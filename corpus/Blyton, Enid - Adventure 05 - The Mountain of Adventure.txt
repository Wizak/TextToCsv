 enid blyton the mountain of adventure chapter all set for a summer holiday four children were singing at the tops of their voices in a car that was going up a steep mountainside road a parrot was also joining in very much out of tune cocking up her crest in excitement the man at the wheel turned round with a grin i say i cant even hear the car hooter whats the matter with you all philip jack dinah and lucyann stopped singing and shouted answers at him its the beginning of the holidays and were going to have a donkey each to ride in the mountains pop goes the weasel that was kiki the parrot of course joining in weve got eight weeks of fun all together and youll be with us bill as well as mother mother arent you excited too mrs mannering smiled at philip yes but i hope youre not going to be as noisy as this all the time bill youll have to protect me from this rowdy crowd of children ill protect you all right promised bill swinging the car round another bend ill knock all their heads together once a day at least and if lucyann starts getting tough with me ill oh bill said lucyann the youngest and least boisterous of the lot jacks always saying im not tough enough i ought to be by now though considering all the adventures ive been through tough enough tough enough chanted kiki the parrot who loved words that sounded alike tough enough tough oh stop her groaned mrs mannering she was tired with their long car journey and was hoping it would soon be over she had eight weeks of the childrens holidays before her and was quite sure she would be worn out before the end of it philip and dinah were her own children and jack and lucyann who had no parents lived with her in the holidays and loved her as if she were their own mother bill cunningham was their very good friend and had had some hairraising adventures with them he had come with them on these holidays to keep them out of any more adventures or so he said mrs mannering vowed she was not going to let them out of her sight for eight weeks unless bill was with them then they couldnt possibly disappear or fall into some dreadful new adventure they ought to be safe tucked away in the welsh mountains with both you and me bill to look after them said mrs mannering mr mannering had been dead for many years and mrs mannering often found it difficult to cope with so many lively children at once now that they were growing older philip loved any animal bird or insect his sister dinah didnt share this love at all and was scared of most wild animals and hated quite a number of harmless insects though she was certainly better than she used to be she was a hottempered girl as ready to use her fists as philip and they had many a battle much to gentle lucyanns dismay lucyann and jack were brother and sister too kiki the parrot was jacks beloved parrot usually to be found on his shoulder in fact mrs mannering had actually suggested once that she should put a little leather patch on the shoulders of each of jacks coats to stop kiki from wearing thin places there with her clawed feet jack was fond of birds and he and philip spent many an exciting hour together birdwatching or taking photographs they had a marvellous collection of these which bill said was worth a lot of money they had brought cameras with them on this holiday and of course their fieldglasses for watching birds at a distance we might see eagles again said jack do you remember the eagles nest we found near that old castle in scotland once philip we might see buzzards too buzzzzzzz said kiki at once buzz buzz off we might even have an adventure said philip with a grin though mother and bill are quite certain they will guard us from even the smallest one this time now here they were all set for a wonderful holiday in the welsh mountains in a very lonely spot where they could wander about with cameras and fieldglasses wherever they liked each child was to have a donkey so that they could ride along the narrow mountain paths as much as they wished i shant always come with you said mrs mannering because im not so thrilled with donkeyriding as you are but bill will be with you so youll be safe ah but will bill be safe with us said jack with a grin we always seem to drag him into something or other poor bill if you manage to pull me into an adventure in the middle of some of the loneliest of the welsh mountains youll be clever said bill the car swung round another bend and a farmhouse came into sight were nearly there said mrs mannering i believe i can see the farmhouse were going to stay at yes there it is the children craned their necks to see it it was a rambling old stone place set on the mountainside with barns and outbuildings all around in the evening sunset it looked welcoming and friendly lovely said lucyann whats it called bill said something that sounded like dothgothooelliothelin gracious said dinah what a name not even kiki could pronounce that im sure tell her it bill see what she says bill obligingly told the name to the parrot who listened solemnly and raised her crest politely now you just repeat that said jack to kiki go on thisisthehousethatjackbuilt said the parrot running all the words together the children laughed good try kiki said jack you cant stump kiki bill shell always say something good old kiki kiki was pleased by this praise and made a noise like the car changing gear she had been doing this at intervals during the whole of the journey and had nearly driven mrs mannering mad dont let kiki start that again she begged thank goodness we are here at last wheres the front door bill or isnt there one there didnt seem to be one the track went up to what appeared to be a barn and stopped there a small path then ran to the farmhouse divided into three and went to three different doors the children tumbled out of the car bill got out and stretched his legs he helped mrs mannering out and they all looked round a cock near by crowed and kiki promptly crowed too much to the cocks astonishment a plump redfaced woman came hurrying out of one of the doors a welcoming smile on her face she called behind her to someone in the house effans effans they have come look you they have come ah mrs evans said bill and shook hands with her mrs mannering did the same a small man came running out of the house and came up to them too this iss effans my husband said the plump woman we hope you will be very happy with us whateffer this was said in a pleasant singsong voice that the children liked very much everybody shook hands solemnly with mrs evans and her husband and kiki held out a claw as well a parrot look you cried mrs evans to her husband effans a parrot mr evans didnt seem to like the look of kiki as much as his wife did but he smiled politely it iss very welcome you are he said in his singsong voice will you pleass to come this way they all followed effans he led them to the farmhouse and when the door was flung open what a welcome sight met the childrens eyes a long sturdy kitchen table was covered with a snowwhite cloth and on it was set the finest meal the children had ever seen in their lives a great ham sat ready to be carved a big tongue garnished round with bright green parsley sat by its side an enormous salad with hardboiled eggs sprinkled generously all over it was in the middle of the table two cold roast chickens were on the table too with little curly bits of cold bacon set round the childrens eyes nearly fell out of their heads what a feast and the scones and cakes the jams and the pure yellow honey the jugs of creamy milk i say are you having a party or something asked jack in awe a party no no it is high tea for you look you said mrs evans we cannot do dinners for you at night we are poor people whateffer you shall have what we have and that is all here is high tea for you today and when you have washed it iss ready oh have we got to wash said philip with a sigh im clean enough golly look at that meal i say if were going to have food like this these holidays i shant want to go donkeyriding at all ill just stay here and eat well if you do that youll be too fat for any donkey to carry said his mother go and wash philip mrs evans will show us our rooms we can all do with a wash and a brush and then we can do justice to this magnificent meal up some narrow winding stairs went the little party into big lowceilinged rooms set with heavy oldfashioned furniture mrs evans proudly showed them a small bathroom a thing usually unknown in lonely farmhouses there were four rooms for the party bill had a small one to himself mrs mannering had a big one well away from the childrens rooms because they were often so noisy in the mornings philip and jack had a curious little room together whose ceiling slanted almost to the floor and the girls had a bigger one next door isnt this going to be fun said jack scrubbing his hands vigorously in the bathroom while kiki sat on a tap im longing to get at that meal downstairs what a spread move up said dinah impatiently theres room for two at this basin we shall have to take it in turns in the morning oh kiki dont fly off with the nailbrush jack stop her the nailbrush was rescued and kiki was tapped on the beak she didnt mind she was looking forward to the food downstairs as much as the children she had seen a bowl of raspberries which she meant to sit as near to as possible she flew to jacks shoulder and muttered loving things into his ear while he dried his hands on a very rough towel stop it kiki you tickle said jack are you ready you others aunt allie bill are you ready were going downstairs coming cried the others and down they all went now for a proper feast chapter at the farmhouse that first meal in the welsh farmhouse was a very happy one mrs evans was excited to have visitors and effans her husband beamed all round as he carved great slices of ham tongue and chicken there were a lot of look yous and whateffers and kiki was especially interested in the upanddown singsong way the two welsh folk talked wipe your feet whateffer she said to mrs evans suddenly mrs evans looked surprised she hadnt heard the parrot speak before shut the door look you commanded kiki raising her crest the children squealed with laughter shes gone all welsh already said dinah hey watch her jack shes absolutely wolfing those raspberries jack put a plate over the bowl and kiki was angry she made a noise like the car changing gear and effans looked startled its all right its only kiki said jack she can make all kinds of noises you should hear her give her imitation of a train whistling in a tunnel kiki opened her beak and swelled up her throat as if she was about to make this horrible noise mrs mannering spoke hastily jack dont let kiki make that noise if she does youll have to take her upstairs and put her in your bedroom bad kiki naughty kiki said the parrot solemnly recognising the stern tone in mrs mannerings voice she flew to jacks shoulder and cuddled there eyeing the plate that he had put over the bowl of raspberries she gave his ear a little nip what a meal that was for six very hungry travellers who had had nothing but sandwiches all day long even mrs mannering ate more than she had ever eaten before at one meal mrs evans kept beaming round as she filled the plates there iss plenty more in the larder look you she said effans go fetch the meatpie no no said mrs mannering please dont we have more than enough here its only that we are extra hungry and the food is so very very good mrs evans was pleased it iss plain country food but it iss very good for the children she said they will soon have good appetites in this mountain air look you indeed to gootness they will agreed effans their appetites are small yet they will grow mrs mannering looked rather alarmed good gracious ive never in my life seen them eat so much if their appetites get any bigger ill never be able to feed them at home and we shall starve at school grinned jack the poor boy said mrs evans it iss a big ham i must give him to take back whateffer at last nobody could eat any more they sat back from the table looking out of the wide low windows and the big open door what a view great mountains reared up their heads in the evening light deep shadows lay across the valley but the mountains still caught the sunlight and gleamed enchantingly it was all so different from the country round their home and the children felt that they could never look long enough at the mountaintops and the shadowed valleys below you are very lonely here said bill i cant see a single house or farm anywhere my brother lives on the other side of that mountain said mrs evans pointing i see him at the market each week that is ten miles away or maybe eleven and my sister lives beyond that mountain you can see there she too has a farm so we have neighbours look you yes but not nextdoor ones said dinah dont you ever feel cutoff and lonely here mrs evans mrs evans looked surprised lonely indeed to gootness what iss there to be lonely about with effans by my side and the shepherd up on the hills and the cowherd and his wife in their cottage near by and there iss plenty of animals as you will see hens wandered in and out of the open door pecking up crumbs fallen from the table kiki watched them intently she began a warm clucking noise and the hens clucked back a cock came strutting in and looked round for the hen that had a cluck he didnt quite know cockadoodledoo suddenly crowed the cock defiantly catching sight of kiki on jacks shoulders cockadoodledoo answered kiki and the cock immediately jumped up on to the table to fight the crowing parrot he was shooed down and ran out indignantly followed by a cackle of laughter from kiki effans held his sides and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks that is a fine bird look you he said to jack quite losing his heart to kiki let her help herself to the raspberries again shes had enough thank you very much said jack pleased at effans praise of kiki people didnt always like the parrot and when she went away with him jack was always anxious in case anyone should object to her they all wandered out into the golden evening air happy and well satisfied bill and mrs mannering sat on an old stone wall watching the sun sink behind a mountain in the west the four children went round the farmhouse and its buildings pigs and what a marvellous clean pigsty said dinah ive never seen a clean pig before look at this one fat and shining as if its been scrubbed it probably has in preparation for our coming said philip i love these little piglets too look at them routing round with their funny little snouts kiki will soon have a wonderful collection of noises said lucyann hearing the parrot giving a very lifelike grunt shell be able to moo and bellow and grunt and crow and cluck and gobble like a turkey said dinah seeing some turkeys near by this is a lovely farm theyve got everything oh philip look at that kid there were some goats on the mountainside not far off and with them was a kid it was snowwhite dainty and altogether lovely philip stood looking at it loving it at once he made a curious little bleating noise and all the goats looked round and stopped eating the kid pricked up its little white ears and stood quivering on its slender legs it was very young and new philip made the noise again the kid left its mother and came leaping to him it sprang right into his arms and nestled there butting its soft white head against philips chin oh philip isnt it sweet said the girls and stroked the little thing and rubbed their cheeks against its snowwhite coat i wish animals came to me like they come to you philip said lucyann enviously it was amazing the attraction that philip had for creatures of any kind even a moth would rest contentedly on his finger and the number of strange pets he had had was unbelievable hedgehogs stagbeetles lizards young birds mice rats you never knew what philip would have next all creatures loved him and trusted him and he in turn understood them and loved them too now this kid will follow at his heels like a dog the whole time were here said dinah well im glad it will be a kid not a cow do you remember that awful time when philip went into a field with a herd of cows and they all went to him and nuzzled him and followed him about like dogs they even tried to get over the gate and through the hedge when he went out i was awfully scared they would you ought to be ashamed of being afraid of cows at your age said philip fondling the kid its silly at any age of course but you dont seem to learn sense as you get older di its surprising youre not afraid of this kid i bet youd run if the goats came near i shouldnt said dinah indignantly but all the same she moved off hurriedly when the herd of goats curious at seeing the kid in philips arms began to come nearer to the children soon they were all round philip lucyann and jack dinah watched from a distance the kid bleated when it saw its mother but as soon as philip put the little thing down to run to her it leapt straight back into his arms well youll have to take it to bed with you tonight theres no doubt about that said jack grinning come on lets go and see the horses theyre the kind with shaggy hooves i just love those the goats were shooed off and the children went to look at the great horses standing patiently in the field there were three of them they all came to philip at once of course he had put down the little kid and now it followed so close to his heels that every time he stopped it ran into his legs at the first possible chance it sprang into his arms again it followed him into the farmhouse too oh you have found little snowy said mrs evans looking round from her oven with a face redder than ever she has not left her mother before look you oh philip dont bring the kid in here said mrs mannering seeing at once that yet another animal had attached itself to philip she was afraid that mrs evans would object strongly to the kid coming indoors with philip and once it had felt the boys attraction nothing would stop it from following him anywhere even upstairs oh it iss no matter if a kid comes into the house said mrs evans we haff the newborn lambs in and the hens are always in and out and moolie the calf used to come in each day before she was put in the field the children thought it was a wonderful idea to let creatures wander in and out like that but mrs mannering thought differently she wondered if she would find eggs laid in her bed or a calf in her bedroom chair still it was a holiday and if mrs evans liked creatures wandering all over her kitchen the children would like it too lucyann gave an enormous yawn and sank down into a big chair mrs mannering looked at her and then at the grandfather clock ticking in a corner go to bed all of you she said were all tired yes i know its early philip you dont need to tell me that but weve had a long day and this mountain air is very strong we shall all sleep like tops tonight i will get ready some creamy milk for you began mrs evans and you would like some buttered scones and jam to take up with you oh no said mrs mannering we simply couldnt eat a thing more tonight thank you mrs evans oh mother of course we could eat scones and jam and drink some more of that heavenly milk said dinah indignantly so they each took up a plate of scones and raspberry jam and a fat glass of creamy milk to have in bed there came the scampering of little hooves and snowy the kid appeared in the boys bedroom she leapt in delight onto philips bed gosh look at this snowys come upstairs said philip have a bit of scone snowy i say did we hear the kid coming up the stairs said lucyann putting her head round the door of the boys room oooh philip youve got her on your bed well she wont get off said philip as soon as i push her off shes on again look like a puppy maaaaaa said the kid in a soft bleating voice and butted philip with its head are you going to have it up here all the night asked dinah appearing in her pyjamas well if i put it outside itll only come in again and if i shut the door it will come and butt it with its head said philip who had quite lost his heart to snowy after all jack has kiki in the room with him all night oh i dont mind you having snowy said dinah i just wondered what mother would say thats all and mrs evans i shouldnt be at all surprised to hear that mrs evans has got a sick cow in her room and half a dozen hens said philip arranging snowy in the crook of his knees shes a woman after my own heart go away you girls im going to sleep im very happy full of scones and jam and milk and sleep kiki made a hiccuping noise pardon she said this was a new thing she had learnt from somebody at jacks school the term before it made mrs mannering cross i should think kikis full up too said jack sleepily she pinched a whole scone and im sure shes been at the raspberries again look at her beak now shut up kiki i want to go to sleep pop goes the weasel look you said kiki solemnly and put her head under her wing the girls disappeared the boys fell asleep what a lovely beginning to a summer holiday chapter the first morning the next day the two girls awoke first it was early but somebody was already about in the yard lucyann peeped out of the window its effans she said he must have been milking dinah come here did you ever see such a glorious view in your life the two girls knelt at the window the sun was streaming across the valley below through the opening between two mountains but the rest of the vale was in shadow in the distance many mountains reared their great heads getting bluer and bluer the further away they were the sky was blue without a cloud holiday weather real holiday weather said dinah happily i hope mother lets us go picnicking today theres one thing about this holiday said lucyann we shant have any awful adventures because aunt allie is absolutely determined to go with us or send bill with us wherever we go well weve had our share of adventures said dinah beginning to dress more than most children ever have i dont mind if we dont have one this time hurry lucyann then we can get to the bathroom before the boys dont make too much noise because mother doesnt want to be wakened too early lucyann popped her head in at the boys room on the way to the bathroom they were still sound asleep kiki took her head from under her wing as she heard lucyann at the door but she said nothing only yawned lucyann looked closely at philips bed snowy the kid was still there cuddled into the crook of philips knees lucyanns heart warmed to philip what an extraordinary boy he was to have every creature so fond of him and to be able to do anything he liked with them the little kid raised its head and looked at lucyann she fled to the bathroom and washed with dinah they soon heard the boys getting up and kikis voice telling somebody to wipe his feet shes probably teaching a few manners to snowy giggled lucyann kiki always tries to teach things to all philips pets oh dinah do you remember how funny she was with huffin and puffin the two puffins we found when we had our last adventure arr said dinah making the noise the puffins used to make kiki heard them arrrrr she called from the boys bedroom arrrrr then she went off into a cackle of laughter and snowy the kid stared at her in alarm maaaaaa said the kid maaaaaa said kiki and the kid looked all round for another kid the boys laughed kiki always encouraged when people laughed swelled up her throat to make the noise of a car changing gear her favourite noise of the moment but philip stopped her hurriedly stop it kiki weve had enough of that noise do forget it god save the king said kiki in a dismal voice wipe your feet blow your nose come on said the girls putting their heads in slowcoaches they all went downstairs just as mrs evans was setting the last touches to the breakfasttable it was loaded almost as much as the suppertable the night before jugs of creamy milk stood about warm from the milking and big bowls of raspberries had appeared again i shant know what to have groaned jack sitting down with kiki on his shoulders i can smell eggs and bacon and theres cereal to have with raspberries and cream and ham and tomatoes and gosh is that cream cheese cream cheese for breakfast how super snowy the kid tried to get onto philips knee as he sat down to breakfast he pushed her off no snowy not at mealtimes im too busy then go and say good morning to your mother she must wonder where you are kiki was at work on the raspberries mrs evans had actually put a plate aside for kikis own breakfast she and effans beamed at the bird they both thought she was wonderful look you whateffer said kiki and dipped her beak into the raspberries again it was rapidly becoming pink with the juice the children made an extremely good meal before bill or mrs mannering came down the evans had had theirs already in fact they seemed to have done a days work judging by the list of things that evans talked about he had cleaned out the pigs groomed the horses milked the cows fetched in the eggs been to see the cowherd and a dozen other things besides mrs evans do you know where the donkeys are that we arranged to have for riding in the mountains asked philip when he had finished his breakfast and snowy was once more in his arms ah trefor the shepherd will tell you said mrs evans it iss his brother look you that has the donkeys he is to bring them here for you cant we go and fetch them and ride them back said jack indeed to gootness trefors brother lives thirty miles away said effans you could not walk there whateffer you go and see trefor today and ask him what has he done about your donkeys mrs mannering and bill appeared at that moment looking fresh and trim after their good nights sleep in the sharp mountain air any breakfast left for us said bill with a grin mrs evans hurried to fry bacon and eggs again and soon the big kitchen was full of the savoury smell golly if i stay here and smell that i shall feel hungry all over again said philip bill were going up to see trefor the shepherd to ask about our donkeys mother can we have a picnic in the mountains as soon as the donkeys come yes when im sure i can keep on my donkey all right said his mother if mines a very fat donkey i shall slide off they are not fat effans assured her they are used in the mountains and they are strong and small sometimes we use ponies but trefors brother breeds donkeys and they are just as good well well go and have a talk with trefor said philip getting up and letting snowy fall off his knee come on everyone kiki do you want to be left with the raspberries you greedy bird kiki flew to jacks shoulder and the party set off up the path that effans had pointed out to them snowy bounded with them turning a deaf ear to his mothers bleats already he seemed one of the company petted by them all though kiki was not altogether pleased to have another creature taking up so much of the childrens attention they went up the steep little path the sun was up higher now and was hot the children only wore thin blouses or shirts and shorts but they felt very warm they came to a spring gushing out of the hillside and sat down to drink and cool their hands and feet snowy drank too and then capered about lightly on her strong little legs leaping from place to place almost as if she had wings i wish i could leap like a goat said jack lazily it looks so lovely and easy to spring high into the air like that and land wherever you want to philip suddenly made a grab at something that was slithering past him on the warm bank dinah sat up at once what is it what is it this said philip and showed the others a silverygrey snakelike creature with bright little eyes dinah screamed at once a snake philip put it down philip itll bite you it wont said philip scornfully its not a snake and anyway british snakes dont bite unless theyre adders ive told you that before this is a slowworm and a very fine specimen too the children looked in fascination as the silvery slowworm wriggled over philips knees it certainly looked very like a snake but it wasnt lucyann and jack knew that but dinah always forgot she was so terrified of snakes that to her anything that glided along must belong to the snake family its horrible she said with a shudder let it go philip how do you know its not a snake well for one thing it blinks its eyes and no snake does that said philip watch it it blinks like a lizard and no wonder because it belongs to the lizard family as he spoke the little creature blinked its eyes it stayed still on philips knee and made no further attempt to escape philip put his hand over it and it stayed there quite happy ive never had a slowworm for a pet said philip ive a good mind philip if you dare to keep that snake for a pet ill tell mother to send you home said dinah in great alarm dinah its not a snake said philip impatiently its a lizard a legless lizard quite harmless and very interesting im going to keep it for a pet if itll stay with me stay with you of course it will said jack did you ever know an animal that wouldnt i should hate to go to a jungle with you philip youd have monkeys hanging lovingly round your neck and tigers purring at you and snakes wrapping themselves round your legs and dinah gave a little scream dont say such horrible things philip make that slowworm go away instead he slipped it into his pocket now dont make a fuss dinah he said you dont need to come near me i dont expect it will stay with me because it wont like my pocket but ill just see they set off up the hill once more dinah hanging back sulkily oh dear philip would go and spoil the holiday by keeping something horrible again chapter up on the mountainside trefor the shepherd had a small cabinlike cottage a good way up the mountainside around him for miles grazed the sheep nearer in were that years lambs now grown into sturdy little beasts their woolly coats showing up against the sheared bodies of the older sheep the shepherd was having a simple meal when they got to his hut he had bread butter cream cheese and onions and beside him a great jug of milk that he had cooled by standing in the stream that ran down the mountainside nearby he nodded his head to the children as they came up he was a curiouslooking old fellow with longish untidy hair a straggling beard and two of the brightest blue eyes the children had ever seen he spoke welsh which they didnt understand can you speak english asked jack we cant understand what you say trefor knew a few words of english which after much thought and munching of onions he spoke donkeys tomorrow he added something the children didnt understand and waved his hand down the mountainside towards the farmhouse he means the donkeys will arrive tomorrow at the farm said jack good perhaps aunt allie and bill will come for a picnic on the donkeys trefor was very interested in kiki he had never in his life seen a parrot he pointed at kiki and laughed a hoarse laugh kiki at once copied it trefor looked startled wipe your feet said kiki sternly how many times have i told you to shut the door three blind mice trefor stared at the parrot half alarmed kiki cackled loudly look you whateffer look you whateffer look the children laughed jack tapped kiki on the beak now now kiki dont show off snowy butted against philips legs she didnt like so much attention being given to kiki philip turned and the little creature leapt straight into his arms trefor seemed most amused and sent out a flood of welsh words that nobody could understand at all he tapped philip on the arm and then pointed to the ground to show the children that he wanted them to sit down they sat down wondering what he wanted he went a little way down the hillside making a soft baaing noise from everywhere around the woolly lambs looked up they came running to the shepherd bleating and even little snowy left philip and ran too the shepherd knelt down and the lambs crowded round him nuzzling against him trefor had had them when they were tiny he had looked after them even fed some of them from bottles if their mothers had died and when they heard his soft call that once they had known so well they remembered and came to him their first friend a lump came into lucyanns throat there was something very touching in the sight of that halfwild dirty longhaired old shepherd calling to his lambs and being answered snowy the kid eager to get close to him leapt up on to the woolly backs of the lambs and butted his head against him look at snowy isnt he a cheeky rascal of a kid said dinah my goodness you can hardly see trefor now hes so surrounded by lambs trefor came back smiling his eyes very blue in his old brown face he offered the children some bread and onions but the onions were big and strongsmelling and jack felt certain mrs mannering wouldnt approve if they all came back smelling strongly of trefors onions no thank you he said politely will you be down to see your brother tomorrow when he brings the donkeys trefor seemed to understand this he nodded i come tomorrow donkeys getting quite talkative isnt he said jack to the others right trefor see you tomorrow then they set off down the hill again they stopped once more at the little spring to drink they sat on the grass looking at the towering mountains round them effans says that all those mountains over there have hardly anyone living on them because they are difficult to get at said jack i bet there are some interesting animals and birds there wish we could go and see i dont see why we shouldnt if bill and mother would come with us said philip trying to stop snowy from walking on his middle stop it snowy get off my tummy your hooves are sharp it would be fun to go off into the mountains on donkeys and take food with us for a few days and have tents do you mean said jack i say thats an idea philip we could take our cameras and get some fine pictures i might see some rare birds i bet you would said philip hallo here comes sally slither out of his pocket glided the slowworm and curled itself up in the crook of philips elbow in the sun dinah removed herself to a safe distance at once kiki looked down with interest from her perch on jacks shoulder sally slither what a nice name said lucyann running her finger down the slowworms silvery back look my fingers tickling her shes going all dithery slithery dithery said kiki at once she had a real talent for putting together words of the same sound dithery slithery slithery dithery all right all right said philip we dont want to hear it again kiki youre a clever old bird we all know that jack look at this slowworm its not a scrap frightened now i do think youre mean to keep it began dinah from a safe distance you know how i hate snakes all right all right i know it isnt a snake though i wouldnt be a bit surprised if it bit me if i came near it so there i wouldnt be surprised at anything biting you when youre so silly said philip crossly i feel like biting you myself come here dinah run your finger down sally slithers back look at her sharp little eyes dinah gave a scream i couldnt bear it no dont come near me philip its worse than those awful white rats you had a few months ago but at least they grew up and you let them go sally can go whenever she wants to said philip i never keep any pet when it wants to go do you want to go sally slither slithery dithery musty dusty fusty said kiki trying to remember the various collections of words she had picked up at one time or another huffin and puffin come on lets go said dinah perhaps that horrible thing will go back into your pocket if we go and im getting hungry the slowworm slid back somewhere in philips clothes he got up and snowy bounded round him now just see if you can walk without getting your head between my legs all the time said philip to snowy youll send me flying in a minute youre a bit too friendly at times snowy they went back to the farmhouse enjoying the sunshine and the constant breeze that blew over the mountainside by the time they reached the farmhouse they were all terribly hungry and visions of ham chicken salad and raspberries and cream kept coming into their minds bill and mrs mannering had been for a walk too but down the mountain not up they had been back for a little while and were just beginning to wonder where the children were snowy went bounding up to them shes a pet said mrs mannering i suppose we shall have her at our heels the whole of this holiday now its a pity kids have to grow up into goats dont think youre going to take snowy back home with you philip im not going to have a goat in the garden while youre at school eating the vegetables out of the beds and the clothes off the line mother trefor says his brother will arrive at the farmhouse tomorrow with the donkeys said philip can we each choose our own how many will there be yes you can choose your own if you want to said mrs mannering i dont know how many there will be six i suppose i only hope i choose a surefooted one theyll all be surefooted said jack as surefooted as goats but not so leapy i shouldnt care to ride one of these mountain goats and find myself leaping about from rock to rock good gracious what a horrible thought said mrs mannering i shall choose the quietest staidest placidest besttempered donkey of the lot one without a single bound or leap in him everyone laughed effans came over to them beaming to see them happy it iss dinnertime he said mrs effans has it ready i shall soon begin to talk in a singsong voice myself said lucyann getting up from the stone wall indeed to gootness i shall they all laughed at the upanddown way she spoke snowy galloped ahead into the kitchen mrs evans didnt seem to mind at all but she shooed him down when he leapt into a chair a hen scuttled out from under the table kiki went up to a rafter sat on a ham wrapped up in a cloth and cocked her eye down to the table to see what fruit there was pop goes the weasel she announced and made a popping noise like a cork coming out of a bottle effans looked up in admiration such a bird he said never have i seen such a bird look you kiki began hiccupping and effans went off into a screech of laughter mrs mannering frowned kiki stop that how many times am i to tell you i dont like that noise how many times have i told you to wipe your feet retorted kiki and screeched effans almost died of laughter kiki began to show off snapping her beak open and shut putting her crest up and down and making peculiar noises kiki come here said jack sternly and kiki flew down to his shoulder jack tapped her smartly on her beak any more nonsense from you and ill shut you in the bedroom upstairs bad bird silly bird poor polly bad polly said kiki and nipped jacks ear he smacked her on the beak again be quiet not another word he ordered kiki put her head under her wing in disgrace and various whispering sounds came to everyones ears but nobody could hear what she said though effans strained his big ears hopefully what a bird he wished he could have one like it the dinner was as good as the high tea and breakfast had been the children set to work and mrs evans felt very pleased to see how much her good food was appreciated she kept pressing second and third helpings on everyone but soon even the boys could eat no more there iss no four oclock tea she kept saying nothing till six oclock so eat look you eat dithery slithery announced kiki suddenly and dinah gave a scream the slowworm was gliding out of philips sleeve he pushed it back hurriedly hoping that no one had seen it bill had his sharp eyes had caught sight of it at once he grinned another member added to the family he said very nice too what with snowy and kiki and er slithery we look all set for a most interesting holiday chapter arrival of the donkeys the next excitement of course was the arrival of the donkeys the children had waited expectantly for them all the following morning not liking to go for a walk in case they missed the donkeys arrival lucyann saw them first she gave a yell that sent the slowworm back into philips pocket and startled snowy so much that he leapt four feet in the air even kiki jumped the donkeys cried lucyann there they come look up the mountainpath soon all four children were tearing down the path to the donkeys there were eight of them strong sturdy little creatures with big bright eyes and long tails that whisked the flies away they were all grey and their long ears twitched to and fro as they came steadily up the steep path trefors brother david was with them an elderly man rather like trefor but with tidier hair and beard he had the same bright blue eyes but he looked timid and fearful as if the world had not been kind to him he smiled faintly at the lively children can we ride four of the donkeys now asked philip we know how to ride come on lucyann up with you he gave lucyann a shove and she was tip on a donkeys back dinah needed no help with a leap like snowys she was up at once the donkeys ambled up the steep path with the children refusing to trot now that they had heavy weights on their backs snowy galloped beside philips donkey half jealous of it butting it in the legs hallo here we are cried jack ambling up to mrs mannering and bill eight donkeys to choose from which are you going to have aunt allie david stood by smiling while his donkeys were examined and tried trefor the shepherd arrived and the two old brothers chatted together in welsh effans and his wife came along and soon there was quite a company in the farmyard discussing the donkeys we badly want to go off on the donkeys into the mountains mother said philip coaxingly can we with you and bill of course to stay a few nights i mean jack and i think there should be a fine lot of rare birds over there in those lonely mountains and there will be lots of animals too it would be rather fun said his mother i havent camped out for ages and in this weather it would be lovely what do you say bill i say yes said bill who loved outdoor life and was an old hand at camping do you good allie we could take a couple of extra donkeys to carry the things we want oh bill can we really go said lucyann overjoyed and dinah danced round him too to go off on donkeys into the mountains and take tents and food what could be more fun it will be an adventure said dinah not one of our usual ones of course but a really nice one youll like that lucyann wont you oh yes said lucyann who never really enjoyed a proper adventure while it was happening id like that kind of adventure when can we go well wed better get used to our donkeys before we think of going said bill im not used to donkeyriding nor is aunt allie we shall be stiff at first so wed better get over that stage before we go say next week oh i cant wait that long said dinah and the others laughed at her long face effans where is a nice place to go asked jack turning to him effans considered he spoke to trefor in welsh and the old shepherd answered him he says the vale of butterflies is a good place said effans it is full of birds as well as butterflies the vale of butterflies that sounds gorgeous said jack pleased super said philip absolutely wizard well go there is it far two days on donkeys said effans bill calculated we shall want a guide either trefor effans or trefors brother and two donkeys at least to carry our tents and food and six donkeys for ourselves thats nine weve only got eight here effans ask this fellow if hes got another donkey it turned out that trefors brother had meant to ride home on a donkey himself and take another donkey back with farm produce to sell leaving only six effans bargained with him to come back the next week complete with three donkeys to add to the six left behind then you can act as guide to these people look you he said that will be money you will have one donkey they will have six and there will be two for loads that is much money for you david indeed to gootness david agreed he would come on the wednesday of next week bringing three donkeys to add to the six he would leave behind two to carry loads one for himself and six for the children mrs mannering and bill the children were very excited they ran round the donkeys patted them rubbed their long noses and sat on their broad backs the donkeys seemed to like all the fuss they stood stolidly there their tails whisking following the children with their eyes snowy darted about running under first one donkey and then another acting like a mad thing trefor helped his brother to load up a donkey with packages of all kinds heavier and heavier grew the load but the donkey stood patiently seeming not to mind at all then eager to be gone it suddenly brayed kiki had never heard a donkey bray before and she sailed straight up into the air with fright eeore eeore brayed the donkey and stamped his foot gracious now i suppose kiki will practise braying too said jack we shall have to stop her firmly if she does its bad enough from a donkey but brays from kiki would be frightful the donkey was loaded at last david mounted his sturdy little beast said a polite goodbye to everyone and rode off down the path the loaded donkey being led after him by a rope he held in his hand now we can choose our own donkeys said lucyann in delight aunt allie you choose first well they all look exactly alike to me said mrs mannering bill spoke to effans asking him if he knew which donkey was the quietest effans turned to trefor trefor knew he pointed out a little creature with a patient expression in its eyes and said a few words in welsh he says that is the one for you said effans it is quiet and good its name is patience oh good ill choose her then said mrs mannering this is mine children the one with the black mark on her forehead i want this one cried lucyann pulling at a sturdy animal that threw his head back continually and stamped now and then i like him what is his name trefor trefor said something nobody understood effans translated his name is clover this one is grayling and that one is dapple the other two are buttercup and daisy lucyann had clover jack had grayling and dinah had dapple bill had buttercup and philip had daisy each of them was delighted with his or her own special donkey lets ride them now said jack mounting his little beast come on bill aunt allie get on well go for our first ride now up the path and back again with effans and his wife looking on in delight the six rode off on their donkeys they would not go fast uphill and bill warned each child not to try and make them theyll trot coming down all right he said but its heavy going for them uphill with our weight on their backs it was great fun riding the grey donkeys up the steep mountain path mrs mannering was nervous at first when she came to the rocky bits but her donkey was as surefooted as the others and went steadily along on even the stoniest parts bill rode close by in case she needed help but she didnt the four children of course would have scorned any help they were all used to riding horses and the donkeys were very easy to manage now well turn back called bill so they all turned and went homewards snowy came too of course having leapt and bounded ahead of them all the way apparently under the impression that he was leading them that was fun said lucyann as they trotted homewards the donkeys going faster now that they were on a downhill road mrs mannering didnt like the trotting so much as the ambling my donkey is a very bumpy one she said to bill when i go down he comes up and when i go up he goes down so we keep meeting with a bump everyone laughed they were all sorry when they reached the farmhouse for by that time they felt as if they could go trotting on forever but a meal was ready for them on the table and mrs evans was beaming at the door so they didnt lose much time in taking the donkeys to the field and carrying their harness to the stables youll be quite used to riding a donkey by next week bill said to mrs mannering by the time wednesday comes youll be ready to set off and youll feel as if youd ridden a donkey all your life oh yes im sure i shall said mrs mannering she felt something pecking at her foot and looked under the table she saw a fat brown hen there and pushed it away shoo stop pecking my foot the hen shooed only to be replaced by snowy who pushed off philips knee as he sat at table was amusing himself by trying to eat shoelaces under the table mrs mannering pushed him away too and snowy went to chew the hem of mrs evans dress she never noticed things like that so snowy had a nice long chew the next day the girls and mrs mannering were so stiff with their donkeyride that they could hardly walk the boys and bill were all right but mrs mannering groaned as she came down the stairs good gracious i feel like an old old lady ill never be able to ride a donkey again she said but the stiffness wore off and the six of them soon got used to riding their donkeys day after day into the mountains there were some lovely rides and magnificent views snowy came with them always never tired leaping along gaily kiki rode on jacks shoulder occasionally taking a flight into the air to scare any bird that happened to be flying overhead they flew off quickly full of astonishment when kiki told them to wipe their feet two days more and its wednesday said lucyann happily well be quite ready then able to ride for hours and hours yes off to the vale of butterflies said jack i wonder what its like i imagine it to be full of wings of all colours lovely oh hurry up and come wednesday said dinah only fortyeight hours and then off we go but something unexpected happened in that fortyeight hours something that quite upset their lovely plans chapter off to the vale of butterflies it happened the very next day it was when mrs mannering had gone with mrs evans to the big barn the door suddenly blew shut and caught her hand in it trapping it tightly mrs mannering screamed mrs evans ran to open the door but poor mrs mannerings hand was badly bruised and crushed bill was very concerned i must take you down to the doctor he said ill get the car where are the children out on their donkeys tell them where weve gone mrs evans when they come back they neednt worry ill have mrs mannerings hand seen to and properly bandaged i dont expect it will be very much but id like her to have it xrayed in case any small bone is broken looking rather white mrs mannering was driven off by bill down the steep mountain road to the town that lay some way off in the next valley it was about fifteen miles and soon mrs mannering was in hospital having her hand xrayed and bound up the children were very upset when they heard what had happened poor mother said philip it must have hurt dreadfully when her hand got caught in that heavy door indeed to gootness it did said mrs evans who looked quite upset too she gave one scream poor soul and then made not a sound whateffer now dont look so sadly shell be back tonight will she be able to go off to the mountains tomorrow asked lucyann how can she ride with a bad hand well there now she cant said mrs evans but she can stay here with me and ill look after her for you you can go with mr cunningham and david but will bill go if mothers hurt wondered philip he thinks the world of her oh blow its bad luck for this to happen just when we had such a lovely plan poor mother i do hope her hands better now mrs mannering arrived back in bills car that evening just before high tea she looked better and made light of her hand weve had it xrayed said bill shes broken a tiny bone just here and he showed them where on the back of his hand its got to be bandaged and kept at rest im to take her down to have it seen again in three days time im so sorry dears said mrs mannering and bill you dont need to take me down you know im quite able to drive myself down even with an injured hand take the children on their trip tomorrow i cant bear to have them disappointed what and leave you like this said bill dont be silly allie i shall take you down myself in the car on friday the children can go with david if hell take them on by himself its a perfectly ordinary trip and theyll be back in a few days time they can all ride their donkeys as easily as david and probably theyll enjoy a trip without us wed much rather you and aunt allie came said jack but as you cant its decent of you to let us go alone well be perfectly all right bill david knows the way and we can all look after ourselves so it was settled that the four children should go by themselves on the donkeys with their guide david taking with them tents bedding and food philip questioned bill to make sure that his mothers hand was not seriously hurt oh no it will soon be right said bill but i want to be sure she doesnt use it and i want to take her down to the doctor in three days time im sorry not to come with you but youll be all right by yourselves i dont see that you can get into any trouble or any startling adventure going donkeyriding in the mountains with david maybe we can all go together later on the children were very excited that night getting ready the things they wanted to take they had two small tents a sleepingbag each two groundsheets cameras fieldglasses a change of clothes and food the food was mrs evans care bill watched her packing up what she thought they would eat in the next few days i didnt like to stop her he told the others but honestly shes packed enough for a month shes put in a whole ham golly said jack what else a tongue or two hardboiled eggs tins of all kinds plumcake and goodness knows what said philip we shall feast like kings well began lucyann i always think that we eat twice as much in the open air because food tastes so much nicer chorused everyone lucyann always said that at least a dozen times each holiday she laughed well anyway it will be nice to have as much as ever we can eat theres david too weve got to take food for him as well he doesnt look as if hed eat much said dinah skinny little fellow whateffer youd better go to bed early children said mrs mannering a little later youll have a long ride tomorrow according to effans all right itll make tomorrow come all the sooner said lucyann hows your hand feel aunt allie its quite comfortable thank you said mrs mannering im sure i could have gone with you tomorrow really well you couldnt said bill hastily half afraid that mrs mannering would try to be foolish and go with the others after all she laughed dont worry im going to be sensible and dear me it will be quite a change to be rid of four noisy ruffians and an even noisier bird for a few days bill wont it all the children were awake very early the next day snowy the kid who was a real sleepyhead in the mornings didnt want to wake up at all and snuggled deeper into philips blankets as the boy tried to get out of bed kiki took her head from under her wing and scratched her poll dithery slithery she remarked which meant that she had spied philips slowworm it was coiled up in a corner of the room it would very much have liked to sleep on philips bed but it was afraid of snowy who had a habit of nibbling anything near him the boys got up and looked out of the window it was a really perfect day the mountains towered up into the fresh morning sky as beautiful as ever they look as if someone had just been along and washed them said jack the sky looks washed too so very very clean and new i like the feel of an early morning said philip putting on his shorts it has a special new feel about it as if it were the first morning that ever happened snowy went over to the corner where sally the slowworm was and the slowworm at once wriggled away under the chest of drawers philip picked her up and she slid gracefully into his pocket have to get you a few flies for breakfast sally said philip shut up kiki youll wake the rest of the household with that awful cough kiki could give a terrible hollow cough at times which she had copied from an old uncle of jacks and she was practising it now she stopped when philip spoke to her and hopped to jacks shoulder funny bird silly bird said jack affectionately scratching her neck come on philip lets see if the girls are up they were just getting up both of them thrilled at the fine day and the idea of going camping in the mountains have you got that horrid slowworm on you asked dinah fearfully looking at philip yes somewhere said philip feeling all over him theres one thing about sally slithery she does get about dinah shuddered and went to wash in the bathroom snowy the kid was there nibbling the cork bathmat which he evidently thought was delicious oh snowy mrs evans wont be at all pleased with you said dinah and shooed the kid out of the door he went to find philip he was quite one of the family now mrs mannerings hand was stiff and sore that morning but she said very little about it not wanting to upset the children she was glad it was such a lovely day for them and watched with amusement as mrs evans carefully packed up all the food she had prepared for the children to take with them if you eat all that youll never be able to ride home on the donkeys she said youll be too fat they must not go hungry said kind mrs evans there i think i have thought of everything children you must use one donkey for the food and the other for everything else look you i will see that david straps everything on well the children listened to her kind singsong voice as they sat at breakfast they felt very happy and the only thing that spoilt their pleasure was the fact that bill and mrs mannering were not coming with them on the other hand they would be freer without grownups kiki gave a hiccup with one eye on mrs mannering she looked at the parrot severely kiki you did that on purpose do you want your beak smacked pardon said kiki and went off into a cackle of laughter effans choked over his bacon trying to laugh with his mouth full and went purple in the face his bacon went down the wrong way and he got the hiccups too pardon look you he said to mrs mannering with such a horrified look on his face that everyone roared with laughter now here is david all ready for you cried mrs evans from the door where she had gone to chase away a turkey that had suddenly appeared it made a gobbling noise that scared snowy terribly kiki of course at once gobbled too and the turkey looked into the kitchen in amazement shoo said mrs evans good morning david its early you are and a nice day you have brought with you indeed to goodness i have said david in welsh and smiled timidly at the company in the big kitchen his donkeys crowded round him sturdy and patient their harness clinking and glinting come on yelled jack suddenly feeling too excited to sit at the table any longer come on lets pack the things on the donkeys and go they all rushed out soon david and effans were strapping everything on two donkeys one donkey had big panniers each side for food the other had the things strapped across his broad little back they stood perfectly still their ears twitching as a fly or two settled on them well are we ready to start said philip i think weve got everything oh gosh where are my fieldglasses at last everyone and everything was ready it had been explained to david that bill and mrs mannering could not come and effans had said he would care for the two extra donkeys till the children came back david did not seem too pleased to think he was to go alone with the children he looked rather scared bill thought poor timid little fellow bill wished it was effans who was going with the children not david still jack and philip were used to camping out and could be trusted to be sensible goodbye called everyone see you in a few days time take care of your hand mother now were off off to the vale of butterflies goodbye everyone chapter on the way with bill mrs mannering effans and mrs evans waving and calling goodbye the party set off on their donkeys they had to go by trefor the shepherds little cabin and the donkeys picked their way steadily up the steep hillside snowy ran beside them bobbing about under the donkeys bodies as he pleased they seemed to like him and dapple kept putting his head down to the kid whenever he came near kiki was perched as usual on jacks shoulder jogging up and down contentedly snapping her beak and making a few quiet remarks into jacks ear they came to trefors cabin he was on the hillside seeing to a sick sheep he came to meet them his untidy hair blowing in the wind and his eyes shining as blue as forgetmenots there was a conversation between the two men in welsh david sounded rather complaining trefor seemed to be poohpoohing what he said david got out a map that bill had given him and appeared to be saying that he didnt understand it at all trefor then spoke earnestly pointing in this direction and that poking david with his finger every time he wanted to make a point go home the children thought he must be telling david the exact way to go i hope david really does know the way said jack he might have thought bill would help him with the map if bill had been going it looks to me as if hes telling trefor hes not too certain of the way well what does it matter said philip pushing snowy off with his hand as the kid tried to jump up onto his donkey with him id like to see the vale of butterflies but so long as we go off camping in those gorgeous mountains thats all that matters yes we shall see heaps of birds and animals anyway said jack feeling that philip was right come on david lets go the timid david leapt onto his donkey at once he called goodbye to trefor and the little company set off once more along the mountainside taking a narrow path that went neither very far up nor very far down it was glorious riding there so high looking down on the valley far below it was partly in the sun and partly in the shadow for the sun was not yet high swallows flew round them catching flies their steelblue wings gleaming in the sun kiki watched them out of her sharp eyes she had often tried flycatching herself but she knew she was no good at it anyway flies didnt taste as good as fruit they ambled on until everyone felt hungry and thirsty and they came to a copse of birchtrees with a small stream nearby lets picnic here in the shade of those trees said philip sliding off his donkey im absolutely cooked with the sun david saw to the donkeys taking them to the stream for water he then let them wander free for they came most obediently at his call and could be trusted not to go far away they went to the shade of the trees and stood there swishing their long grey tails enjoying the rest snowy ran to them and behaved like a spoilt child letting the donkeys fuss him and stare at him dapple put down his big head to the little kid and nuzzled him in the neck when snowy ran to the next donkey dapple followed him dapple wants to be friends with snowy said dinah unpacking the lunch parcel from one of the enormous panniers here lucyann take this tin and fill it with water from the stream it must be absolutely pure i should think we can put some of this lemonade essence with it im so dreadfully thirsty david was drinking at the stream so the children felt that it must be all right it gurgled along fresh and clear running through the pebbles and down the hillside at top speed lucyann went to fill the tin there was a lovely lunch the children had to call david to share it because he suddenly seemed shy he came and sat down a little way away from them no david come here with us called jack patting the ground we want to learn welsh come and talk to us but the little welshman was very shy and it was as much as the children could do to persuade him to eat his share of the lunch it was such a good lunch too there were five different kinds of sandwiches fresh lettuce wrapped in a damp cloth hardboiled eggs to nibble and great slices of jam tart washed down with cold lemonade it was the finest lunch anyone could wish nobody in the whole world not even the very richest king can possibly have a nicer lunch than this said lucyann munching a chicken sandwich or a nicer place to eat it in said philip waving his sandwich at the magnificent view before them look at that no king could have a better view from his palace valleys and mountains and yet more mountains and then the clear blue sky marvellous they all gazed at the unbelievable view that lay in front of them a rustle of paper made them look round snowy you greedy little kid look here hes eaten the rest of the chicken sandwiches cried jack indignantly forgetting all about the lovely view philip smack him we cant let him do that or our food wont last out he can jolly well eat the grass philip gave snowy a smart tap on the nose the kid retreated in a huff taking with him a mouthful of sandwich papers which he proceeded to eat with apparent enjoyment but soon he was back with philip pressing against him affectionately anxious to be back in his good books dapple the donkey moved over to philip too to be near the kid he lay down beside him and philip at once leaned back against him thanks old man very nice just what i wanted said philip and everyone laughed as he settled himself against the donkeys side have another sandwich david asked lucyann holding out a packet to him david had not eaten nearly as much as they had either through shyness or because he hadnt such an enormous appetite he shook his head lets have a bit of rest now said philip sleepily theres no hurry we can take all the time we like to get anywhere jack began to ask david the names of things in welsh it was silly not to be able to talk to david david apparently understood more english than he spoke but even the few english words he said were pronounced so queerly that the children found it hard to puzzle out what he was saying come on david talk said jack who did not feel as sleepy as the others whats this in welsh he held out his hand david began to realise that jack wanted a lesson in welsh and he brightened up a little he was a trifle embarrassed by kiki who insisted on repeating all the words he said too and added a few nonsense words of her own for good measure the girls and philip fell asleep in the shade lucyann sharing philips donkey to lean against dinah would have liked to do the same but she was afraid that sally the slowworm might come out of philips pocket if she did and nothing would make dinah go near the silvery creature jack patiently tried to learn a few welsh words and then got tired of it he threw a few pebbles down the mountainside and gazed round at the many summits towering up in the distance there was one queer one shaped like three teeth that amused him he decided to look it up on the map the map however was rather disappointing it showed very few names in the district where they were probably because it had been very little explored and there were no farmhouses or other buildings to put on record jack found a name that seemed to him to fit the mountain fang mountain he read that might be it gosh what a lot of mountains there are about here i bet nobody has ever explored them all id like to fly over them in an aeroplane and look down on them we havent seen a plane since weve been here off the route i suppose david had gone to round up the donkeys jack woke up the others come on lazy things wed better get on or david will think we mean to camp here for the night theres a heavenly wind now it will be gorgeous riding this afternoon soon they were all on their donkeys again jogging along round the mountainside enjoying the wind and the sun gazing on the different vistas that opened up before them round every bend of the track new mountains reared up faraway heads new skylines appeared for long stretches the children said nothing at all to one another but simply drank in the beauty around them and the sun and wind they travelled until six oclock having decided to keep to the high tea that mrs evans had at the farm jack spoke to david when six oclock came david we stop at halfpast six do you know a good place to camp for the night near here david did not understand and jack repeated it more slowly david smiled and nodded iss iss this meant yes and jack looked as david pointed to a wooded spot some way ahead david said something else in welsh and jack caught a few words here and there which he understood one was water the other was trees david says theres a good place to camp in a little way off jack shouted back to the others theres water there and trees gosh however do you understand him said philip in admiration jolly clever of you jack jack grinned all over his freckled face oh i just caught the words water and trees thats all come on lets get there in time to watch the sun sink over the mountains id like to have a sunset with my sandwiches philip laughed they all ambled on towards the spot pointed out by david it was a little further than they thought but when they got there they all agreed it was just the right place to camp for the night a spring as cold as ice gushed out beside the small wooded patch the trees sheltered the campers from the nightwind which could be very chilly at times the donkeys could be tied to trees so that they would not wander in the night everything was perfect the children were tired but happy they slid off their donkeys backs and the little beasts tired now too were taken to the spring to drink they stood patiently waiting their turn whilst snowy skipped about like a mad thing not in the least tired with his long trip well put up the tents after weve had a meal and a rest said philip get out the food lucyann and dinah theres a nice flat stone here we can use as a table soon the supper or high tea was spread out on the big flat stone and mugs of lemonade were set by each plate the children drained them at once and jack was sent to get more icecold water from the spring they all ate quickly for they were very hungry again they said very little until the first edge of their appetite had worn off then they all talked with their mouths full eager to make the others remember the lovely day david ate too and listened the donkeys pulled at the grass snowy was with dapple and kiki was eating a tomato and dripping juice down jacks neck they all felt as if they couldnt possibly be happier now well put up the tents said jack at last come on philip itll be dark before weve put them up if we dont make haste chapter first night in camp the girls washed the dirty crockery in the cold spring water while david and the boys unpacked the tents from the donkey that carried them they took off the whole of his pack and also unstrapped the heavy panniers from the other donkey both were delighted to be rid of their loads they lay down on the ground and rolled kicking their legs up into the air kiki couldnt understand this at all and flew up into a tree she thinks theyve gone mad said jack its all right kiki theyre only feeling glad because their packs have gone kiki made a noise like a train screeching in a tunnel and the two rolling donkeys leapt to their feet in alarm and raced some way down the hill david also jumped violently and then called to the donkeys kiki if you do that again ill tie your beak up threatened jack spoiling this lovely peaceful evening with that horrible screech wipe your feet wipe your feet screamed kiki and danced from foot to foot on her branch the tents were soon put up side by side david did not want to sleep in one he preferred to sleep outside he had never slept in a tent and he thought they were quite unnecessary well id just as soon he slept outside said jack to philip i dont believe hes ever had a bath in his life do you lets leave the tentflaps open said lucyann coming up with the clean crockery then we can look out down the mountainside i wouldnt mind a bit sleeping in the open air like david as a matter of fact winds too cold said jack youll be glad to have a cosy sleepingbag lucyann david must be very hardy hes only got a thin rug to cover himself with and hes apparently going to sleep on the bare ground the sun had now disappeared completely it had gone behind the mountains in a perfect blaze of colour and all the summits had gleamed for a while and then darkness had crept up to the very tops leaving only a clear sky beyond stars were now winking here and there and a cold wind was blowing up the mountain the donkeys were tied loosely to trees some of them were lying down dapple was looking out for snowy but the kid had gone to philip and was waiting for him to go into his tent they all washed at the spring all that is but david who seemed rather astonished to see the four children solemnly splashing themselves with the cold water he had drawn his thin rug over him and was lying quite still looking up to the starry sky hes not what you might call a very cheerful companion is he said jack i expect he thinks were all quite mad the way we joke and laugh and fool about buck up philip and get into the tent the girls were already in their tent they had slid down into their sleepingbags and tied them up loosely at the neck each bag had a big hood to come over the head they were comfortable quite roomy and very warm lucyann could see out of the tent opening stars twinkled in the sky looking very big and bright there was no sound at all except of the trickletrickle of the spring and the sound of the wind in the trees we might be all alone in the world said lucyann to dinah dinah imagine that we are it gives you an awfully queer feeling its wizard but dinah hadnt got lucyanns imagination and she yawned go to sleep she said are the boys in their tent yet i wish they were a bit further away ive got an awful feeling that slowworm will come slithering in here in the night it wont hurt you if it does said lucyann snuggling down in her sleepingbag oh this is super i do think we have lovely holidays dont you dinah but dinah was asleep already her eyes had shut and she was dreaming lucyann stayed awake a little longer enjoying the sound of the running spring and the wind she still felt rather as if she was on her donkey jogging up and down then her eyes closed too the boys talked for a little while they had thoroughly enjoyed their day they gazed out of the open flap of the tent its pretty wild and desolate here said jack sleepily its surprising theres a track to follow really decent of bill and aunt allie to let us come by ourselves mmmmmmm said philip listening but too sleepy to answer mmmmmmm imitated kiki from the top of the tent outside it was too hot for her in it theres kiki said jack i wondered where she was philip arent you hot with snowy on top of you mmmmmmm said philip and again there came the echo from the tenttop mmmmmmm snowy was almost on top of philip he had tried his hardest to squeeze into the boys sleepingbag with him but philip was quite firm about that if you think youre going to stick your sharp little hooves into me all night long youre wrong snowy he said and tied up his bag firmly at the neck in case snowy should try any tricks in the night the slowworm was somewhere about too philip was too sleepy to bother to think where sally slid about where she pleased philip was now quite used to the sudden slithering movement that occurred at times somewhere about his body and which meant that sally was on the move again there were a few more quiet remarks from kiki who was apparently talking to herself then silence the little camp slept under the stars the nightwind nosed into the tent but could not get into the cosy sleepingbags snowy felt too hot walked over philip trod on jack and went to lie in the tent opening he gave a tiny bleat and kiki bleated in answer david was up and about before the children the next day he was looking at his donkeys when philip put a towsled head out of the tent opening to sniff at the morning lovely he said stop butting me snowy your little head is jolly hard jack stir yourself its a gorgeous morning soon all the campers were out of their sleepingbags and running about they splashed at the spring laughing at nothing snowy bounded everywhere quite mad too kiki hooted like a car and startled the donkeys even david smiled to see such earlymorning antics they had breakfast tongue cream cheese and rather stale bread with a tomato each there was no lemonade left because they had been so lavish with it the day before so they drank the cold spring water and vowed it was just as nice as lemonade david shall we get to the vale of butterflies today asked jack and then repeated it again slowly flapping his arms to show david that he was talking about butterflies it took david a minute or two to realise this then he shook his head tomorrow asked philip and david nodded he went to strap the packs on the donkeys again and to put on the big pannier baskets all the little grey creatures were waiting impatiently to set off already the sun was getting well above the mountains and for david and the donkeys at any rate it was late they set off at last though jack had to gallop back to get his fieldglasses which he had left behind hanging from a treebranch then they were all in a line one donkey behind the other ambling over the mountains with the wind in their hair jack felt sure he saw a couple of buzzards that day and rode most of the time with his fieldglasses in his hand ready to clap them to his eyes at the first sight of specks in the sky the others saw red squirrels shy but tame among the trees they passed one shared the childrens lunch darting up for titbits but keeping a wary eye for kiki and snowy it wants to come with you philip said lucyann amused when the red squirrel put a paw on philips knee philip stroked the pretty little thing gently it quivered half frightened but did not bound away then kiki swooped down and the squirrel fled you would spoil things you jealous bird said philip go away i dont want you go to jack and let the squirrels come to me swallows flew round them once again not attracted by the food but by the flies that pestered the donkeys the children could hear the snapping of their beaks as they caught the flies we ought to get jack to tame a few swallows and take them with us to catch the flies said lucyann slapping at a big one on her leg horrid things ive been bitten by something already you wouldnt think thered be any as high up as this would you sally the slowworm came out to eat the fly that lucyann had killed she was getting much too tame for dinahs liking she lay in the sun gleaming like silver and then slid under philip as snowy came up enquiringly keep your nose out of things said philip pushing the kid away as it tried to nose under him to find the slowworm snowy butted him hard and then tried to get on his lap too hot too hot said philip why did we ever bring a little pest like you snowy you breathed down my neck all night lucyann giggled she loved snowy they all did the kid was mischievous given to butting and didnt mind treading on anyone but he was so lively so full of spring and bounce so affectionate that it was impossible to be cross with him for long come on said philip at last davids clearing his throat as if hes going to tell us were too lazy for words david had a habit of clearing his throat about a dozen times before he spoke it was a nervous habit which kiki copied to perfection she would sit near him and make a noise as if she was clearing her throat every time he did the same thing then she would go off into a cackle of laughter david was rather scared of her they travelled well that second day and went a long way when the time came to camp again david looked earnestly over the mountains as if he was searching for something lost your handkerchief old chap said jack and everyone laughed david looked solemnly at him not understanding then he suddenly began to flap his arms like wings and to say a few words in welsh he looked comical standing there flapping like that the children had to turn away trying not to laugh he says tomorrow we shall see the butterfly valley said jack good it ought to be a real sight if its anything like i imagine it to be they had a meal and prepared to camp out again the evening was not so fine as the day it had clouded over and there was no sunset to watch and no stars to come gleaming out one by one if it rains youll get wet david said jack david shrugged his shoulders and said something in his singsong voice then wrapped himself in his rug on the bare ground it wont rain said philip looking at the sky but its much colder brrrrr ill be glad of my sleepingbag tonight good night called the girls sleep well good night it will be a lovely day again tomorrow you just see called back philip who thought himself a good weather forecaster but he was wrong when they awoke the next morning they looked out on a completely different world chapter a different world lucyann awoke first she was cold she snuggled down into her sleepingbag and then opened her eyes she stared out of the open tentflap expecting to see the green mountainside and the distant mountains towering up into the sky but they werent there instead a white mist swirled past the tentflap some of it putting thin cold fingers into the tent itself there was nothing to see at all except the mist the mountains had gone the trees by the camp were blotted out even the donkeys couldnt be seen whats happened said lucyann astonished golly its a thick mist come up she awoke dinah and the girls peered out in dismay at the misty mountainside now and again a tiny bit of view could be seen as the mist thinned a little but it grew thick again at once its a cloud said dinah you know how we see clouds resting on mountaintops well this is one its resting on us its like a thick fog we cant see through blow the boys woke up then and the girls could hear their dismayed voices they called to them jack philip isnt this sickening we cant see a thing it may clear when weve had breakfast said philip cheerfully appearing out of the mist with snowy at his heels gosh its chilly im going to put on a warm jersey david also appeared looking very doleful he swung his arm out towards the valley and poured out a torrent of welsh hes quite excited about it isnt he said jack i wish i could follow him when he talks like that i just dont understand a word they decided to have breakfast in one of the tents because the mist made everything damp and chilly david preferred to stay outside dinah didnt want to come into the tent because of sally and only agreed to if she were allowed to sit in the doorway ready to escape if the slowworm appeared it was not so cheerful a meal as usual the children missed the magnificent view they had been used to and were afraid that david wouldnt take them on their way that day but the mist cleared a little in an hours time and david seemed quite willing to go they loaded up the donkeys mounted and set off down the track they could see some way ahead of them now for the sun was rising higher and trying to dissolve the mist with its heat itll be all right said jack i almost caught sight of the sun then but the mist came down again and it was only just possible to see the donkey in front i feel as if i ought to hold your donkeys tail in case you disappear in the mist shouted jack to dinah you know like elephants do in circuses when they come into the ring all holding on to one anothers tails the mist thickened very much and the little company stopped to discuss what to do it was difficult to get anything intelligible out of david who seemed suddenly to have forgotten any english words he knew jack flapped his arms raised his eyebrows and pointed in front of him meaning to ask if they were near the butterfly valley david understood but he hesitated i hope he hasnt lost the way said jack to philip he seemed sure enough of the direction yesterday now he doesnt seem very certain blow well we cant stop here said dinah shivering in the clammy mist theres no shelter and its jolly cold oh for the sun again go on said jack to david its the only thing to do till we find some kind of shelter its too cold to hang about till the mist has gone if we go the wrong way we can turn back and go right when the mist disappears so they went on following davids donkey through the wet mist kiki was very silent she didnt understand the mist and was afraid of it snowy kept close to philips donkey and was not nearly so full of spring and liveliness everyone disliked the mist thoroughly when we find a sheltered place well stop for lunch said philip im sure were all getting frightfully hungry now but we seem to be on quite a bare bit of mountainside hopeless to picnic in wed all be down with colds tomorrow they ambled on nose to tail pulling their jerseys close glad of their coats too jack began to look rather worried he stopped his donkey and went to walk beside philips whats up said philip seeing jacks serious face weve left the track said jack havent you noticed weve followed some kind of track up till an hour or two back but now im pretty certain weve lost it goodness knows where davids heading for i doubt if hes even noticed were not on any track at all philip whistled dont let the girls hear you theyll be scared yes youre right theres not the vestige of a track here davids lost the way better ask him said jack and rode to the front of the line is this the right way he asked david slowly so as to be understood where is the track he pointed downwards to the ground david was looking solemn too he shrugged his shoulders and said something in his singsong voice jack rode back to philip i think he knows hes off the track but hes hoping to pick it up further on anyway he doesnt seem inclined to stop or go back well hes our guide said philip after a pause well have to trust him he knows these mountains better than we do yes but hes a poor stick said jack not much brain i wouldnt put it past him to go on losing us deeper and deeper in these mountains once hed begun he just wouldnt know what else to do what a horrible idea said philip good thing weve got so much food with us if thats what he means to do they came at last to a big outcrop of rocks which would give them shelter from the wet chilly wind better have a meal here said philip id like something hot to drink did mrs evans put in a teakettle yes if we can find a stream or spring well build a little fire and boil some water for cocoa or something said jack but there was no spring and no stream it was most annoying considering the dozens weve passed this morning and waded through i call it a bit hard that theres not even a tiny one here said dinah im jolly thirsty too they had to have a meal without anything to drink they were very hungry and the food seemed to warm them a little they played a game of tag to get themselves thoroughly warm after the meal david looked as if he thought they had gone mad snowy joined in wildly neatly tripping everyone up kiki rose in the air and screamed look at davids face he thinks were all crazy giggled lucyann she sank down on a rock oh i cant run any more ive got a stitch in my side stitchinmyside stitchinmyside chanted kiki running all the words together pop goes the weasel the mists clearing hurrah suddenly cried jack and he pointed upwards the sun could be seen quite clearly struggling to get through the clouds of mist everyone cheered up at once even david looked less dismal lets try to get to the butterfly valley before the evening said jack to david doing the flapping business vigorously to make sure david understood david nodded they mounted the donkeys again and set off once more they could see much further in front now quite a big stretch of mountainside was spread before them the world suddenly seemed a much bigger place they rode on steadily the mist thinned more and more rapidly and the children felt the heat of the sun on their heads they took off their coats revelling in the warmth after the chilliness of the mist look we can see the nearest mountaintops now called jack and the distant ones will soon be uncovered too thank goodness we ought to see the vale of butterflies soon said lucyann eagerly david said wed get there today i wonder where it is look theres a butterfly philip philip glanced at it only a meadowbrown he said weve seen heaps of those he looked before him searchingly and then put his fieldglasses to his eyes theres a valley which might be it he said pointing hey david is that the vale of butterflies david looked where philip was pointing he shrugged his shoulders iss no he said yes no whatever does he mean by that said philip in disgust i suppose in plain english he means he hasnt the faintest idea well well go on and hope for the best it looks a nice sheltered kind of valley the sort that might be hot enough for all kinds of insects and flowers picturing a perfect paradise of brilliant flowers and equally brilliant butterflies the children rode on and on down towards the valley in the far distance it was much further than they thought that was the worst of travelling in mountains everywhere was about twice as far as you imagined it to be most disappointing it was late when they rode into the valley which was more of a shallow depression between two high mountains than a real lowland valley it was sheltered and certainly it had more flowers in it than they had so far seen but there were no butterflies this cant be it said philip in disappointment is it david david shook his head he was looking round in a puzzled manner and it was quite clear that he didnt know where he was if this is not the butterfly place where is it asked jack slowly and clearly david shook his head again he was really a maddening person no use as a guide at all well said philip hes brought us the wrong way to a place he doesnt know but its quite warm and sheltered so well make the best of it tonight tomorrow well get the map from david see if we can find out the way and set off with ourselves as guides hes as much use as kiki to guide us in these mountains they set up their camp again feeling rather disappointed they had so hoped to come to the place they wanted that night and to set up camp properly for a few days to revel in hordes of common and uncommon butterflies now they would have to go hunting for it again and goodness knew if they would ever find it they crawled into their sleepingbags and called goodnight just as the stars gleamed out david was sleeping outside as usual but in the night the boys woke up suddenly david was crawling into their tent he was trembling with fright noises he said in english and then poured out something in welsh he was very frightened sleep here he said and crept between the boys they were amused and puzzled whatever could have scared david so much chapter a disturbing night the sun was shining brightly when the camp awoke next day it made them all feel cheerful and lively snowy who had resented david sleeping with philip and jack the night before and had butted him continually bounded about lightly everywhere butting david whenever he met him what happened to you last night david asked jack when they were all having a meal why were you so frightened noises said david what sort asked philip curiously we didnt hear any david made some surprising noises that sent kiki sailing into the air and snowy bounding away in fright the children stared at david in astonishment by means of odd words and gestures david managed to convey to the children that he had gone to see if the donkeys were all right in the night and had heard these noises near by where they were tethered that explains why we didnt hear them i suppose said jack david makes them sound like animal noises fierce and savage lucyann looked scared oh you dont think there are wild animals anywhere about here do you jack i mean fierce wild animals jack grinned well if you are thinking of lions and tigers and panthers and bears i think i can say you neednt be afraid of finding those here but if like dinah you include snakes foxes hedgehogs and so on in your list of fierce wild animals then i should say look out dont be silly jack of course i dont mean those said lucyann i dont quite know what i did mean i just felt scared and wondered what animal had made the noises david heard probably his own imagination said philip or a bad dream it wouldnt take much to scare him david did not seem to want to go any further he kept pointing back over the way they had come but the children were not going to let their trip come to such a disappointing end they meant to go and find the butterfly valley if it took them all week there was a lot of flapping to make david understand this he turned sulky but mounted his donkey to go with them jack now had the map and examined it very carefully it was annoying that the butterfly valley wasnt marked perhaps very few people knew about it they all set off across the valley and up into the mountains again perhaps the next valley would be the one they wanted or the one after that but although they travelled hopefully all the day they did not find any valley full of butterflies the children began to think it was all a fairy tale there was no track to follow now though the boys kept a keen lookout in case they should come across one again when they camped that night they discussed what they had better do next if we go on any further we shant know our way back said jack david would perhaps because he was born and bred among mountains and like a dog could follow his own trail well enough if we had to go back but hes so brainless that i dont like to trust to him too much i wouldnt be surprised if he lost the way going back if we take him much further had we better go back then asked lucyann in disappointment or camp here for a few days said jack looking round its quite a good place they were halfway up a steep mountain that rose very sharply from where they were and looked quite unclimbable what a queer mountain said dinah gazing up i shouldnt think anyone ever climbed to the top its all crags and rocks and juttingout bits well camp here decided philip the weather looks quite settled theres a spring nearby we can mess about with our cameras and fieldglasses they told david he did not seem pleased but went off to tether the donkeys for the night they were all tired that evening children and donkeys both for they had had a very long day they cut the big ham that mrs evans had provided for them afraid that it might go bad if they didnt eat it soon david looked as if he thought he would sleep in the tent again that night for he cast various longing glances in that direction however the night was hot and he felt he couldnt bear to be under cover so he arranged himself under his rug in the open fairly near to the two tents the donkeys were some way away tethered to trees by long ropes that night there was a snuffling around the camp lucyann awoke suddenly and heard it she went right down to the bottom of her sleepingbag frightened what could it be was it the wild animal that david had heard then she heard a howl the boys heard it too and awoke david outside was awake having heard both the noises he was shivering with fright all kinds of fears coming into his peasant mind the moon was up and everything was silvery bright david sat up and looked down the hill what he saw made his hair rise straight up on his head wolves a pack of wolves no no it couldnt be he was dreaming wolves had not been known in the mountains for hundreds of years but if those creatures were not wolves what were they and that noise of snuffling he had heard that must have been a wolf too no not a wolf it couldnt have been such a thing david sat there hugging his knees his mind going round and round wolves or not wolves or not what were they doing near the donkeys another howl came half a howl half a bark a horrible noise david shot into the boys tent and gave them a terrible start he stammered something in welsh and then in english wolves dont be silly said jack at once seeing that the man was scared to death youve had a bad dream david dragged him to the tent opening and pointed with a trembling finger to where the pack of snuffling animals stood not far from the donkeys the boys stared as if they could not believe their eyes they certainly looked like wolves jack felt a cold shiver down his back good gracious was he dreaming those creatures were more like wolves than anything else snowy the kid was trembling as much as david was his trembling somehow made the boys feel scared too the only person who was not in the least scared was kiki in the bright moonlight she too had caught sight of the wolves she sailed out of the tent at top speed to go and investigate anything unusual always interested kiki she flew above the animals whose eyes gleamed green as they turned at her coming wipe your feet screamed kiki and made a noise like a mowingmachine cutting long grass it sounded really terrible in the still night air of the mountainside the wolves started in fright then with one accord they all galloped away down the hillside into the night kiki shouted rude remarks after them theyve gone said jack gosh were they real i cant understand it when it was dawn david got up to see if the donkeys were all right neither he nor the boys had slept again that night david had been too scared and the boys had been too puzzled daylight was almost on the mountain david crept down quietly to the donkeys they were all there safe and sound but uneasy david untethered them to take them to the stream to drink the boys were looking out of their tent down the hillside to watch there was no sign of any wolf now birds sang a little and a yellowhammer cried out for a little bit of bread and no cheese suddenly something happened david who was taking the donkeys in a line to the stream gave a terrified scream and fell to the ground covering his face the boys holding their breath thought they saw something moving in the bushes but they couldnt see what david gave another scream and got to his feet he mounted a donkey and rode at top speed up to the tent come he cried in welsh and then in english black black black the boys had no idea at all what he meant they stared at him in amazement thinking he must have gone mad he made a violent gesture to them pointed to the following donkeys as if to tell the boys to mount and follow him and then galloped off at breakneck speed they heard the hooves of his donkey echoing on the mountainside for some time the other donkeys looked doubtfully at one another and then to the boys dismay trotted after david hi come back you yelled jack scrambling out of the tent hi hi one donkey turned and made as if to come back but he was pushed on by others behind in a trice they had all disappeared and the sound of their hooves grew fainter and fainter as they galloped away after david and his mount the two boys sat down suddenly they felt faint jack turned pale he looked at philip and bit his lip now they were in a terrible fix they said nothing for a moment or two and then the girls two scared faces looked out from their tent whats happened whats all the yelling was that david galloping away we didnt dare to look yes it was david running away from us and all the donkeys have gone after him said philip bitterly were in a pretty fix now nobody said anything lucyann looked really alarmed no david no donkeys what were they going to do jack put his arm round her as she came and sat down beside him its all right weve been in worse fixes than this at the worst it only means a few days here because as soon as he gets back to the farm bill will come and look for us good thing we unloaded the donkeys and have got plenty of food said philip and our tents and sleepingbags blow david hes a coward i wonder what he saw to make him gallop off like that said jack all i could make out was black black black black what asked dinah black nothing just black said jack lets go down to the place where he got his fright and see if we can see anything oh no said the girls at once well ill go and philip can stay here with you said jack and off he went the others watched him holding their breath he peered all round and then turned and shook his head and shouted nothing here not a thing to see david must have been seeing things his bad night upset him he came back but what about those animals in the night said philip after a pause those wolves we both saw those they seemed real enough yes what about those wolves chapter a strange happening it wasnt long before dinah suggested having something to eat and went to the big panniers that had been unloaded from the donkeys the night before she pulled out some tins thinking that it would be a change to have sardines and tinned peaches or something like that anything to take their minds off davids flight and the disappearance of the donkeys they sat down rather silently lucyann kept very close to the boys what with wolves and davids fright she felt very scared herself i hope this wont turn into one of our adventures she kept saying to herself they always happen so suddenly snowy the kid bounded up to philip and knocked a tin flying from his hand he nuzzled affectionately against him and then butted him philip rubbed the furry little nose and then pushed the kid away im glad you didnt go off with the donkeys too he said ive got used to having you around now you funny aggravating little thing take your nose out of that tin lucyann push him off hell eat everything weve got kiki suddenly flew at snowy screaming with rage she had had her eye on that tin of sliced peaches and to see snowy nosing round it was too much for her she gave him a sharp peck on his nose and he ran to philip bleating everyone laughed and felt better they sat there eating by the tents occasionally glancing up at the mountain that towered so steeply above them it had no gentle slope up to the summit as most of the mountains around had but was steep and forbidding i dont much like this mountain said lucyann why asked dinah i dont know i just dont like it said lucyann ive got one of my feelings about it the others laughed lucyann often had feelings about things and really believed in them it was just like her to start having feelings about the mountain when everyone was also having uncomfortable ideas about wolves and other things well you neednt have any feelings about mountains said philip mountains are all the same just tops middles and bottoms sometimes with sheep on and sometimes without but not many have wolves said lucyann seriously and that made the others feel uncomfortable again what are we going to do today asked jack when they had finished their meal i suppose we must stay here till bill comes to find us we cant try to walk back home because for one thing we dont know the way and for another wed never be able to carry enough food to get there without starving wed far better stay here said philip at once its ten chances to one david will know his way back here all right and can bring bill and the donkeys whereas if we start moving about theyll never find us yes it does seem the most sensible thing to do said jack weve got our camp here tents set up and everything so we might as well make the best of it and enjoy the camping i wish there was somewhere to bathe though its so jolly hot that little streams too small to do anything but paddle in lets all keep together said lucyann i mean we could frighten those wolves away perhaps if we all screamed at them but one of us alone might be might be gobbled up said jack and laughed what big eyes youve got granny and oh what big teeth youve got dont tease her said philip seeing lucyanns alarmed face its all right lucyann wolves are only really hungry in the wintertime and its summer now lucyann looked relieved well i suppose if theyd been really hungry they would have attacked the donkeys wouldnt they she said oh dear i do think its most extraordinary to find wolves here they were just about to get up and clear away the picnic things when something curious happened that froze them to the ground first of all there was a grumbling rumbling noise that seemed to come from the heart of the mountain itself and then the ground shook a little the four children distinctly felt it quivering beneath them and they clutched at one another in alarm kiki flew straight up into the air screaming snowy leapt to a high rock and stood there poised on his four little legs as if to take off in the air like a plane the ground stopped shaking the noise died away but almost immediately the rumbling began again a little louder but very muffled as if great depths of rock separated it from the listeners the ground quivered once more and snowy took a flying leap into the air landing on another rock he was really terrified so were the four children lucyann very pale clung to jack and philip dinah forgetting all about the slowworm held on to philip too there were no more rumblings and the earth beneath them stayed still the birds which had stopped singing and calling began to chirp again and a yellowhammer gave his familiar cry snowy recovered herself and came bounding up to the others kiki landed on jacks shoulder god save the king she said in a relieved voice what in the world was that said philip at last an earthquake gosh i was scared oh philip this mountain isnt a volcano is it said lucyann gazing up at it fearfully of course not youd know a volcano all right if you saw one said jack this is a perfectly ordinary mountain and goodness knows why it should have rumbled like that and trembled beneath us it gave me a horrible feeling i told you i had one of my feelings about this mountain said lucyann didnt i i feel very queer about it i want to go back to the farmhouse and not stay here so do we all said philip but we shouldnt know the way lucyann it isnt as if wed followed a track we left the track as you know and part of the time we were in thick mist we shouldnt have the faintest idea of the way i know youre right said lucyann but i dont like this mountain especially when it starts to rumble and shake what made it nobody knew they got up cleared away the meal and went to splash in the little stream the wind suddenly began to blow rather chilly and looking up the children saw that big clouds were coming up from the southwest looks like rain said jack i hope the wind doesnt get up much more or it will blow our tents away do you remember how they were blown clean away from over us on our last adventure on the island of birds that was an awful feeling well said philip if you really think the tents might blow away jack wed better find a better place to camp than this somewhere not too far though because we dont want to miss seeing bill and david when they come for us a copse of trees or a cave or somewhere like that right out of the wind lets look now said dinah pulling on her coat it was extraordinary how cold it got as soon as the sun went in and the wind blew up the mountain wed better take snowy with us or hell eat everything weve left snowy had every intention of coming with them he capered along by philip and jack as mad as ever he was now very annoyed with kiki and leapt at her whenever she came within reach wanting to pay her back for nipping his nose when the girls had been left a little way behind philip spoke in a low voice to jack wed better find a cave i think jack i dont like the idea of those animals prowling around us at night wolves or whatever they are if we were in a cave we could light a fire at the entrance and that would keep any animal off yes thats quite a good idea agreed jack i hadnt thought of that i cant say i like the idea either of wolves nosing round our tents when were asleep at night id feel much safer in a cave they hunted about for some kind of rocky shelter or cave but there seemed none to be found the mountain was so steep that it was difficult to climb and lucyann was afraid of slipping and falling snowy leapt ahead of them as surefooted as ever the boys wished heartily that it was as easy for them to leap about the mountain as it was for the kid look at him up there standing on that rock said jack feeling exasperated and far too hot with his climbing hey snowy come and give us a leg up if only we had four springy legs like yours snowy stood there whisking his little tail and then ran back and disappeared wheres he gone said jack oh there he comes again philip there must be a cave or overhanging rock up where he is he keeps going back and disappearing into it whatever it is they climbed up to where snowy was and sure enough just at the back of the overhanging rock was a long low cave its roof made out of another overhanging rock its opening fringed with ferns of all kinds this would do awfully well for us said jack going down on hands and knees and looking in we could light a fire on the rock outside the one snowy stood on and feel quite safe tonight clever little snowy you found us just what we wanted but how in the world are we going to get everything up here said philip it was such a climb its not as if we are donkeys or goats able to scramble up steep places quite easily even with a load to carry we need our hands to help us this was certainly a problem the boys hailed the girls and helped them up on to the rock where snowy stood look said jack heres a good place to sleep in tonight we can see quite well from here if bill and david come see what a good view we have from this rock and wed be safe from the wolves if we lighted a fire at the entrance to the cave oh yes said lucyann pleased she went into the cave she had to bend her head at the opening but inside the roof grew higher its not really a cave she said its just a space under that big juttingout rock but it will do awfully well they all sat down on the rock wishing the sun would come out snowy lay down beside them and kiki sat on jacks shoulder but suddenly she rose up into the air and screeched loudly snowy leapt up and stood looking downwards what was the matter is it the wolves again asked lucyann in alarm they listened they could hear a noise of some animal or animals down below in the thick bushes under the birchtrees get back into the cave said jack to the girls and keep quiet the two girls went silently back into the darkness of the cave the boys listened and watched what animal was it down there it must be big by the noise it made chapter wolves in the night snowy suddenly bleated loudly and took a flying leap off the rock before philip could stop him he disappeared into the bushes below and then a loud and welcome sound filled the air eeore eeore eeore goodness its a donkey cried jack and scrambled down to see have they come back is david with them they soon found what they were looking for dapple the donkey was in the bushes nuzzling snowy evidently full of delight at seeing him again but there was no sign at all of the other donkeys or of david dapple you darling said lucyann running up to him in joy youve come back to us come back to snowy you mean said philip he was always fond of snowy werent you dapple so you came back to find him well were very very glad to see you because you will solve a very knotty problem for us how to get all our goods up to that cave dapple had come back to see snowy but he was also very pleased to see the children again he was a quiet stout little donkey hardworking and patient he kept close to the children and had evidently made up his mind he was going to stay with them snowy was happy with him and trotted by his side all the time here dapple called philip come and help us with these things theres a good fellow dapple stood obediently whilst the boys strapped things on to his back he took all the bedding up to the cave first scrambling up the steep bits with difficulty but managing very well indeed then he took up the panniers of food thanks dapple said jack giving him a pat now come and have a drink they all went to the stream and drank and splashed the sun had come out again and immediately it was very hot the children flung off their coats and lay about basking we must collect wood for the fire tonight said jack we shall need a good lot if were going to keep the fire going all night long well stack it in the big panniers and get dapple to take it up for us good old dapple said dinah they collected as much wood as they could and soon it was all piled up on the rock outside the cave the boys made a fire but did not light it there was no need to do that till night the day soon went and the sun sank behind the mountains in a blaze of crimson as soon as darkness fell on the mountainside the children retired into the cave the thought of wolves kept coming into their mind and davids scream of terror when he had seen something in the bushes black black black what could he have seen the children hadnt thought much of these things during the bright daylight but they came back into their minds now it was dark they debated whether or not to have dapple in the cave with them but dapple settled that idea by firmly refusing to go under the overhanging rock he just stood outside stubbornly his four legs set firmly on the ground and no amount of pushing or pulling made the slightest difference he was not going into that cave all right dapple said jack crossly stay outside and be eaten by wolves if you want to oh dont say things like that said lucyann dapple do come inside please dapple lay down firmly outside and the children gave it up there would be no difficulty about snowy or kiki one would want to be with philip the other with jack now well light the fire said jack as stars began to glimmer in the sky its getting very dark got the matches philip the fire soon burnt for the twigs and branches were very dry the cheerful flames leapt and flickered and the fire crackled merrily thats very very nice said lucy pleased i feel safe tucked away in this cave with a fire at the entrance philip make snowy go the other side of you hes sticking his hooves into me i wish hed wear bedroom slippers at night everybody laughed they all felt safe and comfortable tucked up in their sleepingbags with the fire lighting up the cave filling it with jumping shadows snowy was pressed against philip kiki was on jacks middle somewhere outside was dapple lucyann wished he was inside with them then the whole family would be safe they all watched the flames for a while and then fell asleep the fire flickered down as the wood was burnt up and soon only the embers glowed philip woke with a start a few hours later he saw that the fire had died down and he got out of his sleepingbag to put on more wood it would never do to let it go out dapple was still outside lying quietly philip saw him when the flames leapt up to burn the wood he piled on the boy went back to his sleepingbag he found that snowy had crept inside it while he was piling wood on the fire you little scamp he whispered get out theres not room for us both there was quite a scuffle as he tried to pull snowy out of the bag fortunately the others were so very sound asleep that they didnt wake philip got snowy out at last and slid in himself he hastily laced up the neck of the bag before snowy could try to squeeze in again snowy gave a sigh and lay down heavily right on philips middle philip lay awake watching the fire the wind sometimes blew the smoke towards the cave and for a moment or two the smell made philip want to cough then he heard dapple stir outside and he got up on one elbow to see why his heart began to beat very fast silent dark figures were slinking up to the cave they did not pass beyond the fire but they did not seem to be afraid of it philip felt breathless and his heart beat faster as if he had been running what were those figures were they the wolves the boy caught sight of two gleaming eyes shining like the headlights of a distant car but green as grass he sat up quietly the wolves were back they had smelt out the little company what would they do they had not attacked dapple thank goodness and the donkey did not seem to be unduly frightened he was only moving uneasily the slinking figures moved to and fro behind the fire philip couldnt think what in the world to do he could only hope that the fire would frighten them enough to keep them out of the cave after a while all the animals disappeared philip breathed again gosh what a horrible fright he had had what a blessing they had thought of that fire philip made up his mind that he wasnt going to sleep again that night in case the fire went out at all costs he must keep that up so the boy lay wideeyed thinking of wolves rumblings earthquakes and black black black there was something queer about all these things did they fit together or didnt they was there something peculiar about this mountain the fire was dying down again philip got up cautiously to put more wood on the moon was up now and he could see for miles he piled wood on the fire and the flames shot up then the boy heard a sound he looked up and to his horror he saw a wolf between him and the cave he had gone to pat dapple and in that moment the wolf had slunk in between fire and cave would he go in the wolf stood still looking at philip in the moonlight philip gazed back wondering what to do if the creature attacked him and as he looked a very peculiar thing happened the wolf wagged its long tail to and fro it went to and fro like a big dogs philips heart leapt the animal wanted to be friendly all animals were attracted to philip but a wolf that was extraordinary the boy held out his hand half afraid but bold and daring the wolf trotted round the fire and licked philips hand it gave a little whine the moon shone down brightly on the animals dark coat pointed ears and long muzzle was it a wolf now that he was close to it philip began to doubt and then quite suddenly he knew what this friendly animal was why youre an alsatian dog he cried arent you why didnt i think of it before i knew there werent wolves in this country where are the others youre all alsatians good dog fine dog id like to be friends with you the big alsatian put his paws up on philips shoulder and licked his face then he lifted his head and howled it was a wolflike noise but philip no longer minded that it was a call to the other dogs the rest of the pack there came the sound of feet in the bushes below and a crowd of dogs leapt up on to the rock they clustered round philip and seeing that their leader was so friendly with the boy they pawed him and licked him the howl awakened all the three children in the cave and they sat up in fright to their unspeakable horror they saw outside the cave what looked like philip being attacked by wolves look theyve got philip quick yelled jack all three children slid out of their sleepingbags and rushed to philips aid the dogs growled at the sudden commotion philip were coming are you hurt cried valiant little lucyann picking up a stick its all right its all right yelled philip theyre not attacking me theyre friendly theyre not wolves but alsatians dogs you know goodness gracious said dinah and came out into the moonlight so glad that the dogs were not wolves that she didnt even feel afraid of so many big dogs oh philip said lucyann almost in tears with the shock of delight at knowing the wolves were only dogs oh philip i thought you were being attacked you were a darling to come to my rescue then said philip smiling when he saw the little stick that lucyann had meant to attack the wolves with the leader of the dogs made friends with me so all the others are doing the same the dogs had apparently made up their minds to stay for the night philip debated what to do we cant possibly go back into the cave he said the whole pack will come crowding in and it would be impossible to breathe quite impossible said dinah filled with horror at the thought of so many dogs sleeping with them so well bring our sleepingbags out here on the rock beside dapple and sleep there said philip the dogs can stay if they want to theyll be good guards and if they dont want to they can go there are about ten of them i wonder how it is theyre wandering about here wild ten of them its extraordinary they dragged out their sleepingbags and got into them the dogs sniffed round in wonder the leader sat majestically down by philip as if to say this boy is my property keep off the others lay about among the children snowy was afraid of the big leaderdog and dared not even go near his beloved philip he went to jack instead kiki stayed up in a tree there were altogether too many dogs for her it was a curious sight the moon looked down on four children one goat one parrot one donkey and ten dogs chapter the face in the tree when the morning came dapple awoke the children by giving a mighty sneeze they woke with a jump wondering what it was dapple gave another sneeze and they knew its dapple have you got a cold dapple asked lucyann anxiously then she remembered the happenings of the night and looked round everyone said the same thing at once where are the dogs they had disappeared not one was there the children looked at one another puzzled where had they gone and why we couldnt all have dreamed them said dinah answering everyones unspoken thought they really were here ten of them most peculiar yes it is peculiar said jack personally i think they must belong to somebody they didnt strike me as being a pack of wild dogs nor me said philip but who could they belong to theres not a house for miles and why should anyone in this desolate mountain country keep ten manhunting dogs oooh are they manhunters said lucyann startled well the police use them for that said philip dont they jack they hunt criminals with them those alsatians can smell them out and capture them but there cant be any police here with huntingdogs i mean bill would have had it reported to him if they were hes high up in the police organisation himself and theres not a thing he doesnt know about whats going on in the police world where do the dogs come from then asked dinah would they be kept as guards for anything to frighten anyone off or give the alarm for instance yes but what is there to guard here among these mountains said jack nothing at all as far as i can see give it up said philip sliding out of his sleepingbag im going for a splash in the stream coming yes then well open a tin or two said dinah i wish wed thought of giving that hambone to the dogs jack the hams gone bad now but they wouldnt have minded well give it to them next time we see them said jack ive no doubt theyll be along again they all splashed in the stream dapple too kiki sat apart making sarcastic remarks for she was not fond of water pooh gah she shouted trying to remember all the rude words she knew gooh pah thats right mix your words up kiki said jack what about piffle and bunk you used to know those too pifflebunk said kiki and thought that was a good word pifflebunk bifflepunk pop goes the pifflebunk the children laughed kiki laughed too and then began to give an imitation of dapple braying this was much too lifelike and dapple started up looking all round for the other donkeys eeore eeore eeore went on kiki till jack threw a towel at her to make her stop it fell over her head and she screamed in rage dapple and snowy stared solemnly at her puzzled and surprised after they had a meal lucyann volunteered to go down to the stream again and wash the dishes while the others looked at the map trying to find out exactly where they were she went off to the stream humming she knelt down by the water scouring a dish when a sound made her look up she had heard something in the tree above just by the water there was a big leafy tree there growing almost out of the stream lucyann thinking there must be a bird in the tree peered up into the branches she got a terrible shock looking down at her was a face and it was black the little girl stood there petrified the dish in her hand unable to move or speak the branches moved and she saw the face was topped by black woolly hair and that it had very white teeth and thick lips its a negro she thought to herself but here up this tree what shall i do the black face looked down on the little girl and then the thick lips parted in a smile the woolly head nodded amiably then a black finger came up from among the leaves and was put to the lips you not make a sound little missy said the negro in a hoarse whisper you not say i here i poor nigger little missy lost and all alone lucyann couldnt believe her ears she felt that she simply must call the others but they didnt hear her and as soon as she had shouted the negro frowned fiercely and shook his head missy you go way from here dis very bad mountain full of bad men they get you if you dont go way bad things here missy what are you doing here asked lucyann in a scared voice how do you know all this i been in bad mountain missy i get away but poor nigger nowhere to go he afraid of dem big dogs he stay here in big tree you go way missy far away lucyann felt queer standing there talking to a blackfaced man up a tree she suddenly turned and ran back to the others she ran fast and arrived absolutely out of breath whats the matter whats the matter cried jack seeing from lucyanns face that she had had a shock lucyann could only gasp out one or two words she pointed back to the stream black man she gasped black black thats what david said cried philip get your breath lucyann tell us what you saw quick lucyann panted out what she had seen and heard the others listened in astonishment a black man hiding in a tree from the dogs a man who said the mountain was bad full of bad men whatever did it mean come on well ask him what he knows cried jack theres something going on here wed better find out and then we can tell bill when he comes quick they all ran back to the stream and peered up the tree but there was nobody there the negro had gone blow said jack in disappointment he must have seen you scuttle back to us lucyann to tell us you had seen him and hes scared and now hes gone its a wonder the dogs didnt find him last night and before that when david saw him up this very same tree said jack well hes been rather clever i should think said philip looking at the stream you know dogs cant follow scent through water they lost it and i reckon that negro was clever enough to wade up or down the stream to that tree and hop up it from the water the dogs couldnt possibly follow his scent through the stream they would lose it wherever he entered the water still he must have felt pretty scared when he saw the dogs milling round near here were they hunting for him do you think asked lucyann fearfully he must have been awfully afraid i should be terrified if i thought a pack of alsatian dogs was after me the children hunted about for the negro but he was nowhere to be seen they wondered what he ate there was not much to eat on the mountains except bilberries wild raspberries and grass do you think he really meant there were men inside this mountain asked dinah when they had tired themselves out looking for the black man it seems incredible but if you remember those noises of rumbling we heard yesterday and the way the earth shook beneath us it seems as if there might be men working underground said jack what as miners or something asked dinah i dont know possibly though goodness knows what could be mined inside this mountain or how they would get the machinery there there would have to be a road and then everyone would know its very mysterious said dinah lucyann sighed its another adventure thats what it is its fatal to go off together like this we go to look for birds or butterflies or something and we always stumble into something peculiar im getting tired of it poor lucyann said philip we certainly do happen on strange things i think its very exciting i love adventures yes but youre a boy said lucyann girls dont like that kind of thing i do said dinah at once ive enjoyed every single one of our adventures and this one seems more mysterious than any other what is going on inside this mountain how id love to know if only we could see that negro again we could ask him to tell us all about it oh listen i do believe that rumblings going to start again said lucyann suddenly see how frightened snowy is yes there it comes they sat and listened jack put his ear to the ground at once the rumblings became magnified and sounded queerer than ever was something exploding down there far in the heart of the mountain then the earth quivered as it had done before and lucyann clutched at jack it was horrible to feel the firm solid earth quivering like a jelly it soon stopped dinah glanced up at the steep mountain rearing up just behind them wondering what its secret was she suddenly stiffened and caught hold of philips arm look she said and pointed upwards they all looked out of the side of the mountain was drifting a small cloud of smoke one puff came then another but it was not ordinary smoke it was a curious crimson colour and it did not drift away like mist on the wind but hung like a solid little cloud close to the mountain for some time then it suddenly became lighter in colour and disappeared well whatever was that said jack in amazement i never in my life saw smoke like that before there must be a vent or something in the side of the mountain there that lets out smoke or gases whats a vent asked lucyann her eyes looking as if they would drop out of her head oh a sort of chimney said jack some place with a draught that will take up smoke or gases to the outer air whatevers going on in the mountain produces that smoke which has to be got rid of i wonder what else is being produced inside there nobody could imagine they couldnt seem to fit together all the curious facts they knew the pack of manhunting dogs the runaway negro the noises the earths shaking the crimson smoke it didnt make any sense at all if only bill would come said philip he might be able to fit this jigsaw together or if we would get hold of that negro lucyann saw said philip he could tell us a lot we may see him again said dinah well watch out for him they did see him again that very evening but alas he didnt answer any of their questions chapter plenty of things happen they decided to go for a walk that evening they would leave dapple tied up to a tree by the stream with a note on his harness to say they would soon be back just in case bill came when they were away though he couldnt possibly be here yet said jack still you never knew with bill he had a remarkable way of doing impossible things extraordinarily quickly they went off together snowy capering about and kiki on jacks shoulder they climbed up past the cave where they had slept the night before their sleepingbags were still there pulled into the cave out of the sun they meant to sleep in them up on the rock again that night lets follow snowy suggested dinah he always seems to know a way to go though i expect he only follows his silly little nose but he usually chooses quite possible paths for us so they followed snowy the little kid took it into his head to climb up the mountain but at last they all came to such a steep rocky cliff of rock almost sheer that they had to stop even snowy was brought to a halt im frightfully hot said dinah fanning herself lets sit down under those trees the trees were waving about in the wind jack looked longingly up into the windblown branches it would be lovely and cool up there in the windy boughs he said what about climbing up they look pretty easy to climb a wizard idea said philip i love swinging in the branches at the top of a tree want a legup lucyann lucyann got a legup and soon they were all settled into forking branches letting themselves be swung about in the wind which was very strong just there this is lovely said dinah heavenly super said jack dont clutch my shoulder so tightly kiki you wont fall off snowy was left down below bleating he tried his best to leap up into the tree but he couldnt he ran round and round philips tree and then in a rage he tore up to a rock and leapt up it and down it without stopping the children watched him laughing at his antics then quite suddenly a hullabaloo broke on their ears it was the sound of excited barking and snarling howling and yelping the dogs said jack straining his eyes to see where the noise came from i say theyre after the negro there came the crashing of bushes and twigs far below them on the mountainside accompanied by more howls and barks then the children caught sight of a man running across a bare stony part of the mountainside below them about half a mile away the dogs poured after him lucyann almost fell out of her tree in fright at seeing a man chased by dogs the children watched without a word their hearts beating fast anxious for the man to escape he came to a tree and flung himself up it just as the first dog reached him he pulled himself up and was lost to sight the dogs surrounded the tree clamouring loudly lucyann gulped tears ran down her face she felt so sorry for the hunted man that she could hardly see through her tears the others watched grimly philip debated whether to go down and see if he could call the dogs off then another man appeared walking leisurely across the mountainside towards the tree and the dogs he was too far away for the children to see what he was like or to hear his voice but on the crisp air of the mountain came the shrill sound of a whistle the dogs at once left the tree and trotted back to the man he stood not far off from the tree and evidently gave orders for the man to come down but nobody came down from the tree the man waved his hand to the dogs and at once they streamed back to the tree again clamouring and howling like mad the man turned to go back the way he came oh hes left the dogs to keep that poor man up the tree till he starves or comes down to be set on sobbed lucyann philip what shall we do ill go down and call the dogs off said philip ill give the man a chance to get right out of sight so that he wont see me then ill see if i can get the dogs away and give that negro a chance to escape from the tree he climbed down his tree after he had waited for twenty minutes to give the second man a chance to go back to wherever he had come from he made his way cautiously through the tall bushes and then something happened a rough hand pounced down on his shoulder and he was held in a grip like iron he was swung round and came face to face with the man who had ordered the negro to come down from the tree philip wriggled but he couldnt possibly get away he didnt dare to yell for the others in case they got caught too blow why hadnt he waited longer before going off to the negros rescue what are you doing here said the man in a strange foreign accent who are you boy ive only come to look for butterflies stammered philip trying to look as if he knew nothing about anything but butterflies he didnt like the look of this man at all he had a fierce hawklike face overhanging eyebrows and such a sharp look in his black eyes that philip felt sure he would be difficult to deceive who are you with asked the man digging his steellike fingers into philip and making him squirm im alone as you can see said philip hoping the man would believe him the man looked at him searchingly my dogs would have got you if you had been here for long he said and all your friends too what friends asked philip innocently oh you mean snowy my kid he always comes with me snowy had bounded up at that moment to the obvious surprise of the man hes like a dog never leaves me let me go sir im looking for butterflies ill be gone tonight where did you come from asked the man do your parents know where you are no said philip truthfully i just went away to hunt for butterflies i came from over there he nodded his head vaguely behind him hoping that the man would think he was a harmless naturelover and let him go but the man didnt instead he tightened his fingers on philips shoulders and turned towards the tree where the negro was still hiding surrounded by the dogs youll come with me now he said youve seen too much just then there came a yelling and shouting from the tree evidently the negro had given in the man still clutching philip by the shoulder and followed by a puzzled snowy went towards the tree he took a whistle from his pocket and blew on it shrilly as before the dogs at once left the tree and came to him the man shouted for the negro to come down the frightened man came down in such a hurry that he half fell the dogs made no attempt to go for him philip saw that they had been extremely well trained the negro fell on his knees and began to jabber something he was terrified the man told him to get up in cold contemptuous tones surrounded by the dogs the negro walked stumblingly in front of the man who still held philip firmly by the shoulder up in their trees the children watched in horror hardly believing their eyes when they saw philip held by the man sh dont make a sound commanded jack its no good us being captured too if the dogs go with philip hell be all right hell have ten friends he can call on at any time the little procession of men boy dogs and kid passed almost beneath the trees the children were in philip did not glance up though he longed to he was not going to give away the hidingplace of the others jack parted the branches of his tree and followed the procession anxiously with his eyes they were going in the direction of the steep wall of unclimbable rock jack took up his fieldglasses which were slung round his neck as usual and glued them to his eyes following the company closely where exactly were they going if he knew he might be able to go and rescue philip and snowy he saw philip taken right up to the steep wall then before his eyes the whole company seemed to vanish one moment they were there the next they were gone jack took his glasses from his eyes and rubbed the lenses thinking something must have gone wrong with them but no he saw exactly the same thing a steep wall of sheer rock and nobody there at all not even a dog jack can you see whats happened to philip came lucyanns anxious voice oh jack hes caught yes and hes been taken into that mountain said jack though how i dont know one moment they were all there the next they were gone i cant understand it he looked through his glasses again but there was nothing to be seen he suddenly realised that the sun had gone down and it was getting dark girls itll be dark soon we must get down and go to the cave while we can still see our way said jack they all climbed down quickly lucyann was trying to blink back tears i want philip to come back she said whats happened to him dont be a baby said dinah crying wont help him you always burst into tears when anything happens dinah spoke crossly because she was very near tears herself jack put his arm round both of them dont lets quarrel that wont help philip come on lets get back quickly ill fetch dapple from the stream and bring her up to the rock they made their way back to the cave they had left their sleepingbags in jack fetched the patient dapple kiki sat silently on his shoulder she always knew when things had gone wrong with the children she nipped jacks ear gently to tell him she was sorry it was almost dark when they reached the cave there was no need to make a fire tonight they did not fear wolves any more indeed they would have been very glad to see dark figures come slinking up to the cave they would have welcomed the dogs eagerly i miss snowy said dinah its queer without him leaping about everywhere im glad hes gone with philip im glad the slowworms gone too they didnt want to get into the sleepingbags and go to sleep they wanted to talk a lot of things seemed to be happening very suddenly oh dear when would bill come they could manage quite well without grownups in many ways but just at the moment all three would have welcomed even david well lets get into our bags said jack isnt the moon lovely tonight nothing seems very nice when i think of philip being captured said lucyann dismally all the same the moon was glorious swinging up over the mountains and making everything as light as day they were just about to slide into their bags when lucyanns sharp ears caught an unfamiliar sound listen she said whats that no not a noise underground this time somewhere up in the sky they went out and stood on the flat rock listening their faces upturned to the moonlit sky what a peculiar noise said jack a bit like an aeroplane but not an aeroplane what can it be chapter behind the green curtain the noise came nearer like a motorbike in the sky said jack or a sewingmachine said dinah jack look whats that that tiny speck up there jack fumbled for his glasses which were still round his neck he put them to his eyes straining to focus the little black speck up in the moonlight it came nearer well whatever it is i do believe its going to land on this mountain said dinah isnt it going slowly is it an aeroplane jack no said jack gosh its a helicopter you know those things with whirling vanes on the top of them they dont fly fast but they can land in a very small space on a lawn or a roof even a helicopter cried dinah and took the glasses from jack let me see it was now near enough for dinah to be able to see it clearly with the glasses jack and lucyann watched it with screwedup eyes it hovered over the mountaintop and then flew slowly round it appearing in sight again after a few minutes it then flew up a little higher and descended slowly almost vertically its engine making a curious sound in the night then there was silence its landed said jack but where gosh i wouldnt like to land on a mountain as steep as this one perhaps there is a proper landingplace said lucyann right on the very top yes there may be said jack what a thing to do though land a helicopter on the very summit of a mountain like this what for nobody knew the answer to that well said jack at last if that helicopter did land up on top that would be one way of bringing food and stuff to the men who are at work inside the mountain theyd have to have food and theres no way of getting it round about here i feel as if all this must be a dream said lucyann in a small voice i dont like it at all i wish i could wake up come on lets get into our bags said jack we cant do anything well just have to wait for bill we can sleep out on the rock tonight if you like its got very warm again and were snug enough in our bags nibbling bars of chocolate the three of them slipped into the bags kiki flew up into a nearby bush she cleared her throat as david had often done look you whateffer look you whateffer she began meaning to have a little practice of the new words she had learnt kiki shut upsaid jack whateffer said kiki and hiccupped very loudly pardon she gave a cackle of laughter and said no more for a moment then she took her head out from under her wing pifflebunk she said delighted at having remembered it and put her head back again jack woke several times in the night wondering about philip he also puzzled his head to think how the whole company of dogs men and boy could possibly have vanished as they did under his very eyes he felt that he really would have to go and explore that steep wall of rock the next day perhaps he would find out where the company had gone and how it had gone do you think bill will come today asked lucyann next morning jack reckoned up and shook his head no perhaps he will tomorrow though if david got back quickly and bill came at once still if we go far away from the stream wed better leave a note for bill in case he comes and were not there like we did yesterday they had taken the note off dapples harness the night before when they had brought the donkey back from the stream up to their sleepingrock now jack set to work to write another in it he told the story of philips disappearance by the wall of rock and he also wrote about the helicopter he had seen he had a feeling that he had better tell all he knew in case just in case something happened and he and the girls were captured too so many queer things had happened on this mountain it was quite likely that if the man got out of philip the fact that he had friends nearby on the mountain he would send to capture them too he took dapple back to the stream putting him in the shade in some long lush grass and near enough the stream to stand in it or drink if he liked dapple liked this kind of life well enough but he stared anxiously all around missing snowy where was his tiny friend snowy will come back soon dapple said jack rubbing his hand up and down the long grey nose you wait and see what are we going to do today asked lucyann when jack came back i dont feel like doing anything now philips gone well would you like to come with me to the steep rocky wall the others went to last night said jack just to see if we can find out how they disappeared so suddenly but if you come well have to keep a jolly good lookout in case were taken by surprise lucyann looked as if she didnt want to come at all but nothing would stop her being with jack if she thought there was any likelihood of danger if they were going to be taken by surprise then she would be there too so taking some tins with them in case they didnt feel inclined to go all the way back to the cave in the heat of the day for a meal the three of them set off kiki flew over their heads annoying the swallows and crying feetafeetit feetafeetit just as they did they took not the slightest notice of her but went on with their flycatching deftly and serenely the three came at last to the little copse of trees where they had swung in the wind the evening before wait here a minute said jack and he leapt up into a tree ill just have a look round to make sure the coast is clear he balanced himself in branches near the top of the tree and swept the countryside around with his glasses not a sound was to be heard except the wind the trees and the birds there was no sign of any human being or of any of the dogs it seems all right said jack when he got down to the foot of the tree again well go come on kiki began to bray like dapple and jack turned on her fiercely kiki stop it just when we want to be quiet bad bird silly bird kiki raised her crest up and down snapped her beak angrily and flew up into a tree it was almost as if she had said all right then if you speak to me like that i wont come with you she sat on a branch sulking keeping one eye on the three children walking towards the wall they reached it and looked upwards it towered up steep and sheer nobody could climb that not even snowy now where were the others when they disappeared said jack about here i think he led the way to an uneven slab of rock hanging down in front of it over the rocky wall was a thick curtain of greenery half bramble half creepers of some kind all matted together the children thought this mass of green was actually growing on the wall in the same way that many other little plants and ferns grew it was only when the wind blew strongly and the curtainlike mass swung backwards and forwards a little that lucyann guessed it wasnt growing out of the wall it was hanging down covering it she caught hold of it it swung back like a curtain behind it was the wall right enough but there was a split in it a great crack that reached up about twenty feet look said lucyann this is a kind of curtain jack and look at the big crack in the wall behind is this where they went yesterday gosh yes they must all have gone quickly behind this curtain of creepers said jack and i thought they had vanished hold it up lucyann lets see the crack i bet they went through that all three passed easily behind the swinging curtain of creeper and bramble they could slip through the crack without any trouble at all once through it they found themselves in an immensely high cave very round and with no roof that could be seen though jack flashed his torch up as far as he could manage its like a hole in the mountain he said it goes up goodness knows how high did the others come in here asked dinah staring upwards where did they go then cant think said jack puzzled i say look here look whats in the middle of the floor i almost went into it he flashed his torch onto the floor of the cave but there was hardly any floor to be seen most of it was taken up by a silent black pool whose surface had no wrinkle or ripple its not a nice pool said lucyann with a shudder this is a most peculiar cave said dinah no roof no floor only a deep pool and no sign of where the others went yesterday there must be some way out said jack quite determined to search until he found it he began to walk all round the cave flashing his torch on it inch by inch but there was no opening anywhere not even a tiny hole the walls were absolutely solid well theres no passage leading out of this cave said jack giving it up he glanced up to the roofless top of the cave the only way is up there but there are no footholds to climb up nothing nobody could possibly climb up these steep walls well then is there a way out through the pool said dinah half in fun jack looked at the black pool no i dont see how that pool can possibly contain a way out of this cave still its the only thing i havent examined ill have a swim in it or wade across but it was too deep to wade jack took two steps and the water came over his knees he stripped off his clothes and plunged in lucyann didnt like it much she watched jack anxiously as he swam across and back cant feel the bottom at all said jack kicking out with his legs must be awfully deep a bottomless pool and a roofless cave sounds queer doesnt it im coming out now the waters icy cold he found his footing almost at the edge of the pool slipped and went in again he reached out to grasp the edge and his hand found something else it felt like a small steeringwheel a foot under the water jack got out and dressed he was shivering too much to do any more investigation till he had some clothes on then he knelt down by the edge of the pool and put his hand in to feel the curious wheellike thing again hold my torch lucyann he commanded theres something queer here lucyann held the torch in trembling fingers what was jack going to find its a little wheel he said why is it here well wheels are meant to turn so ill turn it here goes he turned it to the right it ran easily and then he jumped violently because both the girls screamed loudly and clutched him hard chapter inside the mountain whats the matter shouted jack jumping up whats happened lucyann had dropped the torch in her fright the light went out and they were in darkness she clutched at jack again and startled him something touched me she wept something ran its fingers all down me oh jack what was it yes and me too said dinah in a trembling voice i felt them they touched my shoulder softly and then ran all the way down to my feet what is it jack theres something here lets get out wheres the torch said jack impatiently oh lucyann i hope it isnt broken you idiot dropping it like that he groped about for it on the floor and found it luckily it hadnt rolled into the pool he shook it and the light came on everyone was very thankful now what touched you demanded jack nothing touched me i dont know sobbed lucyann i want to get out of here jack im frightened jack swung his torch round behind the girls he saw something that made him cry out in surprise the girls didnt dare to look they clung to him trembling see what touched you a ropeladder falling down just behind you laughed jack well of all the babies you ought to be ashamed of yourselves dinah pulled herself together at once and forced herself to laugh well fancy that i really did think it was somebody touching me it felt just like it it must just have run down quietly behind you from somewhere up high said jack flashing his torch upwards and following the ladder with the beam as far as he could well you made me jump all right when you yelled i almost went headfirst into the pool it happened when you turned that wheel down there said lucyann still sniffing a little yes a very clever little idea said jack i must say this is a jolly wellhidden entrance to the mountain better even than ali babas cave first theres the green curtain then just a crack in the rock then you come in and see nothing but a black pool and a roofless cave most people would just say how queer and go out again yes they would never never guess about the ladder that comes tumbling down when you turn the wheel hidden so cleverly in the water agreed dinah most ingenious all of it somebody with brains lives in this mountain yes said jack thoughtfully brains that work and produce minor earthquakes and crimson smoke and plan for landinggrounds for helicopters on mountaintops and keep packs of alsatians that would terrorise anyone roaming too near the mountain very remarkable brains i wonder exactly what those brains are after the girls stared at him in the dimlylit cave with the black pool glinting up at them jack sounded very serious he felt serious too there was something very strange about all this something very clever much too clever what could be going on he stared up the ladder he felt very much inclined to go up it he longed to see what was inside this mountain and he wanted to find philip again too then a hollow voice made them all jump violently naughty boy pifflebunk its kiki said jack relieved you wretched bird you made me jump what do you think of this cave kiki pifflebunk repeated kiki and made a noise like a mowingmachine it sounded terrible in that roofless cave the noise seemed to go up and up endlessly kiki enjoyed the sound she began all over again be quiet said jack goodness knows what will happen if your noises arrive at the top of this ladder and somebody hears them youre not going up are you jack asked lucyann afraid as she saw jack place a foot on the lowest rung of the ropeladder yes ill just go up to the top and see whats there and come down again said jack i dont expect therell be anyone on guard because nobody would ever dream of us guessing the secret of getting the ladder down you two go out into the sunshine and wait for me no were coming too said lucyann they had lost philip she wasnt going to lose jack so she and dinah began to climb up behind him the ladder was well made and strong it swung to and fro a little as the three of them climbed it up they went and up and up there seemed no end to it im stopping for a rest whispered jack you stop too its frightfully tiring this they clung to the rungs and rested panting a little with their long climb lucyann didnt like to think how far away the foot of the cave was nor did she like to think how far away the top of the ladder was they went on again it was pitch dark for jack had put away his torch needing both hands to climb with lucyann began to feel that she was in a peculiarly horrid nightmare one in which she would have to climb ladders in the dark until she awoke in the morning i say i can see a dim sort of light now whispered jack i believe we must be coming to the top dont make any noise they got to the top just as lucyann felt that her arms would not hold on to the ladder any longer as jack said there was a dim light there he climbed off on to a rocky floor and the girls followed they all lay panting for a few minutes unable even to look round and see where they were jack recovered first he sat up and gazed round him he was in a little chamber lighted by a dim lamp big stone jugs full of what looked like water stood at the back with mugs near by jacks eyes gleamed just what they wanted after their terrible climb he fetched a jug and three mugs and the three of them drank deeply of the icecold water now i feel better said jack with a sigh he put back the jug and mugs there was nothing else to see in the room at all at the far end was an open passageway leading into the heart of the mountain jack went to it lucyann called softly to him jack arent you coming back you said youd only go to the top and look well im looking said jack theres a narrow passage here come and see i wonder where it leads to the girls went to see jack wandered along a little way and the girls followed not liking to be left alone they came to another dim lamp set on a rocky shelf in the passage wall jack went on and on following the winding passage coming to lamp after lamp that lighted the way come back now whispered lucyann pulling at his sleeve weve gone far enough but jack felt that he couldnt possibly go back now why he might meet philip round the next corner so on he went they came to a forking of the passage which suddenly divided into three the children stopped wondering where the three passages led to they all looked exactly the same to them and then out of one passage capered somebody they knew very well indeed it was snowy the kid was as delighted to see them as they were to see him he butted them all rubbed his nose into their hands and bleated joyfully jack felt pleased well follow snowy he said to the girls hell lead us to philip so they let the little kid dance in front of them leading the way he led them down the passage into a vast halllike cave into another passage and then to their great surprise they came to a most amazing place it was like a vast laboratory a workroom set in the heart of the mountain it lay below them and they had to lean over a little gallery to look at it what is it whispered lucyann awed at the amount of queer things there there was no enormous machinery only a vast network of gleaming wires great glass jars standing together crystal boxes in which sparks and flames shot up and down and rows upon rows of silently spinning wheels that shone queerly as they spun the wires ran from these all over the place in the middle of the workroom shone a curious lamp it had many sides and it glowed first one colour and then another sometimes it was so dazzling that the children could hardly look at it sometimes it died down to a faint red green or blue glow it seemed alive a monster eye that watched over everything in that secret laboratory the children gazed fascinated there was nobody there at all everything seemed to work on its own never stopping the wheels spun round the wires gleamed and nothing made any noise beyond a very quiet humming and then and then there began that faint faroff rumbling they knew so well far below the laboratory deep deep down came a stirring and a groaning as something happened in the depths of the mountain then as had happened before the mountain quivered a little and shook as if something tremendous had happened deep underground the great lamp in the middle suddenly grew bright so bright that the children crouched back afraid it grew crimson the brightest crimson they had ever seen in their lives it began to belch out tiny puffs of crimson smoke jack began to choke he pushed the girls back into the passage and they breathed the fresher air there in relief snowy frightened crouched against them thats the smoke we saw coming out of a hole in the side of the mountain whispered jack there must be a chimneypipe built from that lamp right away up the mountain to that hole where the smoke can escape whats going on do you think asked dinah in awe whats all that wire for and the crystal boxes and things i havent the least idea said jack but its plain that its something very secret or theyd never do all this here in this lonely inaccessible place atom bombs or something do you think asked lucyann with a shiver oh no you want enormous buildings for that said jack no its something queer and unusual i should think lets go back and peep they went back but everything was just as it had been the wheels spinning silently the crystal boxes sparking and flaming up and down inside the great lamp watching like an eye now crimson now blue now green now orange lets go round the gallery and see where it goes to whispered jack i feel as if im in some sort of aladdins cave now the slave of the ring might appear at any moment they wandered on and came to another extraordinary place it was really only a highroofed cave but it was made into a great sumptuous hall with flights of steps leading up to what looked like a throne beautiful hangings hung down the avails from the roof which glittered with shining lamps shaped like stars the floor was laid with a golden carpet and ranged on each side were beautiful chairs the children stared in astonishment whatevers all this whispered dinah does some king live here the king of the mountain chapter philip again its queer theres nobody about at all said jack staring round at the silent hall not a soul to be seen i wonder where everyone is all those wheels and wires and things whirring away busily by themselves with nobody to see to them and now this great empty place with its throne and gorgeous hangings jack said dinah pulling at his sleeve cant we find philip now and rescue him weve only got to go back through those long passages and down the ropeladder snowy will take us to philip and we can take him safely to the entrance of the mountain yes thats a good idea said jack he fondled the little white kid by his side wheres philip he whispered and gave snowy a push you show us snowy snowy butted jack gently he didnt seem to know what the boy meant jack gave it up after a bit well wait and see if snowy goes off by himself he said if he does well follow him so they waited snowy soon became restive and set off down the big hall past the great throne the children followed cautiously keeping by the walls as far in the shadows as possible snowy disappeared through some deep red curtains the children peeped through them on the other side was what looked like a small library books lined the walls the children looked at the titles curiously they hardly understood what any of them meant most of them were in foreign languages and all of them looked very learned and difficult scientific books said jack come on snowy has gone through that opening they followed him he saw that they were coming and waited for them they hoped he was taking them to philip he was he led them upwards through a curiously rounded tunnellike passage lit at intervals by the same kind of dim lamps they had seen in the first passages it was weird going along in the halfdark not able to see very far in front or behind snowy trotted in front like a little white ghost they passed big openings filled with what looked like stores of some kind boxes chests packages of all kinds were there flung in higgledypiggledy jack paused to examine some they had foreign labels on most of them one had been opened showing tins of food look said jack its what i said they have their food brought here by the helicopter i expect i wonder what in the world theyre up to they came to some steps hewn out of the rock itself these led upwards rather steeply in a spiral snowy bounded up lightly but the others panted as they went up and up twisting and turning with the spiral of the stairway they came to a door set fast in the side of the stone stairway it was a stout wooden door with great bolts on the outside snowy stopped beside this door and bleated loudly then the childrens hearts jumped and they heard a familiar voice snowy im still here i cant get to you snowy but never mind thats philip said jack he knocked gently on the door philip its us were going to undo the bolts of this door there was an astonished exclamation and the sound of feet running across to the door then philips excited voice came through the door eager and thrilled gosh jack is it really you can you let me out jack shot the bolts back they were well oiled and went back easily philip pulled him into the space beyond as soon as the door was open the girls followed too with snowy jack how did you get here ive been shut in this strange place with that negro look there he is over there he sleeps most of the time hes the one the dogs were after sure enough there was the negro lying against the side of the cave fast asleep jack and the girls looked round philips prison in wonder it was nothing but a cave in the side of the top of the mountain it opened onto the sky or so it seemed at first the children could see nothing but a vast expanse of blue when they gazed out of the opening opposite to the door its almost at the top this cave said jack isnt it a miraculous view you can see right over the tops of the mountains yonder ive never been so high in my life before it makes me quite giddy to look out for long dinah stepped to the edge of the cave but philip pulled her back no dont go too near theres an almost sheer drop there and if you look down it makes you feel very queer as if youre on top of the world and might fall any minute hold my hand then while i look said dinah and jack wanted to see too lie down on the floor of the cave and look out of it that way said philip you feel safer then so all four lay down and peered over the edge of the cave that was almost at the top of the mountain it certainly gave them a queer feeling far far down below were the slopes of the mountain and far below that the valley lucyann clutched philip tightly she felt as if she was toppling over downwards but she wasnt of course she was safe on the floor of the cave it was just the terrific feeling of height that made her think she must be falling down and down i dont like it she said and came away from the edge the others were awed they gazed until they too felt that they were going to fall and then they pushed themselves back and sat up come with us quickly said jack to philip we know the way out and snowy will guide us if we dont we must go while theres a good chance the whole place seems deserted its most peculiar well the men live on the very top of the mountain said philip the negro has been telling me quite a lot this cave is very near the top so near that i can sometimes hear men talking and laughing there must be a plateau on the summit or some kind of flat place because the helicopter lands there oh well i suppose everyone must be up on the mountaintop then said jack we didnt meet a soul coming up here come on lets go philip dont lets waste a minute we can tell each other everything when were safely out of this extraordinary mountain they all went to the door and then jack pushed the others back quickly he shut the door quietly and put his finger to his lips i can hear voices so could the others loud voices that were coming nearer their door would the owners of the voices spot that the bolts were undone the voices came nearer and nearer and then passed evidently nobody had looked at the bolts of the door the children breathed again thank goodness theyve gone past said jack shall we wait for a few minutes and then run for it no wait till the men come back and go up to the roof said philip i think they are only the paratroopers gone to get some stores to take up to the top everyone stared at him paratroopers said jack in amazement what do you mean why should there be paratroopers here the negro told me his names sam said philip nodding towards the sleeping negro lets wait till those fellows come back with their stores or whatever theyve gone to fetch i dont think theyll even look at this door they dont know im here well for goodness sake tell us all about everything then said jack filled with intense curiosity paratroopers it sounds impossible well you know when i was caught dont you began philip they took me to that steep wall behind a thick screen of creeper and in at an opening there i was pushed up some kind of ladder in the dark a ropeladder i should think and we went up for ages and ages the others nodded they knew all about that we went through long passages and came to a jolly frightening place with wheels and things did you see it too yes most extraordinary but there was no one there said jack i didnt have time to see much said philip then we went round a gallery the one that looks down on that place of wheels and wires and sparks and flames and came into a most magnificent place like a room out of a palace yes we saw it too a room for a king with throne and all said jack but nobody there well then i was pushed up passages and steps to this cave said philip and i was bolted in and here ive stayed ever since the negro was pushed in too but poor little snowy was bolted out hes come and bleated outside my door dozens of times i hated that he sounded so lost and miserable snowy was very happy now however he was curled up on philips knee occasionally butting him gently to get a little more attention ive had food pushed in through the door all tinned stuff said philip but nobodys said a word to me not even that nasty foreignlooking fellow who caught me you should see his eyes you often read in books about people with piercing eyes well hes really got them they go right through you i was glad he didnt question me much because i felt as if hed know everything by reading my very thoughts the others had been listening intently jack nodded towards the sleeping negro what did he tell you oh a lot of peculiar things said philip he said he saw an advertisement in the paper asking for men who had been paratroopers you know men who are trained to jump out of planes high in the air and parachute to earth yes go on said jack impatiently well the hawkeyed man the one who captured me he goes by the name of meier by the way interviewed him at some office in mexico and offered him a terrific sum of money if hed come and try some new kind of parachutejumping what kind asked dinah i dont exactly know sam sounded a bit muddled when he told me or else i didnt understand him said philip its something to do with flying through the air on wings wings fixed to his arms apparently you cant possibly fall to earth when youve got these wings on and you can guide yourself where and how you like just as birds do thats impossible said jack at once quite mad yes thats why i think sam got hold of the wrong idea said philip well this fellow meier engaged a whole lot of exparatroopers paid them fabulous sums and brought them here in helicopters to the top of this mountain and their job is to try out these wings or so sam says has he tried them asked jack no but three of his mates have they had these queer wings fitted to their arms and were given orders to jump from the helicopter at a given moment or else be pushed out said philip what happened asked jack sam doesnt know answered philip you see none of his mates came back hes pretty certain they fell to their death he didnt want to do the same so he got away chapter a little exploring there was a long pause after this strange story it was very hard to believe and yet they had seen and heard such strange things the last few days that they felt anything might be true of this lonely mountain but whats the idea asked jack after a while and why all the wheels and wires and things i just dont get the hang of it all nor do i but sam reckons that if the experiment came off and men could really fly with these wings somebody would make a most colossal fortune said philip everyone would want them everyone would fly it sounds lovely said lucyann i should love to fly like the birds do much much better than going in an aeroplane they all felt the same but nobody could really believe in these wings that sam had talked of how did he escape asked jack nodding at the black man he did an absolutely mad thing as dangerous as jumping off a helicopter to try the wings said philip he got a parachute out of the stores came in here fitted it on and jumped everyone shuddered what jumped out of this cave right from the top of the mountain said jack gosh hes a brave man he is his parachute opened and he floated down to earth landing with an awful bump but hed learnt how to fall and he soon recovered the next thing was to find safety somewhere he couldnt have found a lonelier more deserted bit of country than in these mountains said jack i suppose he didnt even know where he was he hadnt the faintest idea said philip i told him we were in wales but he didnt know there was such a place and then the dogs got after him i suppose said jack poor sam yes he knew about them because they live up on the mountaintop with the men he says theyre used to scare any possible wanderer who comes near this mountain and of course to hunt anyone who does escape or find anyone who crashes if the wings dont work thats more likely said jack gosh what a horrible callous lot of men there must be behind all this i never heard of anything like it in my life sam says theres a king said philip the king of the mountain isnt it incredible that throne must be for him sams never seen him he must be the spider at work catching all these fellows and making them try out his mad experiments we thought there was some colossal brain behind all this said jack i suppose that hawkeyed man meier isnt the king is he oh no i dont know what youd call him sort of organiser i suppose he sees to everything the stores all the arrangements shuts up the men when the helicopter arrives and so on there are two men apparently who work together on these things the king is somebody who only appears on state occasions such as when another pair of wings is produced and the men have to go down to that great stateroom listen to some harangue they dont understand and watch one of their number being picked to try out the wings picking out a victim for sacrifice it sounds like said jack grimly i dont like this at all its so mad sam was ill the last time the king picked out his victims said philip so he hasnt seen the king of the mountain as i said he must be a queer sort of chap really callous and cruel to make these fellows try out wings that cant possibly be any good i agree with you said jack and i think the sooner we get out of here and get into touch with old bill the better i dont feel safe in this mountain no wonder lucyann got feelings about it ive got quite a lot of feelings about it myself now look sams waking up said lucyann they all looked at the negro he sat up and rubbed his eyes he looked across the cave and seemed surprised to see so many children then he recognised lucyann as the little girl who had seen him up in the tree he smiled and then shook his head i done told you go way said sam looking solemn bad mountain dis bad men too were going now sam said philip as soon as we think its safe will you come too we know the way out sam looked frightened sam fraid of the dogs he said i safe here youre not i bet youll be the very next one chosen to try out the wings you told me about said philip wings better dan dogs said sam voices came past the door the children fell silent and listened till they had gone past sam listened too dat pete and jo he said well pete and jo have gone up to the mountaintop again said jack come on it seems a good time to go now we didnt meet anyone coming here and the chances are we shant meet anyone going back what a tale well have to tell bill they opened the door cautiously snowy bounded out at once kiki was on jacks shoulder having kept silence for a surprisingly long time she did not seem to like this peculiar mountain they went quietly down the spiral stairway following its many turns round and round they came to the openings where the stores were kept it made them feel very hungry to see all the tins of food but there was no time to think of eating now they had to escape as quickly as possible snowy led them down the dimlylit passages the children expected to see the curious library of books at the end of them but snowy had apparently taken them a different way they stopped after a while in dismay i say this isnt right we didnt see that cave there before im sure we didnt said jack they hesitated not knowing whether to go on or go back it would be awful to get lost in the heart of that mountain i can hear some kind of noises said lucyann listening lets creep on and see what they are they went on down a wide passage that at times ran very steeply downhill the air suddenly grew hot phew said philip mopping his forehead i can hardly breathe they came out on a kind of balcony that overlooked a great deep pit so vast that it took the childrens breath away far down in the middle of it men were at work though what they were doing the children couldnt possibly tell they were as small as ants great lamps lit up the pit the children gazed in astonishment what could be going on down there suddenly jack nudged philip look the men have slid aside the floor of the pit do you see whats that under it philip might well ask out of the hole in the pit floor shone a brilliant mass of colour but a colour the children did not know it was not blue or green not red or yellow not any colour they had ever seen before they gaped at it in surprise then suddenly they felt a queer feeling a feeling of lightness as if they were in a dream and not quite real they clutched the balcony rail afraid at the same moment the men down below slid the great floor over the hole in the pit again and shut out the brilliant mass of unknown colour at once the strange feeling passed away from the children and they were themselves once more they felt a little weak lets go said jack scared i dont like this but before they could go there began that now familiar tumbling noise from the very depths of the mountain the children clung to one another it was so much louder now that they were inside the mountain it was louder than thunder an angry unearthly noise then the balcony they were on began to shake jack took one last look down into the strange pit the men had disappeared probably hidden safely behind rocky walls jack caught lucyanns hand and fled after him came philip and dinah kiki clung to jacks shoulder more scared than any of them snowy had disappeared completely the four children tore up the steep wide passage that had led them down to the pit the floor of it shook beneath their feet as they ran the children felt sure that the whole of the great mountain was shaking what powers were being used by these men surely they must have discovered some scientific secret unknown to anyone before the children did not stop running until they came to the end of the uphill passage they were streaming with perspiration and panting loudly snowy suddenly joined them and pressed against philips legs all four children sank down in a heap and snowy walked over them unheeded for goodness sake lets get out of here said philip at last i daresay if we were scientists we shouldnt be a bit scared only intensely interested but all i can say is lets get out of here everyone agreed heartily the only thing was which was the way they got up and walked along a twisty little passage it forked into two after a bit and the children not knowing which to take took the righthand one it led them to a celllike cave with a narrow bed in it a jug and basin and a shelf nothing more funny said jack i expect it belongs to meier or one of the other men lets go back they went back to where the passage forked and took the lefthand way to their great surprise they came to hanging curtains of purple silk patterned with great red dragons they stopped philip put his hand on snowy to prevent him from darting forward jack crept to the curtains on tiptoe beyond was a cave so beautifully decorated so profusely hung with curtains and spread with thick carpets that it didnt seem like a cave at all a couch stood in one corner covered with a purple silk quilt worked with the same red dragons as on the curtains they had seen jack stared perhaps this was where the king slept it felt deliciously cool there where did the little cooling draught come from he saw a narrow rod hanging on the wall near him with slits in it all the way along he put his hand up and felt a draught of air how astonishing it was only a rod fixed to the wall how could fresh air come out of it again jack felt that there were remarkably ingenious brains at work in this mountain he heard voices from a room further on whose opening was hidden by the same kind of purple curtains that hung in other places he tiptoed back to the others well wait for a bit theres somebody talking in the room beyond this one this is the kings bedroom i should think they waited peeping through the curtains every now and then they all began to feel terribly hungry they were very relieved when the voices stopped and there was silence they tiptoed through the bedroom and into the room beyond they stopped in delight not at the strange beauty of the room but at the gorgeous food on the table chapter the king of the mountain look at that said jack somebodys been having a meal here three people and look at what theyve left cant we have some said lucyann eyeing a great bowl of fresh strawberries and a jug half full of cream nearby was a plate of cooked lobsters and two dishes of mixed salads it was clear that three people had been having a meal there judging by the plates and glasses all of which were really beautiful i call this a feast a royal feast said dinah and she picked up a cake with cream icing on the top in the shape of a rose and dug her teeth into it i dont know who this stuff belongs to but theres nobody to ask permission to share it and im too hungry to wait so am i well get bill to pay for it if anyone objects said jack and set to work on a lobster there were dishes of things the children had never seen before they tasted one or two but they were spiced in a way they disliked there were peaches and nectarines pineapples and plums of all kinds the helicopter must be pretty busy bringing all these said philip biting into the sweetest peach he had ever tasted in his life i must say the king of this mountain does himself proud nobody came to interrupt them at all kiki feasted well enjoying the food as much as the children snowy ate all the salad offered him and for a treat was allowed to be on philips knee with his forefeet on the table he badly wanted to get on the table itself and could not understand why kiki was allowed there when he wasnt if you eat any more kiki youll get the hiccups properly said jack stuffing yourself like that greedy pop goes polly agreed kiki and would have given a cackle of laughter if jack hadnt shushed her well what about trying to find our way out again said jack at last i dont know whether its anything to do with that queer feeling we had when the floor of the big pit was pushed back and we saw that extraordinary mass of brilliance below but i feel rather dontcarish now not scared any more i dont even feel that its terribly urgent to get out of here though i know it is it was a very queer feeling said philip i thought i was going to float up into the air the next minute i hung onto that balcony for dear life they had all felt the same and now they felt as jack did very dontcarish but that wouldnt do at all it was imperative that they should find their way out as soon as possible they left the curious diningroom with its laden table and went into a passage that was much more brightly lit than the others they had walked down hangings decorated the rocky walls great curtains that swayed a little in the draught that ran through the passages this must be the kings own quarters said jack maybe we shall come to the throneroom soon he was quite right they did but this time the throneroom was not empty it was full men stood there silently there were all kinds and a toughlooking lot they were they were of many nationalities some had the maroon berets that british paratroopers have when in uniform the peeping children thought that probably they were all former paratroopers there were about twenty of them sam was there too and philip gave a little start when he saw him now it would be known that he philip had escaped whoever had gone to bring sam down here would have seen the unbolted door and found that he was gone blow now he would be carefully hunted for and it would be very difficult to escape he nudged jack and pointed out sam to him jack peeping through the curtains that hung before them nodded and frowned the same thought occurred to him as had occurred to philip he debated whether to go off straight away now and try to find the way out but either they would have to go back the way they had just come which obviously would not take them to the entrance they knew or else they would have to go into the throneroom where they would certainly be seen no they would have to stop where they were till this meeting or whatever it was was over besides the paratroopers there were little men who looked like japanese standing in elaborate uniforms down each side of the great hall the throne was empty there was no sign of the man meier but suddenly there came a whispering among the men gathered there the great curtains near the throne were flung back by two japanese and the king of the mountain entered he seemed very tall for he had a great crown that stood up from his head embroidered with glittering stones he wore a rich suit and cloak and looked more like an indian prince at some splendid festival than anything else his yellowish face looked out impassively from below his great crown and a mass of black hair swung down on each side he sat down on the throne beside him stood two men philip was sure that one was meier he didnt know the other but he didnt like the apelike face and enormous burly figure meiers hawklike eyes swept the room he began to speak in a penetrating most incisive voice in a language that the children did not know then he paused and spoke in english the children listened spellbound meier spoke of the king and the wonderful gift he was giving to mankind the gift of flying he spoke of the grand men who were helping them in their experiment the paratroopers willing to try the wings he spoke of the great wealth the men would receive the honours that would be piled on them then he said it all again in a third language and in a fourth he seemed to hypnotize everyone as he spoke jack could not help feeling that a lot he said was sheer nonsense but he couldnt do anything but believe it while he heard it and it was obvious that all the men there drank every word in whether it was spoken in their own language or not what a spellbinder thought jack next volunteers were called for all the men stepped forward at once the king rose and apparently at random picked out two or three he spoke a few inaudible words in an unexpectedly thin reedy voice that didnt seem to go at all with his kingly presence then meier took charge again he said that these men among the first to fly with wings would be sent back to their own countries after the experiment with wealth enough to last them for a lifetime all the others who had tried out the wings were now safely back in their homes and were rich and honoured men i dont think muttered jack to philip remembering what sam had related the king then walked majestically out and meier and the other man followed the japanese ushered the paratroopers away and soon the great throneroom was empty when everyone had gone and there was complete silence jack whispered to philip we know the way out from here come on they went to the huge laboratory where the wheels and wires were still at their secret work the children stood in the gallery above the big workroom and looked down at the strange lamp in the middle dinah suddenly clutched jack and made him jump he looked at her she pointed to where there was a great cluster of glass jars with tubes running from one to the other jack saw somebody there it was an old man with a very large forehead larger and rounder than any forehead jack had seen in his life the man was quite bald which made his head seem queerer than ever he bent over the glass jars and looked searchingly into them come on before he sees us whispered jack and pulled the others towards the passages that would lead them to the entrance they went along them and at last came to the little chamber where the pitchers of water and the mugs were now to get down the ropeladder and escape what about snowy whispered dinah how can we get him down i wonder how he got up before said philip and the dogs too i never thought of that i was just pushed up in the dark and i was so scared i didnt think of snowy or the dogs they couldnt have climbed that ladder theres probably some hole somewhere that they went into said dinah a hole outside i mean too small for us but big enough for snowy and the dogs as it turned out afterwards dinah was right there was a small hole near the crack and it was through this and up a narrow little tunnel that snowy had passed with the dogs who knew the way very well the dogs tunnel led eventually into one of the passages and that was how snowy had got into the mountain but had not been imprisoned with philip snowy was still with them he knew the way he had come in by but he wasnt going to leave the others jack switched on his torch and felt about for the ropeladder where is the wretched thing he said surely it was just here snowy came and pressed close to him and nearly sent him headlong down to the black pool hold snowy he said to philip i almost went over then i cant seem to find the ladder it should be hanging down somewhere about here let me look said philip giving snowy to dinah he felt about too and jack flashed his torch all round and about to see if he could spy the ropeladder up which they had all come but it wasnt there or if it was nobody could see it jack flashed his torch down into the hole as far as he could no ladder at all whats happened to it he said exasperated perhaps someone has turned that little wheel in the pond the other way and the ladder rolled up and put itself away suggested dinah this was a dreadful thought jack began to look round the little chamber to see if the ropeladder had been pulled up by the machinery set in motion by the wheel but he couldnt see it anywhere his hand touched a spike on the wall he focussed his torch on it this may be a lever he said to the others look he pulled and pressed at the spike and it suddenly gave way pulling downwards a slab of rock was moved smoothly and there behind was the ropeladder how it worked with the wheel below the children could not imagine it certainly wouldnt work for them it was coiled or folded neatly in the hollow behind the rock but how to get it from there nobody could make out some machinery put in motion was needed to set it free then jack supposed it would come sliding smoothly out of the place it was in fall over the edge of the rock and uncoil all the way to the bottom hanging ready for any climber to come up how does it work from up here though said jack for the twentieth time all of them had pulled and twisted and tugged at the ladder lying so snugly in its hidingplace but it was quite impossible to move it give it up said jack gloomily at last no good were done for its absolutely maddening just when we are almost out of this beastly mountain chapter an amazing secret they sat in the little room for some time disappointed and puzzled time and again they tried to make the ropeladder slide out of its secret place but it wouldnt in the end they got very thirsty and very hungry they drank all the water left in the jugs and wondered where they could get something to eat they could only think of the room where they had feasted before lets go back to it and see if the remains of that meal are still there said jack i could do with another lobster or two poor polly remarked kiki who always seemed to know when food was being talked about pollys got a cold send for the doctor oh youve found your tongue again have you said jack i thought youd lost it now dont start screaming or cackling for goodness sake or youll have us caught they found their way back to the throneroom which was still empty and then to the room where the meal had been there were still the remains of the meal there the childrens eyes gleamed good they felt better at once they sat down and reached for the food then suddenly jack put his hand on philips arm and frowned a noise had come from the next room the beautifully furnished bedroom the children sat as still as mice was anybody there kiki suddenly saw snowy with her front hooves on the table reaching for the salad in anger she flew at the kid and screeched thats done it said jack and as he spoke the hangings at the entrance to the room opened and a face peered through it was the face they had seen down in the big workroom the face with the enormous forehead it had bulging eyes of a curious greenblue a hooked nose and sunken cheeks yellowish in colour this face stared in silence at the four children and they in turn stared back without a word who was this strange old man with the great forehead do i know who you are asked the face a puzzled look coming over it i forget i forget the curtains were swung further apart and the old man came right through he was dressed in a kind of loose tunic of blue silk and the children thought he looked a pathetic old thing he had a thin high voice that kiki immediately copied the old man looked astonished especially as he could not see kiki who was behind a great vase of flowers the children didnt say anything they were wondering if it was possible to make a dash and get away what are children doing here said the old man in a puzzled tone have i seen you before why are you here er we came to look for somebody who was lost said jack and now we cant get out again could you tell us the way the old man appeared so lost and wandering that it seemed to jack he might quite well be foolish enough to show them the way out but he was wrong oh no oh no said the old fellow at once a cunning look coming over his yellow face there are secrets here you know my secrets nobody who comes in may go out until my experiments are finished im the king of this place my brain runs it all he finished up on a high shrill note that gave the children a queer feeling was the old fellow mad surely he couldnt be the king they had seen in the throneroom you dont look like the king said lucyann we saw the king in the throneroom he was tall and had a great crown and black hair round his face ah yes they make me appear like that said the old man i want to be king of the world you know the whole world because of my great brain i know more than anyone else meier says i shall be ruler of the world as soon as my experiments are done and they are nearly finished very very nearly does meier dress you up like a king then when you appear in the throneroom asked jack astonished he turned to the others and spoke in an undertone thats to impress the paratroopers i suppose he wouldnt cut any ice with them if they saw him like this i am a king said the old man with dignity because of my great brain you know i have a secret and i am using it you have seen my great laboratory have you ah my little children i know how to use all the great powers of the world the tides the metals the winds and gravitation whats gravitation said lucyann it is the power that keeps you on the earth that makes you come back to it when you jump that brings a ball back when you have thrown it said the old man but i i have conquered gravitation this seemed a lot of nonsense to the children they were quite sure the poor old man was mad he might have had a marvellous brain at one time but he couldnt be much good now you dont believe me said the old fellow well i have discovered some rays that repel the pull of the earth do you understand that my little children no no it is too difficult for you its not said jack interested what you mean is you think youve got hold of some rays that if we use them will cancel out gravitation so that if you used the rays say on a ball it wouldnt feel the pull of the earth to bring it back here but would speed through the air and not fall to earth yes yes that is it very very simply said the old man and now you see i have invented these wings i send the rays through them i imprison them in the wings and then when a man jumps from an aeroplane he presses a button to release the power of the rays and he does not fall to earth instead he can glide and soar flap his wings and fly like a bird until he tires of it then he can imprison the rays again and glide to earth the children listened to all this in silence it was the most extraordinary thing they had ever heard but is it really true asked lucyann at last the idea of flying like that was very tempting do you think we would have come here to this lonely mountain for our experiments do you think meier and erlick would have poured out their money if they had not known i could do this demanded the old man looking rather angry well it just sounds so extraordinary thats all said lucyann it sounds perfectly lovely of course i mean id give anything to be able to fly like that how clever you must be i have the biggest brain in the world said the old man solemnly i am the greatest scientist that ever lived i can do anything anything could you show us the way out of here asked jack in an innocent voice the old man looked uncomfortable if you use my wings then you can go he said at last we are all prisoners here till then even i meier has said this must be so he says i must hurry hurry to get my wings quite perfect time is short then i shall be made king of the whole world and everyone will honour me poor old man thought philip he believes everything that rogue of a meier says meier and erlick are using his brains for their own purposes as suddenly as he had appeared the old man went he seemed to forget they were there he vanished through the curtains and left them alone they looked at one another feeling uneasy i dont know how much to believe said jack has he really got hold of the secret of how to cancel out the pull of gravitation do you remember how queer we felt when we were looking at that extraordinarily brilliant mass down in that pit we felt sort of light as if we ought to cling onto the balcony or wed float off into the air well i bet some of those rays he spoke of were flying loose then gosh yes that was strange said philip thoughtfully and of course all this would have to be done underground so that the rays couldnt go flying off everywhere the heart of a mountain seems a jolly good place for a terrific experiment like this avails of thick rock all round no wonder we heard rumblings and felt the earth shaking that old scientist knows a thing or two id be scared stiff to meddle with all the powers that scientists use nowadays this is more extraordinary than splitting the atom i dont understand about things like that said lucyann i feel like the people of old must have felt towards their magicians i dont understand what theyre doing but it all seems like magic and im scared you wait till you put on a pair of nongravitation wings or whatever he calls them said philip helping himself to a peach thatll be magic if you like meier and erlick must believe in the ideas the old man has said jack or they wouldnt go to all the terrific trouble they do and try to keep everything such a secret i suppose if the idea really came to something theyd make such a colossal fortune that theyd be the richest men the world has ever known and the most powerful yes theyd be the rulers not the old man said philip theyre just using him and stuffing him up with all kinds of stories hes as simple as can be though hes got such a brain they would give out that they were the inventors not the old man fancy keeping him a prisoner here like that and everyone else too us included said dinah well im beginning to see daylight a bit now understanding whats going on here but i just cant believe it nor will bill they finished a very good meal nobody came to interrupt them there was no sound from the old mans room the children thought perhaps he had gone to bed for a rest or had returned to his weird underground pit they all made up their minds that nothing would persuade them ever to go down there again what shall we do now said jack snowy tell us kiki youve had enough peaches poor polly said kiki sorrowfully and wiped her beak on the tablecloth someones coming suddenly said lucyann quick hide behind the hangings on the wall whispered dinah and the four children fled to the loose hangings they squeezed behind them and waited holding their breath it was two of the japanese who had entered the room to clear away the meal they talked to one another in surprised voices and indeed they were filled with astonishment to see so much of the food eaten the children heard their little feet pattering to and fro then one of them gave a sharp exclamation which the children didnt understand they stood behind the curtains their hearts beating fast kiki was on jacks shoulder silent and puzzled suddenly lucyann gave a loud scream and the two boys leapt out from behind their curtains at once one of the japanese had seen her foot below the hangings and had pounced on her jack philip quick save me she cried and they rushed to her rescue chapter on the mountaintop both the japanese had got hold of poor lucyann she was screaming wildly and the two boys flew at the men but to their great surprise they were thrown back as easily as if they had been featherweights just a twist of the mens arms and back they went falling headlong to the floor they were up again in a trice but this time one of the japanese caught philip in a vicious grip and the boy found himself turning over in the air and flying right over the mans head he landed with a crash on the table and sent all the dishes into the air what with lucyanns screams the boys yells and the crashes of the dishes there was a terrific commotion kiki added to it by screeching loudly then she flew down and attacked one of the men he fended her off four more japanese suddenly appeared and that was the end of the childrens resistance they were all captured kiki flew off somewhere still screeching snowy had disappeared completely the four children were marched out of the room and taken to a bigger room well furnished but not nearly so elaborate as the kings rooms hangings covered the walls but they were plain and simple the roof of the cave was not covered and the children could see the rough rock above their heads lucyann was sobbing dinah looked very pale and the boys were angry and defiant they were all stood in a row against the wall philip felt in his pocket to see if his slowworm was hurt in the scuffle sally slithery had not liked life in the mountain she had become lethargic and dull but she would not leave philip she was still there coiled up philip wondered where kiki and snowy were it was not like kiki to fly off like that she must have been very scared or perhaps one of the dishes had struck her as it flew off the table in a few minutes meier and erlick the two men who were the real power behind the poor old king came into the room meier was glowering and his piercing eyes glanced from one child to another sharply so there are four of you three of you came to find this boy i suppose and let him out of the cave he was in you thought you could all escape you thought it would be easy so easy and it was not he fired this question at them with a twisted smile on his hawklike face nobody answered how did you find the way to let down the ropeladder the man fired this question at them so suddenly that they jumped who told you how to get it down nobody said a word meiers eyes began to narrow and the girls felt uneasy he was horrid i asked you a question he said you boy answer me i used my brains said jack shortly seeing meier looking at him does anyone else know of that entrance said erlick suddenly the children looked at him with dislike he was like an ape they thought meier was bad enough but erlick was ten times worse how do we know said philip beginning to boil at the way these two men spoke to them what does it matter if they do is what youre doing here so shameful that you need to hide even the entrance to the mountain erlick stepped forward and slapped philip across the face lucyann stopped crying in greater fright than ever philip did not flinch he looked the man boldly in the face and did not even rub his smarting cheek leave him alone erlick said meier there are better ways of bringing a boy like that to heel than by slapping his face and now we will send out the dogs to scour the countryside if these children have friends anywhere near the dogs will find them and bring them in the childrens hearts sank would the alsatians capture bill and david then and bring them to the mountain to make them prisoners too that would be dreadful from somewhere outside came a hollow cough meier and erlick jumped meier went to the entrance of the cave and looked out there was nobody there at all is there another of you asked meier is it boy or girl neither said jack who had recognised kikis cough and was hoping she would keep out it would be just like these men to wring her neck pooh gah came kikis voice and then a cackle that was enough to make the mens blood curdle they went to the entrance of the cave again and had a good look round but kiki was safely perched on a shelf of rock above their heads and they could not see her at all send for the doctor said kiki in a sepulchral voice that sent shivers down the mens backs send for the doctor good heavens who is it said erlick he looked threateningly at the four children if thats another boy out there being funny ill skin him alive there are only four of us two boys and two girls said jack and here we all are said philip in an insolent voice he knew it was foolish to talk like this to the two men but he couldnt help it both he and dinah were foolhardy when their tempers were up oh and here youll all stay said meier and ill think up something to take the spirit out of you my boy you may have gone through your life cheeking everyone and throwing your weight about but you wont do it with me now walk in front of us and keep going the children were forced to walk out of the cave in front of the two men they soon found themselves stumbling up the stone spiral stairs going up and up they came to the openings where the stores were and then went on past those till they came to the door of the cave in which philip had been bolted hey you boy youre to go into that cave again ordered meier a few days without much to eat will soon take the insolence out of you you others go on up poor philip he was shut once more into the cave that looked out to the sky but this time he had no negro to keep him company he sat down wishing he hadnt been so foolish as to cheek the two grim men then he was glad he had he wasnt going to kowtow to two rogues like that all the same it was a pity he wasnt with the others especially as now there was only jack to look after the girls the other three were forced to go on higher climbing steadily and then what a surprise they came up a broad flight of steps hewn out of the rock onto the very top of the mountain itself they stood there breathing in sharply at the amazing panoramic view all round them the top of the world surely they must be touching the sky itself the three forgot their troubles for a moment as they gazed round in wonder everywhere they looked were mountains rising high valleys deep in shadow lay far far below it was wonderful to be up there in the blazing sunshine and cool breeze after being in the dark mountain for so long the top of the mountain was extraordinarily flat on three sides rose steep rocks like teeth jack knew in a flash what mountain it was fang mountain the one he had noticed when they had set out he looked round the mountaintop nothing grew there at all it was bare flat rock the size of a great courtyard at one side playing cards in the shade were the paratroopers they stared in surprise at the children sam the negro was with them and he pointed to jack and was evidently telling his companions about him and the others jack was glad that philip had told sam so little about himself and the other three he did not want meier to know any more than he already did there was an awning rigged up on the side opposite the paratroopers meier pushed the children towards it you will stay here he said you will not talk to those men over there at all you will not go near them you are prisoners you understand you have forced your way in here where you are not wanted and now we shall keep you here as long as we wish cant philip come with us begged lucyann hell be so lonely away from us is that the other boy no he needs a little punishment said meier a little starvation diet then we will see if he will talk civilly meier and erlick then left the three and disappeared into the mountain again jack and the girls sat down looking doleful things werent too good it was a thousand pities that poor old philip was apart from them evidently the paratroopers had been warned that they were not to go near the children for they made no attempt even to shout to them it was obvious that meier and erlick were used to being obeyed there was a natural parapet of rock near where the children were that ran round the edge of the mountain jack got up and went to it he sat on it and put his fieldglasses to his eyes if only he could spot bill and yet he was afraid that if bill was anywhere below the dogs might set on him and find him he wondered where all the dogs were then he sat up a little straighter on the parapet and focussed the glasses on a small spot on the slope on the mountain he had seen a movement could it be bill and david and the donkeys no it wasnt it was the dogs they had evidently already been let loose and were ranging the countryside if bill was anywhere about they would soon find him blow then bill would be captured too jack wished he knew some way of preventing this happening but he couldnt think of anything he wondered about poor old dapple thank goodness they had tied him up so very loosely he had plenty of range and there was grass and water for him but how the donkey would wonder what had happened to everyone something touched jacks hand and he jumped and looked down it was snowy the kid had found his way to them and was nuzzling jack in a halfscared manner hallo snowy have you been looking for philip said jack rubbing the kids soft nose hes in that cave again you cant get to him snowy knew that very well he had already been to bleat outside philips door he looked so dismal that jack took him to the girls and they all made a fuss over him what do you suppose has happened to kiki asked lucyann after a time oh shell turn up all right said jack she knows how to take care of herself trust kiki for that shes probably leading those two men a fine old dance coughing and sneezing and cackling and making a noise like an express train screeching in a tunnel jack was perfectly right kiki had been playing a fine game with meier and erlick and as they had no idea that the children had a parrot they were two extremely puzzled men a voice without a body to it how very strange nothing happened for some time then when the sun was sinking there came a clamour of howls and barks and the pack of alsatians was brought up to the top of the mountain by two of the japanese the children watched to see if bill had been caught but there was no sign of any prisoner with the dogs they heaved a sigh of relief the dogs were taken to a big wire enclosure some way off from the children you be caleful of dogs said one of the japanese to the children they much bitee you be caleful chapter the helicopter the children however were not in the least afraid of the dogs for had they not all slept together with them some nights back they did not tell this to the japanese of course they waited till the men had disappeared and then they went over to the dogs but philip was not there this time and the dogs did not feel the same towards the girls and jack as they had done towards philip they growled when jack came near to them and one showed his enormous white teeth lucyann and dinah shrank back oh how terribly fierce they look theyve quite forgotten us jack be careful jack was not afraid but he was cautious when he saw that the dogs did not want to be friendly they were strong fierce creatures disappointed in their hunting that day hungry and suspicious of jack now if he had been philip how different their behaviour would have been philips magic touch with animals would have put everything right he had an irresistible attraction for all live creatures come away from them said lucyann when she heard the growling taken up by most of the pack theyre making a perfectly horrible noise just like wolves would im sure they went back to their own part of tho mountain a corner for the dogs a corner for us a corner for the men said jack well i wonder how long were going to be here nobody brought them anything to eat at all for the rest of that day they thought it was a very lucky thing they had had such good meals in the kings room jack wondered if they were supposed to lie on the bare rock to sleep what brutes those men were if they meant to keep them without rugs or food but just as it was getting dark three of the japanese appeared they carried rugs with them which they threw down at the childrens feet one had brought a pitcher of water and mugs what about something to eat asked jack no blingee said one of the men master say no blingee your master no nicee jack told him your master plenty nasty the man said nothing he and the others went away softfooted as cats the children curled up in their rugs wondering how philip was faring alone in his cave the next morning was unbelievably beautiful when the sun rose and lighted up the mountaintops one by one the three children sat on the parapet and watched they all felt very hungry indeed snowy was with them kiki had still not appeared and jack was getting a little worried about her snowy leapt up on to the parapet beside jack there was a very steep drop from there with a tiny ledge of rock jutting out some way below nobody could escape by climbing down that was certain he would just go slipping and sliding down the mountain and break all his limbs in no time snowy stood there his little ears pricked up as if he was listening he suddenly bleated very loudly and then very muffled hardly to be heard a voice answered jack leapt up from the parapet was it philips voice where was his cave then anywhere near where they were lucyann and dinah joined jack seeing his sudden excitement then snowy gave them a really terrible shock he jumped right over the mountaintop off his perch on the parapet of rock oh screamed lucyann hell be killed she wouldnt look to see what happened but dinah and jack watched in horror the little kid had leapt to the tiny ledge of rock jutting out some way below the parapet he landed on it with all four tiny hooves close together there was only just room for them not half an inch to spare he stood balanced there and then when it looked as if surely he must topple off he leapt to a small ledge lower down slithered down a rough bit and disappeared completely gracious goodness what a thing to do said dinah taking a deep breath my heart almost stopped beating is snowy all right asked lucyann still not daring to look apparently anyway hes disappeared and i should think hes probably found the cave where philip is said jack all i hope is he wont try to get back the same way or hell certainly break his neck but snowy did get back the same way and appeared on the parapet about half an hour later looking as frisky as a squirrel and round his neck was a note it was tied there with string jack took it off quickly and opened it how are you getting on im all right except that ive nothing to eat and only water to drink i believe those brutes are going to starve me out can you send snowy with anything for me to eat when you get a meal cheerio philip at that moment the japanese arrived with a meal for the children it was all out of tins but there was plenty with it was a loaf of fresh bread dinah said she thought perhaps the japanese had an oven down in the pit somewhere to bake their bread they waited till the men had gone and then jack debated how to send food to philip he made some sandwiches and wrapped them up firmly in the paper the japanese had brought the bread in he slipped a note inside the sandwiches to say they would send food by snowy whenever they could then he tied the packet very firmly on to snowys back snowy smelt it and tried to reach it but he couldnt now you go to philip again said jack and patted the parapet to show snowy that he wanted him up there as soon as he was up snowy remembered philip and down he went again on his clever little feet landing on first one tiny ledge and then another the other three felt pleased to think that philip was having a meal instead of being starved jack took a look round the countryside below with his fieldglasses as they sat and ate wondering if bill would come that day time was getting on now surely bill would arrive soon the day passed very slowly the paratroopers were taken off into the mountain by the japanese and didnt come back the dogs were also taken out and jack was sure he could see them ranging the countryside again they sent food to philip by snowy each time they had a meal it was a help to exchange cheery notes with him even though nobody felt at all cheerful kiki hadnt yet returned and all the children were now very worried about her the evening came the paratroopers had not come back and the children wondered why the dogs came back however but this time the children did not go over to them the alsatians were fighting over their meat and sounded savage and fierce it was a cloudy sultry evening the children dragged their rugs out from under the awning to a place where the breeze blew more strongly they lay down trying to go to sleep the two girls slept but jack lay wide awake feeling worried about kiki and philip and the girls too he heard a noise far away in the distance and sat up he knew what that was it was a helicopter there was no mistaking the noise now was it coming to the mountain he awoke the two girls dinah lucyann the helicopters coming wake up and lets watch get back under the awning in case it lands too near us the girls dragged their rugs under the awning they went to sit on the parapet and listened wondering if philip was awake and listening too he was he was lying on his tummy looking out of his cave watching and listening it was too dark for him to see anything much but he hoped he might share in the excitement the noise came nearer and at last sounded very loud look there it is said jack excited see going round the mountain a bit above us arent they going to flash a light here to show it where to land as he spoke two of the japanese appeared in a hurry on top of the mountain they ran to the middle of the great rocky courtyard and did something the children could not see immediately a strong light flashed upwards into the sky and in its beam the children saw the helicopter its wheels poised almost above their heads there it is its landing cried jack see how its dropping down slowly almost vertically its just the right sort of machine to land on a mountaintop the helicopter came down to the courtyard and stopped the vanes ceased to whirl above it voices hailed one another its a jolly big helicopter said jack ive never seen such a big one before it must be able to carry quite a large cargo the beam of light was now directed on the helicopter and the children could see what was going on quite clearly boxes and crates were being tumbled out of it onto the ground and the japanese servants were all very busy handling them dragging them about opening some of them and taking the contents down the stone steps to the storeplaces a leanfaced young man with a scar right across his cheek was the pilot of the helicopter with him was a swarthy fellow who limped badly they spoke to the japanese in curt tones and then left their machine and disappeared into the mountain gone to report to meier and erlick i should think said jack come on lets go and have a look at the helicopter wish i knew how to fly it we could escape nicely in it now and hover outside philips cave and take him off too said dinah they all went over to the machine jack got into the pilots seat and felt grand how he wished he knew how to fly the helicopter he was still sitting there when meier erlick the pilot and his companion and one of the paratroopers appeared jack tried to scramble out before he was seen but he was too late meier saw him and dragged him out so roughly that he fell to the ground what are you doing you keep away from this machine shouted meier in a fury jack skipped off to the girls rubbing his shoulder are you hurt jack asked lucyann anxiously he whispered that he was all right then he said something that made the girls stare fearfully at the group of men in the centre of the courtyard i believe that paratrooper is the next one to try those wings theyve brought him up to show him the helicopter and where hes to jump from both the girls thought it would be dreadful to have to leap from a machine high up in the air and trust to the kings extraordinary wings they wondered how many people had tried them and failed nobody would know if they were efficient or not until they had been tried the paratrooper looked the helicopter over thoroughly he talked to the pilot who answered him shortly jack thought that the pilot wasnt any too keen about the jumping part he would probably have been content to fly the goods to the mountain and finish at that tomorrow night you leave said the voice of meier cutting through the night come and eat now leaving two japanese to guard the helicopter from the curiosity of the children the rest of them disappeared into the mountain tomorrow night what would they see then chapter the wonderful wings the three children retired to their rugs they were afraid to go near the helicopter again because the japanese servants they knew would stand no nonsense snowy appeared from over the parapet full of curiosity he ran over to the helicopter but the japanese hit out at him the beasts how can they be cruel to a little kid said jack snowy come here these fellows would make you into soup as soon as look at you youd better be careful oh jack dont say things like that said tenderhearted lucyann would they really surely nobody would ever have the heart to hurt snowy snowy retreated hastily to the children and skipped up and down the parapet as surefooted in the dark as in the daylight the beam of the lamp showed up the helicopter but the rest of the courtyard was in darkness the dogs howled in their enclosure they had not liked the noise the helicopter made and they were uneasy and restless the japanese shouted threateningly to them but the dogs took no notice i dont like this adventure at all said lucyann suddenly in fact i simply hate it i want to get away i want to go back to bill and aunt allie and effans and mrs evans why did we have to find another adventure in these nice peaceful summer holidays it just happens to us said jack something in us attracts them i suppose like animals are attracted to philip some people attract good luck some attract wealth some attract animals some attract adventures well id rather attract something harmless like cats or dogs complained lucyann oh dear i do wish snowy wouldnt keep walking over us when were lying down they fell asleep at last in the morning when they sent some food to philip by snowy they sent a note also telling him all they had seen in the night snowy brought a note back im sorry for that paratrooper i wonder how many theyve used in trying out this mad experiment im glad im not chosen for anything as crazy as that keep your chin up im all right here ive got snowy most of the time and sally slithery is getting so tame she eats out of my fingers she sleeps on a bit of warm rock at the edge of my cave tell snowy not to tread on her when he comes bounding in so long philip the day seemed very long again the dogs were not taken down into the mountain and let loose on the countryside but were exercised round and round the courtyard by the japanese servants the children were glad about that if old bill arrives today the dogs wont be out on the mountainside hell be safe so lets hope he comes not that he can do much if he does he wont know where the entrance is and if he finds it he wont know how to work the ropeladder and theres no other way of getting in lucyann looked very dismal shall we have to stay here all our lives long she asked the others laughed at her no said jack bill will do something but dont ask me what the paratroopers had not appeared again that day not even the one who was supposed to be going to use the wings that night the helicopter stood there in the middle of the courtyard the sun glinting on its motionless vanes evening came the children grew restive the japanese had brought them food as usual but had not said a word what were all the paratroopers doing having a ceremonial feast or something to celebrate their comrades experiment and where oh where was kiki jack was feeling very miserable about her now he turned over and over in his mind all the things that might have happened to her she had never been away from him so long that night the beam shone out again in the courtyard meier erlick three or four servants and the paratrooper appeared followed by the leanfaced scarred pilot and his companion then up the opening stepping out majestically came the king he was dressed in his grand robes and crown and was hardly recognisable as the poor bald old fellow who had talked to the children a day or two back he held himself proudly as he walked to the centre of the courtyard behind came four japanese servants carrying a box they laid it down at the kings feet in silence he stooped down and opened it he took out a pair of wings they glittered like gold and were shaped like a birds outstretched wings big and wide lucyann gasped in delight oh look dinah real wings arent they lovely the king was speaking to the amazed paratrooper these will hold you up when you jump press this button here as soon as you leap from the helicopter then you will find that you cannot fail you will no longer feel the pull of the earth you will be free and light as air then you may use the wings for guiding yourself for planing for soaring whatever you wish doesnt it sound marvellous whispered lucy ann drinking in every word the wings must be fitted to your arms said the king hold out your arms and i will fix them on here is this all im going to have to stop me falling said the paratrooper you will not need anything else said the king in these wings are imprisoned powerful rays at the press of the button they are released and shoot towards the earth preventing its pull on you you cannot fall but when you want to come to earth press the button once more and you will glide down gently as the earth exerts her pull on you once more yes but look here i understood it was a new kind of parachute i was trying out said the paratrooper see i didnt think it was stuff and nonsense like this it is not nonsense man said meiers curt voice it is a great invention by the greatest scientist in the world you will find erlick and me waiting for you to come to earth when you have flown a mile or two we shall take the dogs and find you then riches for you and honour for the rest of your life one of the pioneer flyingmen look here im a heavy chap began the paratrooper again see those flimsy wings wont hold me rays or no rays i dont know about any pull of the earth on me all i know is ill have to fall once i jump out with only those things on my arms are you crazy get him suddenly said meier in a furious voice erlick and the japanese at once pinioned the paratroopers arms he had to stand while the king fixed on the wings the children watched with bated breath the paratrooper cried out and struggled but the apelike erlick was far too strong for him put him in the helicopter and take off commanded meier go too erlick push him out at the right moment if hes a fool hell not press the button if he is wise he will press it and then he will see how well he flies but the pilot now had something to say he spoke in a drawling voice clear and contemptuous i think this fellows too heavy the last one was too youd better think again boss and get those wings made twice the size im game for an experiment where theres a chance for everybody but i reckon theres not much chance for a big fellow trying out those wings of yours do you mean you refuse to take this fellow said meier white with anger youve got it right first time boss said the pilot getting so red with anger that his scar showed up very plainly try a little fellow i guess the experiment worked all right last time for a minute or two and then it petered out these paratroopers are hulking great chaps the ones you try out with me anyway and i tell you plainly im not taking anyone who doesnt want to go got it meier went up to the pilot as if he meant to strike him erlick pulled him back thats right said the pilot who had not turned a hair dont try any funny business with me boss i know too much and theres others will know too much too if i dont get back on time he got into his machine and the swarthy man his companion who had not said a single word all this time got in beside him the paratrooper watched them dazedly the engine of the helicopter started up the pilot leaned forward and spoke again to meier who looked as if he was on the point of bursting with rage so long i shant be coming next time im going for a holiday ill be sending somebody whos not so pernickety as i am but i warn you try a little guy the machine rose vertically into the air circled round the mountainside slowly and then made off to the west in a few minutes it could not even be heard the children had watched all this the girls only half understanding what was going on lucyann felt sorry for the frightened paratrooper and very glad he had not been forced to go off in the helicopter the little group left in the courtyard paced up and down a lot of talk and argument went on though the paratrooper did not seem to be joining in at all he had stripped off the wings and was held securely by the japanese the king carried his precious wings all the time but at last replaced them in the box and locked it very well he said i agree it may be that the men we choose are too heavy but who else could we have asked only paratroopers are used to jumping from heights try someone lighter if you wish it will make no difference to my ideas and then the children heard a few words that made them gasp in horror one of those kids will do said meier that insolent boy for instance well put the wings on him and he shall jump from the helicopter chapter the helicopter comes again when the courtyard was completely empty and the beam had gone out leaving the mountaintop in darkness lucyann began to cry bitterly jack and dinah put their arms round her they felt like howling too he doesnt mean it said jack trying to think of something really comforting dont worry he only said that to scare us theyd never make philip do a thing like that they didnt say it to scare us they meant it you know they did sobbed lucyann what are we going to do weve got to do something it was all very well to say that but what in the world was there to do the children got very little sleep that night they debated whether or not to tell philip what had happened and what was proposed they decided not to it would be dreadful for him to lie alone in his cave and worry so when morning came and they sent snowy to philip with the usual sandwiches made from their own breakfast rations they said nothing in the daily note about what had happened but to their great surprise who should be ushered up the steps by the japanese that morning but philip himself he bounded forward to greet them grinning hallo theyve let me out tired of starving me i suppose and seeing me get fatter and fatter i say did you see the helicopter last night i heard it lucyann and dinah hugged him and jack slapped him heartily on the shoulder they were delighted to see him again snowy had come with him and acted like a mad thing careering up and down the parapet as if he was in a circus they told him very little about the night before he was rather puzzled that they said so little even in answer to his questions but jack by means of heavy frowns had let the girls know they had better not say too much he thought it would be wise to postpone saying anything in case meier really hadnt meant what he said but it looked a bit queer meier letting philip come up to be with the others all of a sudden and bringing them very much better food and plenty of it like victims being fattened for the sacrifice thought jack i wonder when the next helicopters due how long have we got oh bill do make haste lucyann and dinah fearing that poor philip really would have to jump from the helicopter were most affectionate to him dinah even enquired after sally the slowworm and did not shrink away when philip brought her out of his pocket i say whats up with dinah asked philip at last shes gone all sweet and sugary its not like her shell be offering to nurse sally slithery for me next philip felt sure there was something up he couldnt imagine what it was he wondered if it was bad news about kiki no if jack had heard any he would be much more upset than he was philip felt uncomfortable it wasnt like the others to keep anything from him he tackled jack about it firmly look here jack somethings up dont say there isnt i jolly well know there is so come out with it or ill go back to my cave and sulk jack hesitated then he took the plunge all right philip ill tell you but its not good he told him all about it how the helicopter had arrived what had happened about the frightened paratrooper and the angry pilot and finally about meiers wicked suggestion that one of the children should try the wings i see said philip slowly and i suppose the one theyre going to try is me thats what they said said jack the brutes that experiment is only halfway to perfection the wings arent a hundred per cent foolproof nor even fifty per cent though they may be one day well well to think im going to fly with wings said philip trying to pass the whole thing off as a joke he saw jacks troubled face dont worry old son it wont happen something will turn up and if it doesnt im no coward i know you dont need to tell me that said jack the girls are awfully upset thats why weve seemed a bit funny with you we just didnt want to tell you philip pranced up to the girls flapping his arms like wings cheer up he cried as soon as im out of that helicopter ill fly off to bill and give him the shock of his life but it wasnt much use trying to make a joke of it it was too serious none of the children felt like playing with snowy who was very hurt and gambolled down the stone steps into the mountain to look for somebody with a bit more fun in him three days went by the children had almost given up all hope of bill coming now surely he would have been along before if he had come looking for them they would have seen a searchparty on the mountainside if one had come but they saw nothing at all it was most disappointing they felt quite sick with watching and waiting they pondered whether to make a dash for freedom again and try for the ropeladder once more but jack shook his head no theyll be on the watch now theres always one of those softfooted japanese about meier will have put somebody on guard there was one good thing orders had evidently been given to feed the children well and they had plenty of good food even their sad hearts did not take away their appetites and they tucked in well helped by snowy who would devour every scrap of greenstuff or vegetable if he could and then one night as they slept together under the awning their rugs pulled round them they heard the familiar sound of the helicopter all four sat up at once their hearts beating tears came into lucyanns eyes the helicopter circled round the mountaintop slowly then the bright beam came on and the courtyard was lighted up the helicopter came slowly down and at last its wheels rested on the rocky yard there were two men in the machine but neither of them was the same as before the pilot had on big goggles and a peaked cap the other man was bareheaded he looked stern and grim meier soon came up with erlick and the japanese servants you the boss called the pilot ive taken kahns place hes on holiday had a job finding this place this is johns my mate weve got the goods you wanted there was the same unpacking as before and boxes and crates were piled on the ground the pilot and his companion jumped down there is a meal ready for you said meier you will start back tomorrow night no got to leave tonight said the pilot theyre making enquiries about some of our doings got to be back at once you have been told that er that er began meier what that some paratrooper wants a jump off the helicopter said the pilot oh yes thats okay by me if a chap wants to do that well its no business of mine you will be paid very very well said meiers grim voice this time it is double the price we have a young jumper it is necessary for our experiments you understand there was a pause the pilots voice came on the air sharp and enquiring what do you mean a young jumper a boy said meier he is here then he turned to one of the servants and said something to him in a foreign language the servant darted off down the steps into the mountain i have sent to tell the inventor that you have arrived he said now will you come to have a meal no said the pilot i must be off get this boy and make him ready lucyanns knees were shaking so much that she couldnt stand philip felt calm but rather fierce all right let them strap those wings on him then let them take him in the helicopter hed jump out all right and if those wings did act if they did but would they philip just couldnt bring himself to believe that they would the pilot had not seen any of the children but now philip had to go forward fetched by one of the servants the others followed though lucyann had to hold on to jack before the pilot could say a word to them the king appeared the children thought he must have dressed himself up very quickly his crown was a little crooked but otherwise he looked as majestic as ever the box with the wings in was carried by one of the servants the king undid it and took out the wings they really did look beautiful and what was more they looked as if they would be able to fly lucyann hoped fervently that they could philip made no fuss at all as the wings were strapped to his arms he was shown the two buttons and nodded he flapped his arms a little and was surprised to feel the power in the wings as they met the air the others watched him in admiration jack warmed to him what pluck he had he didnt in the least show that he was scared perhaps he wasnt but deep down inside philip was a nasty little core of dread he kept it clamped down not for worlds would he have let anyone know it was there then meier the king erlick and the others got a surprise little lucyann stepped forward and laid her hand on the arm of the king your majesty i think i ought to try out your wings for you i am much lighter than philip it would be an honour for me to try them philip and jack looked thunderstruck the idea of it philip gave the little girl a hug putting his winged arms all round her youre a brave darling but im going and whats more ill fly back to this old mountaintop and just show you how well im doing lucyann gave a sob this was too much for her altogether the pilot said nothing but got into the helicopter with his companion the king showed no hesitation at all in letting philip go it was pathetic the way he believed wholeheartedly in his extraordinary wings his head was in the clouds the people who performed his experiments for him and tried out his clever ideas were nothing to him at all meier watched grimly as philip climbed into the helicopter helped by one of the servants for his arms were hampered by the beautiful wings the man would have been better pleased if the boy had objected and made a scene he did not admire philips pluck in the least his piercing eyes looked into philips and the boy looked back at him mockingly so long he said and raised one of his winged arms see you later look out for yourself meier youll come to a bad end one of these days meier stepped forward angrily but the planes engine began to whir the vanes went slowly round gathering speed lucyann tried to stifle a sob she felt sure she would never see philip again the helicopter rose straight up into the air the pilot leaned forward and shouted something loudly dont forget bill smugs he called and his voice was no longer the same as it had sounded before it was quite different it was somebody elses in fact it was bills voice chapter a thrilling night only lucyann jack and dinah knew what that last shout meant meier and the others had no idea at all they hardly heard what was shouted but the children had heard all right they gasped jacks hand found lucyanns and dinah squeezed jacks arm they didnt say a single word until meier erlick the king and the servants had all disappeared once more then they made their way to their awnings linking hands to keep together jack that was bill bill himself said lucyann her voice going all funny as she spoke yes and he knew if he yelled out dont forget bill smugs that wed know it was him said dinah he called himself bill smugs the very first adventure we had do you remember gosh i never had such a surprise in my life and philips safe said jack in intense satisfaction thats one good thing the other fellow with bill must be one of his friends philip will just chuck those wings overboard and thatll be that i feel as if i simply must sit down at once said lucyann my legs will hardly carry me i feel so joyful she sat down and the others followed suit they all let out a terrific sigh of relief a heavy load rolled away from them philip was safe he didnt have to jump out of the helicopter to try out an experiment for a mad old scientist or for meier and erlick he was with bill what made bill think of getting a helicopter wondered jack landing on the mountaintop with it too under the noses of meier and erlick well dont you remember you put in your note something about the helicopter we thought was landing up here said dinah the note we left with dapple yes so i did said jack well that looks rather as if old bill did come along here then and found dapple good for him trust bill to get going somehow whats he going to do next said dinah do you think hell come back for us you bet he will said jack hell park philip somewhere safe and hell be back as soon as he can perhaps tonight oh how lovely sighed lucyann i dont like this mountain i like mrs evans farmhouse best i dont like anyone here that horrid meier and that awful fat erlick and the nasty little slinky japanese servants and the king well i feel sorry for him said jack hes just got into the hands of rogues no doubt theyve made plenty of money already from his inventions now theyre going all out for this one i do wonder if theres anything in it well im jolly glad philip hasnt got to find out said dinah good old philip he was as plucky as could be wasnt he yes and lucyann was jolly brave too said jack whatever made you think of trying to go in philips place lucyann i dont know it sort of came over me all at once lucyann tried to explain but i wasnt brave my legs were wobbling like jelly the only thing that worries me is kiki said jack i hope those men havent done anything to her shes never been away from us so long i havent heard so much as a hiccup from her the others were worried too dinah couldnt help feeling pretty certain that kiki had come to some harm if meier caught her that would be the end of her dinah shivered when she thought of his cold piercing eyes suddenly dinah gave a small shriek oh somethings wriggling over my leg what is it quick its the slowworm said jack making a grab at it sorry dinah you see philip didnt want to make poor old sally share his jump so he slipped her into my pocket when he thought you werent looking i didnt know shed got out dont yell dinah with everybody being so frightfully brave tonight you might as well show your pluck too and surprisingly dinah did after all what was a slowworm compared to philips jump if he had had to jump nothing at all dinah drew her leg away but made no fuss at all sally slithered round them for a little while and then went into jacks pocket again i just simply cant get over knowing it was bill in that helicopter said lucyann for the twentieth time my heart jumped nearly out of my body when he suddenly changed his voice to his own and yelled out dont forget bill smugs well have to be on the lookout for when he comes back said jack im sure it will be tonight perhaps no one will hear him but us because well be the only ones expecting him you cant hear a thing down in that mountain oooh wouldnt that be super if bill came back without being heard and took us off said lucyann what would meier and the others think theyd hunt all over the place for us and send the dogs out too said jack shall we keep awake to look out for him said dinah no you girls have a nap ill keep watch said jack im much too wide awake to go to sleep ill wake you as soon as ever i hear anything what about that beam of light that shows the helicopter where to land at night said dinah suddenly can you turn it on when you hear it coming jack i expect so said jack and went into the middle of the courtyard to find the switch that turned on the powerful beam but he couldnt find it anywhere he hunted all over the place and gave it up at last cant find where the wretched thing turns on he said sickening well i daresay bill can land all right said lucyann who had the utmost faith in bills ability to do anything no matter how impossible you keep watch jack im going to have a nap she and dinah shut their eyes and in spite of all the terrific excitement of that night they were both asleep in half a minute jack sat up keeping watch it was a cloudy night and only occasionally did he see a star peeping out from between the clouds good old bill how had he got that helicopter how did he know how to fly one jack felt very thankful indeed that he had had the sense to leave a note behind with dapple telling everything they knew otherwise bill wouldnt have known a thing about the mountain or its secret and certainly wouldnt have guessed that a helicopter landed on the top from far away a noise came through the night jack strained his ears yes it was the helicopter coming back it hadnt been long then just long enough to drop philip somewhere hear his story and come back for the others what a sell for meier to find them all gone and not to know what had happened to the wonderful wings the boy went to try and put on the lamp again but could not find the switch at all this was not surprising because it was set in a tiny trapdoor let into the yard the helicopter came nearer it circled the mountain it rose vertically to land on the courtyard jack shook the two girls its here bills back the girls woke up at once snowy who was asleep by then woke up too and leapt to his feet he could feel the terrific excitement of the others and sprang about madly look its landing said jack and the three of them strained their eyes to see the helicopter a big dark shadow in the blackness of the night there came a slight crashing sound and then the helicopter suddenly swung over to where jack and the girls were they had to dodge out of the way bills voice came on the air jack are you there jack ran to the helicopter as bill switched on a powerful torch im here bill the coasts clear nobodys up here gosh its good to have you is philip all right quite all right hes down on the mountainside with johns the fellow who came with me waiting for us get into the helicopter all of you and well go while the goings good bill switched his torch round to see where the girls were and in a moment all three were being helped up into the machine i couldnt quite see where to land said bill i must have hit something coming down i felt a good old jolt and the helicopter swung round like mad i hope shes all right you went into part of the rocky parapet i think said jack helping the girls in oh bill this is grand how did you all explanations later said bill and began to fiddle about with something in front of him now here we go the helicopter rose a foot or two in the air and then swung round in a peculiar way bill put her back to earth again at once now whats wrong she shouldnt do that lucyann was so longing to be off that she could hardly bear this lets go lets go she kept saying till dinah nudged her to stop snowy was on lucyanns knee as good as gold she held onto him tightly tense with excitement bill tried again once more the machine rose into the air and then did its peculiar swinground somethings wrong with the steering said bill in an exasperated voice why did i leave johns down there he might have been able to put it right but i didnt think this machine would hold him as well as you three in deepening dismay the children sat while poor bill tried his best to get the helicopter to rise and fly properly but each time it swung round violently and bill could do nothing with it he was secretly rather afraid that it would get completely out of control and swing right off the mountaintop he could not risk an accident with the three children on board for at least an hour bill experimented with the steering of the helicopter but it would not answer to the controls at all he made the children get out to see if lightening the load made any difference but it didnt it must have got damaged when you struck the parapet said jack oh bill what are we going to do now what about that way out by the wall said bill philip told me all about it something about a ropeladder and so on as a matter of fact i did go to find the entrance there when i came to look for you the other day you spoke of it in your note you remember and i went behind the green curtain found the crack in the rock and went in but i couldnt go any further than that curious cave with no roof and the black pool at the bottom no nobody would find how to get out of that cave except by accident said jack we discovered how to get the ropeladder down from above by turning a wheel under the water in the pool down came the ladder well it seems to me well have to try to get out that way said bill this pest of a helicopter wont answer to her controls now i darent try and take off wed crash and we havent any wonderful wings to save us either oh bill cant we really fly off in the helicopter said lucyann her heart sinking like lead oh i dont want to go down into that horrid mountain again we might lose our way we might get caught well have to try im afraid lucyann said bill never mind im here to protect you now and after all its the middle of the night and nobody is likely to be about if only that helicopter would go properly said jack its a piece of real bad luck that it wont its such a giveaway too as soon as anyone sees it theyll know somethings up and will come to look for us all the more reason why we should get a move on now said bill come on gosh whats this banging against me oh its you snowy well if you come too youll have to keep at our heels or youll give the game away by the way wheres kiki i havent seen or heard her tonight we dont know where she is said jack miserably we havent seen her for days not since we were captured she may be caged somewhere or hiding in the mountain or even killed oh no said lucyann dont say that kikis too clever to let herself be captured perhaps well find her tonight wheres the way out of this place asked bill switching on his torch over there are there steps that go down into the mountain well come on then every minute is precious now they left the damaged helicopter in the yard and went towards the stone steps that led down into the mountain lucyann shivered i hoped id not go down there again take my hand bill im scared chapter flight through the mountain soon they were right down inside the mountain they had passed jacks cave passed by the stores and gone down the steep spiral stairway cut in the rock it was very difficult to choose the right way to go because all the dim lamps that lighted the passages were out it was quite dark everywhere bills powerful torch sent a bright ray in front of them but he had to use it cautiously in case someone saw the light and was warned of their coming there was a lot of standing still and listening a good deal of argument on jacks part and dinahs about the right way to go bill was very patient but his voice was urgent as he told them to think hard and choose the right way if we followed snowy wed probably go right said lucyann at last he would know the way well but he doesnt know where we want to go said jack i mean if he knew we wanted to go to the ropeladder cave he could lead us there all right but we cant make him understand that they ended up in being completely lost they found themselves in a dark tunnel with a very high roof that none of the children recognised at all bill began to feel desperate if only he had been able to land without damage this long trek through dark unknown passages wouldnt have been necessary they went down very deep and quite suddenly came out on to the high gallery that overlooked the pit bill drew in his breath sharply when he saw the mass of brilliance suddenly showing when the curious floor slid back for a moment he and the children felt the strange feeling of lightness at once but it passed immediately the floor slid over the glowing mass again there was nobody in the pit apparently the floor worked automatically by machinery of some kind though there was none to be seen that was the curious part of the works in the mountain there was no heavy machinery anywhere whatever power was used was not conveyed by iron or steel machines and there was little noise except for the heavy rumbling that sounded before the shaking of the earth theres obviously some metal in this mountain that can be used for that fellows experiments said bill some rare metal or other like uranium which is used for splitting the atom there are a few mountains in the world which contain various rare metals but usually they are mined for it and the stuff is taken out in this case they havent mined it they are using it where it is its possible that they have to do that in order to use the enormous thickness of the rocks in the mountain to protect the outer world from whatever rays they are experimenting with very ingenious i think we know the way back now said jack quite thankful at having found some place they recognised even though it was the frightening pit he pointed behind them up the wide uphill passage that he knew went up and up for a long way bill switched his torch on it is that the way he said well come along then they went up the wide steep passage they came to the narrow twisty little tunnel they had been in before and walked along till they came to the fork lefthand fork said jack and they took that bill was amazed to see the beautiful silken hangings that decorated the walls further on and hung across the entrance to a cave jack put his hand on bills arm thats the kings bedroom beyond he whispered dinah have you got snowy dont let him rush on in front bill tiptoed to the curtains and parted them a dim light shone beyond bill looked with interest into the kings bedroom and then closed the curtains quickly he tiptoed back to the children theres somebody lying on the couch there he whispered an old fellow with a colossal forehead thats the king of the mountain whispered back jack the great brain behind all these inventions i think he is an absolute genius but quite mad he seems to be asleep said bill is there any way we can go round this cave without waking him up no i dont know of any said jack weve got to go through it and then through a cave where he eats his meals and then into the throneroom bill thought for a moment well have to risk it then he said well go through the room one by one but for heavens sake dont make a sound they went through the kings bedroom one at a time hardly daring to breathe dinah had tight hold of snowy praying that he wouldnt bleat when he went through the room fortunately there were very thick carpets on the floor so it was easy to make no sound lucyanns heart beat so loudly as she tiptoed across that she thought it must surely wake the king with a jump then they were in the room where the long table had held so much lovely food but now it was empty and there was not so much as a dish of fruit on it then on to the throneroom and outside this behind the lovely hangings patterned with the red dragons the little company paused a curious noise came to their ears was it snoring what was it bill peeped through the hangings very cautiously he grinned in the throneroom sitting or lying were the paratroopers a very long table had been set down the middle and on it were the remains of a lavish supply of food and drink not a single man was awake so thats where those fellows have been the last day or two whispered jack i wondered where they were gosh theyve fallen asleep where they are what a pretty sight bill fumbled about in the hangings they were looking through he was looking for a switch he found one and whispered to the children now listen im going to switch off the light so that we can get through the hall without being seen keep close to one side of it and get through as quietly as possible even if we do make a noise and some of those fellows wake up it wont matter because they wont be able to see who it is this was a good idea the light went out with a slight click and the great hall was in darkness the children led by bill moved quietly along one side their feet making no noise on the soft mats when they came to the immense laboratory bill stood still in amazement he knew a great deal more about these things than the children did of course and he could see what a brilliant ingenious mind must be at the back of all the things at work there they stood in the gallery and looked down at the wires and wheels the glass jars and the crystal boxes and heard the quiet purposeful humming going on what is it all doing bill whispered lucyann its transmuting or changing one power or energy into another said bill soberly making it into usable form so that so that it can be imprisoned in those wings for instance said jack something like that said bill its an amazing setup altogether there was nobody there it did seem extraordinary that all these humming spinning whirring things should go on and on seemingly of their own accord with just the king wandering round them occasionally bill was so fascinated that for a few moments he forgot the urgency of finding the way out of the mountain there was something dreamlike about all this it didnt seem real he was brought back to reality again by feeling snowy butting against him he jumped a little then he took lucyanns arm come along what am i thinking of stopping like this jack had found the passage that led out of the laboratory he led them down it and they came to the great cave they had seen before bills torch swept round it but there was nothing to see then they went into the passage that led to the roofless cave the children felt they really were getting near freedom again if only only only they could find out how to get that ropeladder out of its place in the wall they passed the dim lamps which for some reason or other were lighted here they came to the roofless cave and bills torch picked out the pitchers of icecold water standing at the back to refresh those who had had the long and exhausting climb up the ropeladder this is the place where the ladders kept said jack and he took bills torch and swung it to find the place in the rocky wall where they had seen it last but before he could spot it lucyann tripped over something and fell with a thud bill picked her up she had hurt her knees but she didnt make a sound bill told jack to flash his torch on lucyann to see what she had fallen over she had stumbled over the ropeladder itself there it lay stretching from its place in the wall over the floor and then disappearing downwards over the edge of the cave down down down to the cave with the pool far below look the ladders out cried jack forgetting to whisper in his excitement oh bill lets come on down at once somebody must have gone out of the mountain tonight said dinah and left the ladder down to come back by i wonder who it was wed better be careful we dont meet them jack you go down first said bill who had been examining with great interest the way the ladder was attached to the hole in the wall it was extremely ingenious bill could see how wires must be run up from the wheel in the pool to a lever which released the ladder whose weight then compelled it to run out over the floor to the edge of the cave where it fell and then rolled itself undone until it had come to its last rung what made it able to roll itself up again bill could not imagine but the brain that could devise all the amazing things inside that mountain would find that a very simple problem jack went to the place where the ladder hung over the edge he knelt down and put his feet one after another on a rung a little way down the ladder felt as firm as before it was very well made and strong well here i go said jack send the girls next bill and then you come snowys gone already down whatever little hole he and the dogs use i dont know where that is i only wish i knew where poor old kiki was i dont like leaving her all alone in this beastly mountain bill shone his torch on him the girls watched his head disappear as he climbed down you go now lucyann said bill jack must be a good way down you wont tread on his head then dinah can go and ill follow last of all dont attempt to leave the cave below till i am down with you jack was going steadily down what a long long way it was and then a very peculiar thing happened the ladder began to shake below him jack stopped climbing at once gracious somebodys climbing up and im climbing down whoever can it be chapter escape at last no sooner had he felt certain that somebody was climbing up very steadily below him than jack immediately stopped climbing down and began climbing back again at top speed he didnt want to meet meier or erlick on that ladder some way up he bumped into lucyanns feet she gave a small squeal of fright its all right lucyann its only me said jack in a low voice theres somebody coming up the ladder go back again as quickly as you can lucyann at once began to climb up as fast as possible in a great fright gracious how awful to feel that somebody was coming up the ladder just as they were going down she felt certain it was that horrid meier she in turn bumped into dinahs feet and passed the urgent message on to the surprised girl dinah began to climb back again up to the cave at the top very quickly indeed lucyann and jack were immediately below her jack felt as if somebody might catch his ankles at any moment and of course the next thing was that dinah nearly got her head trodden on by bills big feet he was descending at top speed to join the others and was most amazed to find dinah just below him whats the matter didnt i tell you to buck up he said and then caught dinahs agonized whisper somebodys coming up quick before they get jack quick bill muttering something under his breath bill climbed back quickly he pulled dinah up then lucyann then jack the ladder still shook the climber or climbers were coming up steadily back into the passages commanded bill we cant afford to be caught now well wait till whoever it is has gone and then well try again they came to where the passage forked into three and bill pushed them all into the darkest one but coming towards them were footsteps and somebodys shadow at the far end they all rushed back again now the climber had reached the top of the ladder and was behind them they tried the second passage and found themselves in a maze of funny little caves all leading one out of another wait here said bill but they had been seen and challenging voices began to echo along the dark passages whos there come out at once they didnt stir they were all crouched in a dark corner overhung by a rocky ledge bill wondered if the beam of a torch would find them he was afraid it would the feet passed by in another cave then came more voices the hunt was on bill groaned it sounded as if four or five searchers were there now they would separate and search until they had found them and they had been so near freedom come said bill after a moment well try a better cave than this but before they could move the flash of a torch shone into their cave they all stiffened and stood absolutely still the beam came nearer and nearer lucyann forgot to breathe and stood with her hand firmly clasped in bills just as the beam of the torch was picking out jacks feet or so it seemed to jack a surprising interruption came a voice came from somewhere nearby a hollow mournful voice full of misery and despair poor kiki ding dong bell peepbo jacks heart leapt kiki she wasnt dead then she must have been wandering completely lost all about the passages and caves for days she didnt know they were close to her she had seen the light of the torch and heard voices and as usual she had joined in the conversation bills hand squeezed jacks arm warningly he was afraid the boy might call kiki or exclaim out loud in delight but jack held his tongue kiki went on talking in the most melancholy voice imaginable send for the doctor musty fusty dusty pooh gah jack had never heard her so miserable before poor kiki she must have thought herself quite deserted a sharp voice rang through the cave what in the world was that somebodys in this cave erlick come here did you hear that what asked erlick coming in with another torch a voice said meier somebodys in here two people probably one talking to another stand there with your torch while i walk around with mine meier began to walk round examining all the walls carefully for hidingplaces bill groaned silently now they had no chance at all to get to another cave kiki gave a realistic sneeze and then a cough meier stopped his search and swung his torch in the direction of the sound we can hear you come out or it will be the worse for you he shouted in a furious tone kiki was frightened she had been without food for some time and was hungry and unhappy the mans angry voice filled her with panic and she flew off into the next cave having no idea that her beloved jack was so near her it was just as well that she didnt know for if she had known she would certainly have flown to jacks shoulder and given their hidingplace away at once her voice came from the cave further on polly put the kettle on send for the doctor then came a loud hiccup and an apologetic pardon good heavens whats going on cried meier completely puzzled its that voice again that weve been hearing at intervals well where theres a voice theres a body and im going to find it this time if i have to shoot the caves to pieces a loud report made bill and the children jump in fright meier had drawn his revolver and fired wildly in the direction of kikis voice jack didnt like that a bit he was afraid kiki might be hit meier and erlick went into the next cave after kikis voice it came to them from further away upsadaisy wipe your feet you naughty boy the children couldnt help smiling scared though they were kiki always managed to say such ridiculous things in moments of urgency there came another shot which echoed all round the caves kiki gave a cackle of scornful laughter and then made a noise like a car changing gear she came back to the next cave again and the men followed they still had not caught sight of kiki because they were looking for a human being running away in front of them whereas kiki flew high in the roof of the caves and perched on small ledges well hidden somebody else ran through the cave where the children were calling to meier mr meier sir sir all children run away helicopter come back all alone on mountaintop no one there children run away it was one of the japanese servants who had evidently discovered the returned helicopter and the disappearance of the pilot and the children there was an amazed silence meier raised his voice and let forth a stream of furious foreign words none of which bill or the children could understand then came erlicks voice no good going on like that meier get out the dogs the children must have gone down the ladder you left it down when you went out tonight didnt you the dogs will soon round them all up whats happened to the pilot though raged meier and lapsed into some foreign language again the japanese came pattering back through the cave again presumably on his way to get the dogs send for the doctor called kiki mournfully she screeched like an engine and made meier flash his torch in and out of the caves again almost beside himself with rage erlick meier and one or two others with them then began a loud argument in many languages bill didnt wait to hear what it was all about he pushed the children out of their hidingplace and towards the nearest passage very quietly and quickly they all fled back towards the cave with the ladder maybe there was a chance now of escape jack wished with all his heart that he could take kiki too they went down the ladder in the same order as before jack wondering fearfully if he would find anyone coming up this time ready to catch him by the ankles but he didnt he reached the bottom safely his legs shaking with the effort panting and exhausted lucyann almost fell off the last rung weeping with relief to find she was finally at the bottom it had seemed an endless climb down to her she sank to the ground beside the pool her heart beating painfully dinah followed and threw herself on the ground too then came bill not so distressed as the others but very glad indeed to be at the bottom of the ladder phew the bottom at last he said what a climb now come on out we go on the mountainside well join up with philip and johns if only those wretched dogs dont find us philips told me about them and how you thought they were wolves i dont fancy a pack of alsatians on my trail somehow with meier and erlick urging them on the dawn was beginning to come over the mountains the sun was not yet above them but a golden light was spreading upwards from the east the children were very glad indeed to feel the fresh wind on their faces when they went out through the crack in the rock and swung aside the big green curtain of creeper and bramble they took deep breaths and gazed around them in the silvery light of dawn come on said bill i left philip and johns by a stream where you left dapple we took dapple back with us by the way when david effans and i came with the rest of the donkeys to look for you philip said youd know where the place was even if we landed a little way from it in the helicopter he thinks were all coming through the air of course to land on a good flat place where we left a light burning to guide me it was a bit tricky landing in the dark with philip and johns the helicopter nearly overbalanced still we managed it philip will be looking out for us by that light then said lucyann not by the stream no i told him not to in case anyone was roaming about there saw the light and spotted him and johns explained bill i thought meier and company might possibly be on the lookout for philip if they thought he had jumped i was supposed to radio back to them what had happened but i didnt of course it was easy to find their way to the meetingplace now that dawn was coming but before they got there a bit of good luck came to jack in the shape of kiki she suddenly sailed down on him from the air with a cackle of delight and a screech that nearly deafened them all she flew to his shoulder and rubbed her head into his ear giving it little pecks and pulls of love jack was so overjoyed that he couldnt say a word he just scratched kikis head and made funny loving noises which kiki immediately copied oh good said lucyann in delight oh jack dear old kiki isnt it lovely to have her again its been awful without you kiki even bill joined in the demonstrations of affection you saved us kiki old bird you led those fellows such a song and dance that they let us escape how did you know where we were did you fly out and follow us kiki didnt tell them so they never knew but jack felt sure she had flown down into the roofless cave and come out of the crack into the open air then she must have heard their voices and come to join them god save the king said kiki in a happy voice and gave a loud hiccup pardon pardon the king pop goes polly oh kiki we thought you were dead said dinah she looked round missing snowy and now snowys gone where is he he hasnt been with us for some time said bill hell turn up i expect just like kiki dithery slithery said kiki suddenly cocking her head on one side and looking at jacks pocket sally the slowworm was half in and half out enjoying being in the fresh air again dinah didnt even squeal they went on their way with kiki firmly on jacks shoulder and suddenly they heard a yell hie here we are jack dinah lucyann bill and oh i say theres kiki too hurrah youve escaped but wheres the helicopter weve been waiting and waiting for it it was philip of course leaping up and down like a mad thing with johns standing stolidly behind him and snowy frisking round about them both he had found philip so all the family were together again they were full of delight but wait what was that howling noise in the distance the dogs said jack theyre after us chapter trailed by the dogs lucyann shrank back against bill and johns when she heard the savage howls and barks she didnt at all like the idea of the dogs being after them bill and johns exchanged glances and bill said something under his breath and looked stubborn and angry they had all been so pleased at their escape and now here they were about to be caught again nobody could do anything against ten manhunting dogs bill get into the stream and wade up through the water said jack suddenly thats what the negro did when he wanted to break his scent dogs cant smell a trail through water lets all wade up the stream and try and find a good hidingplace a big tree like sam went up well its a poor chance said bill but well try it blow that helicopter behaving like that just when i wanted to take off to safety wed have been quite all right by now if it hadnt been for the damage to the steering they all waded into the middle of the little stream up it they went the water very cold to their feet lucyann was between bill and johns she felt very glad indeed that there were two grownups with them in the distance the dogs barked again they were certainly on the trail the little company went up the stream as quickly as they could so that their scent was well broken but they could easily be seen and it was essential that they should get up into a tree or find a cave as soon as they could and soon they found just exactly the thing the stream disappeared into a large hole in the mountain the clear water came bubbling out from there into the sunshine swirling round the feet of the two men and the children and of snowy too look it comes from that big hole said bill pleased well go in there and hope it will take us all we ought to be able to hide here till the dogs give up all hope of finding us they crawled in one by one bill switched on his torch there was only just room for them all because a few yards back the hole narrowed down to a tiny tunnel out of which the stream gushed madly they sat down where they could squeezed up closely against one another jack and philip had their feet in the stream they sat there listening to the distant yelping of the alsatians bill pulled some chocolate out of his pocket i forgot about this he said and handed it round it was very comforting to have something to nibble johns had brought some too so there was plenty do you think the dogs have lost the trail now asked jack not hearing the barking coming any closer yes sounds like it said bill theyre at a loss i should think they must have come to the stream jumped over it and found the trail was at an end they probably wont have the sense to realise weve gone upstream but i should think the men with them would guess said big stolid johns who was taking this extraordinary adventure with the utmost calm as if things like that happened to him every day i know i would if i were hunting a man with dogs and we came to a stop by a stream id order the dogs up or downstream at once oh dear said lucyann would you really well im sure meier will then when he catches up with the dogs because hes terribly clever hes got the most piercing eyes bill honestly they go right through you well hed better try looking right through me said bill hed be sorry pardon said kiki sorry you forgot your hiccup old thing said jack and kiki solemnly produced one johns laughed suddenly he said hed heard plenty of hiccups without birds and seen plenty of birds without hiccups but when you got the two together it was worth a lot the dogs are coming nearer said jack suddenly they all listened straining their ears it was true their howls were distinctly louder meiers caught up with them then said dinah and hes guessed our trick and theyre all coming upstream yes and theyre sure to smell us here said philip absolutely certain to we cant diddle dogs like that hey diddle diddle said kiki and screeched shut up said jack and tapped her on her beak do you want the dogs to hear you pooh said kiki and nipped jacks ear listen i can hear the dogs splashing in the stream cried philip and so he could the sound came to everyones ears and lucyann clutched bills hand even more tightly would this horrid adventure never end and then they saw the first dog his red tongue hanging out his breath coming in excited pants he was half leaping in the water not wading in and out he leapt in and out coming nearer and nearer then came meiers hateful voice go on get them find them the leading dog came right up to the hidingplace he could smell everyone in there as he stood in the stream outside the hole he did not attempt to go in he had found what he had been told to find he had not been told to capture and hold he lifted his head and howled like a wolf kiki was very surprised she attempted an imitation but an alsatians howl was beyond her she only produced a curious whirring noise that made the dog cock his big head on one side and listen then the other dogs came up panting too their tongues all hanging out they stood beside and behind their leader sniffing they looked very fierce indeed not a nice sight murmured bill to johns who was staring stolidly at the dogs as if he was perfectly used to being hunted by a pack of alsatians and didnt mind it at all keep still bill commanded everyone as long as we dont attempt to move or get away the dogs wont do anything more than stand there and stare there came the sound of shouts and meier and erlick appeared very red in the face with running meier stopped dead when he saw the pack of dogs standing looking in the hole where the stream poured out he pushed erlick behind a tree quickly it was plain that he feared bill might have a gun he shouted out loudly come on out the dogs have found you if you dont want them to set on you come on out and throw any gun youve got down on the ground and put your hands up weve got you covered pleasant fellow isnt he said johns to bill itll be nice to get hold of him do we go out boss or dont we we dont said bill shortly i doubt if hell dare to set the dogs on us he knows the children are here meier wouldnt stick at anything said jack and he was right when there was no answer and not even a movement from the hole in the hill meier began to lose his temper as usual he shouted out something in a foreign language then changed to english you heard what i said you have one more chance the dogs are ready to pounce theyll round you up all right and i warn you their teeth are sharp so dont resist still nobody moved lucyann shut her eyes she really couldnt look at the eager panting dogs any more she could see that they were just awaiting the word to rush into the cave and drag them all out and then philip suddenly moved and before anyone could stop him he was outside the cave put your hands up called meier and philip put them up the dogs sniffed at him and under his breath philip talked to them dont you remember me im philip you slept with me up on the rock fine dogs you are were friends dont you remember the dogs did not understand one word but they understood his tone of voice they remembered this boy they felt his friendliness and his attraction the leader began to whine a little he longed to have this boy pat his head but philip had his hands above his head and had only his voice to charm the dogs with he went on talking to them in a low voice while the other children and bill and johns watched spellbound they all thought the same philip philip what is there in you that makes all creatures your friends what gift have you got so rare so irresistible lucky boy thought bill and lucky for every one of us that you can charm these dogs meier called out angrily where are the others tell them to come too or ill give the order for them to be dragged out the leader dog stood up and put his paws on philips shoulders he licked the boys face it was a very wet lick but philip did not even turn away his face that was the signal for all the other dogs to come round too quite forgetting meier they milled round philip trying to get near him sniffing at him giving him a lick when they got near enough he put down his hands meier would not dare to take a shot at him now in case he killed a dog he ran his hands over their backs patted their heads rubbed their noses and all the time he talked to them in the special voice he kept for animals meier snapped out an order to the dogs fetch them out get them bring them here the dogs turned their heads automatically at his commanding voice they hesitated the leader looked at philip come with me said philip come you will find more friends in here and to meiers everlasting astonishment the boy actually led all the dogs to the cave where at least four of them squeezed in to lick lucyann jack and dinah they sniffed doubtfully at bill and johns growled at snowy and kiki and then when philip laid a hand on bills arm and then on johns they accepted them as friends too philip youre a marvel said bill in heartfelt admiration its magic you use cant be anything else what a boy said the stolid johns allowing his face to change its expression for once and show great admiration meiers shortly going to have a fit i think said jack he just cant understand all this fetch them out i say ill shoot the lot of you dogs if you dont obey orders stormed meier whats come over you fetch them out the dogs took absolutely no notice at all their leader had accepted philip as master now and they all followed his decision what philip said they would obey they feared meier but they loved philip meier suddenly fired his revolver in a fury he did not fire at the dogs but over their heads they jumped and growled turning their heads towards him bill judged it was time to do something philip will the dogs obey you will they go for meier and erlick if they will order them to well give that couple a taste of their own medicine chapter the tables are turned right said philip he pointed to the tree where meier and erlick were hiding behind its big trunk see boys fetch them out bring them here fetch them for me then before meier or erlick knew what was happening the pack of alsatians was speeding joyfully to obey the whole pack flung themselves on the two rogues and bore them to the ground there was no chance to use a revolver in fact meiers gun rolled on the ground and was completely lost under the scrambling crowd of dogs dont hurt them bring them here ordered philip in excitement proud of his power to give commands to the pack of dogs bill and johns were now out of the cave and jack followed telling the girls not to come out yet they didnt want to lucyann clutched dinahs arm till she squealed both girls watched what was happening breathless with intense excitement the dogs began to drag the two men over to philip erlick the great apelike fellow a real bully if ever there was one was screaming for mercy a coward like all bullies call them off ill surrender call them off boy meier fought savagely not seeming to care whether he was bitten or not he could not find his revolver and was beside himself with amazement anger and fear the dogs were trained not to bite unless commanded but one or two of them gave him a welldeserved nip a little repayment for his callousness in dealing with them in their training the leader got hold of him by the slack of his trousers and looking rather ridiculous meier was brought to where the boys and the two men were standing watching then erlick was brought too trying to stand almost weeping with panic he remembered a gun he had in his pocket and he reached to get it thinking it was his last chance of escape but johns was on the spot hands up he said any funny business on your part erlick and the dogs can have you for all i care stand up meier and put your hands up too white with rage meier put up his hands when the dogs allowed him to find his feet he glared at the boys and bill what did you do to the dogs he snapped at philip theyve never turned on me before he lapsed into a foreign language again and poured out streams of abuse shut up said bill who was now holding his own revolver in his hand you talk too much wipe your feet said kikis voice and she flew out of the hole and onto jacks shoulder pooh gah meier glared at the parrot recognizing the voice that had puzzled him for so long if looks could have killed certainly kiki would have fallen dead at that moment as it was she went off into one of her dreadful cackles and meier clenched the fists he was holding above his head wishing that for one moment he could get hold of kiki what do we do now enquired jack its a long way from home bill and weve got no food to keep us going if we have to walk back effans and trefor and david are not far off said bill i told them to stand by somewhere near this mountain with plenty of donkeys in case we needed them i wasnt sure if the helicopter would fly very far with such a lot of you on board oh will they really be near here said lucyann gladly oh bill you think of everything oh good can we take the dogs back with us asked philip who was still surrounded by furry bodies and wagging tails i could look after them till we get them away somewhere i dare say youd like them for the police force bill theyre jolly well trained thanks for the offer said bill with a grin ill accept it and now quick march well leave this surprising mountain behind and i and a few others will come back to it later i feel it wants a little cleaning up and well take that mad genius in charge before he does something dangerous i wouldnt put it past him to blow up the mountain good gracious said lucyann in alarm well lets get away before he does they set off at a smart walk meier and erlick walked in sullen silence they had their hands by their sides now for johns had searched them both and they were now weaponless jack and the others began to feel a familiar feeling of emptiness under their belts im jolly hungry announced dinah has effans brought any food with him do you think well mrs evans was so upset to hear that you were lost that she immediately did an enormous baking said bill and i believe two of the donkeys are laden with the results so lets hurry where are they asked jack in the vale of butterflies waiting for us patiently said bill with a grin this was a most surprising thing to hear the vale of butterflies cried jack why we couldnt find it we began to think it was all trefors makeup oh no it was really quite easy to find if only david had known how to read a map said bill the name was on it in welsh so you wouldnt have understood it but i dont believe david can read words of more than three letters i shouldnt have let him go off with you as guide did you find it then asked lucyann oh yes its on the way here actually said bill david took a wrong road thats all stupidly left the track anyway i told him to wait there with the donkeys because i thought youd rather like to see the butterfly valley after having missed it and found a very strange mountain instead oh everythings coming right said lucyann joyfully the adventure is over isnt it bill well it doesnt seem nearly so bad now as it did poor lucyann said bill you do have adventures thrust upon you dont you never mind youll soon be back at the farm enjoying mrs evans wonderful cooking as soon as you came things were all right said lucyann happily it was super hearing you yell out dont forget bill smugs last night gosh was it only last night it seems years ago they went through a narrow pass between two mountains feeling hungrier and hungrier and there below them was the vale of butterflies they stopped in delight the valley was a froth of coloured butterflies red yellow white pink blue copper brown there were thousands there fluttering in the sunlight darting erratically to and fro hovering dropping down to the millions of flowers these made a carpet of brilliant colour and the children thought they had never seen such a lovely sight before why are there so many many butterflies i wonder marvelled dinah i suppose because there are so many varieties of foodplants said bill this valley is apparently as famous for flowers as for butterflies but because it is so much off the beaten track it is rarely visited ive no doubt the pack of dogs would keep trippers away anyhow theres effans and the donkeys cried philip hey effans hallo trefor and david dapple moved forward to greet snowy who ran in delight to his friend effans beamed trefors blue eyes shone only david did not greet them eagerly he kept his eyes on the ground and seemed ashamed he got it hot and strong from mrs evans when he arrived back alone with the donkeys chasing after him explained bill i also had a few words to say to him as you can imagine so he now feels he cant look anyone in the face it wont do him any harm to feel like that for a while he behaved like a coward poor david said lucyann i expect hes sorry now and she spoke to the little man kindly he looked at her gratefully its good to see you again indeed to gootness it is whateffer said effans in his singsong voice whateffer whateffer shouted kiki in delight look you look you whateffer that bird said effans in great admiration look you it iss a marvel that bird i would give ten pounds for a bird like that whateffer shes not for sale said jack fondling kiki no not for a million pounds wheres the food effans were starving all explanations after the meal said bill to effans well have a talk then effans while the children go mad over the butterflies meier erlick keep over there philip tell the dogs to look after them effans stared in surprise at the two sullen men meier glared back erlick was full of selfpity and had even begun to reproach meier for his carelessness in letting them be captured meier looked at erlick as if he could snap at him like the dogs a pretty couple said bill i think well turn our backs on them they spoil the view joyfully the children settled down to the finest picnic they had ever had mrs evans had indeed surpassed herself there was roast chicken tender tongue spiced ham hardboiled eggs cucumbers tomatoes potted meat fresh fruit homemade lemonade which effans had had the sense to keep cooling in a nearby stream and so many other eatables that the boys despaired of even being able to taste them all they sat there on the hillside the carpet of bright flowers spread at their feet unbelievably brilliant in colour and the butterflies theyre like flying flowers cried lucyann in joy hundreds of them thousands of them what are they philip fritillaries painted ladies commas peacocks ringlets coppers skippers heaths reeled off philip my word what a paradise of butterflies i really will never forget this all my life long it was a wonderful picnic wonderful food gorgeous butterflies brilliant flowers and plenty of laughter and jokes kiki was quite mad and when she saw how johns and effans admired her she showed off tremendously she gave them her whole repertoire of noises and effans laughed till he choked the stolid johns munched away keeping his eyes on kiki and occasionally giving a slight smile at her more outrageous sayings indeed to gootness whateffer wipe your feet and blow your nose pifflebunk pardon snowy wandered round taking titbits from everyone the dogs watched from a distance feeling certain that their friend philip would not forget them it was a very good thing that mrs evans had provided so much because with two prisoners and ten dogs every scrap of food would be needed bill johns and effans exchanged news when the children had gone to wander through the clouds of butterflies effans listened gravely trefor and david tried to understand but most of what bill said was beyond them they are brave children look you said effans very brave children whateffer chapter the end of it all they had to sleep out in the open that night effans gave the children the rugs he had brought because all their sleeping things had been left behind in the cave on the mountainside the prisoners slept apart guarded by the dogs it was very warm and snowy got pushed off by everyone when he tried to cuddle down first on top of philip then on jack and then on the girls they had had a very long talk with bill and told him all their adventures down to the last detail bill had marvelled at their accidental discovery of the strange mountain and its even stranger secret he had examined the wings which philip had given to johns to take care of for him i shall take those back to school with me next term he said wont the boys stare i bet some of them will want to try them well all i can say is i should discourage anyone from jumping off the school roof or anything like that and trusting to these wings said bill drily i have a feeling that the ingenious brain behind these things is failing a little the old king will never discover how to make the wings he so much wants to make but he certainly has invented some remarkable things i have had a talk with meier and he has told me why he believed in monally thats the kings real name why did he believe in him asked the children curiously well apparently he has at one time or another produced the most remarkable inventions said bill and meier has backed him and made a great deal of money out of them how he came to find this mountain and the rare metal in its heart which the king wanted for his latest idea of conquering the pull of the earth i havent been able to find out yet dirty work of some sort i expect what are you going to do about everything asked jack well the paratroopers will be sent back home the japanese will be questioned and also sent back i have a feeling theres something queer about them too the king will be taken into safety said bill i shall send two or three scientists to the mountain to let them report on what they find there i shouldnt be surprised if they advise us to destroy everything in it the king has been meddling with dangerous things with no one there to keep a guiding hand on them there might be a vast explosion its a good thing we discovered it isnt it said lucyann a very good thing said bill and its an even better thing you left that note with dapple if it hadnt been for that id never have found you what happened asked jack i came along to find you complete with donkeys after davids silly rush home said bill instead i found only dapple and the note which talked of very peculiar things indeed and made me smell a very large rat go on said philip interested well i snooped round but couldnt find my way in through the roofless cave said bill so the only thing to do was to start finding out about helicopters if somebody could land on that mountaintop then so could i good old bill said jack and then said bill i found when i began making enquiries about all the helicopters in this country who owned them and so on that other people were also making enquiries about a few of them some of the helicopters had been flying off in suspicious circumstances nobody knew where so the police were even then enquiring into the matter and i joined them hotfoot and what did you find asked dinah i found a young pilot with a terrific scar across his face said bill ah you know him i see and he spilt the beans as we say told us he was worried about paratroopers jumping without proper parachutes and so on and so when he went on holiday i took his place on the next helicopter trip and hey presto there i was on the top of the mountain oh bill it was heavenly to see you said lucyann bill had told them all about mrs mannering too how anxious she had been how her hand had healed very well and how she had begged in vain to be allowed to come with effans and the others to meet the children with the donkeys it was a long time before the children could go to sleep that night for the day had been so exciting the dogs lay and snoozed one eye on the prisoners the donkeys lay peacefully together snowy sent off by each of the children wandered off to dapple and lay down beside him dapple was very pleased they got back to the farmhouse by dinnertime the next day for bill had got them all up very early the next morning mrs mannering ran out in joy she had been very worried indeed mrs evans followed indeed to gootness its grand to see you whateffer to think what you have been through look you as much danger as in wartime its glad we are to see you back its well they are looking too said effans in his upanddown voice beaming and that bird indeed she is funnier than ever whateffer look you mimicked kiki also in a singsong voice and effans went off into guffaws imitated by kiki the two of them sounded so silly that everyone else began to laugh too mrs evans of course had got another lovely meal ready for them all and what a lot there were to feed that day too she even found a fine supply of bones for the dogs and philip had to take them a good way off because mrs mannering said she really couldnt bear to hear such a munching and crunching as the ten dogs made short work of the bones what a lot there was to tell mrs evans eyes nearly fell out of her head as she listened and handed out food of all kinds to everyone to think of the children doing such things look you she kept saying inside that mountain look you down in that pit too look you pardon look you said kiki and gave a loud sneeze effans choked and kiki copied him making such a dreadful noise that mrs mannering said she was to go out of the room if she couldnt behave herself oh aunt allie shes just so glad shes back again said jack tapping kiki on the beak send for the doctor said kiki fixing her wicked little eyes on effans who was still choking with laughter send for the weasel send for the lookyou nobody could help laughing jack gave kiki a very large plum hoping to keep her quiet holding it in one clawed foot kiki dug her beak into it making juice squirt all over poor effans pardon said kiki in delight and did it again effans felt that he would exchange every one of his sheep for a bird like that he watched kiki and quite forgot to eat johns was to take the prisoners down to the town with david escorted by two of the dogs mrs evans said she would keep the rest of them at the farmhouse until the police had decided what to do with them mother i suppose we couldnt possibly keep two or three of the dogs could we asked philip longingly good gracious no said his mother its bad enough being landed with so many of your pets when you go back to school but to have three great hungry alsatians to look after would just kill me no they will be happier as police dogs bill was to stay until two or three scientists arrived to go with him to the mountain some police officers were to accompany them too to round up the japanese though bill did not expect any trouble from them at all they probably had bad records and had signed on with meier to keep out of the way of the police for a while and to earn money can we go to the mountain too asked jack hopefully you might lose your way inside bill oh no i shant said bill i found a nice little map of the inside of the mountain in meiers pocket i shant lose my way and you may as well give up all hope of coming with me because youve been in quite enough danger these holidays im afraid if i took you with me another adventure might blow up i never saw such children for smelling out adventures i believe if i took you to visit my dear old aunt we should find she had suddenly been kidnapped in a submarine and you were forced to go to the other end of the world to
