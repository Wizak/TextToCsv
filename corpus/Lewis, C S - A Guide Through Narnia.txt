 a guide through narnia by martha c sammons faltering with bowed heads our altered parents slowly descended from their holy hill all their good fortune left behind and done with out through the oneway pass into the dangerous world these strange countries no rumour in eden had reached the human pair of things not men yet half like men that wandered the earth beyond its walls but now they heard the mountains stirred and shaken all the heapd crags reechoing the deep tarns and caverns shuddering and the abysmal gorges with dismal drums of dwarfs or some prodigious night waked by a thumping shock as of piles being driven two miles away ran till the sunrise shone upon the bouncing monopods at their heels or held their breath hiding and saw their elders the race of giantsthe bulldozers pace heads like balloons toadthick ungainly torsos dotting the plain like ricks memory not built upon a fake from piltdown reaches us we know more than bones can teach before were born we have heard it longsilenced ogres boom voices like gongs reverberate in the mind a dwarfdrum rolls trolls wind unchancy horns c s lewis the adam unparadised i n t r o d u c t i o n the purpose of this book is to tell you something about the creator of the seven narnia books how he came to write them to summarize the history of narnia and then to talk about what the pevensie children learn during their adventures and their meaning to readers of these chronicles published during a relatively brief timeonly about yearsthe narnia tales achieved quick success especially as children read them and their parents eagerly grabbed them up to see what their offspring were so excited about lewiss friend walter hooper tells of a boy in oxford for instance whose parents found him chopping away at the back of their wardrobe and into the bricks of their house trying to get into narnia the last battle received the carnegie medal for the best childrens book of yet these fairy tales are not just for children as we shall see in fact in recent years these stories have become lewiss most widely read and best selling books especially around college campuses readers range from fourandahalf year olds to monks who read them for their theology to college students analyzing them in depth for college courses and masters theses of all lewiss works ranging from literary criticism to christian apologetics to fiction many believe the seven narnia chronicles to be his best and most lasting work c s lewis once wrote that the test of a good book is the number of times you can read it and find more in it than you did to start withor find that your delight doesnt diminish with rereading although this test seems to hold true for all of lewiss novels the narnia tales seem overwhelmingly packed with adventure suspense humor and sorrow philosophy and theology of course lewis would be the first to urge a reader not to try to find things he didnt see himself in these books or have inherently within him to begin with you may think of them simply as good childrens stories or may sense the many virtues the young heroes and heroines learn during their visits in response to the announcement that the narnia books would be televised beginning in early walter cronkite said the chronicles of narnia have genuine family appeal in a dramatic and compelling way these classics present human values often lacking in todays television loyalty courage caring responsibility truthfulness and compassion produced with care for these values the chronicles of narnia can and i believe will become the classics in television that they are in literature a unique view of man especially in our modern world can be seen in four ordinary english children becoming kings and queens for lewis believed in the potential of each individual to some day be a king or queen of heaven eustace turned into a dragon and literally peeled out of his sins by aslan plus others like him are turned insideout their prideful personalities remade by aslan furthermore each individual learns to obey and to perform his particular task when summoned into aslans world this harmonious plan of things is jarred out of tune by evil which is not only confronted and defeated in a personal internal warfare but externallyin perpetual battles with wolves bad dwarfs white and green witches and their like by experiencing the affects of evil on narnia by learning to recognize the various shapes and disguises of evil and by perceiving the nature of temptation we can certainly better understand it in our own world and learn to overcome it after reading these stories you may return to the real world changed with a new way of looking at things your mind opened to the possibilities of an unseen spiritual world and the limits of merely human intellect and undeveloped imagination on an even deeper level though perhaps you may be touched in a special and personal way by the great lion aslan himselfand the infinite bounding joy he brings and bestows on his country or the terror he evokes in those who fear and hate him or you may hear echoes of some christian concept presented in a startling new way without its stainedglassandsundayschool associations no matter what you have enjoyed about these stories we hope this book helps you understand a little more about the author of the narnia chronicles and more important about the creator author depicted within its pages whose story no one on earth has read which goes on for ever in which every chapter is better than the one before martha c sammons chapter the creator of the narnia chronicles he has made everything beautiful in its time also he has put eternity into mans mind ecclesiastes c s lewis is becoming increasingly well known as the author of an overwhelmingly varied range of books other than the narnia tales he is a well respected authority on medieval and renaissance literature and milton he has written key theological works such as miracles and the problem of pain and his book mere christianity was instrumental in the conversion of people as diverse as watergate felon charles colson and black radical eldridge cleaver the screwtape letters is a unique classic whose main character is a devil advising his nephew on how to corrupt a human soul the slim volume the abolition of man may well be one of the great philosophical books of our time and the science fiction trilogy are to be found in every bookstore lewis is now read three times as much as he was in his lifetime and book sales have increased six fold since his death in for example two million of his books were sold in the us and englandover one million of the narnia chronicles aloneand the trend is increasing when asked what quality about lewis impressed them most members of the new york c s lewis society gave a wide range of responses mentioning such qualities as joy truth imagination wholeness belief holiness light and beauty but why would a bachelor professor of medieval and renaissance literature at cambridge university write seven childrens stories when he was in his fifties while it is always difficult to point categorically to elements of an authors life as influences in his writings we will look at some of the most important events in lewiss life which helped to mold so creative an imagination and which led to the writing of the narnian chronicles if you are interested in learning more lewiss life is described at length by walter hooper and roger green in c s lewis a biography and by lewis himself in his autobiography surprised by joy clive staples lewis was born on november in belfast he died on november the same day john f kennedy was assassinated when his mother died before he was ten lewis was very angry at god for not miraculously healing her like a magician perhaps some of his deep distress at his mothers long illness is reflected in digorys sorrow over his dying mother and her joyous recovery through the lifegiving apple from aslan when lewis was five his family moved to a huge house whose atmosphere had a profound influence on him and his older brother warren lewis said i am a product of long corridors empty sunlit rooms distant noises of gurgling cisterns and pipes and the noise of wind under the tiles because of the typical cold wetness of the climate of great britain the boys were often driven to entertain themselves indoors in the magicians nephew digory and polly explore the attic above their houses just as lewis did their adventures began chiefly because it was one of the wettest and coldest summers there had been for years that drove them to do indoor things you might say indoor exploration such a setting became the matrix for lewiss fertile imagination to grow in fascinated by beatrix potters books and by animal cartoons plus the quantities of books stacked in every available nook in the house lewis began writing his own stories before he was six and up until the time he was he attributes his turn to writing to the fact that he had only one joint in his thumb and thus was clumsy at everything else so he tells us in his autobiography he staked out a claim to one of the attics and decorated it with his own pictures or those from magazines polly plummer had used the bit of the tunnel just beside the cistern as a smugglers cave she had brought up bits of old packing cases and the seats of broken kitchen chairs and things of that sort and spread them across from rafter to rafter so as to make a bit of floor here she kept a cash box containing various treasures and a story she was writing pollys creator c s lewis wrote his first stories in this kind of hideaway too here my first stories were written and illustrated with enormous satisfaction they were an attempt to combine my two chief literary pleasuresdressed animals and knightsinarmour as a result i wrote about chivalrous mice and rabbits who rode out in complete mail to kill not giants but cats his stories were about a medieval country called animalland inhabited by an array of characters such as bublish i a frog lord john big a horse samuel macgoullah and an owl viscount puddiphat the first book called the kings ring centered around the theft of some crown jewels in the reign of benjamin i another book the locked door was written when he was yet shows a style and vocabulary mature for such a young boy there is some evidence that lewiss brother warren was also writing his own stories set in modern india with trains and steamships and lewis may have decided to combine the two worlds and their inhabitants at any rate he created a mythical land called boxen he thus became interested in the setting of animalland and systematically recorded its year history then its geography complete with maps steamship routes and elaborate illustrations of boats although we can see how this might have been the embryo of what later would grow into narnia lewis emphasized that none of the narnian stories or characters were drawn from these childhood tales animalland had nothing whatever in common with narnia except the anthropomorphic beasts animalland by its whole quality excluded the least hint of wonder my invented world was of interest bustle humour and character but there was no poetry even no romance in it it was almost astonishingly prosaic the stories dealt mainly with politics rather than with the more imaginative events and the sense of joythe kind of happiness and wonder that makes you seriousthat pervade narnia a second element runs as a thread throughout all of lewis lifethe search for joy it began as a series of aesthetic experiences scattered through his younger years once warren made a miniature garden in the lid of a biscuit tin with moss twigs and flowers that was the first beauty i ever knew it made me aware of nature as something cool dewy fresh exuberant similarly the low line of the castlereagh hills which he could see from his nursery windowperhaps contoured like the mountains of aslans countrytaught him longing or sehnsucht one day he stood beside a flowering currant bush and the same sensation came over hima desire but desire for what in a certain sense everything else that had ever happened to me was insignificant in comparison later in his life an arthur rackham illustration from siegfried and the twilight of the gods and a line from this retelling of the norse myth engulfed lewis in what he described as pure northernness a vision of huge clear spaces hanging above the atlantic in the endless twilight of northern summer remoteness severity and he felt a return of the sense of distant joy for which he had long searched the myth also contained elements he looked for in religion and he admitted that he loved the god balder before he loved christ throughout all the narnia tales we can sense the spell of aslans country or a glimpse of something no one can quite put their finger on but we should also mention that lewiss life had another side i am telling a story of two lives they have nothing to do with each other on the one side was the inner secret world of imagination on the other that of the intellect the two hemispheres of my mind were in the sharpest contrast on the one side a manyislanded sea of poetry and myth on the other a glib and shallow rationalism nearly all that i loved i believed to be imaginary nearly all that i believed to be real i thought grim and meaningless part of this other half of lewiss life can be associated with his strict formal schooling in one boarding school after another undertones of his feelings about school are certainly obvious in the narnia stories at he attended his first boarding school dressed in the stiff eton collar which he came to hate naturally in narnia and aslan s country not a bit of elastic flannel or starch is to be found setting off for school at the start of a new term he must have felt much like the four pevensie children awaiting the train at the station they were all rather gloomy and noone could think of anything to say lewiss somewhat irrational schoolmaster oldie flogged the boys liberally and indiscriminately at lewis switched to campbell college in belfast where he was introduced to literature by his teacher octie and read fairy tales especially enjoying stories about the dwarfs then while attending prep school he ceased to be a christian up until this time lewis viewed god as more or less a magician whom he wished would go away believing in the doctrines of christianity simply because he feared hell at malvern though the matron introduced lewis to the spirit world of the occult where he became further frustrated at trying hard to feel something when he prayed and it was at malvern college which he attended at where lewis probably learned the great distaste he thenceforth showed for the british school system although he was an excellent student and his teacher smewgy further nourished his love for literature including greek and roman myth he was lonely and miserable at this school a tart or fagging system required that all the younger boys wait continually on the older boys and be ready to serve their whims or succumb to pranks like being locked up in a dark underground room it was all probably much like the misery jill and eustace experience at experiment house where they are bullied or attended to by mean conceited cruel sneaky schoolmates with names like cholmondely major edith winterblott spotty sorner and the two loathesome garrett twins at that time he felt paradoxically that god did not exist and he was angry at him for not existing next his tutor w t kirkpatrick after whom kirke the professor in the lion the witch and the wardrobe is perhaps patterned further influenced lewis with his atheistic positivist logic but it was with the help of kirkes excellent coaching that lewis won a scholarship to oxford he later became a fellow of magdalen college lewiss great love for learning and his endless reading from homer and plato to classical writers to fairy talesdespite the tendency of his schooling to discourage his belief in god is reflected in the narnia tales patched together out of his vast memory they contain fragments reminiscent of malory and the arthurian tradition norse celtic greek and arabian myths and childrens books such as those of potter nesbit and george macdonald a combination of events led to lewiss eventual conversion to christianity and he has since become noted as one of its chief apologists first a number of his closest friends including owen barfield and nevill coghill discussed or more properly argued christian beliefs with him and began to influence his thinking he was especially flabbergasted when an atheist friend admitted that the historical evidence for christianity was quite good also all of the authors lewis especially liked such as spenser milton g k chesterton and even norse myths conveyed a certain religious quality that others lacked in fact lewis regarded most of his reading as a kind of trap for him george macdonalds adult fantasy phantastes presented him with the bright shadow he later identified as holiness later macdonalds childrens books greatly inspired lewiss own writing then lewis discovered a book by samuel alexander called space time and deity in which he read that it was impossible to think about something and experience it simultaneously what this showed him was that everything he had been searching for all his life and mistaking for joy were merely its byproducts only pointers signaling with all fingers that they had their source elsewhere they were only appearances of the absolute of god himself in which we all are rooted so too all the children discover in aslans country their real home the real narnia and england of which all others had been only shoddy reflections thus in a man who had once stubbornly refused to give in knelt down and reluctantly admitted that god was god two years later when he set out on a trip to whipsnade zoo i did not believe that jesus christ is the son of god and when we reached the zoo i did aslans s cure had begun chapter the creation of the narnia tales i am concerned with a certain way of looking at life which was created in me by the fairy tales but has since been meekly ratified by the mere facts g k chestertonthe ethics of elfland it is interesting that lewiss creativity started to flourish in earnest after his conversion one important influence was undoubtedly that of a group of friendshis brother warren j r r tolkien owen barfield hugo dyson and otherswho gathered regularly to read their manuscripts aloud to each other then criticize or debate but how did lewis come to write his narnia books were they simply written for his goddaughter lucy barfield as he suggests in the dedication letter at the beginning of the lion the witch and the wardrobe i wrote this story for you but when i began it i had not realized that girls grow quicker than books as a result you are already too old for fairy tales and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still but some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again or was his purpose to entertain children perhaps in the process teaching them subtle truths about christianity and christian virtues to begin with lewis had only one book in mind the lion the witch and the wardrobe and he says he had no notion of writing any others a hazy sequel only came to mind long after the idea for this book was conceived in autumn four schoolgirls evacuees from london came to spend some time with mrs moore lewiss adopted mother and lewis entertained them on the back of another book written by lewis was found the original opening to the lion this book is about four children whose names were ann martin rose and peter but it is most about peter who was the youngest they all had to go away from london suddenly because of the air raids and because father who was in the army had gone off to the war and mother was doing some kind of war work they were sent to stay with a relation of mothers who was a very old professor who lived by himself in the country thus we can see some similarities between the basic plot and events in lewiss own life at the time lewis says he is not positive what made him in a particular year of my life feel that not only a fairy tale but a fairy tale addressed to children was exactly what i must writeor burst unsure of how he actually got his ideas he is certain that all seven of his books began by seeing pictures in my head at first they were not a story just pictures the lion all began with a picture of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood the picture had been in my mind since i was about then one day when i was about i said to myself lets try to make a story about it other pictures he had in his mind were a queen on a sledge and a magnificent lion then he had to invent reasons why they should appear in those particular situations and the ideas began to bubble up into story form still even after he had begun lewis says he was unsure of where the book was really going and he turned to writing some of his theological books the lion sat thus for years uncompleted then from somewhere suddenly aslan came bounding into it i think i had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time apart from that i dont know where the lion came from or why he came but once he was there he pulled the whole story together and soon he pulled the six other narnian stories in after him by the time lewiss american friend chad walsh visited in the summer of lewis spoke vaguely of completing a childrens book which he begun in the tradition of e nesbit by march he read the first two chapters of the lion the witch and the wardrobe to his friend roger lancelyn green and completed this first book in the narnia series by the end of the month so narnia had begun unsure what should come next lewis decided to move on to explain how the lamppost came to be in narnia walter hooper says that very few original manuscripts of the narnia tales existonly some fragmentsbut they do indicate that lewis did work on ideas which later found their ways into some of the books or were tossed out with the trash a good example is his story of digory and his godmother mrs lefay a magician then he got a better idea and wanted to see what it would be like to be pulled by magic into a new land so what started as a book called drawn into narnia then a horn in narnia became what we know as prince caspian by the end of february the manuscript of the voyage of the dawn treader was ready since lewis liked his first draft of the story and it had come to him quickly and easily he seems to have worked from a brief outline of the book although it contains some plot fragments which lewis never used or else incorporated into prince caspian by july a book first called narnia and the north then the desert road to narnia the horse and the boy cor of archenland the horse stole the boy over the border the horse bree and finally as you must by now have guessed the horse and his boy was completed as you can see lewis had difficulty deciding on titles and many of them were suggested by his publisher the silver chair soon followed the magicians nephew came next now with the characters of both digory and polly and mrs lefay transformed into andrews godmother at last two and onehalf years later came the last battle finished by the end of may the books were published between and and when roger green suggested the name the chronicles of narnia for the series it stuck as a result of his series lewis unlike many authors seems to have achieved almost instant success we can perhaps understand why his friend j r r tolkien who labored over the lord of the rings and the silmarillion for most of his life was somewhat critical of the narnia books he also thought the religion too obvious but lewis received quantities of fan letters especially from children who seemed to react naturally to the ideas in the books but mainly to aslan himself in fact they wanted more lewis however felt he had written enough there are only two times at which you can stop a thing one is before everyone is tired of it and the other is after as for the adult readers lewis was pleased with those who wanted to know the sources of his ideas at first a number of mothers and school mistresses felt the books might frighten children but says lewis the real children like it and i am astonished how some very young ones seem to understand it i think it frightens some adults but very few children most parents read them to find out what all the fuss was about and according to walter hooper became converted and pressed them on their friends now over one million are sold yearly half of them bought by college students illustrations all the illustrations in every edition of the narnia series were drawn by pauline baynes who was commissioned to illustrate the books many letters were written from lewis to miss baynes and demonstrate his approval of her pictures with the exception of the disproportion of the children in the lion could you possibly pretty them up a little her pictures are based on lewiss own sketches or his answers to her questions in fact lewis attributed much of the success of his stories to her illustrations maps of the various lands and oceans are found on the end papers of the geoffrey bles and puffin editions of the voyage of the dawn treader the silver chair and the horse and his boy macmillan paper back editions contain neither the maps nor all the illustrations lewiss view of fairy stories in his letters but especially in the essays collected in a book called of other worlds lewis presents some of his views on fairy tales and writing for children he says that when the imagination in him led him to write the narnia tales he did not begin by first asking what children want and then endeavoring to adapt myself in lewiss opinion such an approach results in what he considered bad childrens literature the type that only attempts to dish up to them what they want or treats them like a distinct and inferior race instead he decided that the fairy tale was the genre best fitted for what he wanted to saythe ideal form which his ideas demanded the only real effect this form had on his style was on the level of his vocabulary lack of erotic love or analytical passages and composition of chapters of almost equal length for reading aloud but his style is remarkably clear and vivid like that of many fairy stories who can forget the many long awaited meals the pevensie children sit down to eatthe nice brown eggs lightly boiled sardines on toast and then buttered toast and then toast with honey and then a sugar topped cake with mr tumnus or the freshly caught trout boiled potatoes and sticky marmalade rolls with the beavers or the turkeys geese peacocks boars heads sides of venison pies shaped like ships or dragons or elephants ice puddings bright lobsters gleaming salmon nuts grapes pineapples peaches pomegranates melons and tomatoes at aslans table lewis gives us deep unforgettable images like eustaces undragoning and the tiniest details down to the dead bluebottle on the windowsill or the slight blister on susans heel a good childrens story says lewis should not be written down as if told to a child in fact we are wrong in believing that childrens stories are written just for children most great fantasy and fairy tales are addressed to everyone and thus the author should speak to his reader simply as one person speaking to another only bad stories are enjoyed just by children no book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally worth reading at the age of fiftyexcept of course books of information the only reason most fairy tales unfortunately gravitated to the nursery is because their elders ceased to like them lewis says when he was ten i read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if i had been found doing so now that i am fifty i read them openly when i became a man i put away childish things including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up in a sense we grow through stages when we are first attracted to fairy tales then ashamed of reading them and finally perhaps return to them as adults some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again lewis wrote to lucy barfield actually according to g k chesterton it is really adults who need fairy tales not children for children still have a sense of awe and wonder at the world simply as it is lewis also agrees with tolkiens assertions in his significant essay on fairy stories that fantasy can give us recoverya cleansing of our vision of the world thereby strengthening our relish for real life thus after reading we return to the real world with renewed pleasure awe and satisfaction the boy does not despise real woods because he has read of enchanted woods writes lewis the reading makes all real woods a little enchanted certainly no one of the children returns from narnia to earth unchanged polly for example notes how the mysterious tunnels in her house seem tame after sojourning in charn eustace of course is inwardly turned around through reading we too learn not to treat things as mere objects as ramandu teaches even in your world that is not what a star is but only what it is made of an interesting turnabout of this renewed vision comes about in the voyage of the dawn treader when caspian is amazed to hear that the children come from a round world he had only read about them in fairy tales but ive always wished there were and ive always longed to live in one oh id give anythingi wonder why you can get into our world and we never get into yours if only i had the chance it must be exciting to live on a thing like a ball theres nothing particularly exciting about a round world when youre there says edmund another result of fairy stories in tolkiens view is the fulfillment of our desires to communicate with other living beings and escape death certainly narnia fulfills both these desires caspian for example says if i hadnt believed in him before now i would now back there among the humans the people who laughed at aslan would have laughed at stories about talking beasts and dwarfs sometimes i did wonder if there really was such a person as aslan but then i sometimes wondered if there were really people like you yet there you are this of course is a quite common aspect of childrens stories though in not many stories are the children actually allowed to die in a railway accident yet escape from death is found in the glorious afterlife with aslan in what tolkien calls eucatastrophe or a truly happy ending are such stories merely escapism or wish fulfillment then no says lewis instead their true significance lies in their ability to arouse in ones mind a longing for he knows not what it stirs and troubles him to his lifelong enrichment with the dim sense of something beyond his reach and far from dulling or emptying the actual world gives it a new dimension of depth this is a special kind of longing this longing says lewis is askesis or a spiritual exercise since we long for another world to see beauty and be united with it that is why we have peopled air and earth and water with gods and goddesses and nymphs and elvesthat though we cannot yet these projections can enjoy in themselves that beauty grace and power of which nature is the image furthermore such stories not only present to us a whole spectrum of experiences in concrete form but in giving us experiences we never had before thus add to life so although the tales may not be exactly like real life they may show us what reality may be like at some more central region this leads us to one of the most important aspects of the narnia tales the quality of joy which tolkien says results from good fantasya sudden glimpse of the underlying reality or truth for in every eucatastrophe we see a glimmer of an even deeper realitythe christian story itself the fairy story found in the gospels embraces the essence of all fairy stories says tolkien the birth of christ is the eucatastrophe of the story of the incarnation this story begins and ends in joy it has preeminently the inner consistency of reality there is no tale ever told that men would rather find was true chapter the chronicles of narnia it was about a cup and a sword and a tree and a green hill i know that much but i cant remember and what shall i do and she never could remember and ever since that day what lucy means by a good story is a story which reminds her of the forgotten story in the magicians book the voyage of the dawn treader although the narnia books are numbered in the sequence of their writing beginning with the lion the correct chronological order of the events narrated is as follows the magicians nephew the lion the witch and the wardrobe the horse and his boy prince caspian the voyage o f the dawn treader the silver chair and the last battle we will not only briefly review each story but fill in the events between the stories from information provided by an outline of narnian history which lewis wrote after the stories were published and which is reproduced in walter hoopers essay past watchful dragons in imagination and the spirit the magicians nephew the events in the magicians nephew take place in chronologically this is the first book of the series because it describes how narnia was created the whole adventure begins one day in england when a year old boy named digory peers over a wall and meets a little girl named polly plummer one day they accidently find themselves in the secret attic study of digorys eccentric uncle andrew a dabbler in magic by tricking polly into touching a special ring he has created out of magic dust uncle andrew sends polly off into a place called the wood between the worlds bravely deciding to rescue her digory follows with another magic ring and two different ones to bring them back the two children discover that through dozens of small pools in this drowsy quiet woodland they can enter various other worlds diving into one of the pools they find themselves in charn a dead world where everyone including jadis the witch is frozen into immobility by means of an enchantment digory insatiably curious strikes a tiny bell which wakes the witch by grabbing hold of digory she comes back with them to englandmuch to the childrens dismay after causing havoc with uncle andrew and his sister as well as the police and a cabby the witch is yanked back into still another world by digory and a magic ring unfortunately polly andrew the cabby and his horse strawberry are also transported into this new world of nothing nothing that is until they hear the voice of a magnificent lion who sings life into being and gradually creates a world before their eyes sun flowers grass beasts two of each animal are chosen by the lion to be talking beasts and set over all the other animals the cabbys wife helen is summoned into narnia soapsuds still on her arms and she and the cabby become the first king and queen of narnia for in that land only humans can rule meanwhile digory is sent on the task of getting an apple from a hill far away in the western wilds he is provided with aid from polly and strawberrywho has now become fledge a flying horse when they arrive at the garden digory again encounters jadis who tempts him convincingly to eat an apple as she is doing although digory is certainly hungry and also desperately wishes to take an apple back to his mother to cure her of her illness he does not submit to the witchs enticement but obediently returns with an apple to aslan the lion from this apple comes the tree of protection which guards narnia against the witch for many years aslan rewards digorys obedience and patience by presenting him with an apple which wonderfully cures his mother the seed of this apple grows into a tree in england from the wood of which digory later builds a magic wardrobe during the years that follow earth years and narnian years pass before humans return to narnia and according to lewiss outline several events occur involving surrounding countries king frank and queen helens youngest son col leads followers into archenland which lies just south of narnia and becomes its first king then outlaws from archenland set up a kingdom further south called calormen the calormenes in turn colonize telmar but behave so wickedly that aslan turns them into dumb beasts the lone islands in the great sea east of narnia are given to king gale as his reward for delivering the inhabitants from a dragon then narnian years after its creation jadis returns out of the north and the long winter begins the lion the witch and the wardrobe the events in this book take place narnian years after the creation of narnia or the year in england by now digory is old professor kirke and the four pevensie childrenpeter edmund susan and lucycome to stay with him to get away from the airraids in london one day lucy hiding in the professors magic wardrobe accidentally discovers not the expected back wall of the closet but the crunch of snow underfoot and lines of dark fir trees ahead of her she meets a faun mr tumnus who explains that this is narnia a land where it is always winter and never christmas because of the reign of the white witch when lucy returns home however it is not only the exact same moment as when she entered but worse none of her brothers and sisters believe her story of entering narnia next edmund accidentally enters narnia through the same wardrobe and unfortunately encounters the witch herself who appears to him exceedingly beautiful enticing him with turkish delight and the promise of being king of narnia she convinces him to return bringing the others with him for her to destroy for a prophecy says that when four humans gain the throne her reign will be ended edmund returns to the professors house but having become increasingly nasty from his contact with the witch refuses to admit that lucy was right about narnia all along finally all four children enter the wardrobe one day they discover that mr tumnus has been punished for disobeying the witch and a robin leads them to mr and mrs beaver who help them the beavers explain that aslan king of narnia and of all the beaststhe great lion himselfis on the move and has returned to narnia and all four children experience totally different reactions to his name peter susan and lucy decide to hurry to aslan as soon as possible edmund however quietly slips off to find the witch only to discover that she seems quite a different person than before horrified that aslan has returned she wildly sets off in her sledge dragging with her poor cold hungry edmund all around them springtime gradually but steadily reverses the frozen enchantment which has paralyzed narnia for years celandines crocuses primroses laburnums bluebells all begin to bloomand in the very same order as they bloom in our own world the three children reach aslan in time to be ensnared in a brief battle in which peter bravely kills the witchs chief fenris ulf and edmund is rescued he ashamedly asks forgiveness but according to the deep magic the law of the emperoroversea he must be killed as a traitor aslan offers to be sacrificed instead lucy and susan then watch that terrible scene when aslan willingly submits himself to the mockery and jests of the witchs horrible lackeys and is stabbed with a stone knife on the great stone table but aslan knew that according to a deeper magic if a willing and perfect victim were sacrificed in a traitors stead the witch would not only lose her claim on the individual but death would start working backwards while lucy and susan are mourning his death aslan opens his eyes leaps from the broken table and appears to the girls more vibrant and alive than ever romping joyously with them to the castle aslan breathes on every statue of a creature frozen by the witch and frees them leading them all in a victorious battle against the witch and her forces peter becomes high king of narnia and the three other children kings and queens they rule in narnia for narnian years during their reign the next story takes place the horse and his boy a boy named shasta living in calormen with arsheesh the fisherman discovers one day that arsheesh is not his real father in fact he overhears him bargaining to sell him to a tarkhan or great lord he decides to

taken to their quarters where he overhears susans plot to secretly escape calormen instead of marrying rabadash shasta comes facetoface with his lookalike corin who helps him escape he awaits the others at the designated meeting place the deserted tombs of the ancient kings outside the city there a giant cat comforts and protects him at night meanwhile aravis is aided by an old but silly friend lasaraleen another calormen princess by accident the two girls overhear rabadashs plans to win susan by conquering archenland and later narnia lasaraleen helps aravis escape the city and she and shasta and their two horses are once again reunited quickly they begin the tiring and lengthy journey north over the mountains the desert and a valley during the ride a lion snaps at the horses and scratches aravis on the back while a hermit cares for aravis and the horses a tired and disheartened shasta must travel on alone to archenland and warn king lune of rabadashs plans he alerts lune but gets separated for a time from his army that night lost on a mountain pass shasta is joined by a giant shadow in the darkness who explains to him that all along there has been but one lion who has protected him spurred him on to his duty and even helped a boat bring him to calormen as a baby shasta recognizes the glory of aslan himself and refreshed by a tiny stream aslan provides for him shasta sets off in the morning he rejoins the battle though wounded during most of it rabadashs army is soundly defeated and aslan punishes rabadash by turning him into a donkey if he strays from tashs temple shasta learns that he is the twin brother of corin stolen as a baby because of a prophecy that he would one day save archenland he eventually becomes king cor of archenland one day after they have long been reigning in narnia the four kings and queens set out to hunt for the white stag upon discovering the very same lamp post where they entered narnia they return home through the wardrobe to find that no time has elapsed since they entered many years after the children leave narnia the telmarines invade and conquer it and caspian i becomes king the telmarines silence the talking beasts and spread false rumors about aslan and the old narnia one of caspians descendants caspian ix is murdered by his own brother miraz who usurps the throne caspian x is born and the story of his attempts to defeat his wicked uncle and restore the old narnia is told in the next book prince caspian young caspian raised by his uncle miraz is told the real story of his past by his tutor dr cornelius who is part dwarf caspian runs away in order to find the old narnian talking beasts he meets trufflehunter the badger the dwarfs nikabrik and trumpkin and eventually many other narnian beasts at the council of dancing lawn the small army of narnian creatures plan to make war on miraz after minor skirmishes and defeats caspian decides to blow the magic horn that will send for help though skeptical trumpkin offers to journey to cair paravel once the narnian capital to await the possible return of the four kings and queens thus just one year after the pevensies had returned to england they find themselves pulled back into narnia by the blast of caspians horn but they are horrified to find that years have passed since they were last in narnia trumpkin on the other hand cannot believe that these four children are the help they had been awaiting and has to be convinced that they are indeed royal material as the group travels to the meeting place at aslans how they find that after all these years the landmarks and terrain of narnia are so altered that they get lost asian appears to lucy and points the way but the rest of the children stubbornly continue in the opposite direction naturally they reach a dead end barely miss a confrontation with mirazs forces and must retrack to where they started asian appears to lucy once more and though the others cannot see him this time they grudgingly follow his leading one by one each child begins to see the great lion guiding them easily to the how arriving just in time to overhear nikabriks plan to call on the witch for aid they defeat him and his evil cohorts a werewolf and a hag in handtohand combat next peter challenges miraz to a duel and sopespian and glozelle mirazs lords dupe their monarch into accepting the duel culminates in a battle between both armies miraz is killed and his army defeated asian leads a band of joyous revellers through the villages celebrating caspians restoration to the throne then asian prepares a doorway in the sky for the telmarines who wish to return to their homeland in the south seas peter and susan sadly learn that they are now too old ever to return to narnia and all four children step through the doorway back into their own world the voyage of the dawn treader three narnian years and one earth year pass before lucy and edmund are called back to narnia the two pevensie children are staying with their bumptious young cousin eustace clarence scrubb and one day all three are drawn into a picture on eustaces wall into narnias eastern sea and caspians ship the dawn treader caspian they learn is setting out for the eastern islands to find seven of his fathers lost lords who long before were sent off by his evil uncle miraz on a voyage of exploration on the journey too is reepicheep king of the talking mice and most valiant of the beasts of narnia he is seeking asians country at the end of the world eustace is miserably seasick and indignant at the whole affair but the pevensie children eagerly anticipate a new adventure their first stop after several days of sailing is the island of felimath where they find the first lost lord lord bern felimath is one of the lone islands and although lewis hints that he would like to tell their story in another book we learn no more about them the children are captured by slave traders but caspian is bought by lord bern who on learning caspian is narnias king helps them plan their escape felimath is ruled by an incompetent and bumbling man named gumpas the stereotyped politican who sticks solely to statistics graphs and appointments on his calendar by feigning to have an entire fleet of forces caspian overthrows gumpas and declares lord bern ruler of the lone islands after nearly three weeks on felimath the little company leaves to continue its mission twenty six days later badly damaged by a storm the ship and its crew find haven on an island which they dub dragon island in order to escape work eustace wanders off and comes upon a dying dragon but eustace who has read all the wrong books has no idea what the creature is taking shelter in the dragons cave eustace discovers a cache of magnificent treasures and after slipping a bracelet on his arm and cramming his pockets full of precious things he falls asleep but when he awakens feeling not quite himself he finds he is walking on all fours and breathing smoke peering into a stream he discovers he has turned into a dragon when the others figure out what has happened they find their cousins plight has much improved him causing him to become more helpful and reasonable then one night asian appears and orders eustace to follow him after eustace unsuccessfully attempts to remove his skin by shedding it like a banana peel asian tears off the last layer of painful scales and bathes him in a clear pool restoring him to true boyhood thereafter eustaces behavior is markedly changed the children deduce that lord octesian was probably the other dragon or had been destroyed by the dragon after the dawn treader visits burnt island the crew battles a fearful sea serpent who almost engulfs the ship five days of sailing bring them to deathwater island where the crew discovers a pool which turns anything dropped in it to gold lord restimar they realize must have bathed in this water and been turned into a gold statue when they begin to quarrel over the great possibilities of capitalizing on the wealth this magic pool would give aslan sternly appears to bring them to their senses on the next island the island of the voices lucy is asked by the dufflepuds strange creatures who hop around on one umbrellalike foot to find a spell to deuglify them to accomplish this she must go into a magicians house and read his magic book among other things lucy finds a spell to make herself beautiful a wonderful story about a cup sword and green hill as well as a spell to let her know what her friends think of her when lucy says this spell aslan appears to her he introduces her to the magician who turns the invisible dufflepuds into visible monopods then for thirteen days they sail for the dark island where nightmarish dreams come true there the group discovers haggard and whitehaired lord rhoop and aslan appears as an albatross to guide them out at worlds end island the group finds the last three of the lost lords revilian argoz and mavramornsleeping at a sumptuous banquet table there they also meet ramandu a retired star and his beautiful daughter this is aslans table where the food renewed daily is served for those who travel this far the three lords had quarreled over the sacred stone knife once used by the white witch to stab aslan at the moment they touched it they had been cast into an enchanted sleep all but one sailor set off for the end of the world the light grows brighter and brighter the sea smoother and white with lilies and the water clear and luminous like drinkable light keeps the group nourished and unwearied quivering with excitement reepicheep sails off alone to aslans country now after a year of travelling caspian regretfully decides to turn back with the ship to narnia the three children meet aslan who appears to them first as a lamb then a lion and promises them that they can come to his land from all worlds and will know him even better in their own through a rip in the sky they return to cambridge thus ends lucys and edmunds last adventure in narnia caspian returns to narnia to marry ramandus daughter three years after his voyage fifteen years later a son rilian is born one day as ramandus daughter is riding in narnia she stops to rest a green serpent stings her and she dies twenty year old rilian sets off to avenge her death and entranced by a beautiful lady dressed in green is not heard from again though many seek for him ten years later eustace and his schoolmate jill pole are called into narnia to find rilian the silver chair although it is still the year of the dawn treader voyage narnian years have now passed since eustace visited narnia miserably unhappy and desperate to leave their school experiment house jill and eustace enter narnia through a gate in the wall they find themselves high on a precipice in aslans country overlooking all of narnia after eustace accidently tumbles off the cliff and floats away jill finds herself alone with aslan their task she learns is to find the lost rilian which they will accomplish only if they obey four signs first they will meet an old dear friend whom they must greet if they are to receive help then they must journey from narnia north to a ruined giant city where they will find writing on a stone they must do what it says prince rilian will be recognized by the fact that he will be the first person who asks them to do something in aslans name jill is then blown softly on aslans sweet breath to narnia where she rejoins eustace caspian now and thus unrecognizable by eustace is preparing to sail to terebinthia in hopes of finding aslan and seeking his advice glimfeather the owl carries the children first to cair paravel then to a parliament of owls where they are briefed on rilians story then north to the swampy home of a gloomy lanky froglike creature named puddleglum a marshwiggle who becomes a member of their team on their mission of search and rescue the three head north to ettinsmoor the land of the giants a lovely lady the lady of the green kirtle who is accompanied by an armored knight advises them to press on to the giant city of harfang where they will receive food and shelter against puddleglums better judgment the children desperately insist on finding the city to get relief from the bitter snowy cold through a series of ruins and trenches they reach the castle where they are welcomed fed and bathed aslan appears to jill in a dream and shows her the inscription under me written outside on the ruins when the three discover that the giants mean to have them as the main course of their autumn feast they slip through a crack in the ruinsthe third sign they now realize they have muffed the first three signs beneath the earth they descend through tunnel after dark tunnel into a strange land where the varied faces of earthmen sadly and silently labor in the city among a variety of creatures they even see father time himself sleeping until the worlds end they are taken to the castle of a green witch who boasts though under earth and throneless now i be yet while i lived all earth was under me she is the cruel ruler of this country called the shallowlands in her castle also lives a knight who the witch has promised will be king of overland once the earthmen dig through to the surface during one hour of every day however he is under a spell by which he becomes enraged and is transformed into a serpent daily during this hour the witch binds him to a silver chair the children fearfully watch as the awful change comes over him and then he bids them in aslans name to free him recognizing the last sign as well as the danger of obeying it the three nevertheless unbind the prince who destroys the awful chair the witch returns to discover what has been done and causes a drowsy smoke and music to fill the room enchanting them into believing there is no other world but hers but stouthearted puddleglum stamps out the fire and after renouncing her world leads caspian into killing the witch as she turns into a snake noisy fireworks signal the earthmens glee at the end of the witchs hold over them golg a gnome explains that beneath the witchs land is the really deep land of bism inhabited by gnomes and salamandersa fiery world of live gems and a delicious smell the gnomes dive into that realm through a crack before a shift in the earth closes it forever through one of the tunnels to the overworld the four escape the witchs realm to discover that they are back in narnia itself they are rescued by dwarfs performing the great snow dance riding on centaurs the children arrive in time to see rilian greeting his sick fathers returning ship although caspian dies the children are taken to aslans country where on aslans mountain they witness caspians restoration to life with a drop of blood from the great lions paw promising that some day they too will return to stay forever aslan leads them triumphantly back to their school where he terrifies the children and headmistress so badly that there is a grand shakeup and experiment house ends up as a much better school other than the uprising of outlaws in lantern waste and the building of towers to guard the region we know little of the years of narnian history between the silver chair and the final book the last battle during the final days of narnia shift the ape who lives near lantern waste finds a lions skin in the water he convinces his poor gullible donkey follower puzzle to put it on and pose as aslan then he spreads false rumors that aslan has returned and aggressively demanded changes in narniatrees felled talking animals driven to work dwarfs and animals sold as slaves to the calormenes the narnians begin to believe that aslan is not at all like the lion they have heard about in stories and legends meanwhile king tirian of narnia seventh in descent from rilian and his dear friend jewel the unicorn hear of all these changes and believe them to be lies tirian angrily murders two calormenes and is captured desperate and only half believing that the changes are from aslan he calls for help from the past kings and queens in a dream he sees all seven friends of narniadigory and polly peter edmund lucy jill and eustace eating around a table immediately jill and eustace appear before him rescuing not only tirian but jewel and puzzle as well during this time much has happened on earth digory and polly feeling that they are somehow needed in narnia hold a sort of reunion for all who have been to narnia peter and edmund are sent to london to dig up the magic rings digory used many years ago to first enter narnia and are scheduled to meet the train to hand them over jill eustace digory polly lucy and it so happens mr and mrs pevensie all go on the same train which crashes at the station killing all of them as well as peter and edmund at that moment nearly one earth week after seeing tirian aslan brings jill and eustace into narnia in his own way tirian and the children optimistically determine to explain the apes deception to the narnians and restore the old order however all dwarfs except poggin bitterly refuse to believe in anything but themselves after tirians group sees the nightmarish birdlike calormen god tash flying toward shifts camp they join forces with a meager band of loyal narnians led by roonwit the centaur cair paravel he reports has been taken over by the enemy thus they hurry to shifts camp hoping to reveal the truth to the narnians they find that shift has set up a stable where the narnians gather at night by a giant bonfire his new cohorts rishda the calormen captain and ginger the cat have now convinced the narnians that aslan and tash are the same ginger and the ape frustrate all their hopes of unmasking the imposter by telling the narnians that there is a donkey loose masquerading as aslan ginger the cat cockily enters the stable expecting to find nothing but instead finds tash and shoots out again terrified out of speech this of course fulfills aslans prophecy that talking beasts would return to dumb beasts if they chose evil a calormen named emeth bravely goes in next in hopes of meeting tash and never returns the real battle then begins while the dogs and moles join tirians side the dwarfs fight for themselves in vast confusion as the enemy presses in on them eustace is hurled into the stable followed by all eleven dwarfs rishda taken by tash and tirian but instead of finding the fearful god tash in the stable as he had feared tirian sees the seven glorious kings and queens of narnia and aslan himself standing before him beyond the stable door he has entered a luscious green and fragrant country the dwarfs however see only darkness hear aslans voice as an angry snarl and taste rotten food instead of the sumptuous banquet he spreads for them aslan shows all the kings and queens that narnia on the other side of the stable door is ending first father time is called to blow his horn and the living stars fall gleaming to the ground next all the animals stream to aslan and either pass through the door if they love him or to his left and into his shadow if they fear him giant dragons and lizards then devour the vegetation and the sea rises to cover it all the sun and moon turn red flame into each other and father time squeezes the burning ball like an orange until all is dark finally peter locks the door on narniaicy cold and void aslan then leads them further up and further in through the stable door to his own country there they find not only the fragrant green land they had always longed for and discover their own bodies to be full of life and vigor but they see all the old friends they had ever known or heard about susan however is not among them for she is no longer a friend of narnia on the other hand emeth the calormen is there for he had always sought the truth they scale the great waterfall and enter the golden gates of a garden with a tree at its center far below narnia and england stretch out like spurs jutting off from the mountains of aslans country but they are the real narnia and englandthose which they had known before were only imitations the children are now ready to begin the great story lucy had once read about in the magicians magic book a story which goes on forever chapter the country of narnia nothing is yet in its true form till we have faces other worlds according to lewiss friend j r r tolkien man is a subcreator when he creates a fantasy world although now long estranged man is not wholly lost nor wholly changed disgraced he may be yet is not dethroned and keeps the rags of lordship once he owned man subcreator the refracted light through whom is splintered from a single white to many hues and endlessly combined in living shapes that move from mind to mind though all the crannies of the world we filled with elves and goblins though we dared to build gods and their houses out of dark and light and sowed the seed of dragonstwas our right that right has not decayed we make still by the law in which were made man thus creates because he is made in the image of the creator and because there is a part of him which is unsatisfied by the rational natural world using materials from the world around him and drawing on spiritual reality he expresses truths that cannot be expressed or explained in any other way but to create convincing other worlds lewis believed that he must draw on the only real other world he knew that of the spirit in his essay the weight of glory he writes do you think i am trying to weave a spell perhaps i am but remember your fairy tales spells are used for breaking enchantments as well as for inducing them and you and i have need of the strongest spell that can be found to wake us from the evil enchantment of worldliness which has been laid upon us for nearly a hundred years professor kirke suggests that there are probably other worlds right around the corner but the chinks or chasms which connect these worlds are growing rarer narnia is described as one of these secret countries that is reala really other worldanother natureanother universesomewhere you would never reach even if you travelled through the space of this universe for ever and evera world that could be reached only by magic but first the children enter an inbetween place the wood between the worlds digory has the sensation of coming up into a new world only to discover that he has entered not a new world but an inbetween place from which he can get into other worlds it contains dozens of pools with a different world at the bottom of each of them though a dreamy sleepy place where nothing seems to happen it is alivewarm and rich as a plumcake the leafy trees grow so close together that they allow only a green daylight to seep in and he can almost hear them growing digory feels as though he has always been there but the second time the children try to enter from their own world they enter a world of nothing the creation of narnia according to lewiss timeline for narnia narnia was created in ad although the children enter a world of nothingness narnia is still a potential waiting to be born and they feel solid earth beneath them aslan creates it by singing the most beautiful noise digory had ever heard other voices blend in harmony with it but in higher cold tingling silvery voices which become stars constellations and planets bursting into sight in the sky next as the sky becomes lighter digory can see the many colors of a fresh hot and vivid earth then a young sun arises laughing with joy a soft rippling music produces first grass then trees by now polly notices a connection between the notes aslan is singing and the things he is creating for example a series of deep prolonged notes produces dark fir trees light rapid notes produce primroses but a wild invigorating tune produces humps in the ground from which a joyous menagerie of animals emerge moles dogs stags frogs panthers leopards showers of birds butterflies bees and elephants it becomes clear that aslans creations are things he imagines and the song comes from these ideas in his mind a song so special that it makes you hot and flushed wanting to jump and shout this idea of god creating the universe through singing it into being is found also in tolkiens silmarillion in which eru creates the ainor or holy ones as offspring of his thought and propounds to them musical themes harmoniously they sing before him a great music whereas evil and proud beings desire to sing their own music which results in discord both lewis and tolkien seem to be drawing on a medieval concept which uses music as a metaphor for the harmony of the universe the ancients believed that the planets for example were aligned in such exact mathematical relationships that they gave off a special musicthe music of the spheres in this scheme the universe is represented as a musical instrument that includes all creation from angels to stones the hand of god stretches out to tune it a common th century notion of the world pictures an organ with god as primal organ player after singing narnia into being aslan speaks narnia narnia narnia awake love think speak be walking trees be talking beasts be divine waters narnia as aslan first creates it makes our world seem hard and cruel in comparison for narnia is a country of walking trees visible naiads and dryads in the streams and trees fauns and satyrs dwarfs giants centaurs and talking beasts the existence of mythological creatures such as these in narnia grows out of an intriguing idea that occurs quite frequently in lewiss worksthat what is myth and legend in our world may be factual reality in another even bacchus the greek god of wine is seen romping through narnia changing the streams to wine one of the books in mr tumnus home is titled with faun humor is man a myth narnian geography and government by gathering information from the seven narnia tales we get a fairly comprehensive idea of the geography of narnia and the surrounding countries lewis mapped his own rough conception of narnian topography and from this sketch pauline baynes later drew a more detailed map for lewis this map is available in the bles and puffin editions of prince caspian and is also sold as a large poster the map reproduced on the cover of this book and on page was drawn by sylvia smith and is also the result of considerable research narnia itself seems to resemble lewiss favorite parts of the english and irish countrysides with its avenues of beeches sunny oak glades deep forests and orchards of snowwhite cherry trees its windy slopes of gorse bushes acres of blue flowers wild valleys and heathery mountains and ridges its roaring waterfalls winding rivers plashy glens mossy rocks and caverns the low hills to the north and the moorlands lead to the wild and desolate land of the giant stronghold described predominantly in the silver chair this northern land of barren rocky plains frigid mountains and stony boulders and ruins has a bleak windy snowy climate unlike the rich and dewy atmosphere of narnia to the west of narnia is the western wild where one can see high snowcrowned mountains and glaciers and verdant valleys with streams tumbling down from the mountains sparkling like blue jewelry here the great waterfall crashes down to create the caldron pool then the river of narnia winds across the land to the sea this is where the beginning and ending of narnia takes place lantern waste is located on the east side where the children enter narnia in the lion and where the lamppost springs up south of narnia is another ridge of mountains across which lie two countries archenland connected to narnia by a pass and calormen across a sandy desert the great sea lying to the east of narnia contains all the islands visited in the voyage of the dawn treader galma terebinthia the seven islands the lone islands the dragon deathwater darkness and worlds end islands beyond this is aslans country and the end of the world in the voyage of the dawn treader the topography of narnia and these countries is described as being like a great round but flat table with the waters of all the oceans pouring endlessly over the edge during the creation of narnia aslan chooses two of each animal by touching their noses with his these become talking beasts which are put in charge of the dumb beasts yet only a human can be a king or queen of narnia mapgif the hierarchy is thus as follows the emperoroversea and his son aslan peter kings and queens minor nobility talking beasts and longaevi longlivers creatures such as nymphs satyrs and centaurs dumb beasts the kings and queens of narnia rule from a castle on the eastern seacoast named cair paravel which means an inferior court implying its administration is still subordinate to the emperoroversea life there is very reminiscent of the medieval arthurian setting of coronations feasts falconry rich clothing and courtly language as in medieval courts old epics are told aloud for example the children hear the story of the horse arid his boy retold years later battle clothes are bright tunics steel or silver caps covered with jewels and with winged sides and straight swords their banner depicts a red lion yet the subjects of this monarchy retain their freedom in fact there is no slavery at all in narnianot even marriage against ones will aslan instructs king frank first narnian king that a good king rules kindly and fairly with no favorites and is to be first in the charge and last in retreat from enemies the creatures in narnia seem to come straight out of the pages of classical mythology giants centaurs unicorns dwarfs the trees can hear and even assume human form strangely branchy and leafy birchgirls beechgirls larchgirls shaggy wizened and hearty oak men with frizzled beards lean and melancholy elms and shockheaded hollies even common animals like foxes badgers mice moles and squirrels are larger than in our world as in the legends of the north american indians even the stars like coriakin and ramandu are glistening real people with white hot spears and whose long hair shines like burning silver narnia in fact has its own constellationsthe ship hammer and leopardand starsspearhead tarva and alambil of course there is not always peace in narnia because it is surrounded by powerful enemies who could always invade it it is relatively smallone quarter the size of the smallest calormen province but for the most part there are years and years of peace and joyful activitiesdances feasts and great tournaments hunting parties treasureseeking and midnight dances the great snow dance described in the silver chair is especially unique on the first moonlit night when snow is on the ground a ring of dwarfs dressed in fine clothes throw snowballs in perfect time to the sound of wild music if everyone is in the right place no one gets hit here lewis may again be drawing on a rich metaphor of the middle ages which other writers such as tolkien and madeleine lengle have also used in their works the great dance like the music of the spheres was a metaphor for the perfect harmony joy and unity of the universe in which every person animal planet and microorganism played its part in a precisely patterned rhythm ramandu for example says that when he has been rejuvenated he will once again rise and tread the measures of this great dance narnian history after lewis wrote the seven stories he drew up an outline of narnias history an historical timechart of narnia based on lewiss outline and the information found in the stories themselves is shown on pages there are narnian years between its creation and destruction corresponding to earth years during the history of narnia there was an old narnia and a new narnia the former consisted of years of peace and joy when every day and week was better than the last and to recollect those happy years is like looking down from a high hill onto a rich lovely plain full of woods and waters and cornfields which spread away and away till it got thin and misty from distance actually the story of the new narnia begins with the story of telmar telmar telmar an island beyond the western mountains of narnia is first colonized by the calormenes in the year when these calormenes behave wickedly aslan turns them into dumb beasts and the country is laid waste years later some pirates in our word are driven by storm onto an island in the south seas they kill the natives and take native women as their wives one day they become drunk and quarrel six flee with the women to the center of the island then climb up a mountain into a cave this cave is a chink or chasm between worlds and they fall through to the uninhabited land of telmar their descendants become fierce and proud in the narnian year there is a famine and caspian i of telmar leads an invasion of narnia and becomes king but the telmarines begin to change narnia for they silence the beasts trees and fountains kill and drive away the dwarfs and fauns and try to erase all memory of them since they fear the sea they let woods grow up around cair paravel and the coast to separate them from the water then because they hate the trees they invent a story that these black woods are full of ghosts so by the time of prince caspian both the telmarines and old narnians have forgotten the truth about old narniait is all just stories caspian admits that he has often wondered if aslan is real and if there actually were any talking beasts and dwarfs as we know from the story of prince caspian narnia is restored to the old order at the end of the book aslan allows those who wish to go back to the south sea islanda land of good wells fresh water fruitful soil timber and fishthrough a special doorway that chasm between the two worlds is then closed forever timelinegif calormen far to the south of narnia below archenland and across the mountains and a great desert lies calormen as lewis describes the calormenes and their capital city they are reminiscent of the turks or arabians supposedly lewis disliked the arabian nights and perhaps used that culture as a basis for his invention of the evil enemies of narnia calormen is created in narnian year when outlaws from archenland flee south across the desert and set up the kingdom a calormene visitor is readily recognized the spike of a helmet projected from the middle of his silken turban and he wore a shirt of chain mail by his side hung a curving scimitar a round shield studded with bosses of brass hung at his back and his right hand grasped a lance his face was dark the mans beard was dyed crimson and curled and gleaming with scented oil typical calormenes are grave mysterious wise cruel and ancient wearing orange turbans flowing robes and shoes turned up at the toe seeming to lack imagination and creativity the calormenes write poetry consisting only of maxims and apothegmsabout topics other than love and warand they must be taught to tell stories tashbaan is the calormen capital located on an island between two rivers buildings rise on either side of the streets which zigzag up the hill and completely cover the island in between are masses of orange and lemon trees roof gardens balconies archways battlements spires and pinnacles if you look closely though you can see crowded narrow streets full of rude bumping people and sniff the pervasive smell of garlic onions refuse and unwashed bodies the calormenes adhere rigidly to a strict hierarchy although they care nothing for aslan they have a deitytash a hideous birdlike creature with a vultures or eagles head and four arms the ruler is called the tisroc under whom are tarkhans and tarkheenas such as aravis or lasaraleen in the story of the horse and his boy lasaraleens lifestyle is much like that of a turkish princess as she rides proudly atop a platform carried by servants and shielded by lavish curtains underland and bism in the silver chair we learn that narnias world has several layers the green witchs world of underland lies just beneath the ruins of an ancient northern city and is a perversion of the real world the children must descend through numerous caverns and suffocating tunnels each cave lower than the last there are no wind or birds but only a greenish light batlike animals and a city full of docile miserable earthmen like the river styx in mythology a river glides lazily to the witchs castle but the green witchs world is sandwiched in between narnia and another deeper wonderful realm for beneath her false shallowlands is bism this is the really deep land fathoms beneath the queens realm bism is the real home of the gnomish earthmen to whom living on the upper world sounds horrible you cant really like itcrawling about like flies on the top of the world through a chasm in the earth from which seeps a strong heat and a rich sharp exciting smell the children can see brilliant fields and groves of hot bright blues reds greens and whites the gems there they learn are alive through all this runs a river of fire inhabited by salamanders lewis is drawing on the ancient tradition that subterranean fireone of the four elementswas inhabited by gnomes and salamanders in fact he wrote a poem about the true nature of gnomes a gnome moves through earth like an arrow in the air at home like a fish within the seamless foamless liberty of the water that yields to it everywhere beguiled with pictures fancied in my childhood subterranean rivers beside glimmering wharfs hammers upon anvils pattering and yammering torches and tunnels the cities of the dwarfs but in perfect blackness underneath the surface in a silence unbroken till the planet cracks their sinewy bodies through the dense continuum move without resistance and leave no tracks but bism also seems to represent a far deeper reality which rilian reluctantly decides not to explore the gnomes plunge headlong into it just as robin in lewis story the man born blind dives into the light and warmth symbolic of the beauty lewis says we long to bathe in entering narnia the idea of a parallel world reached only by magic is a favorite device in fantasy and it is through magic that the children of our world enter narnia how did you get there said jill the only way you canby magic said eustace almost in a whisper but professor kirke explains that the children can never get into narnia a second time by the same route in fact they cant try to get there at all instead aslan calls them in his own way and time and it happens when they arent expecting it the children are usually called to narnia when someone in a pinch needs them although they are assured that there are many many years of peace in narnia the only way to aslans country from all worlds is across a river bridged by aslan himself in the magicians nephew digory and polly enter by means of yellow rings that only need to be touched they were made from dust in a box from the lost city of atlantis which uncle andrew obtained from his godmother since the material of the rings is from another world that existed when ours was just beginning it draws one back into the place where it came from so digory and polly come up through a pool into the wood between the worlds the green rings on the other hand transport them out of the wood and into a new world the experience of leaving is brief but doesnt happen too quickly for digory to note bright lightsthe stars and even jupiters moonsmoving around him more remarkable as he gets closer to england he can even see through the walls of houses and objects that were at first shadowy come sharply into focus at the end of their adventures in this book the children simply have to look at aslans face and they are back in england for good narnia is reached in a different way made famous in the lion the witch and the wardrobe digory takes a special apple from a narnian tree and plants the core in his back yard although a storm ruins the tree that subsequently grows he makes a magic wardrobe out of the salvaged wood then many years later after digory has become old professor kirke lucy pevensie climbs into the wardrobe and steps behind the coats and mothballs into lantern waste yet when the other three children try to confirm her wild tale of a secret country all they find is hard wood at the back of the wardrobe so again one cant try to get into narnia to return to england from narnia in this book all the children have to do even after narnian years have passed is to walk back through the coats and into the wardrobe this wardrobe is reminiscent of the stable in the last battle whose inside is bigger than its outside and which leads the narnians into another world incidentally a beautiful handcarved wardrobe that actually belonged to professor lewis and perhaps was inspiration for this story can be seen at the marion e wade collection at wheaton college illinois the children are not called to narnia again until one day sitting dejectedly at the train station waiting to return to school they feel themselves pulled and then suddenly scratched with branches trumpkin has blown susans magic horn which always brings help when used the childrens return to england is more spectacular like the special door which appears in the last battle aslan sets up two wooden stakes three feet apart with a third binding them together at the top and thus creates a doorway from nowhere into nowhere through this doorway the telmarines pass back into the south seas of our world then the children sorrowfully pass through layers and see three curious things first a cave opening to a pacific island next a glade in narnia and finally the gray platform of the country station just as it was when they left england the voyage of the dawn treader begins in still a different way on eustace scrubbs bedroom wall is a lovely picture of a sailing ship on the sea but the more lucy stares at it the more real and alive the scene becomesin fact the waves start to roll up and down and the air smells wild and briny lucy edmund and eustace are even slapped in the face with salt water as the incorrigible eustace attempts to smash the picture he finds himself standing on the frame then swept into the sea at the end of their long adventure lucy and edmund are told that they are too old to return to narnia again then aslan returns all three of them to cambridge by ripping the blue sky like a curtain and letting them through that same year eustace and his schoolmate jill pole despairing of their dreary life at a school called experiment house really try to get to narnia aslan aslan aslanplease let us two go into as they rush away from the noise of their approaching schoolmates they throw open a usually locked door in a high stone wall but instead of seeing a heathery moor they find the cool bright air and vibrant forest of aslans country at the end of their mission to rescue rilian they triumphantly return to experiment housethis time with aslanwho simply leads them through the woods to the school of course in the final trip to narnia every one of the friends of narnia on earth is called to narnia by means of an actual train accident which instantly kills them all jill and eustace however immediately find themselves with tirian when he needs them the most we dont know what happened right away to the others but we do know they ended up in aslans countrythis time to stay time as the timeline for narnia indicates there is an obvious and distinct difference between the time frames of narnia and england years of narnia from beginning to end correspond to just earth years yet two narnian years pass between and and years between and just what was lewis up to first it is quite common in stories for two worlds to have different times even tirian acknowledges this fact professor kirke explains to the children that if there is a separate world i should not be at all surprised to find that that that other world had a separate time of its own so that however long you stayed there it would never take up any of our time as a result each time the children return from narnia to england they find no time has passed on earth no matter how long they have been busy in narnia for example digory polly and the whole crew of cabby horse and witch leave england and witness all the glorious events of narnias creation and the establishment of the new kingdom then digory and polly return right into the middle of the very mess the witch had created lucy emerges breathlessly from the wardrobe without a second having ticked away and when all four kings and queens return after their year reign they return the same day and the same hour of the day on which they had all gone into the wardrobe to hide a second muddle about time which seems to take the children quite a while to get used to is the fact that narnian time flows differently from ours so that once youre out of narnia you have no idea how narnian time is going if you spent a hundred years in narnia you would still come back to our world at the very same hour of the very same day on which you left and then if you went back into narnia after spending a week here you might find that a thousand narnian years had passed or only a day or no time at all you never know till you get there so in prince caspian the children have only been gone from narnia one year but find it entirely grown over and so changed they cant recognize it for it is hundreds of narnian years later yet when they return in the voyage of the dawn treader after another year in england only three narnian years have passed since caspians coronation walter hooper explains that lewis knew what he was doing here for he believed that other worlds might have a time with thicknesses and thinnesses not a linear time like ours hooper feels this has two important effects not only do the strange time lapses allow more interesting adventures but also teach the children about history itself since they do not know what stage of narnian history they are playing a role in they cannot see the meaning of the whole plan only aslan does only aslan calls all times soon the end of the world one thing lewis does perhaps better than any other writer is to depict a vision of what heaven is like quite unforgettable is the description of the end of the world in the voyage of the dawn treader always associated with the utter east the first effect on the children is that they simply feel differentnot sleepy hungry or thirsty like their vigor after the romp with aslan following his resurrection they feel life to its fullest two things they notice are also associated with aslan himself light and smell the light becomes a whiteness radiating all around them for the sun grows larger still they get used to it seeing more light than they had ever seen before also a fresh wild lonely smell that seemed to get into your brain pervades the air the clear water reveals a submarine world and is sweet like the airlike drinkable lightand carpeted with lilies there is a stillness and joy in the distance the mountains of a green forested country outside the world come into view these are always associated with aslans country in the chronicles from there too sweeps a smell and musical sound that would break your heart in the silver chair jill and eustace are permitted to get just a taste of this country they find a stream and crystal air that clears their minds as well when they return there briefly at the end of the book jill notices that this is a place where you cant want the wrong things and people are no particular age aslan promises they some day may be called to this place their real hometo stay forever destruction of narniaaslans country jill pole remarks our world is going to have an end some day perhaps this one wont wouldnt it be lovely if narnia just went on and on but all worlds draw to an end except aslans country and so at the end of the last battle we sadly watch this wonderful world come to an end in contrast to the music by which aslan called it into existence father time blows his giant horn to reverse the process first the stars fall leaving an emptiness as aslan calls them home then the talking beasts pass through aslans door leaving only dragons and giant lizards to devour narniaas in the ragnarok or destruction of the earth in norse mythology then water arises to blanket all and the sun and moon turn red and disintegrate at last peter closes and locks the door on a cold dead world all worlds endexcept aslans country the disappointed children follow aslan further up and further in through the stable the land just inside the door reminds them of something they cant quite place a deep blue sky soft summer breeze and thick trees with wonderful indescribable fruit which makes all the fruit of our world seem dull by comparison it seems to be a country where everything is allowed then they realize where they have seen all this before aslans world is just like the narnia they had known only more like the real thing lewis explains the difference as being like a reflection of a landscape in a mirror where the reflection is just as real but somehow differentdeeper more wonderful more like places in a story this new narnia looks deeperas if every flower and blade of grass meant more finding that they are able to run faster than ever before and without tiring the group moves even further up and further in through aslans country by scaling a waterfall most likely the real waterfall of which the great waterfall and caldron pool in the lantern waste had been only a reflection racing to an area just like the western wilds then up a hill they enter a garden the reflection of which digory had entered thousands of years earlier they notice again the characteristic delicious smell the springy turf dotted with white flowers even more wonderful everyone they have ever known is there as lucy climbs up the green slopes and mountains of forests through the sweet orchards and past flashing waterfalls she begins to see more and more clearly now peering over the wall of the garden she distinctly sees narnia spread out below i see lucy says thoughtfully i see now this garden is like the stable it is far bigger inside than it was outside of course daughter of eve explains mr tumnus the further up and further in you go the bigger everything gets the inside is larger than the outside lucy sees then that the garden iscontainsa whole world i see she says this is still narnia and more real and more beautiful than the narnia down below just as it was more real and more beautiful than the narnia outside the stable door i see world within world narnia within narnia yes says mr tumnus like an onion except that as you continue to go in and in each circle is larger than the last she sees not only the layout of narniathe desert tashbaan cair paravel island after island to the end of the worldbut even england looking like a cloud cut off from them by a gap this too is the england within england the real england just as this is the real narnia all real countries in fact are like spurs jutting out from the great mountains of aslan which ring the entire world lewiss platonism the children thus find the real narnia and real england of which the others were only a shadow or copy in fact aslan calls england the shadow lands its all in plato professor kirke keeps explaining plato believed that the real stable permanent part of the universe exists in a supernatural super sensible heaven as ideas or forms thus the physical world is only the realm of appearances rather than solid realityillusory transitory in this way it is a shadow or copy of the real world but lewis places his platonic reality not in a far removed abstract heaven but rather at the very heart the center of all that exists the children go further up to aslan s country in the mountains to platonic heaven and further in then on to a garden containing a narnia that is even better and at last to a narnia seen from the mountains which is as different as a real thing is from a shadow or as waking life is from a dream its all in plato furthermore lewis totally reverses the shadowy platonic conception of heaven we often tend to associate god and heaven with the sky and the spiritual forgetting that our language is only symbolic and incapable of describing or understanding them consequently says lewis god has become to many like a gas diffused in space or a mist streaming upwardvaporous vague indefinable shadowy we also have a vague dream of platonic paradises and gardens of the hesperides which represent the heaven we long for but in the last battle the platonic realm is portrayed as a solid concrete reality every rock and flower and blade of grass seems to mean more in the great divorce lewis likewise notes that in comparison to the ghostly earthlings stumbling on heavens soil things in heaven are much solider even harder in comparison you can cut your finger on the grass life is weak and flimsy compared to the solid reality it reflects similarly in perelandra ransom is told you see only an appearance small one you have never seen more than an appearance of anything and he sadly realizes i have lived all my life among shadows and broken images the paradox implicit in the idea of a sphere with a center bigger than its circumference illustrates how difficult it is for us to believe that this vast universe came out of something smaller and emptier than itself it is not so says lewis we are much nearer to the truth in the vision seen by julian of norwich when christ appeared to her holding in his hand a little thing like a hazel nut and saying this is all that is created and it seemed to her so small and weak that she wondered how it could hold together at all instead the real power of the center is illustrated in the last battle it seems then says tirian smiling himself that the stable seen from within and the stable seen from without are two different places yes says lord digory its inside is bigger than its outside similarly the garden is far bigger inside than outside of course says the faun the further up and the further in you go the bigger everything gets the in side is larger than the outside yes says queen lucy in our world too a stable once had something insideit that was bigger than our whole world in contrast hell is smaller than one atom of the real world and a damned soul writes lewis in the great divorce is also nearly nothing shrunk shut up in itself but we perpetually view reality the other way around as if we were looking through the wrong end of a telescope platonism involves an aspiration a longing a crying out of the human soul from within the unreal world we now know for a beauty which lies on the other side of existence lewis himself experienced this longing all his life long before he even enters narnia digory longs for a world with a fruit that could care his sick mother similarly shasta says he has been longing to go to the north all my life of course you have bree responds thats because of the blood thats in you youre true northern stock and not only is he returned to his home but restored to his proper name raised a telmarine and hearing only fleeting stories about talking narnians caspian searches for such people all his life his old nurse says that she too has always waited for aslan as aslan leads his band of rejoicing newlyfreed followers through the towns a school teacher like caspians nurse feels a stab of joy and follows him jill feels a similar sensation as she steps into narnia through a hole in the wall though frightened she realizes she has always been longing for something like this reepicheep questing valiantly for the end of the world says the spell of aslans country has been on me all my life and finally jewel the unicorn upon reaching the new narnia of asians country stamps on the ground and cries i have come home at last this is my real country i belong here this is the land i have been looking for all my life though i never knew it till now the reason why we loved the old narnia is that it sometimes looked a little like this in an essay the weight of glory lewis says we all have a desire for a far off country like an inconsolable inner panga desire for something that has never actually appeared in our experience we cannot hide it because our experience is constantly suggesting it in fact he says we were made for another world what more poignant illustration of this could there be than the magical tree from narnia that grows in digorys back yard but bends whenever a breeze blows in narnia because of the narnian sap running within it perhaps we mistakenly identify what we long for as beauty or memory but these are only the scent of a flower we have not found the echo of a tune we have not heard news from a country we have never yet visited in narnia the things we long for are associated with the distant mountains of aslans country and the islands of the utter east after their unforgettable experience at the end of the world edmund and lucy cannot describe the smell and the musical sound carried on the sweet breeze from aslans country it would break your heart why said i was it so sad sad no said lucy digory experiences the same strange echo during his first time in the wood between the worlds if anyone had asked him where did you come from he would probably have said ive always been here that was what it felt like as if one had always been in that place his and pollys life before this seems like a dream a picture in their heads the former life of strawberry the horse also seems muddled like a dream and aslans song reminds them all of something after the four pevensies are kings and queens in narnia for many years the real world seems like a dream to them too only aslan is able to wake up the visitors from earth to the reality he alone can bring the children only need to look into his face to feel as though they have never been alive or awake before similarly in the horse and his boy after aslan visits with the children they feel as if awakened from sleep but there was a brightness in the air and on the grass and a joy in their hearts which assured them that he had been no dream as the telmarine in prince caspian feels the touch of aslans breath a new look comes into his eyes as if he were trying to remember something by contrast evil makes us forget the white witch cannot even remember being in the wood between the worlds that quiet placeno matter how often or how long she was there likewise the gnome golg says that the green witch called them to her world by magic and made them forget about their own world we didnt know who we were or where we belonged we couldnt do anything except what she put into our heads puddleglum has to denounce her evil drowsy enchantment which lures them into forgetting the real world by reasoning suppose we have dreamed or made up all those thingstrees and grass and sun and moon and stars and aslan himself suppose we have then all i can say is that in that case the madeup things seem a good deal more important than the real ones were just babies making up a game if youre right but four babies playing a game can make a playworld which licks your real world hollow but the world we dream of or remember or long for is not madeup in aslans country beyond the stable door the dream is ended this is the morning lewis uses the stable door not only in the last battle but also in several of his other writings as a symbol for the entrance to that platonic reality which we have always longed for because we have vague wordsworthian recollections of a past glory we long to be inside of some door which we have always seen from the outside to be at last summoned inside would be both glory and honour beyond all our merits and also the healing of that old ache someday says lewis we shall again be permitted to get in pass in through nature beyond her into that splendour which she fitfully reflects lewis makes this vivid in one of the most memorable passages in all of the chronicles when lucy in reading the magicians magic book comes across a spell for the refreshment of the spirit like the living pictures that orual sees while telling psyches story at the end of till we have faces lucy finds that she is living in the story as if it were real and all the pictures were real too it is about a cup a sword a tree and a green hill and is the loveliest story she has ever read but she can neither go back and read it again nor really remember it ever since that time though lucy defines a good story as one that reminds her of this forgotten story aslan promises her that he will tell that story to her for years and years this certainly is lucys glimpse like the glimpses we have all our lives of the great story which the children are just beginning to experience at the conclusion of the last battle which goes on for ever in which every chapter is better than the one before chapter the creator of narnia aslan if you continue to love jesus nothing much can go wrong with you and i hope you may always do so c s lewis unpublished letter to a little girl who is aslan the one person who makes narnia worth visiting is aslan himselfit isnt narnia you know sobbed lucy its you aslan of course is the magnificent son of the emperoroversea king of the wood and beasts maker of the stars he doesnt actually reside in narnia though one day youll see him and another you wont he doesnt like being tied downand of course he has other countries to attend to there are years for example when the witch rules in perpetual narnian winter and christmas never comes caspian and tirian have real difficulty believing in aslan since they have only heard legends about him who can forget the image of aslan singing narnia into existenceto see that singer makes the viewer forget everything else it was a lion huge shaggy and bright it stood facing the risen sun its mouth was wide open in song the experience of his presence is like a sea of tossing gold in which they were floating and such a sweetness and power rolled about them and over them and entered into them that they felt they had never really been happy or wise or good or ever alive and awake before and the memory of that moment stayed with them always so that as long as they both lived if ever they were sad or afraid or angry the thought of that golden goodness and the feeling that it was still there quite close just around some corner or just behind some door would come back and make them sure deep down inside that all was well his speed says emeth is like that of an ostrich his size like an elephants his hair like pure gold his bright eyes like liquid gold here lewis has succeeded in doing what in his preface to paradise lost he admits is difficult for any author portraying a totally good character to draw a character better than yourself all you can do is to take the best moments you have had and to imagine them prolonged and more consistently embodied in action but the real high virtues which we do not possess at all we cannot depict except in a purely external fashion we do not really know what it feels like to be a man much better than ourselves many readers sense that aslan is a divine or christlike figure as we have mentioned before if you do not see aslan in this way lewis would not want you to because that was not his purpose but for the moment we will look at some of the hints lewis himself has given us in the stories and elsewhere concerning aslans model as will be discussed in chapter the events in the lion the witch and the wardrobe remind us of several events in christs own life and in the voyage of the dawn treader when the children reach the end of the world they see a lamb who invites them to breakfast he is so white they can barely look at him suddenly he is changed and they recognize him as he spoke his snowy white flushed into tawny gold and his size changed and he was aslan himself towering above them and scattering light from his mane similar symbolism is used in revelation the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has conquered so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals and between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders i saw a lamb standing as though it had been slain aslan also calls himself the great bridge builder who promises to guide them into narnia from their worldanother biblical image as we will see later finally in the last battle aslan looks to them no longer as a lion and we assume he has taken his human form as he begins to tell them the great story forever and ever elsewhere lewis makes it clear that aslan is a divine figure and that anything approaching disneylike humor would be blasphemy he wrote the following explanation to a little girl from texas as to aslans other name well i want you to guess has there never been anyone in this world who arrived the same time as father christmas said he was the son of the great emperor gave him self up for someone elses fault to be jeered at and killed by wicked people came to life again is sometimes spoken of as a lamb at the end of the dawn treader dont you really know his name in this world most child readersor at least certain types of peoplewho corresponded with lewis had no problem knowing aslans real identity in several of his letters lewis indicates that he had received many lovely moving letters from children primarily if brought up in christian homes who never failed to grasp the theology of narnia more or less unconsciously and much more clearly than some grownups most grownups never see who aslan is he said a perfect example is a letter written by an year old girl to lewiss friend owen barfield i have read mr lewiss books i got so envoveled in them all i did was eat sleep and read i wanted to write to you and tell you i understand the books i mean about the sy bols and all i know that to me aslan is god and all the sons and daughters of adam and eve are gods children i have my own philosophies about the books if it is possible i would like to meet you none of my friends well some of them liked the books i tried to explain to them but they dont understand about symbols i never really did until i read the books in fact some children understood aslan so well that they began to love aslan more than jesus here is lewiss response to a worried mother of one little boy laurence cant really love aslan more than jesus even if he feels thats what he is doing for the things he loves aslan for doing or saying are simply the things jesus really did and said so that when laur ence thinks he is loving aslan he is really loving jesus and perhaps loving him more than he ever did before of course there is one thing aslan has that jesus has noti mean the body of a lion but remember if there are other worlds and they need to be saved and christ were to save themas he wouldhe may really have taken all sorts of bodies in them which we dont know about now if laurence is bothered because he finds the lionbody seems nicer to him than the manbody i dont think he need be bothered at all why would lewis choose as he suggests to portray christ as a lion first of all we must remember that lewis did not begin writing his stories with aslan in mind instead he says he had been having dreams of lions at the time and suddenly aslan came bounding into the story and pulled the whole story together and soon he pulled the six other narnian stories in after him in fact lewis admitted that writing a story about god would be a tall order to imagine what god might be supposed to have done in other worlds does not seem to be wrong yet it must be emphasized that aslan is not allegorically christ in other words no onetoone correspondence exists between characters and events and what they stand forbetween the characteristics and acts of christ and those of aslan for example rather aslan is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question what might christ become like if there really were a world like narnia and he chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as he actually has done in ours after all we are forced to use symbols for spiritual experience just as the bible uses scriptural imagery to describe god and heaven but the use of symbols leads us into clearer understanding and knowledge of christ similarly aslan says to king frank you know better than you think you know and you shall live to know me better yet and at the end of the voyage of the dawn treader aslan who has nine names in narnia says that in england he has yet another name you must learn to know me by that name this was the very reason why you were brought to narnia that by knowing me here for a little you may know me better there so we must stretch and exercise our imaginations and understanding of spiritual reality in order that we may use them in our everyday world lewis associates aslan with two symbols he said he borrowed from the grail legend brightness and a sweet smell eustace for example notices that although there was no moon when he encountered aslan moonlight shone where the lion was shasta too sees a whiteness and golden light actually coming from aslan himself in many of his other works lewis associates god and heaven with the biblical metaphor of light especially in his story the man born blind appropriately as the children approach aslans country at the end of the voyage of the dawn treader they notice a whiteness shot with faintest colour of gold spread round them on every side a brightness you or i could not bear even if we had dark glasses on aslans brightness contrasts with the dull red light of jadis charn or the sick greenish light of the shallowlands similarly aslans mane gives off a lovely perfume which contrasts with the foul stench of tashbaan and its god sensing aslans warm breath shasta knows the thing walking beside him is alive falling at his feet he experiences all the glory of his power his fiery brightness and perfume the high king above all kings stooped towards him its mane and some strange and solemn perfume that hung about the mane was all round him it touched his forehead with its tongue he lifted his face and their eyes met then instantly the pale brightness of the mist and the fiery brightness of the lion rolled themselves together into a swirling glory and gathered themselves up and disappeared a terrible good aslan manifests a variety of qualitieshe is awesome solemn and stern yet compassionate and joyful this paradox of being at the same time both terrible and good is a key idea in charles williams descent into hell where terrible means full of terror pauline had never considered good as a thing of terror and certainly she had not supposed a certain thing of terror in her own secret life as any possible good salvation is often a terrible thing a frightening good lewis believed god and the numinous overwhelm us with a sense of dread and awe he explains this aspect of aslan in the lion people who have not been in narnia sometimes think that a thing cannot be good and terrible at the same time if the children had ever thought so they were cured of it now for when they tried to look at aslans face they just caught a glimpse of the golden mane and the great royal solemn overwhelming eyes and then they found they couldnt look at him and went all trembly digory finds aslan simultaneously bigger and more beautiful and more brightly golden and more terrible than he had thought and emeth notes that aslan was more terrible than the flaming mountain of lagour and in beauty he surpassed all that is in the world even as the rose in bloom surpasses the dust of the desert the light shasta sees radiating from aslan is more terrible and more beautiful than anything anyone has ever seen jill senses the same paradoxical combination of terror and moral glory in her first encounter with aslan at the beginning of the silver chair desperately thirsty yet paralyzed with fright at the lions presence beside the stream she pleads with him for a promise that he will not harm her but he will make no such promise majestically telling her that he has in fact swallowed up girls and boys women and men kings and emperors cities and realms when jill reluctantly decides to search for another stream to drink from aslan informs her that there is no other it was the worst thing she had ever had to do but she went forward to the stream knelt down and began scooping up water in her hand before she tasted it she had been intending to make a dash away from the lion the moment she had finished now she realized that this would be the most dangerous thing of all as all the old tales of narnia indicate aslan is wildnot a tame lion ooh said susan id thought he was a man is hequite safe i shall feel rather nervous about meeting a lion mrs beaver replies if theres anyone who can appear before aslan without their knees knocking theyre either braver than most or else just silly after his resurrection defying death and evil aslan opens his mouth to roar and his face became so terrible that they did not dare to look at it and they saw all the trees in front of him bend before the blast of his roaring as grass bends in the meadow before the wind aslan resembles the devouring god of the mountain which lewis portrays in till we have faces but when he hurts it is for a purpose first snapping at hwin to make the horses hurry the lion then scratches aravis the scratches he explains later are equal to the stripes her stepmother whipped into a slave because of her you needed to know what it felt like yet aslan has another side i will not always scold he assures the children he can feel all the pain and sorrow of every individual when digory fearfully asks aslan to cure his mother and peers up at his face what he sees surprises him as much as anything in his whole life for the tawny face was bent down near his own and great shining tears stood in the lions eyes they were such big bright tears compared with digorys own that for a moment he felt as if the lion must really be sorrier about his mother than he was himself later although he forgets to say thank you aslan understands without a word from digory likewise during caspians funeral aslan cries great liontears each tear more precious than the earth would be if it was a single solid diamond he feels great sadness over edmunds treachery too he can also be joyously playful who can forget the lively romp with aslan that lucy and susan experience after his resurrection it is like playing both with a thunderstorm and a kitten he gives them a wonderful ride on his back his mane flying he never tires never misses his footing at the end of prince caspians adventures aslan leads the children animals new followers and even bacchus himself in a riotous festive parade through town he playfully tosses the disbelieving trumpkin in the air then asks to be his friend a guide in other forms as a lion aslan can show us the full significance of the incarnationchrist becoming a man like us this is poignantly exemplified in the lion when aslan tells the other lions to join with him in battle did you hear what he said us lions that means him and me us lions thats what i like about aslan no side no stand offishness us lions we cannot read very many pages of a narnia story without sensing aslans presence though unseen and often in another form and guidance of events like god he is wise and foreknowing as puddleglum reminds the children there are no accidents he was there when the giant king caused the letters to be cut and he knew already all things that would come of them including this tirian describes whatever may befall them in the future as the adventure that aslan would send them in the voyage of the dawn treader he appears as an albatross deliciously breathing courage dear heart to lucy then guiding them away from the dark island throughout all of shastas adventuresthe lions forcing him to protect aravis and snapping at the horses the cat protecting him at the tombs the unseen giant shadow keeping to his left to protect him from the cliff even his own coming to calormenit is aslan who guides each step of the way you may call me a giant he tells shasta tell me your sorrows then he reveals to him that he is the one lion that has been with him all along shasta later realizes it isnt luck that sent him through the pass in the mountains into narnia but him aravis too at first thinking it luck that the lion only gave her ten scratches is told by the hermit that in his years he never yet met any such thing as luck there is something about all this that i do not understand but if weever need to know it you may be sure that we shall aslan is ever present to warn the children sternly from time to time not to do wrong he reproves not out of anger but because he always knows what is best for them some day in aslans country they will never do the wrong things and then i will not always be scolding he promises when they bicker about the gold on deathwater island suddenly aslans growling face appears to remind them of their wrongdoing just as lucy begins to say the spell in the magicians book to make herself beautiful aslan stares gravely at her from the page in prince caspian a stern look from aslan is all she needs to tell her that it is truly her responsibility to follow him despite the others it wasnt my fault anyway was it the lion looked straight into her eyes oh aslan said lucy you dont mean it was how could ii couldnt have left the others and come up to you alone how could i dont look at me like that oh well i suppose i could one cannot help but tell the truth before aslans holy stare digory is forced to confess fully to aslan his responsibility for the witch entering narnia she woke up said digory wretchedly and then turning very white i mean i woke her jill too confesses that she shoved eustace over the cliff simply because she was showing off later aslan has to appear to her in a dream to remind her to repeat the signs and give her a clue under me finally just as moses is permitted to see only gods back and not his face because his glory is too great aslan wreaks his fury upon experiment house but permits the hysterical teacher and students to see only his back the power of aslans wonderfully warm sweet breath and the air from his tossing mane give such power and peace that it often seems reminiscent of the power and guidance of the holy spirit the whole trinity is perhaps hinted at when shasta asks the ghostly companion walking beside him who are you myself said the voice very deep and low so that the earth shook god the father and again myself loud and clear and gay and then the third time myself whispered so softly you could hardly hear it and yet is seemed to come from all round you as if the leaves rustled with it the holy spirit aslans breath and kiss always empower the children when he sends digory to get the apple seed digory doesnt know how he will do it but aslans kiss gives him such new strength and courage that he felt quite sure now that he would be able to do it when lucy buries her face in his mane it makes her a disciple for he breathes such lion strength into her that he declares now you are a lioness he breathes on edmund so that a greatness hangs all about him too to wake the statues in the lion he breathes on their frozen forms imparting renewed life to them just as he breathes on the chosen talking animals when narnia is created to separate them from the others because of this divine plan and presence behind events we are not only to have faith in aslan even when we cannot see or know but we are also to be content with the present situation and not long for things to be different the green lady in perelandra believes that the wave sent to her from god at each moment is the best wave of all so too the children are repeatedly told by aslan did i not explain to you once before that no one is ever told what would have happened that is not to say that aslan dictates every event that happens or will always be present even if not asked in fact lewis clearly illustrates the importance of free will and prayer in our lives aslan does not appear as a guide and comfort in the form of an albatross until lucy whispers aslan aslan aslan if ever you loved us at all send us help now even though the darkness seems to remain she feels better because of her small faith until he comes likewise in the last battle tirian cries out aslan aslan aslan come and help us now for him too the darkness cold and quiet seem just the same but there is a kind of change inside him without knowing why he began to feel a faint hope and he felt somehow stronger and help does come although noone can successfully try to get to narnia in the silver chair jill and eustace enter not long after they plead with aslan to let them in aslan aslan aslan please let us two go into we sense that aslan like god wants us to call on him first wondering if aslan knows how hungry they are without telling him digory and polly have to have fledge the horse explain it to them ive no doubt he would says fledge but ive a sort of idea he likes to be asked obedience aslan usually calls the children from our world into another to perform certain tasks in the magicians nephew when aslan calls the cabbys wife from england polly realizes that anyone who heard that call would want to obey it and would be able to obey it however many worlds and ages lay between thus they learn to obey aslan and to seek his guidance in all circumstances in prince caspian for example lucy should have forsaken all the others and come after aslan alone since she didnt aslan bids her once more you must all get up at once and follow me christ also told his disciples if anyone wants to be a follower of mine let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me forsaking all else later after learning his lesson peter assures lucy that they cannot know when aslan will act again but that nevertheless he expects us to do what we can on our own digorys first task is simply to help polly once andrew sends her off into narnia alone later he must abandon his family and follow aslan at any cost in order to get aslan the apple still aslan provides him with helpfledge and pollyand special signs to look fora blue lake a hill and a garden and in reward for obeying and patiently waiting he is given a healing apple for his mother lucy is told in the lion to go save others with her magic cordial and not to stop and wait for edmunds healing wait a minute she tells aslan crossly daughter of eve said aslan in a graver voice others also are at the point of death must more people die for edmund when she returns ed looks better than she had ever seen him so her patience and obedience are rewarded too in fact all four children illustrate well the rewards and blessings faithful christians receive for whatever they as kings and queens took in hand they achieved shastas task is to warn king lune though tired and disheartened he must continue on alone and he thinks this is cruel often we feel god is asking us to do more than our share but shasta learns if you do one good deed your reward usually is to be set to do another and harder and better one likewise caspian selfishly though understandably wants to abandon his throne in narnia his ship and his promise to ramandus daughter to reach aslans country but he must return at aslans bidding in the silver chair jill and eustace are called by aslan out of their world to do an important task in their case aslan guides them by telling jill four important signs she is to follow although the signs are quite clear to her in aslans country he warns her that they will be difficult to recognize in narnia so she is to remember remember remember the signs say them to yourself when you wake in the morning and when you lie down at night and when you wake in the middle of the night god similarly commanded the israelites these words which i command you this day shall be upon your heart and you shall teach them diligently to your children and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise and you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes the children however dont obey aslans commands or stick to their mission for one thing they are tempted by food and shelter at harfang and thus walk right into a giant trap puddleglum has to remind them constantly to have faith and to keep going aslans instructions always work there are no exceptions although it seems illogical they must obey the sign and release the seemingly mad prince even though they are unsure of what he will do they may even die in the process but no matter what the consequences they must obey i was going to say i wished wed never come but i dont i dont i dont even if we are killed id rather be killed fighting for narnia than grow old and stupid at home and perhaps go about in a bath chair and then die in the end just the same jill proclaims in the last battle reactions to aslan an individuals reaction to aslan reveals what kind of person he is a curious thing happens for example when all four pevensies hear the word aslan spoken for the first time at the sound of his name each child feels quite different lewis likens it to the contrast between a terrifying or wonderful reaction to one dream at the name of aslan each one of the children felt something jump inside edmund felt a sensation of mysterious horror in fact he later admits he hated the name peter felt suddenly brave and adventurous susan felt as if some delicious smell or some delightful stream of music had just floated by her and lucy got the feeling you have when you wake up in the morning and realize that it is the beginning of the holidays or the beginning of summer there are similar varied reactions to aslans song of creation the cabby digory and polly drink in the music for it reminds them of something the witch on the other hand knows what the song is and hates it andrew doesnt like it because it makes him think and feel things he doesnt want to he tells himself it is only a lion who hasnt really been singingonly roaring and soon he couldnt have heard anything else even if he had wanted to aslan explains that andrew has made himself unable to hear his voice if i spoke to him he would hear only growlings and roarings oh adams sons how cleverly you defend yourself against all that might do you good just the sight of aslan creates one single expression of terror on the mean cruel faces of the experiment house children a persons attitude also affects his view of narnia itselfandrew eustace and the telmarines all dread the thought of going there thus what you see and hear depends a good deal on where you are standing it also depends on what sort of person you are the dwarfs refuse to believe in aslan even when presented with the truth from tirian like andrew they sit huddled up in the stable and see only darkness instead of the sky and flowers which the children find in the same place to the dwarfs the flowers smell like stable litter they cant even distinguish aslans voice and his glorious feastpies tongues pidgeons trifles ices and winetastes only like old turnips raw cabbage leaves and dirty trough water andrew and these dwarfs are much like orual in till we have faces who believes the wine and bread psyche gives her are just water and berries aslan explains that a person can close his own eyes to the truth they will not let us help them they have chosen cunning instead of belief their prison is only in their own minds yet they are in that prison and so afraid of being taken in that they cannot be taken out one reason for the tendency to lose faith in aslan is that he is not always in narnia but comes and goes caspian for example who has never seen aslan or talking beasts begins to wonder if they are only stories after all nikabrik actually calls on the power of the witch rather than aslan because he has heard so little about him after aslans resurrection he just fades out of the story nikabrik argues how do you explain that if he really came to life isnt it much more likely that he didnt and that the stories say nothing more about him because there was nothing more to say how similar this is to many of the arguments we hear about christ even peter argues that if narnia or anything else is real then they are here all the time are they asks professor kirke hinting at the necessity for faith instead of sight in prince caspian the childrens faith determines when and how they see aslan during their journey to aslans how lucy who loves aslan perhaps more than anyone sees him first the voice she likes best in the world commands follow me although the others dont believe and grumble loudly they follow her nevertheless certainly they wont see him at first aslan predicts later on it depends edmund who after all his misfortunes in an earlier adventure has learned his lesson sees the shadow next then peter and finally susan and trumpkin susan admits that her own attitude kept her from seeing him i really believed it was him tonight when you woke us up i mean deep down inside or i could have if id let myself how much she is like edmund who deep down inside had also known that the white witch was bad ones response to aslan is actually indicative of both his relationship to the lion and his faith spiritual growth permits an even clearer vision of him aslan says lucy youre bigger every year you grow you will find me bigger aslan explains when she thumbs through the magicians book then gazes up from the picture she sees aslan i have been here all the time said he but you have just made me visible ones response to aslan also reflects his unique relationship to god aslan tells shasta and aravis on separate occasions that no one is told any story but their own faith in aslan must also come from the heart emeth is accepted into aslans country because his motives are true son thou art welcome all the service thou hast done to tash i account as service done to me in contrast susan apparently never really believes in her heart for she is not granted final admission to aslans country bree like thomas in the bible refuses to believe aslan is a real lion and must receive proof before he will believe just as christ urged thomas to put his fingers in the nail prints in his hands and feet aslan bids bree you poor proud frightened horse draw near nearer still my son do not dare not to dare touch me smell me here are my paws here is my tail these are my whiskers i am a true beast aslan said bree in a shaken voice im afraid i must be rather a foolhappy the horse who knows that while still young or the human either when disbelieving and stubborn trumpkin doesnt believe aslan is a real lion either aslan proves his reality merely by tossing him gently into the air time and time again the children are called to simply have faith in aslan when the leopards are afraid to go near the witch for fear she will turn them into stone peter tells them to simply trust aslan itll be all right he wouldnt send them if it werent as ramandus daughter tells caspians group you cant know you can only believeor not who best illustrates this but puddleglum who tells the green witch that even if the world of trees grass sun moon starsaslan himselfis made up the madeup things seem a good deal more important than the real ones im going to stand by the play world how wonderful that not only is his faith grounded in a solid reality but in a more perfect reality than he has ever dreamed of in the lion the children fail to believe in lucys story about narnia the professor uses the following logic there are only three possibilities either your sister is telling lies or she is mad or she is telling the truth you know she doesnt tell lies and it is obvious that she is not mad for the moment then and unless any further evidence turns up we must assume that she is telling the truth lewis uses the same sort of argument in mere christianity concerning belief in the claims christ made about himself either he was a lunatic or a devil of hellor the son of god himself all these varied reactions to aslanhate belief belief only with proof parallel ones reaction to the witch so that a persons attitude toward her similarly reflects his spiritual guard polly immediately dislikes her just as aunt letty totally unimpressed calls her a shameless hussy in contrast both digory and andrew are awed by her beauty no matter which side one is on once one has been in the presence of either aslan or the witch his perspective is never the same after seeing the witch the children find andrew much less fearsome after being in the magic wood the tunnel above their house seems drab and homely the apple of life makes everything in london pale in comparison all those other things seemed to have scarcely any colour at all every one of them even the sunlight looked faded and dingy nothing else was worth looking at indeed you couldnt look at anything else certainly after meeting aslan the lion and being in his secret countryno matter what your reactionyou are never the same chapter characters of narnia it is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses there are no ordinary people you have never talked to a mere mortal c s lewis the weight of glory sons and daughters of adam although man is not created in narnia he nevertheless plays an important role there the children are called into narnia when there is trouble and it is significant that only a human can serve as king or queen mr beaver knows that when adams flesh and adams bone sits at cair paravel in throne the evil time will be over and done lewis seems to be clearly affirming that if we are christians we will one day become kings and queens all of us have this potential in the weight of glory he writes it is a serious thing to live in a society of possible gods and goddesses to remember that the dullest and most uninteresting person you talk to may one day be a creature which if you saw it now you would be strongly tempted to worship or else a horror and corruption such as you now meet if at all only in a nightmare there are no ordinary people narnian life illustrates the difference in values where else but in narnia could a mouse be respected as the most valiant of all the beasts every individual who enters narnia is changed and develops qualities he never knew he had frank a simple cabby feels he is not fit to be a king i aint no sort of chap for a job like that i never ad much eddycation you see yet his voice grows steadily richer and by the time of his coronation he has a brand new expression of courage and kindness on his face without an ounce of quarrelsomeness sharpness or cunning digory too feels himself unfit for his task but with the helpmates provided for him he achieves his goal and learns to obey every single time the children return to narnia all their old skills and royal strength are quickly revived once a king or queen in narnia always a king or queen each person in narnia has a special task to performusually something he doesnt want to do digory knows he must put on a magic ring and bravely rescue polly and of course he must get the apple lucy must help the dufflepuds peter must kill fenris ulf and so on but they are always provided with some kind of help in their tasks in the lion father christmas presents three of the children with special gifts that prove invaluable even in later adventures the gifts are appropriate to their personalities and generally reflect the roles each will play in the salvation of narnia peter receives a silver shield with the lion insignia and a gold sword lucy receives a small dagger to defend herself if necessary and a diamond vial containing fluid that will immediately restore someone who is sick or injured susan is given a bow quiver of arrows and an ivory horn which if blown will summon help immediately in every case if one keeps his eyes on aslan and not himself he will find himself made of sturdier stuff than he ever thought possible j r r tolkien describes well what we find in the narnia tales man as a whole man pitted against the universe have we seen him at alltil we see that he is like a hero in a fairy tale digory kirke in the magicians nephew twelve year old digory and his ailing mother are staying with his aunt and uncle ketterley in london while his father is in india with polly digory witnesses the founding of narnia finally bringing back to his mother the curative apple from narnia he buries both the magic rings used to transport the children into other worlds and the apple core in his back yard which produces a great tree at the end of his adventure his parents take him to live in a house in the country with uncle andrew by when the pevensie children come to stay with him he is a famous professor and traveler still living in the grand old country house he has shaggy white hair on his face as well as his head and is so odd looking the children have to stifle laughs his house is a tourist attraction ten miles from the nearest train station and two miles from a post office he owns the ketterley house too he has no wife only a housekeeper and three servants when the special narnian tree he had planted blew down in a storm he made a wardrobe from the wood which he now keeps in his country home by however he has become so poor that he has to live in a small cottage and tutor students like peter to make a living then seven years later as a result of a reunion he holds for friends of narnia he and the others end up in a fatal train accident the pevensies and their cousin peter is the oldest pevensie followed by susan edmund and lucy because of the airraids during the war they are sent from london to stay with professor kirke peter is years old susan edmund and lucy on their first adventure in they are called back to narnia to aid prince caspian after which peter and susan are told they are too old to return to narnia one year later when lucy and edmund are sent to cambridge to stay with their aunt and uncle they join eustace scrubb their cousin and sail on the dawn treader peter at this time is being tutored for an exam by professor kirke their parents on the other hand are in the u s for weeks while mr pevensie lectures and susan tags along since she is poor at schoolwork anyway in digory and polly now and years old feel they all are needed in narnia and send peter and edmund after the magic rings digory had buried in london as the othersjill eustace digory polly lucy and by chance mr and mrs pevensiecome to meet them on the train a train crash kills all of them instantly peter the oldest pevensie becomes high king of narniapeter the magnificent he is described as deepchested and a great warrior thus his sword is an appropriate gift for his use of it during battle with fenris ulf displays great bravery peter did not feel very brave indeed he felt he was going to be sick but that made no difference to what he had to do he rushed straight up to the monster and aimed a slash of his sword at its side he had just time to duck down and plunge his sword as hard as he could between the brutes forelegs into its heart then came a horrible confused moment like something in a nightmare everything was blood and heat and hair a moment later he found that the monster lay dead peter is thus a perfect example of the true chivalric ideal tempering his courage with courtesy and fairmindedness he apologizes for example for disbelieving lucy says it is his fault that edmund went bad and refuses to kill miraz when he has the advantage later aslan gives him the keys to lock the door upon narnia after it has been destroyed it is possible that lewis appropriately named him after peter the rock upon whom christ builds his church and who is given the keys to the kingdom lucy becomes lucy the valiant as a queen in narnia described as gay and golden haired lucy is one of the most clearly depicted characters in all the narnia books it is she who first enters narnia through the wardrobe she and susan are privileged to accompany aslan to his sacrifice and for their faithfulness they experience a joyous ride on his back in fact lucy seems to be spiritually closer to aslan than anyone else and they seem to share a special relationship of love during the childrens long trek with prince caspian aslan appears to lucy before any of the others his voice which she has been longing for is the one she loves best in the world she rushed to him she felt her heart would burst if she lost a moment and the next thing she knew was that she was kissing him and putting her arms as far round his neck as she could and burying her face in the beautiful rich silkiness of his mane aslan aslan dear aslan sobbed lucy at last we can understand why at the end of the last battle during all the final indescribable events in aslans country lucy silently drinks in everything more deeply than the others since lucy seems to be the most sensitive of all the children her gift of healing cordial is appropriate for example she compassionately visits the miserable eustace while he is seasick offering him her own food and water she is also the first one to sense his hurt and help him after he has become a dragon given the frightening task of looking into the magicians book to undo the spell on the dufflepuds she tactfully tries to convince them they arent ugly she also feels guilty for having left her friends so long in contrast susan becomes susan the gentle as queen of narnia and is known for her beauty susan grew into a tall and gracious woman with black hair that fell almost to her feet and the kings of the countries beyond the sea began to send ambassadors asking for her hand in marriage in fact prince rabadashs vicious attack on archenland in the horse and his boy is triggered by his irrational passion to marry and avenge her tenderhearted and skilled at archery and swimming her gift of arrows is appropriate but one of the most perplexing and disappointing details of all the stories is that in the end susan is denied admittance to aslans country she is no longer a friend of narnia we can assume that she never really believed in aslan in her heart in prince caspian for instance she is the last of the children to see aslan because she says she didnt let herself believe eustace says that during the final days whenever youve tried to get her to come and talk about narnia or do anything about narnia she says what wonderful memories you have fancy your still thinking about all those funny games we used to play when we were children jill says shes interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations she always was a jolly sight too keen on being grownup grownup indeed replies polly i wish she would grow up she wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now and shell waste all the rest of her life trying to stay that age her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of ones life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can susan is perhaps symbolic of the superficial christian whose commitment is too shallow to be real edmund commits treachery by succumbing to the witchs temptation and desiring to be king returning from his solo visit to narnia he grows increasingly nasty and spiteful and even lies about having been there but though he is perhaps a seemingly unworthy person aslan who sees the worth of every individual sacrifices himself in edmunds place edmunds transformation after he realizes the evil nature of the witchwhom he really believed was bad all alongis remarkable he and aslan stroll together alone and although no one hears what aslan says it was a conversation which edmund never forgot edmund had got past thinking about himself after all hed been through and after the talk hed had that morning he just went on looking at aslan it is thus fitting that during the later adventure of the dawn treader eustace describes his undragoning to edmund ed admits you havent been as bad as i was on my first trip to narnia you were only an ass but i was a traitor however edmund may never have fully realized what aslan did for himit would be too awful think how youd feel if you were he as king edmund appropriately becomes a grave and quieter man than peter and great in council and judgement he was called king edmund the just eustace clarence scrubb the pevensies cousin halfdeserved the name says lewis which means both a person of little account insignificant and to scratch at ones body both of course adequately dedescribe an individual whose experience vividly illustrates the most drastic kind of change that aslan can produce in a person his uptodate and advanced family is clearly portrayed eustace calls his parents harold and alberta by their first names they are vegetarians nonsmokers teetotallers wear special underclothes have little furniture and sleep with the windows open after eustace changes for the better his mother insists that he has become tiresome and commonplace at the beginning of the dawn treader eustace is a puny bossy bully with no ability to imagine or make things up who tries to impress others with his infinite superiority we can just hear him bawling about art and plumptrees vitaminised nerve food and lodging a disposition against his companions with the british consul his diary of the voyage presents an excellent insight into his personalityhis selfcenteredness and stupidity i have had a ghastly time it all proves the madness of setting out in a rotten little tub like this it would be bad enough even if one was with decent people instead of fiends in human form caspian and edmund are simply brutal to me i tried to explain that perspiration really cools people down so the men would need less water if they were working he believes that everyone is against him despises the food and primitive accommodations has a runin with reepicheepthat little bruteand all the while deceives himself into thinking he is being considerate how like eustace to think calormen the least phoney of all the countries but no matter how despicable eustace is he cant help but be changed by narnia physically his new life little as he suspected it had already done him some good his inner change comes on dragon island when he sets off alone trying to escape work but he doesnt enjoy himself for long he began almost for the first time in his life to feel lonely his greediness and inner nastiness is of course made tangible and visible by his transformation into a dragon yet the experience vastly improves him realizing the nuisance he has been he begins to examine his thoughts about himself and the others then aslan gets hold of him and from that time forth eustace really begins to be a different boy the change doesnt occur overnight he had relapses there were still many days when he could be very tiresome but the cure had begun eustace and his friend jill pole provide good examples of what lewis perceives as dangerous trends in american and british educational systems they attend experiment house a coeducational or mixed school for both boys and girls some said it was not nearly so mixed as the minds of the people who ran it these people had the idea that boys and girls should be allowed to do what they like elsewhere lewis attacks socalled democratic education which so no one will feel inferior levels courses so that there is less distinction between intelligent and stupid students at his school eustace reads only books of information with pictures of grain elevators or of fat foreign children doing exercises in model schools they discuss exports and imports and governments and drains in great detail but say little about dragons so since eustace has read none of the right books he has no idea what a dragon is and consequently has to turn into one before he learns these children also have no bibles so they dont even know about adam and eve nor do they have any idea how to tell a story straight eustace cares only about grades not about learning a subject for its own sake and he likes dead beetles pinned to cards at the beginning of the silver chair jill and eustace are so miserable at experiment house at the mercy of bullying classmates and subjected to other horrid things that they are desperate to escape into narnia not only do they escape of course but aslan comes back with them to wreak vengeance on the school the head of experiment house becomes hysterical and is made an inspector to interfere with other heads and when they found she wasnt much good even at that they got her into parliament where she lived happily ever after once she and others have been expelled experiment house becomes quite a good school after all even in narnia though education can go bad the sort of history that was taught in narnia under mirazs rule was duller than the truest history you ever read aslan rescues a poor schoolgirl gwendolen stuck inside a typical girls school the walls became a mass of shimmering green and leafy branches arched overhead where the ceiling had been miss prizzle found she was standing on grass in a forest glade then she saw the lion screamed and fled and with her fled her class who were mostly dumpy prim little girls with fat legs even cor fears that once he is restored to princedom again education and all sorts of horrible things are going to happen to me one of the acts of the four kings and queens is thus to liberate young dwarfs and satyrs from being sent to school for the children from england going to narnia greatly compensates for the faults of their schools why dont they teach logic asks professor kirke what do they teach them at these schools animals lewis believed that the presence of beings other than humans who behave humanlygiants and dwarfs and talking beastsis a central element in all fairy tales there are two reasons for this first the writer can give these animal characters a childs carefree life with no domestic or other responsibilities yet they are like adults because they can do what and go where they wish second they can portray personality types most succinctly for example where do we see courage more clearly than in the swashbuckling reepicheep a two foot mouse proudly and fearlessly defending and jabbing with his small sword lewis writes about the importance of animals in stories in his poem impenitence all the worlds wiseacres in arms against them shant detach my heart for a single moment from the manlike beasts of the earthy stories badger or moly not that im so crazd as to think the creatures do behave that way nor at all deluded by some halffalse sweetness of early childhood sharply remembered look again look well at the beasts the true ones why they all cry out to be used as symbols masks for man cartoons parodies by nature formed to reveal us each to each not fiercely but in her gentlest vein of household laughter lewis certainly has a convincing way of combining their humanness with their innate animal characteristicsthe cawing cooing crowing braying neighing baying barking lowing bleating and trumpeting the wagging tails and barking and loose slobbery mouths and noses of dogs thrust into your hand mrs beaver is a particularly memorable stereotype of the practical housewife who takes time to pack clean hankies ham tea and sugari suppose the sewing machines too heavy to bring bree snobbishly worries about his looks considers humans funny little creatures speaks to the mare hwin instead of her mistress aravis patronizes shasta and worst of all doubts that aslan is a real lion but how horsey he is too doing that which he likes best and is afraid of losing in narnia rubbing his back on the turf and waving all four legs in the air lewiss most engaging and memorable creations though are reepicheep and puddleglum reepicheep although mice were not originally talking beasts aslan gave them this honor because they nibbled away at the cords which held him to the stone table after his sacrificial death chief mouse is reepicheep most valiant of all the talking beasts of narnia who won undying glory in the second battle of beruna it was a mouse on its hind legs and stood about two feet high a thin band of gold passed round its head under one ear and over the other and in this was stuck a long crimson feather its left paw rested on the hilt of a sword very nearly as long as its tail its balance was perfect and its manners courtly it twirls its whiskers like a long moustache the mouses small size deceptively hides his abundant often impulsive courage in prince caspian for example he graciously offers his mens services in caspians army there are twelve of us sire he said with a dashing and graceful bow and i place all the resources of my people unreservedly at your majestys disposal caspian tried hard not to laugh naturally it is he who first offers to step through aslans door to the island of the telmarines in the voyage o f the dawn treader we get an even better look at reepicheep who voluntarily serves as sentry over the water and indignantly jabs for his honor at eustace who mockingly swirls him through the air by the tail of course he is first to volunteer to fight singlehandedly against dragons he even plays chess daringly by sending his knight into the combined danger of queen and castle for his mind was full of forlorn hopes death or glory charges and last stands only reepicheep wants to press on to the dark island for he argues here is as great an adventure as ever i heard of and here if we turn back no little impeachment of all our honours for the same reason he refuses to leave aslans table this is a very great adventure and no danger seems to me so great as that of knowing when i get back to narnia that i left a mystery behind me through fear then he is the first to believe in the safety of the food and the truthfulness of ramandus daughter i will drink to the lady he cries as he valiantly raises his cup in the air his quest to reach the worlds end has an arthurian flavor the spell of it has been on me all my life he says quivering with excitement at the adventures end he is determined to go on while i can i sail east in the dawn treader when she fails me i paddle east in my coracle when she sinks i shall swim east with my four paws as he throws his sword into the sea it stands up with its hilt above the surface like arthurs excalibur a sign of valor indeed he does reach aslans country for who else but reepicheep later welcomes the children at the golden gates of aslans garden reepicheeps courage and dignity are so extraordinary however that aslan expresses concern that he may be overcome by vanity in prince caspian the mouse loses his tail and thus his balance in battle so he requests a new tail because a tail is the honour and glory of a mouse i have sometimes wondered friend says aslan whether you do not think too much about your honour reepicheep replies permit me to remind you that a very small size has been bestowed on us mice and if we did not guard our dignity some would allow themselves very unsuitable pleasantries at our expense aslan grants him his wish not because of his dignity but because of the love and kindness of his people reepicheep seems not only immune from fear and loss of dignity but also from greed and envy surprisingly he comforts eustace when he is a dragon telling him stories of greater people who have fallen and eustace never forgot it he also keeps out of the quarrel over the gold on deathwater island puddleglum puddleglum the marshwiggle is perhaps lewiss most unique creation described as follows he has a long thin face with rather sunken cheeks a tightly shut mouth a sharp nose and no beard it was wear ing a high pointed hat like a steeple with an enor mously rude flat brim the hair if it could be called hair which hung over its large ears was greenygrey and each lock was flat rather than round so that they were like tiny reeds its expression was solemn and its complexion muddy and you could see at once that it took a very serious view of life he has very long legs and arms and webbed hands and feet like a frog like all marshwiggles who enjoy their privacy he lives in a wigwam in the reedy marshes lewis according to hooper and green based the character of puddleglum on his gardener fred paxford who was similarly unusual and given to gloomy prognostications an inwardly optimistic outwardly pessimistic dear frustrating shrewd country man of immense integrity indeed poor puddleglum always expects the worst of every possible situation very likely what with enemies and mountains and rivers to cross and losing our way and next to nothing to eat and sore feet well hardly notice the weather yet isnt he the perfect guide for eustace and jill on their mission to save rilian his coldblooded clearsightedness and reliability are invaluable in the frozen lands of the north his pessimism keeps him from too readily succumbing to giants or witches and he remembers aslans rules when the children fail during the witchs enchantment for example he stoutheartedly stamps out the fire with his webbed foot and solidly denounces her world im on aslans side even if there isnt any aslan to lead it im going to live as like a narnian as i can even if there isnt any narnia rogues various other characters provide good satires of common personality types and sometimes receive humorous and ridiculous rewards for their actions uncle andrew the proud and foolish dabbler in magic is always out for his own skin apparently he has mismanaged all of his sisters money and if his vanity isnt bad enough he greedily plots the commercialization of narnia by burying coins or valuables and letting them spring up into trees what a fitting punishment when the animals plant himfortunately rightside upand then the elephant appropriately hoses him each animal kindly feeds him with nuts worms and globs of honey aslan calls him simply an old sinner who cannot hear his voice and puts him to sleep in the horse and his boy rabadash receives a similar judgment he impetuously attacks archenland for his own private purpose of getting back at susan and fulfilling his premature desire for the throne his reward is to be suspended from the castle wall in battle hooked by his own chainshirt to a peg in the wall still he indignantly threatens vengeance on lunes forces for this undignified insult although aslan warns him to cast aside his pride and anger he bombards them with curses until his nemesis his ears become pointed and covered with gray hair his face grows long and thick then he stands up on all fours until he is simply and unmistakably a donkey yet aslans justice is tempered with mercy for as long as rabadash does not stray from tashs temple he will remain a human in the voyage of the dawn treader gumpas is the bilious governor of the lone islands and the stereotype of the progressive politican how fitting that gump means dolt or numbskull he sticks mechanically to his appoint ment schedule forms rules and regulations ledgers records minutes dossiers and documents he measures progress by economic development through slavery as proven by statistics and graphs fittingly he is ousted by clever trickery and a single word from caspian lewis be lieved that no one is fit to own or dominate another person although the dufflepuds are probably based on a fabulous medieval creature they too are some of lewiss most unforgettable creations a duffer means an incapable foolish stupid inept unproductive person once dwarfs and servants of coriakin the magician they disobeyed his reasonable request that they obtain water from a nearby stream instead of trudging half a mile away to a spring coriakin who because of their illogic must rule by rough magic and not by wisdom is being punished for something he did and is in charge of them he puts an uglifying spell on them to avoid seeing each others ugliness they put a spell on each other making themselves invisible and of course lucy makes them visible again at their request as lewiss own drawing showed they are like mushrooms with three foot stalks and an umbrella attached to each each body had a single thick leg right under it and at the end of it a single enormous foota broadtoed foot with the toes curling up a little so that it looked rather like a small canoe the foot keeps off sun and rain can be used as a boat and bounces them up and down like a spring but they are very conceited and illogical washing dishes before dinner and planting boiled potatoes to save time they constantly repeat every trivial and obvious pronouncement from their chief one cant help seeing in the dufflepuds a little of his own relationship to god although the magician wants the best for them they persist in going their own foolish ways or changing what they are for something worse instead of allowing coriakin to rule them by wisdom they view him in all the wrong ways one minute they talk as if i ran everything and overheard everything and was extremely dangerous the next moment they think they can take me in by tricks that a baby would see throughbless them chapter creations of evil when we seek our own pleasure as the ultimate good we place ourselves as the center of the universe but nothing created is the center madeleine lengle a wind in the door where maleldil is there is the centre there is no way out of the centre save into the bent will which casts itself into the nowhere perelandra some people argue that fairy tales frighten children especially if they vividly portray battles and wicked characters narnia certainly contains a diversity of evilogres with monstrous teeth and wolves and bullheaded men spirits of evil trees and poisonous plants cruels hags incubuses wraiths horrors efreets sprites orknies wooses ettins ghouls boggles minotaurs spectres people of the toadstools and other creatures whom i wont describe because if i did the grownups would probably not let you read this book lewis is opposed to the idea that we must protect a child from the knowledge that he is born into a world of death violence wounds adventure heroism and cowardice good and evil such protection may breed in him a shallow escapism since he will undoubtedly meet cruel and horrifying enemies he should also hear of and admire brave knights heroic courage comforters and protectors so let there be wicked kings and beheadings battles and dungeons giants and dragons and let villains be soundly killed at the end of the book charn the essence of evil worlds is always a perversion of the good entering the cloud of vague whirling shapes through one of the pools in the wood between the worlds digory and polly find themselves in charn once a great city city of the king of kings wonder of all worlds it is now a dying world once bustling with slaves chariots and ritual drums and sacrifices in the temple it is now a cold dead empty silence devoid of any life only temples towers palaces pyramids and bridges remain courtyard after courtyard stand in ruin the sun is older than ours giving off a dull steady red light in a dark sky and a stale wind blows where once a river flowed which was turned to blood there is only a ditch then at the very end of the magicians nephew the little pool which once led to charn becomes a dry hollow signalling the end of its existence and giving a subtle warning to the race of adam and eve just how did this world fall to such ruin the witches jadis the white witch is onehalf giant and onehalf jinn the jinn are descended from lilith who according to jewish mythology was adams first wife but refused to obey him and became satans dam although she is bad all through jadis is exceedingly beautiful with a look of such fierce wild pride that she seems ten times more alive than most people in london often compared to hans christian andersens snow queen she is seven feet tall and dressed all in white fur with a gold wand and crown her face was whitenot merely pale but white like snow or paper or icing sugar except for her very red mouth it was a beautiful face in other respects but proud and cold and stern she is also physically powerful and can even hear mens thoughts jadis history begins as she battles against her sister who refuses to yield her the throne of charn in revenge jadis speaks the deplorable word which destroys all living things when spoken this word known only to the great monarchs of her race was learned in a secret place and paid for by a terrible price with the word she casts all of charn and its inhabitants into a frozen enchantment under one of her spells the witch promises to sleep among them like a statue until someone strikes a bell to awaken her digory and polly of course discover her asleep in the courtroom on a four foot high square pillar is a golden arch from which hangs a golden bell and beside it lies a golden hammer inscribed on its side with the following words make your choice adventurous stranger strike the bell and bide the danger or wonder till it drives you mad what would have followed if you had wild with curiosityi wonder i wonder i wonderdigory finally strikes the bell at first it gives off a sweet sound which instead of dying away grows unbearably loud until it awakens the witch later digory admits to aslan that he simply wanted to know what would happen if he struck the bellhe wasnt really enchanted by the letters the children escape to the wood between the worlds by touching their yellow rings but jadis first grabbing pollys hair and then digorys ears stays with them until they are back in london later the witch enters narnia by digory grabbing hold of her ankle rebelling against this another new world she hurls the iron bar from the lamppost in england at aslans forehead but it comes to life where it falls growing up as a young lamppost afterwards this lamp shines day and night in the narnian forest and the area where it stands is called lantern waste the witch flees north and the tree of protection keeps her from narnia for years then jadis returns to rule narnia as queen for years as we see in the lion the witch and the wardrobe her reign is accompanied by continuous winter and christmas never comes but in this story she meets her end although she can turn other people to stone with a flick of her wand she is weaker than aslan turn him into stone if she can stand on her two feet and look him in the face itll be the most she can do when she challenges his promise to die for edmund one mighty roar from aslan sends her running she believes she is victorious in killing aslan on the stone table but she is ignorant of the deeper magic which invalidates all her claims to the victim and reverses death itself with a roar that shook all narnia from the western lamppost to the shores of the eastern sea aslan flings himself into battle against jadis lucy saw her face lifted towards him for one second with an expression of terror and amazement before she is killed jadis is not to be confused with the green witch in the silver chair ruler of the shallowlands though they are of the same lineage like jadis she is deceptively beautiful she wears a long fluttering dress of dazzling green and laughs in the richest most musical laugh you can imagine but her true nature is revealed when she changes into a serpent traditionally the symbol of satan and evil temptation lewis deals with temptation in many of his novels especially perelandra and it occurs in various guises in the narnia books as well he makes it plain that evil must be fought within two levelsas spiritual warfare as well as physical the narnia tales are filled with conflict against evil forces which attempt to dominate individuals wills and lives temptation is frequently experienced in the desire to know digory for instance is directly responsible for awakening jadis because of his uncontrollable curiosity to know what will happen if he hits the bell later aslan sends him on a special mission he is told to go to a green hill at the end of a lake there he finds golden gates facing east that say come in by the gold gates or not at all take of my fruit for others or forbear for those who steal or those who climb my wall shall find their hearts desire and find despair central within the garden is a tree of life aslan has commissioned digory to bring back one of its silvergold apples with seeds to plant in the newly created narnia such hunger and thirst overcome digory that he longs just to taste the fruit he sees the witch eating an apple but notices that it makes a horrid red stain on her mouth if he doesnt listen to her she warns he will miss some knowledge that would have made you happy all your life it is the apple of youth the apple of life i know for i have tasted it and i feel already such changes in myself that i know i shall never grow old or die eat it boy eat it and you and i will both live forever and be king and queen of this whole world although this appeal certainly is tempting an even greater temptation for digory is jadis suggestion that he take an apple to save his mother first before completing his task for aslan all will be well again your home will be happy again you will be like other boys oh gasped digory as if he had been hurt and put his hand to his head digory now realizes the terrible choice that lies before him the witch urges him to follow her suggestion by reasoning that the lion hasnt done anything that would make digory his slave and cant help him in this world anyway besides what would his mother think such a wild animal must have made him cruel to make such silly promises polly in fact could stay here so no one would need to know this last suggestion is so patently mean that digory realizes the falsehood and hollowness of the witchs logic as a result of her eating of the fruit all apples become a horror to her aslan explains that this will happen to all those who pluck and eat fruits at the wrong time and in the wrong waywho disobey him and satisfy their own prideful lust for power the fruit is good but they loathe it ever after true jadis is granted her desire for strength and endless daysbut she receives eternal misery as well thus uncle andrews prophecy that no great wisdom can be reached without sacrifice comes true greedfor wisdom for poweris seen in andrew himself not only does he dabble in magic in order to discover new unseen worlds and then trick the children into doing his dirty work for him but he also tries to capitalize on narnias ability to grow gold and silver trees from coins in the lion the witch and the wardrobe greed is vividly portrayed when the witch tempts edmund with turkish delight this is a candy that makes you want it more than anything else so that you would eat it till you kill yourself edmunds greed also appears in his desire to be king as the witch promises and to have all his brothers and sisters under him of course the witch tosses in a few other ploys as well she enlarges upon his handsomeness and tricks him into not telling the others about her food becomes the main bait in the silver chair when the childrens obsession for the giants food as promised by the green witch distracts them from looking for aslanssigns gold and riches are also common objects of temptation and on deathwater island lust for gold makes the children so greedily quarrelsome that only a stern glare from aslan reminds them that they have sinned and what better image of greed can we discover than eustace snoozing on the dragons treasure his pockets bursting with jewels filled with dragonish thoughts eustace turns into a dragon quite like the one lewis describes in a poem lord that made the dragon grant me thy peace but say not that i should give up the gold nor move nor die others would have the gold kill rather lord the men and other dragons the dragon speaks lucy undergoes two different temptations as she reads the magicians magic book first she discovers a spell to make her beautiful beyond the lot of mortals she sees herself throned and lovely with all the kings fighting for her so that even her sister susan is jealous but lucy has the feeling she mustnt succumb to this temptation and a growl from aslan confirms her intuition but she does give in to the temptation to have the forbidden knowledge of knowing what her friends think about her perhaps spoiling the potential for lifelong friendships probably the most vivid example of the wiles of the witches is the enchantment of jill eustace and puddleglum in the silver chair the green witch flings a green powder into the air and strums a mandolin both of which confuse their minds making thinking difficult through her enchantment she begins to convince them that their world is but a dream and her lamp the real sun you can put nothing into your makebelieve without copying it from the real world this world of mine which is the only world appropriately she turns into the symbolic serpent of evil at the end of her temptation pride pride is the root problem of most who are sucked in by temptation or are evil themselves jadis boasts of her power as ruler of charn and her possession of the deplorable word ours is a high and lonely destiny as queen of charn jadis believes her people exist only to do her will digory notes that she never seems interested in objects or people unless she can use them concentrating her attention on those she needs at the moment in the last battle shift who defines true freedom as doing what i tell you echoes this attitude uncle andrew though certainly a feeble parallel to jadis is much like her he is vain enough to think that he called jadis to england and even deludes himself that she is beginning to love him once he gets into narnia himself he worries about his own fate what about me they dont seem to think of that no one thinks of me in fact andrew speaks jadis very words men like me who possess hidden wisdom are freed from common rules just as we are cut off from common pleasures ours my boy is a high and lonely destiny digory perceptively realizes that all andrew really means is that he can do anything he likes to get anything he wants the witch andrew and their like have no rules how unlike aslan who obeys even his own rules caspian though not as selfcentered as these two slips into selfishness when he longs to abandon his ship and country and sail on to the end of the world reepicheep sternly warns you shall not please yourself with adventures as if you were a private person this is a hard lesson learned over and over again by the children and other narnians they must obey first and help others not themselves digory for instance must get the apple seed before aslan will help his mother and surprisingly when he does succeed in his task he feels no conceit at all after his long bout with the witch edmund too finally stops thinking about himselfhe just went on looking at aslan even vain old bree who perpetually worries about his looks and social respectability has to learn that he wont be anyone special in narnia and through aslan he loses his self conceit as aslan teaches if you feel yourself selfsufficient it is proof that you are not other effects of evil can readily be seen an obvious example is the comparison of the worlds of aslan and the mock worlds conceived by evilcharn and the shallowlands these are nothing but dead worlds the witch turns even narnia into an icy white enchantment where the frozen animal statues seem to reflect natures retreat as a consequence of evil in the last battle deception results in the cutting down of trees the silencing and harnessing of talking horses and the same kind of slavery sadness fear and gloom that can be found in the shallowlands evil also sets out to corrupt the truths about reality the green witch claims that her lamp is real and the sun a fake and telmarines like miraz call all stories about narnia and aslan falseold wives fables these examples illustrate what can happen when our experiences of god and heaven become further and further removed from the experiences of the ancient biblical writers we begin to view what they say as simply metaphors rather than solid facts evil tries to set up false gods shift of course creates a parody of aslan and tries to make the creatures believe that aslan is not the one they have longed for and believed in these narnians actually begin to doubt their belief altogether thinking the changes in narnia are punishment for a terrible wrong next shifts group tries to confuse aslan and tash by merging them into tashlan the god tash whose name appropriately means blemish is the calormene god who requires human sacrifices it had the head of a bird some bird of prey with a cruel curved beak it had four arms which it held high above its head stretching them out northward as if it wanted to snach all narnia in its grip and its fingersall twenty of themwere curved like its beak and had long pointed birdlike claws instead of nails its deathly smell is vastly different from the fragrant breath of aslan as shift and the others begin to equate tash and aslan the narnians wonder how a god who feeds on blood could be the same as the good lion by whose blood all narnia was saved even worse perhaps is the enlightened philosophy of ginger the cat who is cockily convinced that neither god exists sadly for him he discovers that tash exists all right lewis vividly shows the reality of demons it seems then said the unicorn that there is a real tash after allyes said the dwarf and this fool of an ape who didnt believe in tash will get more than he bargained for he called for tash tash has come because rabadash similarly calls on tash aslan allows him to be a man in tashs temple but a donkey if he leaves edmund is a prime case study in the gradual effects of sin after he returns home from narnia he first lies about having been there then his behavior becomes nastier and nastier as the sin eats away at him feeling snubbed he increasingly resents his brother and wants to get even with him the beavers note the evil look in his eyes the horrible ideas in his head worst of all he mocks aslan painting an impertinent moustache on a lion statue finally evil makes us forget the glimpses and glimmers of the numinous that appear to us all through our lives the witch has no recollection of ever having been in the quiet place of the magic wood between the worlds and under the enchantment of the green witch rilian says he cannot even remember his true self but evil never conquers totally rilian is allowed to be himself one hour a day problems in discerning evil no matter how obvious its effects evil itself is not always easily detected the problem of perceiving and understanding what is evil is defined well by edmund which is the right side how do we know the fauns are in the right and the queen is in the wrong we dont really know anything about either how do we know he queries certainly part of the white witchs magic says lewis is that she can make things appear to be what they arent she certainly doesnt look like our usual conception of the devil the green witch too is disguised as a beautiful woman in a green garment with her lovely voice she not only deceives rilian into believing she is all good but the children also fail to recognize her as the green serpent in the last battle shift uses both false appearances with the lions skin and also a deceptive logic and a cunning twisting of the facts note how he misinterprets every one of the signs for puzzle then tricks poor puzzle into doing what he wants in prince caspian lucy hypothesizes about the deceptiveness of evil which may come to our world wouldnt it be dreadful if some day in our own world at home men started going wild inside like the animals here and still looked like men so that youd never know which were which so how do we perceive evil quite often in the tales the children are told they can recognize friends who have been in narnia or evil people simply by their eyes at aslans table when edmund is skeptical about whether or not ramandus daughter can be trusted and the food is safe to eat she says you cant know you can only believe or not but more often we may really find the answer deep within us down deep inside for example edmund says he knew that the witch was really bad and cruel as we have seen ones response to a witch or to aslan reflects the kind of person he really is chapter christian concepts in the narnia tales a summary a man may well discover truth in what he wrote for he was dealing all the time with things that came from thoughts beyond his own george macdonald the fantastic imagination many readers cannot help but notice how aslan reminds them of christ or how the stories teach them certain religious values in fact a monk named brother stanislas wrote to the new york c s lewis society that he had read the narnia tales three times in three years they have been for me about the most spiritual books i have read in my years as a monk he commented but did lewis intentionally include these theological elements in the stories in of other worlds lewis wrote some people seem to think that i began by asking myself how i could say something about christianity to children then fixed on the fairy tale as an instrument then collected information about child psychology and decided what age group id write for then drew up list of basic christian truths and hammered out allegories to embody them this is all pure moonshine the christian elements welled up more or less unconsciously into the narrative as lewis wrote it what lewis did see is how stories like the narnia tales could steal past the inhibitions and traditional religious concepts we are often raised with in childhood why did one find it so hard to feel as one was told one ought to feel about god or about the sufferings of christ i thought the chief reason was that one was told one ought to and obligation to feel can freeze feelings and reverence itself did harm the whole subject was associated with lowered voices almost as if it were something medical but supposing that by casting all these things into an imaginary world stripping them of their stainedglass and sunday school associations one could make them for the first time appear in their real potency could one not thus steal past those watchful dragons if a reader does not discover any religious parallel whatsoever dont put one in warns lewis the moral inherent in them should arise unconsciously from whatever spiritual roots you have succeeded in striking during the whole course of your life although biblical principles are very much present in the narnia series they are certainly not allegorycharacters and events in narnia do not represent anything if one tries to find such correspondencesfor example a comparison of aslans sacrifice with christs crucifixionhe will be disappointed instead lewis believed that a writer as creator in a sense rearranges elements god has already provided in his world and which already contain his meanings george macdonald a writer who greatly influenced lewis explains this process in his essay on the fantastic imagination one difference between gods work and mans is that while gods work cannot mean more than he meant mans must mean more than he meant for in everything that god has made there is layer upon layer of ascending significance also he expresses the same thought in higher and higher kinds of that thought it is gods things his embodied thoughts which alone a man has to use modified and adapted to his own purposes for the expression of his thoughts therefore he cannot help his words and figures falling into such combinations in the mind of another as he had himself not foreseen so many are the thoughts allied to every other thought so many are the relations involved in every figure so many the facts in every symbol furthermore lewis believed that the world of the supernatural and spiritual was both an important element of good stories and a way to create believable and significant other worlds to him the plot which is really only a series of events in the story is important merely as a net to catch something else that something else is the numinous the sense of the spiritual of god since spiritual truths are often profound and beyond our experience our attempts to describe them must be constantly changed in order to avoid the narrowness of any one description lewiss books help us see these truths from totally new perspectives several terms might be used to describe his techniques one of course is supposition what if god were to appear in a different form in a different world seeing the aspects of a liongentleness majesty awesomeness terriblenessmay help us learn to understand know and love christ in a new way another way to describe this method is transposition the restatement of ideas in new terms just as piano music can be transposed and scored for other instruments lewis also uses vivid illustrations that serve to make deep spiritual concepts concrete a perfect example is eustaces undragoning by the process of peeling away layer after layer of skina marvellous picture of salvation and spiritual regeneration the gift of description particularly of aslans country and the worlds end is an aspect unique to lewis what other author can so unfailingly depict for us what heaven and true joy and purity may be like his imagerythe garden tree and stream for exampleis biblically rooted yet used in a unique way to give us a totally new perception all of these methods will be discussed later in this chapter as we discuss the various biblical concepts that lewiss books echo our effort will be to show how they may remind us of these ideas or help us understand perhaps through a simple illustration what the bible means in no way are the narnia events exact biblical parallels but perhaps through seeing aslan evil and many christian virtues in another world we may relate them better to our own creation in genesis god created the world by his word first the heaven and earth once a shapeless chaotic voidthen light sky and water dry land grass plants and trees sun and moon sea creatures and birds wild animals and reptiles and at last man aslan also creates narnia from an empty world nothing it is dark and cold but there is cool flat earthy substance underfoot then aslan sings the world into creation first the stars planets and sun then rivers valleys hills rocks and water grass and vegetation trees and finally animals and insects gods let there bes are echoed by aslans be walking trees be talking beasts be divine waters fledge also echoes the genesis chapters when aslan asks him about his flying it is good it is very good instead of creating man as the ruler of all living things aslan chooses two of each animal and touches their noses with his this of course reminds us of noah in genesis choosing two of each animal who are to multiply and inhabit the world after the flood with aslans breath comes a flash like fire upon the chosen animals this image seems to be used throughout the narnia tales as a signal of the holy spirit or of aslans empowering of his followers his warning to them is like that which god makes to man creatures i give you yourselves i give to you forever this land of narnia i give you the woods the fruits the rivers i give you the stars and i give you myself the dumb beasts whom i have not chosen are yours also treat them gently and cherish them but do not go back to their ways lest you cease to be talking beasts for out of them you were taken and into them you can return adam and eve are told that all the earth is to be subdued under them but in genesis after their fall god tells them that as they were made from the ground to the ground they will return although man himself is not created in narnia he plays an important role there just as he was on earth man is directly responsible for the entrance of evil into the new world you come of the lord adam and the lady eve said aslan and that is both honour enough to erect the head of the poorest beggar and shame enough to bow the shoulders of the greatest emperor in earth when digory succumbs to the temptation to know he awakens the witch appropriately she enters narnia before it is even five hours old by digorys grabbing onto her heel she kicks him with her heel and cuts him in the mouth this is reminiscent of gods punishment of satan and eve he shall strike you on your head while you will strike at his heel just as adam and eve are told that they must struggle to extract a living from the soil aslan asks king frank if he can use a spade and plough and raise food out of the earth but man is also able to bring about the help narnia needs evil will come of that evil but it is still a long way off and i will see to it that the worst falls upon myself as adams race has done the harm adams race shall help heal it is this not like christs cure for sin through be coming a man himself death came into the world because of what man did and it is because of what this other man has done that now there is the resurrection from the dead only members of adams race can be kings or queens of narnia but they are entreated to rule the creatures kindly and fairly since all narnians are free subjects the tree and the garden god planted the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of eden but because man disobeyed and ate of the second tree god punished him separating him from both trees some day however believers will be restored to partake of the tree of life because of christs sacrifice on a tree on a hill lewis uses these same ideas in narnia digory goes to the western wilds where he finds a steep green hill on top is a garden with a tree at its center the apples of this tree cast a light of their own and roosting in its branches is a bird larger than an eagle with saffron breast head crested with scarlet and purple tail like aslan himself this garden is permeated with a warm sweet golden smell that brings tears to digorys eyes the hill itself is surrounded by a high wall of green turf and trees of blue and silver facing easttoward aslans countryare the golden gates unlike adam and eve digory does not succumb to the temptation to eat the fruit instead he takes the apple straight to aslan since digory has hungered and thirsted and wept for this fruit he is permitted to sow the seed in narnia himself by simply tossing it into soft soil this tree protects narnia from the witch for many years it grows quickly casting a light from its apples of silver and sending forth a breathtaking smell like the tree in eden the fruit of this tree can bring joy healing and protection when used in the right way but death and horror and despair when taken in selfish disobedience for example it is called the apple of life for digorys mother because it is eaten in the right way and time but gives an endless life of misery to the witch because she plucked the apple in her own way for herself these same symbols reappear in the last moments of narnias story as we shall see later sacrifice and resurrection the events of the lion the witch and the wardrobe remind us in many ways of christs crucifixion and resurrection but in no way exactly parallel the account in the bible they do however give us a new understanding of atonement and rebirth in christ with aslan christmas comes for the first time in years the time between his first arrival in narnia and the coming of spring is appropriately about monthswhen easter occurs according to narnian history the emperoroversea sent a deep magic into the world from the dawn of time this magic permits the witch to kill every traitor and unless she has blood narnia will perish in water and fire this law is written on the stone table the trunk of the world ash tree and the emperors sceptre and is similar to gods old testament law which is written on the stone tablets requiring death and the shedding of blood as the penalty for sin but further back in time is a deeper magic about which the witch knows nothing this law states that when a willing victim who has committed no treachery is killed in the traitors stead the stone table will crack and death will start working backwards what a marvelously succinct expression of the new testament message according to new testament law the law of love when christ is sacrificed as the perfect substitute for man the old testament law is crackedgods demand is met paid for and death no longer has a hold on us for the wages of sin is death but the free gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord yes all have sinned all fall short of gods glorious ideal yet now god declares us not guilty of offending him if we trust in jesus christ who in his kindness freely takes away our sins for god sent christ jesus to take the punishment for our sins and to end all gods anger against us he used christs blood and our faith as a means of saving us from his wrath aslan is sacrificed only for edmund though and this is different from the biblical idea of one individuals atonement for all mankind yet this brings down to earth the very personal sacrifice involved christ died and would have died even for one individual just as christs disciples expected him to help them as their savior who would deliver them from earthly oppression then and there so too the children talk happily of the future battle and of aslans leading them in deliverance from the witchs forces you will be there yourself aslan says peter but aslan promises nothing he is in fact strangely sad and deep in thought for he knows he must pay the price for the judaslike traitor edmund like jesus evening in the garden of gethsemane aslans last night is expectant and troubled lucy and susan like christs faithful disciples follow aslan into the woods but his tail and head hung low and he walked slowly as if he were very very tired for perhaps the first time in our lives we can visualize what it was like for christ to know he would have to die oh children children children why are you following me aslan asks he tells them to promise to stop when he bids them to so he can go on alone until then they walk with him and comfort him by burying their hands in his mane then they watch him go on quietly and alone to confront the witch and her band of horrible creatures just as christ was aslan is mocked kicked hit spit on and jeered puss puss poor pussy how many mice have you caught today cat but even when muzzled aslan looks beautiful and patient just as christ could have called the angels to rescue him so too aslan could have broken out of his bonds if he had wanted to lucy observes aslan is not sacrificed on a cross but on a stone table located on the middle of an open hilltop in the great woods it is a slab of grey stone supported by other stones with strange lines and figures inscribed on it stabbing him with a strange and evilly shaped stone knife the witch jeers you have given me narnia forever you have lost your own life and you have not saved his in lewiss book till we have faces he uses the stone as a symbol of an ancient pagan religion so he may be using the stone slab with its strange writing and the stone knife as symbols for gods law which requires death as a penalty for sin when the sacrifice is over the table is divided in two as was the veil in the tabernacle after christs crucifixion lucy and susan who have looked away during the hopeless and horrid murder later return sadly to the scene of dead calm they remind us of the women who returned dejectedly on easter morning to christs tomb but very gradually changes begin to happen the sky slowly lightens the mice nibble away at the cords which hold aslan to the table then they see aslan himselfresurrected more full of life than ever its more magic they looked round there shining in the sunrise larger than they had seen him before shaking his mane stood aslan himself is he a ghost the warm breath and rich perfumy smell assure them he is not salvation while aslans sacrifice may not exactly parallel the events of christs crucifixion it does illustrate his personal sacrifice for edmunds sin after privately walking and talking with aslan edmund is his real self for the first time in his life eustaces undragoning though is one of the most striking episodes in the chronicles and a wonderful image of salvation and consequent penetration to the true self eustace clarence scrubb the typical stuffed shirt snob is turned appropriately into a dragon in whose likeness through loneliness he learns about friendship but the real changehis undragoningcan only come from aslan himself first he feels aslan commanding follow me then aslan takes him from the description we assume he is taken to the mountains of his country to a garden with a well at the center next the lion tells him to undress so i started scratching myself and my scales began coming off all over the place and then i scratched a little deeper and instead of just scales coming off here and there my whole skin started peeling off beautifully like it does after an illness or as if i was a banana but as he starts going into the well to bathe he looks down and sees that it was all hard and rough and wrinkled and scaly just as it had been before so i scratched and tore again and this underskin peeled off beautifully and out i stepped and left it lying beside the other one but the exact same thing happens and he scratches off yet another layer you will have to let me undress you says aslan when aslan tears off the skin with his claws it hurt worse than anything ive ever felt but it feels good to have the ugly dark knobbly stuff gone aslan then tosses him into the stingingly cold clear water and the pain in his arm disappears he also finds himself somehow dressed in new clothes the cure had begun everyone notices the change in eustaces behavior after his undragoning this episode is a perfect illustration of what happens when christ gets hold of a sinner and makes him a new creature we ourselves are unable to peel away our layers of sin and selfishness in fact we find that such ugliness has penetrated to the very roots the center of our lives the experience of letting christ do it for us may hurt but he bathes us in the water of new life and reclothes us as new creations our behavior cannot help but be changed when someone becomes a christian he becomes a brand new person inside he is not the same any more a new life has begun in another vivid example lewis uses the same biblical symbol of water to show the regenerating power of salvation in john jesus tells a woman every one who drinks of this water will thirst again but whoever drinks of the water that i shall give him will never thirst the water that i shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life throughout the bible living water and the river of living water flowing from the throne of god are used to symbolically describe new life and the blessings flowing from the heart of the believer which find their source in god revelation john in the silver chair jill is thirsty but afraid to approach a stream because a great lion is standing on the other side i darent come and drink said jill then you will die of thirst said the lion oh dear said jill coming up another step nearer i suppose i must go and look for another stream then there is no other stream said the lion so jill kneels and drinks the coldest and most refreshing water she has ever had and it quenches her thirst at once similarly after shasta meets and communes with aslan on the mountainside he notices the deep large footprint left in the grass but there was something more remarkable than the size about it as he looked at it water had already filled the bottom of it soon it was full to the brim and then overflowing and a little stream was running downhill past him over the grass this little stream provides shasta with the refreshment he needs in the last battle tirian and his band of followers while hiding near the stable by a white rock discover a trickle of water flowing down the rock face into a little pool just when they need it most in the heat of battle they are provided with the most delicious drink they had ever had in their lives and while they were drinking they were perfectly happy and could not think of anything else appropriately the way to aslans country is across a river from all countries and aslan calls himself the great bridge builder to arrive there the children scale a waterfall that leads them to the golden gates in the weight of glory lewis writes what would it be to taste at the fountainhead that stream of which even these lower reaches prove so intoxicating yet that i believe is what lies before us the whole man is to drink from the fountain of joy the idea of spiritual refreshment also seems to be depicted by aslans table which the children discover during their adventures on the dawn treader perhaps an image of the communion table aslans table is set by aslans bidding for those who come that far to the worlds end this sumptuous banquet is more magnificent than the children have ever seen like the manna god provided for the israelites the food is eaten and renewed every day for large white birds carry away all uneaten morsels ramandu is brought a small fruit like a live coal which is set on his tonguea fireberry which takes his age away little by little this episode is very reminiscent of isaiah in which a seraphim takes a coal from the altar and lays it in isaiahs mouth thus purging him of sin end times and final judgment in matthew jesus warns what events will signal his return and the end of the world jesus told them dont let anyone fool you for many will come claiming to be the messiah and will lead many astray when you hear of wars beginning this does not signal my return these must come but the end is not yet the nations and kingdoms of the earth will rise against each other you will be tortured and killed and hated all over the world because you are mine and many of you shall fall back into sin and betray and hate each other and many false prophets will appear and lead many astray how similar this account is to the changes narnia undergoes in its final days shifts mockaslan is an almost ridiculous antichrist figure there are false rumors about aslan talking animals are sold into slavery and hard labor there are wars and betrayals the centaur tells the children that the stars do not prophecy the coming of aslan but rather the coming evil then in matthew jesus describes the end of the earth immediately after the persecution of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give light and the stars will seem to fall from the heavens and the powers overshadowing the earth will be convulsed and i shall send forth my angels with the sound of a mighty trumpet blast and they shall gather my chosen ones from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven the end of narnia is much like this father time blows his horn producing each change in the landscape just as aslans song had created it first comes a downpouring of stars leaving the sky empty aslans acceptance into his country of those animals truly faithful to him is like a final judgment scene those who love him pass by him to his right into the door those who hate and fear him cease to be talking animals passing to his left and into his enormous and terrible shadow giant dragons and lizards consume the vegetation and a wall of water rises to cover the earth the red and dying sun and moon burn to nothing creating a steam that rises from the bloodred waters similarly in acts jesus prophesies i will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood at last time has ended eternity has begun resurrection life in the silver chair we join the children in a wonderful glimpse of the afterlife in aslans country and the means by which one can truly experience it during caspians funeral in narnia the children are taken to aslans mountain to walk by that significant stream then in a striking image of the saving power of christs blood and the thorns which pierced his brow to shed some of that blood eustace is told to drive a thorn into aslans paw the blood splashes onto the dead caspian and then the miraculous change begins as we see death truly working backward fulfilling the deeper magic his white beard turned to grey and from grey to yellow and got shorter and vanished altogether and his sunken cheeks grew round and fresh and the wrinkles were smoothed and his eyes opened and his eyes and lips both laughed and suddenly he leaped up and stood before them knowing he has died they think he is a ghost just as lucy and susan had thought aslan a ghost when he appeared before him after his sacrifice but one cant be a ghost in ones own country caspian now has the freedom of no longer wanting or doing the wrong things and of never being afraid this is his real home now and the children have been promised that they too will come here to stay one day indeed they do come home leaving our world forever through a train accident alive in aslans country their end on earth is the beginning of an even greater and never ending story everyone they have ever heard of or loved and thought dead is thereexcept susan of course what will our resurrected bodies be like lewis suggests that we will look the same only better just as the lands the children see in aslans country are the reality of which narnia and england were incomplete reflections the children and animals can run faster without getting hot or tired and can even scale a waterfall but they are not yet as happy as aslan means for them to be the stable door and garden in his image of heaven lewis brings together several rich biblical symbols which tie all the books together the children first enter aslans country through a stable door in our world too a stable once had something inside it that was bigger than our whole world in john jesus said i am the door if any one enters by me he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture the stable seen from within and without are two different places through the door they see only darkness the bonfire and the disbelieving dwarfs squatting just inside it inside is aslans country it is interesting that shift had first used this stable for his false aslan and later that tash hides within it lewis may here be illustrating his belief that many pagan and false religions in a sense prefigure christianity containing elements of truth even pointing the way to the real god a hill and garden appear not only just inside the stable door but later further up and further in in aslans country this garden with golden gates and a delicious smell is also far larger than it had seemed from outside here is the perfect garden the image of which digory had entered to obtain the apple the garden which lucy had longed for in the magicians book whereas digory had seen a bird sitting in the tree larger than an eagle with saffron breast head crested with scarlet and a purple tail here we learn that it is a phoenix the phoenix is a mythological bird said to be larger than an eagle with brilliant gold and reddish purple feathers at the end of its year life cycle it is said to burn itself on a funeral pyre another phoenix then rises from the ashes with renewed youth and beauty this traditional symbol of rebirth and immortality is fitting for the conclusionor shall we say the real beginningof the childrens adventures lewis uses the door not only here but in several of his other writings as a symbol for the reality we have always longed for and for which lewis as we have seen longed all his life we long to be inside of some door which we have always seen from the outside to be at last summoned inside would be both glory and honour beyond all our merits and also the healing of that old ache some day we shall join the children digory polly reepicheep puddleglum and all the others and be permitted to get in pass in
