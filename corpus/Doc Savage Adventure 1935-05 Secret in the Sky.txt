 chapter the friend who died the matter of willard spanner was almost unbelievable it was too preposterous the newspapers publishing the story were certain a mistake had been made somewhere true this was the twentieth century the age of marvels but then at exactly noon the telephone buzzer whirred in doc savages new york skyscraper headquarters noon straight up eastern standard time the buzzer whirred three times with lengthy pauses between whirs which allowed time for any one present to have answered then an automatic answering device art ingenious arrangement of dictaphone voice recorder and phonographic speaker a creation of doc savages scientific skill was cut in automatically the phonograph record turned under the needle and sent words over the telephone wire this is a mechanical robot speaking from doc savages headquarters and advising you that doc savage is not present but that any message you care to speak will be recorded on a dictaphone and will came to doc savages attention later spoke the mechanical contrivance you may proceed with whatever you wish to say if anything doc gasped a voice which had that strange quality lent by longdistance telephonic amplifiers this is willard spanner i am in san francisco i have just learned something too horrible for me to believe several violent grunts came over the wire there were thumps glass seemed to break at the san francisco end then came silence followed by a click as the receiver was placed on the hook at the san francisco terminus of the wire the mechanical device in doc savages new york office ran on for some moments and a stamp clock automatically recorded the exact time of the message on a paper roll then the apparatus stopped and set itself for another call should one come the time recorded was two minutes past twelve noon thirty minutes later approximately the newspaper press association wires hummed with the story of the mysterious seizure of willard kipring parker spanner in san francisco willard kipring parker spanner was a nabob a somebody a big shot anything unusual that happened to him was big news the newspapers did not know the half of it the biggest was yet to come financially willard kipring parker spanner did not amount to much a postmortem examination of his assets showed less than five thousand dollars an insignificant sum for a man who was known over most of the world willard kipring parker spanner called himself simply a guy who likes to fiddle around with microscopes it was said that he knew as much about disease germs and methods of combating them as any living man he had won one nobel prize he was less than thirty years old scientists and physicians who knew him considered him a genius when willard spanner was found dead many a scientist and physician actually shed tears realizing what the world had lost when willard spanner was found dead the newspapers began to have fits and with good reason for willard spanners body was found on a new york street less than three hours after he had been seized in san francisco seized in frisco at noon eastern standard time dead in new york at ten minutes to three eastern standard time a newsboy with a freckled face was first to convey the news to doc savage the newsboy was also crosseyed neither the newsboy nor his freckles nor his crossed eyes had other connection with the affair except that the lads reaction when he sighted doc savage was typical of the effect which the bronze man had on people the boys mouth went roundly open with a kind of amazement when he first saw the bronze giant then as he sold the paper his demeanor was awed and very near worshipful i know you mister he said in a small voice youre doc savage ive seen your picture in the newspapers doc savage studied the boy as he paid for the paper he seemed particularly interested in the crossed eyes wear glasses he asked he had a remarkable voice it seemed filled with a great controlled power sure said the newsboy they give me headaches doc savage produced a small business card the card was not white but bronze and the printing his name only was on it was in a slightly darker bronze if i asked you to do something he queried would you do it betcha boots replied the newsboy doc savage wrote a name and address on the card and said go see that man then walked on leaving the boy puzzled the name and address the bronze man had written was that of an eye specialist whose particular forte was afflictions such as the boy had more than one gaze followed doc savage along the street for he was a giant of bronze with a face that was remarkable in its regularity of feature and a body that was a thing of incredible muscular development his eyes attracted no little attention too they were like pools of flakegold stirred into continuous motion by some invisible force he read the newspaper headlines the galleys of type beneath but there was nothing on his features to show that he was perusing anything of importance the skyscraper which housed his headquarters was in size and architecture probably the most impressive in new york city a private highspeed elevator lifted him to the eightysixth floor he passed through a door that was plain except for a name in small bronze letters clark savage jr the reception room inside had large windows deep leather chairs a strange and rich inlaid table of great size and an impressive safe an automatic pistol lay on the floor a pig a shote with long legs and ears like boat sails walked around and around the gun grunting in a displeased way a man sat in a chair he was a very short man and the chair was huge and high and faced away from the door so that only red bristles which stuck up straight on top of the mans head could be seen the man inthe chair said in a small childlike voice shoot off that gun habeas or ill tie knots in all your legs with an uncanny intelligence the pig sat down inserted a hoof inside the trigger guard and the gun went off with an earsplitting report swel said the man in the chair only you better stand habeas next time the gun might be pointed at your posterior and there might not be a blank in it doc savage said monk uhhuh said the man in the chair sure doc what is it willard spanner was a friend of mine monk lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair lifted out of the chair he was not much over five feet tall he was only slightly less broad than that and he had a pair of arms which gave the grotesque impression of being nearly as long as he was tall red hairs which looked coarse as match sticks furred his leathery hide his was the build of a gorilla i read about it in them blasted newspapers he said and his small voice was doubly ridiculous contrasted with his physique willard spanner was seized in frisco at noon he was found dead here in new york at ten minutes to three screw loose somewhere monk wrinkled a fabulously homely face to show puzzlement he looked amiable stupid when in truth he was one of the most clever industrial chemists alive maybe the newspapers got balled up on the difference in time between san francisco and new york he added all times given are new york time doc savage said then the guy seized in san francisco wasnt willard spanner or the one dead here in new york isnt spanner monk declared the bird didnt go from frisco to new york in a little over two hours it just isnt being done yet doc savage asked any messages ham phoned and said he was coming up replied the homely chemist i havent been here long dunno what was recorded before i got here the bronze man went into the next room which was a scientific laboratory one of the most complete in existence and crossed that to the vast whiteenameled room which held his laboratory of chemical electrical and other devices he lifted the cover on the telephone recorder switched a loudspeaker and amplifier into circuit with the playback pickup and started the mechanism monk came in and listened slackjawed as the device reproduced the call from san francisco complete to its violent termination the pig habeas corpus was the shotes full appendage trailed at the homely chemists heels doc savage examined the time stamped on the recording roll two minutes past twelve he said was that willard spanners voice or would you know it monk demanded i would know his voice doc replied and that was unquestionably willard spanner speaking from san francisco monk grunted incredulously we will see doc savage made a call checking with the telephone people then hung up and advised the call came from san francisco all right willard spanner appears to have been seized while be was in the booth making the call monk picked the pig habeas up by one oversize ear a treatment the shote seemed not to mind then the dead man here in new york is not willard spanner declared the simian chemist nobody goes from frisco to new york in not much more than two hours we will see about that doc told him how by visiting the new york morgue where the dead man was taken monk nodded how about ham we will leave him a note doc said apparently it had not occurred to any one in authority on the new york civic scene that the surroundings of the dead were of aesthetic value for the morgue building was a structure which nearly attained the ultimate in shoddiness its brick walls gave the appearance of having not been washed in generations being almost black with soot and city grime the steps were grooved deep by treading feet and the stone paving of the entry into which the dead wagons ran was rutted by tires rusting iron bars very heavy were over the windows for just what reason no one probably could have told this joint gives me the creeps and i dont creep easy monk imparted as they got out of doc savages roadster before the morgue the roadster was deceptively long its color was somber the fact that its body was of armor plate its windows specially built in the roadster doors of bullerproof glass was not readily apparent monk carried habeas corpus by an ear and grumbled i wonder why anybody should kill willard spanner or grab him either spanner was an allright guy he didnt have any enemies doc listened at the entrance there was silence and no attendant was behind the reception desk where one should have been they stepped inside hello somebody monk called silence answered there was an odor in the air a rather peculiar tang monk sniffed say i knew they used formaldehyde around these places he muttered but theres something besides doc savage moved with such suddenness that he seemed to explode but it was a silent explosion and he was little more than a noiseless bronze blur as he crossed to the nearest door he did not try to pass through the door but flattened beside it monk bewildered began say what the blazes first i smell a man came through the door holding a big singleaction sixgun he said start your settin up exercises boys then his eyes bulged for he had apparently expected to see two men and doc savage beside the door escaped his notice the man with the sixshooter was bony and looked as if he had been under bright suns much of his life he wore a new suit but his shirt was a coarse blue work garment faded from washing the tie was blue and looked as if it had been put on and taken off many times without untying the knot the knot was a very long one doc savage struck silently and with blinding speed the gun wielder saw him but could not move in time and the bronze mans fist took him on the temple the sixgun evidently had a hair trigger it went off the bullet made a hole round and neat in the wall behind monk monk began howling and charged for the door now aint this somethin he bellowed doc savage had gone on with a continuation of the dive which he had made at the sixgun wielder and was already through the door the room beyond was an office with four desks and four swivel chairs five persons were arrayed on the floor the morgue attendants obviously they were neither bound nor gagged but they lay very still the odor of chloroform was heavy in the air two men were on their feet one was tall the other short and the short one wore overall pants and his legs were bowed both were weatherbeaten the tall one held in one hand a blue revolver and in the other a bandanna handkerchief which gave off chloroform stench the short man had an automatic rifle from which barrel and stock had been bobbed off short a bundle of clothing lay in the middle of the floor the automatic rifle smacked loudly as doc came through the door but the marksman did not lead his target quite enough he shot again the cartridge stuck in the ejector damn it the rifleman bawled throw it away gritted the tall man i told you that gun wouldnt work if you bobtailed it the tall man danced back as he spoke seeming in no hurry to shoot he waved his blue revolver that doc savage might be sure to see it dont be a sucker the man suggested behave yourself doc savage held his hands out even with his shoulders and came to a stop but not until momentum had carried him to the center of the room monk lumbered through the door he stopped looked closely at the blue gun as if it were some strange animal then put up his stubfingered hands thats bein sensible said the tall man i can bust poker chips in the air with this here hogleg stunted there is a good shot too only he thought he knew more about that auto ride than the gent who made her stunted the short man was peering into the innards of his doctored rise aww he mumbled i took too much tension off the spring monk grunted whats the idea you guys we like to look at dead people the tall man said dryly were strange that way doc savage was standing with his toes almost against the bundle of clothing the bundle was snug being strapped around tightly with a belt doc hooked a toe under the bundle and kicked with great force the human nervous system is capable of registering impressions only so fast the tall man undoubtedly knew the missile was coming but could do nothing when it hit him he recoiled instinctively the next instant he was flat on his face held there by one foot which doc savage jammed down on his neck monk whooped loudly rushed stunted monks fights were always noisy stunted clung like a zealot to his bobtailed auto rifle trying to get it in operation he failed he tried to club with the gun monk jerked it out of his hands as if he were taking a lollypop from a child then dropped it monk picked the short man up bodily turned him over and dropped him on his head he accomplished the motion with such speed that the short man was helpless stunted did not move after he fell on his head monk blinked small eyes at his victim gosh he said i wonder if that hurt him the tall man on the door snarled what in blue blazes kind of a circus is this anyhow monk felt of stunteds head found it intact then twisted one of the short mans rather oversize ears but got no response the homely chemist turned on the tall man so its a circus huh he grunted i wondered aw hell gritted the other monk came over and sat on the lean prisoner doc savage removed his foot from the mans neck monk grabbed the fellows ears and pulled them he seemed fascinated by the rubbery manner in which they stretched out from the mans head theyd make swell souvenirs monk grunted cut it out the tall men howled whatre you gonna do with me im gonna ask you questions monk told him and im gonna be awful mad if you dont answer em nuts said the captive has this raid or whatever it was got anything to do with willard spanner monk asked what do you think the other snapped monk pulled the ears tears came to the mans eyes he cursed and his voice was a shrill whine of agony ill kill you for that he promised damn me if i dont monk shuddered elaborately grinned and said if i had on boots id shake in em what did you come here for a new voice said you gentlemen seem to be humorists monk started violently and twisted his head toward the door he gulped blazes and got hastily to his feet the man in the door was solid athleticlooking and he held a revolver with familiar ease he was in his socks that probably explained how he had come in from the outside so silently that and the faint mumble of city traffic which was always present get up he told the tall man wipe your eyes then grab that bunch of clothes this is sure something to write home about ill kill this ape bawled the tall man some other time the rescuer suggested get the clothes say just who is this big bronze guy and the monkey anyhow how would i know snarled the man whom monk had been badgering he picked up the bundle of clothing and started for the door you wouldnt leave stunted would you asked the first without a word the tall man picked up the short fellow and made his way not without difficulty out through the door the gun wielder looked on benignly he had one stark peculiarity his eyes were blue and something was wrong with them they crossed at intervals pupils turning in toward the nose then they straightened out the owner seemed to do the straightening with visible effort monk demanded who did them clothes belong to the man said theyll answer a lot of questions where youre going monk did not get a clear impression of what happened next things moved too fast doc savage must have read the intention of the man with the queer eyes doc lunged the gun went off but the man with the eyes had tried to shift from monk to doc for a target and had not quite made it his bullet pocked the wall then doc had a grip on the revolver the man let go of the revolver he bounced back fast on his feet reached the door and slipped through he was yelling now his yells caused noise of other feet in the next room there were evidently more men doc grasped monk and propelled him backward they got into a rear room and slammed the door doc shot the bolt revolver bullets chopped around the lock wood splintered the lock held a man kicked the door monk roared a threat there was no more kicking no more shooting silence fell except for the traffic noises monk looked at doc that guy with the performing eyes was gonna kill us both he mumbled doc savage did not comment he listened then unlocked the door the room beyond was empty he advanced in the next room one of the chloroformed morgue attendants was sitting up and acting sick the street outside held no sign of the violent raiders there was no trace of the bundle of clothing the reviving morgue attendant began to mumble they wanted clothes off a corpse he muttered whatcha know about that off what corpse doc asked him off willard spanner said the attendant chapter the highpressure ghouls doc savage exited to the street and made inquiries finding that the men had gone away in two cars persons questioned named four different makes of cars in each instance insisting that their information was correct theyre all wrong probably monk grumbled pursuit was patently hopeless although monk cast a number of expectant glances in doc savages direction the bronze man had a way of pulling rabbits out of hats in affairs such as this but doc only reentered the morgue none of those who had been chloroformed were in immediate danger we came here to see the body of willard spanner doc told the attendant who had revived sort of a coincidence said the attendant and managed a sickly grin which typified a peculiarity of human behavior the fact that persons who work regularly in close proximity to death are inclined to arm themselves with a wisecracking veneer the bodies were stored in bins not unlike huge filing boxes the marble slabs on which they lay slid into the bins on rollers the attendant was still too groggy to bring the willard spanner slide out after he had found the identifying card and monk helped him doc savage looked at the body for a long time this is willard spanner he said finally they went out monk scratched his head then said but the man seized in san francisco that couldnt have been willard spanner the voice on the phone recorder doc reminded you said it was willard spanners voice monk found his pig habeas and picked him up by an ear could you have been mistaken about that voice i think not doc savage said slowly they examined those who were still senseless from the chloroform gave a description of the morgue raiders to police officers who had arrived then walked out to the roadster monk seemed to be thinking deeply he snapped his fingers that bundle of willard spanners clothing he grumbled now what in the dickens did they want with that the police had searched the pockets and had found nothing it must have been something important doc told him they wanted the garments badly enough to make quite a disturbance in getting them a policeman came to the morgue door and called you are wanted on the phone doc and monk went back and doc picked up the receiver and said yes inquiringly a clipped melodious voice spoke rapidly it was the voice of an orator and it carried the accent which is commonly associated with harvard i got to the morgue in time to observe that something was badly wrong advised the speaker i followed the chaps outside when they left in such a hurry they are now at albemarle avenue and frame street i will meet you at the corner doc savage said in ten minutes and hung up monk making for the street in a series of ungainly bounds demanded who was it ham doc replied the shyster monk growled and there was infinite contempt in his tone albemarle avenue was a twin groove through marsh mud on the outskirts on new york city frame street seemed to be a sign scabby and ancient which stuck out of the salt grass if there ever had been a frame street it had long ago given up to the swamp darkness was coming on when doc savage and monk arrived in the roadster theres ham monk said ham was brigadier general theodore marley brooks park avenue fashion plate and a lawyer the pride of harvard lawschool he was a slender man with the manner of a wasp and a tongue as sharp as the fine damascus sword blade concealed in the innocentlooking black cane which he carried he came out of the marsh grass stepping gingerly to avoid soiling his natty afternoon garb the sword cane tucked under an arm hyah you fashion plate monk growled hello stupid ham retorted insultingly the two glared at each other a stranger would have thought fisticuffs imminent as a matter of fact each of these two had time and again risked his life to save the other although no one had ever heard one of them address a civil word to the other ham opened the roadster door on doc savages side and said i got the note you left at headquarters telling me you had gone to the morgue i went to the morgue as i said over the phone those chaps were clowning around so i followed them where are they doc asked ham pointed across the swamp an oyster plant over there oyster plant monk grunted they probably use it as a blind for whatever they are doing ham observed and incidentally just what is behind this its all screwy so far monk snorted willard spanner is reported grabbed in frisco at noon and is found dead in new york before three oclock then a gang of birds raid the morgue and steal his clothing thats all we know ham said ill show you where they went they had that bundle of clothing too there were a few comparatively firm spots in the marsh the rest of the terrain was covered with water which ranged in depth from an inch to two feet with spots which were deeper as monk promptly proved by going in above the waist a cloud bank in the west shortened the period of twilight they were soon in complete darkness using flashlights would have given away their position making any speed through the coarse grass without noise was almost impossible you fellows take it easy doc directed do not try to get too close monk began but whatre you and did not finish the bronze man had vanished in the darkness monk listened then shook his head it was difficult to conceive of any one moving with such silence it was no casual trait this ability of doc savages to stalk quietly he had practiced a great deal had studied the masters of the art the carnivorous beasts of the jungle the bronze man had covered not more than a hundred yards when something happened something that was later to take on great significance and a terrible importance he heard a peculiar crashing sound that described it more accurately than anything else it was not a series of crashes but one long brittle report it started faintly and attained in the span of two seconds or so a surprising loudness doc glanced up hanging in the sky was what appeared to be a taut rope of liquid fire this faded in a moment it was an uncanny phenomena doc savage crouched for some time listening flakegold eyes on the sky but there was nothing more he went on toward the oyster plant the odor of the place was evident long before the low rambling processing building showed up it was built on the beach with a wharf shoving out porch fashion to one side a channel had evidently been dredged for the oyster boats the plant was used for the sorting and opening of oysters mounds of oyster shells were pyramided here and there and were thick on the ground they made walking difficult wash of waves on the nearby beach covered up lesser sounds several times doc savage stooped and brushed away oyster shells that he might step on the bare ground the brittle shells would break with loud reports the side of the building which he approached was dark he worked around lighted windows appeared smell of oysters was strong two small schooners were tied up at a wharf the cabin portholes of one of these were lighted an instant later the light went out and three men came up the companion they stepped to the wharf one used a flashlight and this illuminated them one was stunted his companions were the tall man and the one with the peculiar crossing and uncrossing eyes one carried a bundle which resembled clothing stunted said danged if i dont still maintain that an automatic rifle can be bobbed and still aw hell the tall man spat disgustedly here we really got things to worry about and you go on and on about that gun man dont the fact that that bronze guy was doc savage impress you none atall stunted stopped suddenly look you gents he said you been cackling around like two old hens since you learned that bird was doc savage now i want you to tell me something yeah said the tall man aint it a fact that with what we got we dont need to be afraid of anybody demanded stunted you mean you know what i mean you saw that streak in the sky and heard that crack of a noise a while ago didnt you now answer my question awww the tall man spat again we aint exactly afraid of him only it mightve been more convenient if he hadnt turned up on the spot that savage is nobodys cinch and dont forget that i aint forgettin it said stunted and quit squawkin you hombres were settin pretty doc savage aint got a line on us and didnt we get willard spanners clothing and aint the rest gonna be taken care of the tall man burst into sudden laughter now what stunted growled just thinkin the other chuckled people are gonna wonder how willard spanner was in frisco at noon and dead here in new york at three oclock the same afternoon doc savage was close to them he could have reached out and tripped any one of the trio as they filed past the silent man of the three the one with the unnaturally roving eyes brought up the rear doc savage had been crouching he stood erect his fist made a sound like a loud finger snap on the mans jaw the man fell the bundle of clothing flew to one side a number of surprising things happened the surrounding darkness erupted human beings at least a dozen men appeared with magical effect each had a flashlight a gun take im alive one shouted questioningly not much squawked another evidently the chief doc started for the clothing bundle a man was leaping over it coming toward him gun spouting flame and thunder doc slipped aside he twisted lead slammed past doc hit the ground and rolled tall marsh grass took him in he burrowed a dozen feet veered left slugs tore through the grass they made hoarse snarls a pile of oyster shells jutted out of the darkness in front of him the bronze man got behind it he ran a score of paces went down in a hollow where there was soft mud but no water and waited listening stunted was yelling hes behind that shell pile if i had an auto rifle it would put a pill right through that stuff suppose you use your legs more and your mouth less some one suggested the men scattered hunting they were in pairs a neat precaution the couples did not walk close enough together that both could be surprised at once yet nothing could happen to one without the other knowing it stunted shouted you jaspers knew he was around here how in thunder did you know that you wouldnt understand a voice told him stunted swore at the speaker cmon feller howd you know it theres a bank of alarm wires strung around here said the voice nuts stunted told him i havent seen anywires theyre underground the other snapped just barely covered any one walking over them changes the capacity of a highfrequency electric field enough to show on a recording device inside well sink me stunted snorted doc savage listening made a mental note that some one of considerable scientific ability was involved with the gang such an alarm system as had been described was feasible but required high technical knowledge to construct the bronze man crawled away through the tall grass doc did not go far however a score of yards and he stopped he spent a moment or two tensing his throat muscles striving for a certain effect hands up you fellows he said loudly using his own natural voice a split of a second later he shouted again this time his tone was a splendid imitation of a man greatly frightened its doc savage he shrilled give us a hand over here somebody results were instant and noisy men howled irately and made a great clatter in the marsh grass charging for the spot they were completely deceived doc savage moved swiftly not in flight but circling back toward the oyster shell mound near which he had made his attack he wanted the bundle of clothes he reached the shell pile paused listened men were making angry sounds but not close by some one had dropped a flashlight in the excitement its beam did not play directly on the spot where the garments lay but the backglow disclosed the parcel it was hardly more than thirty feet away it lay in the open doc continued listening his ears were remarkable for he had trained them from childhood with a sonic device calculated to develop the utmost in sensitivity he evidently caught some small sound for he produced from inside his clothing a coil of thin silken cord to which was affixed a folding grapple hook that he had practiced a great deal with the grapple was shown by the accuracy with which he tossed the hook it snared the bundle of clothing he hauled it toward him remaining sheltered behind the shell pile stunted and other men bounded up from where they had been lying and watching the bundle he slicked us stunted bawled doc savage gave the silk cord a brisk yank stooped and caught the garments and was off like a sprinter guns made whooping thunder behind him he pitched right then left zigzagging then he doubled over and changed course the last was a wise move some type of light machine gun blared out behind him its lead stream sickled off the marsh grass across the spot where he had vacated the gunman did not fan his fire but concentrated it and the ammo drum went empty violent cursing followed doc was some distance away now he heard noises of men sloughing about in mud and enraged grunts and growls monk he called softly ham the pair were waistdeep in mud doc extricated them they joined him in flight monk the baboon led us into that bog ham complained monk found his pet pig before he shouted thats a lie i was followin that overdressed shyster sounds of pursuit dropped rapidly behind and it became evident that they were going to get clear we oughta do something about them rambunctious jaspers monk announced the police will do something about it doc told him doc savage monk and ham were in the skyscraper headquarters when the police telephoned the results of their raid staged on the strength of the bronze mans information the oyster factory they advised had been found deserted the birds had flown they must have a bally tight organization to move that fast ham opined they knew their hangout was no longer a secret so they cleared out monk lifted his pig habeas by one oversize ear and swayed the porker slowly back and forth a procedure the shote seemed to enjoy what gets me muttered the homely chemist is what that streak of a thing in the sky could have been did you see it doc the bronze man nodded monk persisted hear the funny long crack of a noise it or something like it made doc nodded again then said the men at the oyster factory mentioned the streak in the sky and the sound as having some mysterious connection with their own project monk let habeas fall say whats behind all of this anyway the telephone rang this is the central police station a voice stated you seemed to be interested in that willard spanner killing so i thought wed better let you know his body has been stolen from the morgue you mean willard spanners clothing was stolen doc queried i mean his body said the officer they got his clothing first they came back about fifteen minutes ago for his body same crowd sure they got away they did or they have so far doc had switched an audio amplifierandloudspeaker into circuit with the telephone a procedure he commonly followed on calls in which his aides might be interested monk and ham heard jove ham exploded they made no move to take the body the first time at the oyster factory i heard them speaking of taking care of the rest doc said slowly this matter of the body must have been the rest ham lifted the bundle of clothing which doc savage had taken at the oyster factory we still have willard spanners garments here he declared since those men wanted them so badly they may possibly furnish us with a clue monk got up grunting maybe the duds had papers or something sewed in them like they have in story books lets have a gander at em as we lowbrows say the garments were tied together with tarred twine of the type which seagoing men call marlin ham took hold of it after trying the knot intending to break it but finding it much stronger than he had expected gave it up grimacing snapping his strained fingers doc examined the knots no sailor tied those he decided they didnt talk like sailors either monk offered what part of the country dyou figure they came from doc the west or the southwest the bronze man said and with no perceptible difficulty broke the cord which had baffled ham he sorted through the pieces of clothing they outfoxed us he said fixed this up as a decoy by that shell pile merely to draw me back hoping to get a shot at me monk squinted meaning these are not willard spanners clothes doc said they are for a much larger and fatter man monk groaned were sunk we have doc corrected him one chance chapter the man from oklahoma the bronze man lifted the telephone receiver and dialed a number police headquarters he asked homicide bureau please there was a brief wait homicide this is doc savage speaking i believe it is your custom to secure pictures of murder scenes and also photographs of the body of the victim i wonder if you would send me copies of the pictures taken of willard spanner you can have them advised the voice at the homicide bureau by messenger immediately doc requested that he had been promised the photographs so readily was not remarkable since the bronze man held a high commission no whit less effective because it was honorary on the new york police force the commission was a gesture of appreciation for past aid doc savages life work was helping others out of trouble those who deserved aid it was a strange career one with few financial rewards but the bronze man did not need money for he had access to a fabulous treasure trove he followed his career for the return it gave in excitement and adventure and he had five aides who followed it for the same reason monk and ham were two of the five the other three were at the moment in upper new york state where doc savage maintained a remarkable institution for making honest men out of such criminals as he caught a treatment which entailed brain operations and which wiped out past memories a course of vocational training followed the surgery monk frowned demanding how in the heck are those pictures gonna help us doc savage did not answer seemed not to hear monk showed no resentment at not getting an answer it happened frequently the homely chemist went out and came back with late editions of the leading newspapers lookit he pointed at headlines unpredicted rain of comets science cannot explain those residents of new york city particularly those residing near the marsh section of long island were treated to the sight of a comet tonight many reported a loud crack of a sound and a streak of fire in the sky inquiry develops that such phenomena have been reported within the last few days from various sections of the united states monk said and they kindly neglected to state just where the other comets were seen telephone the newspapers doc requested monk went to the instrument made several calls and hung up wearing a puzzled expression the comets have appeared within the last two weeks he reported several were seen around san francisco that kinda hooks in with this willard spanner killing but most of the comets were seen in oklahoma around tulsa doc savage was examining the bundle of clothing come here he said and pointed at the label inside the coat the oil mans tailor tulsa oklahoma monk grunted thatll bear looking into doc savage put in a longdistance telephone call and because it was late some time was required in obtaining the information which he desired in the interim a messenger arrived from police headquarters with a parcel of pictures finally the bronze man secured from the tulsa tailor the name of the man for whom a suit answering the description of the one in the bundle had been made it was a suit distinctive enough to be remembered being rather loud in color the garment was tailored for calvert r moore who is more commonly known as leases moore came the report from tulsa just what do you know about this man moore doc asked he is very wealthy the tulsa tailor hesitated he is also considered a bit sharp as a business man nothing crooked you understand merely well a man who misses few bargains what else he has disappeared he has what disappeared a kidnapping doc demanded there has been no indication of that leases moore merely dropped out of sight two weeks ago on the same day that quince randweil vanished quince randweil doc asked sharply who is he the owner and operator of a local dogracing track explained the tailor there is no indication of what became of these men doc persisted none have either of these men been considered crooked doc asked oh they aint neither one been in jail that anybody knows of said the tailor who seemed to be a frank and talkative individual monk squinted at doc when the conversation ended more angles two men named leases moore and quince randweil vanished mysteriously in tulsa two weeks ago doc told him leases moores clothing turned up in that bundle the bronze man now scrutinized the pictures of willard spanners body spanner had been shot to death two bullets had hit him in the chest but it was another wound a wrist cut upon which the bronze man concentrated attention this was not a new cut he pointed out you will notice marks made by adhesive tape indicating it was bandaged the manner of the tape application indicates the work of a physician the man would hardly have applied the tape himself in this manner i observed this fact at the morgue but unfortunately not close enough to be sure monk looked surprised it was not often that the bronze man had to go back over ground he had already covered for information but wheres this getting us asked the homely chemist our problem is to ascertain whether the man seized in san francisco was the one found dead in new york doc told him on the face of it that seems an impossibility for less than three hours elapsed doc resorted to the longdistance telephone again he first called san francisco police they gave him the name of the hotel at which willard spanner had been staying incidental was the information that spanner had arrived in san francisco only the previous day the call to the hotel was fruitful willard spanner had slipped in the hotel bathroom struck his arm against a glass shelf over the washstand and the shelf had broken cutting his wrist the hotel physician had dressed the wound which was undoubtedly the one the pictures showed wheu monk exploded willard spanner was seized in san francisco a little over a couple o hours before he was found dead in new york ham flourished his sword cane but it could not happen monk stood up the telephoning has taken time there oughta be fresh newspapers out ill go get some he was back in a few moments he looked excited lamp this he barked and exhibited extra editions the headlines were large black seek spanner ransom in frisco demanded a san francisca newspaper editor late today received a note stating that willard spanner reported slain in new york this afternoon was alive and would be released upon the payment of fifty thousand dollars there was more of it but the opening paragraph told the substance of the story monk eyed doc hadnt we better look into this ham or me can go we will all three go doc told him we will leave a note advising the other three members of our outfit to do what investigating they can when they return from upstate they can handle the new york end what about the tulsa oklahoma angle ham queried we will stop off there doc advised tulsa likes to call itself the capital of the oil industry oil men do much flying the tulsa municipal airport is a source of local pride facilities and appointments are excellent floodlights fanned brilliance as doc savage dropped his big speed plane in for a landing the night force of mechanics stood about and stared some one ran to a nearby flying school and shortly afterward there was a stampede to the tarmac of aeronautical students in all states of partial dress it was not often that a plane such as the bronze man was flying was seen the speed ship was trimotored and all three motors were streamlined into the wings until their presence was hardly apparent to the eye the hull breasted down so that the plane could be landed on water and the landing gear was retractable the cabin was as bulletproof as was feasible and inside were innumerable mechanical devices one individual did not seem interested in the bronze mans remarkable craft he was a pilot in greasy coveralls who tinkered with the motor of a shabbylooking cabin monoplane over near the edge of the field he had dropped into the airport two hours before and had been tinkering with his plane since he had given short answers to the field mechanics and thereafter had been left severely alone it was now not long before dawn doc savage taxied over near the covered pit which held the gasoline hoses and cut all three motors he stepped out of the plane and glanced into the east as if seeking the sunrise ive heard a lot about that bird a flying student said unconscious that his whisper carried they say he designed that sky wagon himself and that its the fastest thing of its size in the world over at the edge of the field the motor of the shabby cabin monoplane came to life it roared loudly a small crowd surged around docs speed ship they were flying men greatly interested in a sample of the most advanced aerial conveyance most of them were interested in the layout of navigating instruments in the robot pilot ive heard this bus can take off and fly herself and can be controlled by radio from a distance a man said is that a fact one man was interested in the tail structure of the plane he found himself alone back there he flashed a long knife out of his clothing ripped and gouged and got open one of the inspection ports through which the control connections could be examined the man was thin his movements had the speed of an animal he whipped a series of three packages out of his clothing they were connected by wires and none were extraordinarily large he thrust all three inside the inspection port then closed the flap then he backed away into the darkness he blinked a small flashlight four times rapidly motor ahowl the cabin monoplane scudded away from the edge of the field it headed straight for docs ship the bronze man had to all appearances been occupied entirely in answering questions but now he flashed into life and seemed to know exactly what he was doing run he rapped at those standing about get away from here quick his great voice was a crash it was compelling three men turned and fled without knowing why the others retreated more slowly they saw the oncoming cabin plane runaway ship some one howled monk and ham had stepped out of docs speed craft they whirled to clamber back inside but doc savage was ahead of them he banged the cabin door in their faces then lunged to the controls the big motors whooped out at the first touch of the starters and because they were hot instantly hauled the speed craft into motion there was a tense second or two then it became evident that docs plane was going to get clear the men scattered from the path of the oncoming cabin monoplane it went bawling past doing no harm except to give an aviator student a bad fright all who looked could see by the floodlight glare that the cabin was empty wheres the pilot of that trap yelled the night field manager such damned carelessness he swallowed the rest an unexpected thing was happening a weird thing the old cabin ship had gone on but instead of crashing into the fence at the edge of the field as every one expected it was turning swinging as if a hand of uncanny skill were at the controls it arched completely around and cannoned after the speed plane of doc savage the onlookers gasped unable to believe what they were witnessing they saw the pig habeas corpus come hurtling from the cabin of docs speed ship then they saw the bronze man appear in the cabin door he seemed to be trying to reach the tail of his plane for he dropped off and sought to seize it as it went past but the streamlined metal surface offered no grip he was knocked aside and the ship went on doc scrambled to all fours seized the pig habeas and fell flat with him he lay there the shabby cabin ship charged in pursuit of the speed plane the two ships approached at an angle they met the whole world seemed to go in blinding white the tarmac jumped quaked windows fell out of the operations office hangars the flying school buildings across the paved road the side of one huge hangar buckled inward and the roof came down as if a giant had stepped upon it the noise of the blast thumped and rolled and finally went into the distance like a heavy salve of thunder out where the two planes had met there was a hole in the earth which would require two days to fill chapter oklahoma action doc savage heaved up from where he had lain after failing to reach the tail of his plane he ran not toward the blast scene but toward his men monk and ham veered out to meet him ham unconsciously knocking dust off his natty raiment whyd you quit the plane monk gulped why didnt you take it into the air we were low on gas doc clipped that other ship probably had full tanks it would have caught me come on but there wasnt nobody in it monk exploded as he ran radio control doc told him racing toward the edge of the flying field the ship was loaded with explosive monk and ham pounded in his wake the pig habeas trailed monk puffed but no radio control would this was a device which would send the plane toward a sending set operating on a designated frequency doc advised over his shoulder it is merely an adaptation of the robot pilot which keeps planes in the path of a beam radio monk yelled but there wasnt no sending set in our bus he ran with the waddling gait of a scared bull ape on the contrary there was doc rapped a fellow stuck a tiny portable set inside the empennage shortly before the excitement started i saw him there wasnt time to grab him whered he go monk roared and put on more speed this way doc said and vaulted the metal fence which surrounded the field ham tried to use too much care in mounting the fence with the result that he slipped caught his immaculate afternoon coat on the barbed top strand and left the entire back of it behind whered the pilot of the plane go he gritted this way doc said he and the fellow who planted the decoy radio transmitter probably intended to meet they covered a hundred yards weeds about them were tall the rotating beacon at the airport flashed white light at regular intervals the airport floodlights were still on making a great glow doc savage stopped breathed a listen monk and ham both strained their ears they heard crickets sounds of distant automobiles and voice murmur back at the flying held but nothing else the two are heading a bit to the right doc decided monk and ham showed no surprise being aware of the bronze mans almost superhuman ability to hear countless times they had seen him employ the sonic device with which he had developed his aural organs over a period of years weeds became more profuse then ended suddenly at the edge of an evidently little used road there was a fence which they managed to keep from squeaking while climbing it clouds were making the night darker than before they crawled up an embankment evidently some kind of dike hulks like gigantic pill boxes loomed ahead the night air acquired a definite odor oil tank farm ham decided in a whisper not being used doc added ham asked in a surprised tone how can you tell the odor doc told him the smell of fresh crude oil is lacking off to the side a smaller squarer hulk appeared a light came on suddenly and whitened soiled windows inside was the gleam of dull gray machinery and brasswork which needed cleaning the pump station monk grunted they must be using it for a headquarters ham offered abruptly doc what say the missing link and myself circle and watch the rear while you are reconnoitering do not get too close doc requested ham eased away in the darkness monk on his heels the pig habeas trailed them they made half a circle and were behind the pump station there was a pile of pipe there they eased behind that two men arose from the darkness and put guns against their backs what the monk began i know its a shame said one of the men you two boys must have thought we were pretty dumb monk and ham turned around there was not much light but they did not need light to observe that the guns were genuine and of large caliber the hammer of each weapon was also rocked back habeas the shote faded away into the night with the soundlessness of a shadow monk jutted his small head forward to peer more closely at the two who had sprung the surprise youll get eyestrain one of the men admonished were the two yahoos you followed here from the airport if thats whats worryin you the speech had been in whispers unconsciously now ham decided to speak aloud hoping to advise doc of their predicament you two ugh he doubled over painfully his mouth flew wide and breath came past his teeth with such force that it carried a fine spray with it the man who had jammed a gun into hams middle with great force hissed we know the bronze guy is around in front you try to tip him again and youll spring a leak just about the third button of that trick vest the other man said we hate to part you two from that big bronze shadow but we fear we must shake a leg they backed away from the pump station came to a path and went down it monk and ham were searched expertly as they walked and relieved of the only weapons they carried the small supermachine pistols which were doc savages own invention whats the idea monk demanded a gentleman wants to see you one of the two replied who a man whom im more than half convinced is one of the cleverest gents in the world said the other and mind you partner i know all about the rep of this doc savage the guy who thought up that bright idea of fixing the plane bomb so it would chase a radio transmitter and who also rigged up that burglar alarm at the oyster plant in new york monk hazarded sure said the man hes thought of some other things that would surprise you too shut up advised the mans companion some day youll talk yourself inside a wooden jacket and theyll sprinkle some nice clean dirt on you they went on in silence there was roadway underfoot now a dirt road hard packed by heavy traffic what about doc ham demanded we aint ambitious said one of the captors well dispose of you first hell get his later they rounded a bend hinged by scrub oak and came suddenly upon a truck waiting the truck was large and had a flat bed the type of machine employed in hauling pipe and oilfield supplies a stubby man came forward also a tall thin one and a man who had when flashlights were turned on eyes which turned inward at intervals it was stunted and the rest of the coterie from new york its a regular reunion stunted chuckled you got that sawedoff auto rifle to working monk asked him you bet stunted retorted i worked on it all the way from new york you made a quick trip monk suggested sure said stunted we came in a the man with the uneasy eyes whipped forward and slapped stunted in the face the force of the blow sent stunted reeling back what in blue blazes was the idea he snarled you got a head like a toad the man with the weird eyes snapped you was gettin set to tell this monkey how we came back huh stunted fell silent his mien sheepish two pairs of greasy overalls and two equally soiled jumpers were produced menace of gun muzzles persuaded monk and ham to don these they were compelled to sit on the flat bed of the truck legs dangling over and the machine got into motion some of the captors stood erect on the bed platform all wore work clothing they might have been some pipeline crew bound into the fields let out a bleat and well certainly weight you down with lead monk and ham were advised deuced boorish treatment ham said primly some one laughed the truck had a rear and gear grind and the sound went on and on like something in pain there was little traffic on the road passenger cars for the most part once two policemen on motorcycles went past with a violent popping but did not even glance at the truck later a ramshackle delivery car ran around the truck with a great clatter cut in sharply and went on durn nut growled the truck driver hardly more than ten minutes later there was a loud report from a front wheel the truck began to pound along in a manner which indicated a flat tire the driver pulled over to the edge of the road he began to swear making no effort to get out and start repairs you waiting for it to thunder or something stunted demanded no spare tire along said the driver he alighted and used a flashlight until he found a largeheaded roofing nail embedded in the tire he kicked the nail and swore some more down the road a light flashed whos that a man demanded one of the men advanced down the road keeping in the darker shadows beside the ditch he returned soon delivery truck with a puncture he reported its that nut who passed us he mustve picked up another of them nails he got a spare tire stunted demanded seems to have said the other stunted chuckled old nick takes care of his own eh boys two guns were kept jammed against monk and ham three men went forward there was a wait during which pounding noises came from the delivery truck then a sharp exchange of commands one of the men called back come on you birds the guns urged monk and ham forward they came to the truck the driver was an unusuallooking fellow having a tremendous girth and a right leg which twisted out in grotesque fashion his face was puffy he had a swarthy skin and dark hair this mexican has kindly consented to give us a lift chuckled stunted and flourished his sawedoff auto rifle at the swarthy driver the driver wailed senors my poor car shut up advised stunted you just drive us carefullike well tell you where to go an hour later they were traveling where there seemed to be no road at all the sun was rising but not yet in view turn right stunted advised and they pulled down a precipitous bank and took to the gravel bed of a dry stream the swarthy driver complained senors my poor car will never run back over thees road tell me how shall i return youll find out all about that stunted told him hey one of the men barked lookit they craned necks after a moment of that they all heard a long tending crack of a sound and a weird streak of luminance appeared in the reddening sky it seemed to stretch in an arch away into the infinite reaches of the heavens now what stunted grumbled could that mean that shut up stupid the man with the peculiar eyes snapped the streak in the sky died away quickly vanishing completely the rickety truck went on in spite of the deserted appearance of the region it was undoubtedly a road of sorts which they traveled twice when they crossed sandy stretches the men alighted and with leafy boughs carefully brushed out their tracks dont want em to look too recent stunted grinned the driver showed alarm what ees thees mean senores in about three minutes youll know stunted leered the driver reacted in a fashion which was the more surprising since he had previously shown a surprisingly small degree of backbone he lashed out a fist toward stunted it was a terrific blow after it stunteds face would never look quite the same stunted fell out of the seat the driver emitted a bloodcurdling yell and took to the opposite direction he had chosen his spot well a narrow rip of a draw entered the creek bed at that point the dark man dived into that his game leg seemed if anything to add to his speed he disappeared the truck unloaded in roaring confusion wild shots were discharged the men rushed into the gully some climbed the steep sides after the first excitement they used flashlights and searched more thoroughly they found no trace of the fugitive one of that guys ancestors must have been a rabbit stunted grumbled they consulted for a time there seemed to be little they could do about it that mex wont know what its all about anyhow some one decided they got in the truck and it had rolled hardly less than half a mile before it pulled out on a flat and stopped before what seemed to be literally a mansion it was a great brick building two stories in height with flanking wings and a garage capable of housing four cars situated on the outskirts of a city such as tulsa the mansion would have aroused no more than admiration but located here in a wilderness of scrub oak and hills with no roads worthy of the name near by it was a startling sight the headlights played on the place at closer range and it became evident in the early morning light that many of the windows were broken out that the woodwork needed painting that the lawn had not been trimmed in years yet the place could not from the style of architecture have been more than ten years old monk asked how did this dump come to be here osage indian stunted leered through his smashed face heap oil catchum many dollars build um brick tepee then osage him turn around and croak tepee him go pot youre quite a smart guy aintcha monk growled they unloaded beside the mansion a lean brown man stepped out to meet them squinting in the headlights he had a rifle we got two visitors for the chief said stunted the chief just left said the man with the rifle oh said stunted so it was him in the man with the queer eyes screamed damn you all the time about to let things slip where these guys can hear he slugged stunted heavily with his right fist stunteds face was already sore from the blow landed by the swarthy delivery truck driver the new pain maddened him he went down but retained his grip on his rifle rolled over and lifted the weapon men shouted and sprang forward to prevent bloodshed ham kicked monk on the shins monk bellowed in pain and knocked down the handiest of his captors the house ham yelled theyd shoot us down before we could get across the clearing the house entrance was not more than a dozen feet away they dived for it a rifle slug tore an ample fistful of splinters off the edge of the door as they went through chapter flame thread the door was of some rich dark wood paint had peeled off but the panel still retained its strength monk tossed out one long hairy arm and slammed it echoes of the slam echoed through the house which seemed virtually devoid of furniture monk snarled you didnt need to kick me it was a pleasure ham told him i mean i had to get you in action yeah monk hit a door at the end of the reception hall where they stood it was not locked momentum sent him across the chamber beyond on hands and knees there was a table at this side of the room it had been thrown hastily together from rough wood but there was nothing crude about the apparatus on it black insulating panels knobs and switches glistened monk veered for the apparatus ham yelled that wont help us heck it wont monk began fumbling with the dials this is a bangup radio transmitterandreceiver i know it ham was making for another door what good will the bally thing do us bring help monk made a fierce face trouble is i gotta figure out what knob does what glass crashed out of a window a rifle smashed and the highpowered slug clouted completely through the walls missing monk by something less than a yard take your time ham told monk dryly you only have to get that thing working and call until you raise a station five or ten minutes should be all you need two more rifle bullets came in showering monk with plaster dust monk made another fierce grimace and gave up working with the radio mechanism he followed ham into another room which held numerous boxes all of them of stout wood none of them bearing markings which might have hinted at their past contents monk upset a box found it empty and began heaving the containers against the door to block it rifle lead went through the boxes with splintering ease them highpowered guns kinds complicate things monk grunted they retreated finding an empty chamber then one with cheap canvas camp cots on the floor blankets were piled carelessly on the cots odds and ends of clothing lay about cigarette stubs spotted the floor monk scooped up an armload of the clothing maybe theres something in the pockets thatll tell us things he said he carried the clothing as he lumbered in the wake of ham the latter peered through a window rubbed dust off the pane looked again and began knocking glass out with quick blows sure we can just walk away monk told him sourly theyll stand by and sing us a bedtime story or something look you accident of nature ham pointed an arm there is a car behind the house which we failed to sight before monk looked and saw that the car was large and powerful it was inclosed he helped smash the rest of the glass out let ham jump down to the ground then followed retaining the clothes and grunting loudly as be landed they reached the car together and crowded each other getting inside monk threw his right hand for the switch then made a fist of the hand and struck the instrument panel blast it he grated they would take the key out he flopped down on the floorboards tore a fistful of wiring bodily from under the instrument panel took one rather long second in sorting them over then joined the ends of two and the motor whooped into life handy to know how these cars are wired monk grinned the machine moaned and pitched in second gear making an ample circle around the house ham drove recklessly shoving his head up at intervals to ascertain their course brush switched the underside of the car a loud clanking sound came from one of the windows and monk squinted at a spidery outline of cracks which had appeared magically in the glass glory be he snorted this chariot has bulletproof glass there sure is a santa claus ham sat up drove more carefully and they pitched into the obscure roadway by which they had arrived ham was overanxious he put on too much speed and the car skidded went into a ditch and stopped he looked outside we can back out he said then he sat very still for he had felt a small spot of metallic coldness come against the back of his neck he had felt gun muzzles on his bare skin on other occasions we should have looked in the back seat he told monk the homely chemist reared up and peered around the gun was removed from hams neck and shoved almost against monks flattened nose it was a singleaction sixshooter of tremendous size a young woman held the gun with one hand she was a lean tanned young woman with a few freckles not at all hard to look at her eyes were a rather enchanting blue and she showed teeth which would have graced the advertising of any dentrifice it was not a smile which showed her teeth rather it was a grimace intended to convey fierceness these are hollowpoint bullets she advised they would just about remove your head monk swallowed now listen shut up she requested i never saw you before and dont know you maybe you dont know me but youve heard of me im lanca jaxon oh said monk youve heard enough to know id as soon shoot you as not or sooner said the girl twogun lanca jaxon murmured monk who had never before heard of any young womanwith such a name a wisecracker like the rest of them the girl said frostily i never dreamed there could be so many alleged humorists in one gang of crooks monk said young lady quiet she snapped one of these bullets wont be funny you two sit still ill get out and then you get out ill tell you what to do next she got out three men came from the adjacent brush their arrival was so sudden that it was evident that they were men who had scattered to the edges of the clearing surrounding the house when the action had started that they might be in a position to shoot down any one attempting to cross the open space each of the three held a gun well take it over now lanca one said the young woman looked at them very hard she seemed to be trying to make up her mind about something of great importance the gun was perfectly steady in her hand she shrugged at last and one of the men came over and got the gun she had wielded you helped us a lot he chuckled the girl said nothing puffing and growling at each other the remaining members of the gang arrived shortly they surrounded monk and ham discussion followed three of them favored shooting monk and ham immediately others held saner convictions let the big boss decide suggested the man with the peculiarbehaving eyes they walked monk and ham back toward the house the man with the queer eyes linked an arm with the girl and said my dear lance would you explain just how you happened to be in that car and with a gun too it was stunteds old sixshooter wasnt it the girl managed to say nothing in a very vehement manner the mans eyes seemed to shift more queerly than usual he conducted the girl into another part of the house monk and ham found themselves in the room with the radio apparatus one of the captors went out came back with a lariat of the cowboy variety and they were bound with expert thoroughness whatll we do with em stunted asked nursing his bruised features ill find out said one of the men and went to the radio apparatus he switched the mechanism on it was apparently of allwave construction because an ordinary broadcast program began coming from the receiver it was a newscast the commentator had a pleasant voice rapid enunciation weird phenomena reported from various sections of the nation said the voice from the radio the man at the apparatus started to turn knobs wait stunted barked get that the man reset the dial to the broadcast station some of the reports state that long ribbons of flame were seen in the heavens accompanied by a weird crashing noise said the radio newscaster others insist they saw balls of flame astronomers for the most part insist that the phenomena witnessed are not meteors as was at first believed in no case has it been reported that a fallen meteor has been found one of the men laughed harshly said its got em worried itll have em a lot more worried before its over stunted muttered the last streak of flame in the heavens was reported over northcentral oklahoma and over kansas said the broadcaster this was hardly more than an hour ago the voice stopped coming from the radio during the pause which ensued crackle of papers in the distant radio station could be heard flash said the broadcaster an undercurrent of excitement in his voice here is an important item which just arrived aw turn it off growled one of the men in the room somebody has shot somebody else in siberia or somewhere probably stunted snapped nix get the news before we contact the chief they fell silent the broadcaster was still rattling papers he began speaking it has just been announced that the explosion heard in downtown kansas city and which broke studio windows in this station was a blast which thieves set off to enter the vaults of the citys largest bank said the newscaster the raid was on a gigantic scale and daringly executed at least ten men participated bank officials have not been able to make a check but estimate that the thieves could have escaped with nearly three million dollars stunted seemed to forget all about his facial injuries he grinned from ear to ear and slapped a palm resoundingly against a thigh boy oh boy he chortled get that get that shut up some one told him they were all intent on the radio now a few minutes after the robbery one of the strange streaks of fire in the sky which have so mystified the nation was sighted said the radio announcer police are investigating a theory that this might be connected with the robbery of the bank stunted said they begin to smell a rat this concludes our news broadcast said the loudspeaker voice we will be on the air later with more details of the sensational robbery one of the men shifted the radio control knob clicked a switch and got down on shortwave bands all of the men looked suddenly and extraordinarily cheerful the man at the controls made adjustments switching on the transmitter then he picked up a microphone and a small notebook evidently a code book of some kind calling cq calling cq he said into the microphone station wexf calling cq monk blinked as he heard that it was the accepted manner in which amateur radio stations took the air and sought to establish connection with other amateurs the cq was merely the radio ham manner of stating that the station wanted to talk with anybody who would answer out of the radio loudspeaker came an answer station wssav calling station wexf the voice said the man at the apparatus grinned winked he consulted the code book i have two headaches today he said obviously using the code how are you feeling the two headaches you were looking for asked the distant voice which was somewhat distorted thats the two advised the man in the room have you tried diagnosing them asked the voice from the loudspeaker the man at the apparatus consulted the code book sure i diagnosed them he stated but they aint the kind of headaches that tell you things monk scowled darkly as he listened there were thousands of amateur radio stations on the air all over the country and a conversation such as this would not arouse suspicion the code was simple so simple that any one knowing it was code could guess what many of the statements meant but a casual listener would not catch the hidden significance the radio conversation continued you talked about a big headache that you felt coming on the last time we hooked up said the distant voice any sign of that one nope said the man in the room but i may get it yet monk decided they were referring to doc savage otherwise you are all well asked the loudspeaker voice nothing to complain about the man at the transmitter hastily thumbed the code book how is your case of ptomaine the one you got out of a can all cleared up chuckled the radio voice another look at the code book what do you suggest doing for my two headaches ill see what the manual says replied the faraway speaker the man at the transmitter laughed then there was silence during which monk concluded that the manual referred to must be a cipher word designating the mysterious chief of the gang the manual says to use two pills growled the radio voice grim expressions on the features of the men in the room as the radio conversation terminated showed monk that they all knew without referring to the code book what a pill meant stunted stood up scowling i dont like that he said sourly whats eating you the man with the queer eyes snapped i aint exactly a puritan stunted grunted but croakin these two guys in cold blood dont come in my bailiwick if theyve got a chance sure but just to plug em feed em one of them pills a piece which we all know darn well is the bosss word for a bullet not me turned champion of defenseless manhood the uneasyeyed man grated nuts stunted glared at him i aint forgot that pop in the kisser you give me you cockeyed gazoo cut it out you twoa man barked stunted continued to glare the eyes of the other man crossed uncrossed then he shrugged aw the deliverytruck driver getting away had me fussed up he said i guess i shouldnt have smacked you stunted said well let it go at that then the man with the unusual eyes drew a revolver ill take care of the pill doses he said im not as finicky as some he shoved monk and ham propelling them before him through the door they staggered about helpless to do more than voice threats which had absolutely no effect the lariat bindings on their arms were painfully tight securely tied one of the men left behind in the room called say what about that deliverytruck driver well look for him after i take care of this said the selfappointed executioner they passed outside the man with uneasy eyes did not close the door evidently he was calloused enough to want the others to hear the shot walk the fellow snarled you guys make one move and ill let you have it here instead of outdoors monk and ham walked they could hear the tread of the man behind them it was heavy regular betraying no nervousness and there was in it the quality of doom then the tread stopped monk thought afterward that there was also a faint gasp about the same time that the tread ceased but he was never quite sure it was a long moment before monk apprehensive lest their captor shoot turned the homely chemists little eyes flew round his mouth came open the deliverytruck driver stood spreadlegged in the passage he had the uneasyeyed man gripped by the neck with both hands he held the fellow off the floor with an obvious ease and the victim was making no outcry hardly twitching monk ogled the deliverytruck driver the latter had changed appearance vastly although he still wore the same garments and his skin and hair were swarthy but the limp was gone and the stature and fabulous strength identified the man doc savage monk gulped chapter two gentlemen of tulsa doc savage was not choking his prisoner but rather working on the back of the mans neck with corded bronze finger tips seeking out certain sensitive nerve centers on which pressure properly applied would induce a state of paralysis lasting some time when the man was completely limp with only his eyes and breathing showing that he still lived doc lowered him to the floor monk and ham stood immobile while the lariat was untied docs finger strength managed the knots with ease you hear anything that was said in that room monk whispered practically all of it doc told him after using the ruse of the delivery truck i you sprinkled nails in the road ham interjected exactly doc answered i hired the truck from a fellow who chanced to pass and his clothing as well he was carrying some roofing material and the nails came in handy the makeup material i always carry on my person it was largely dye and wax for the cheeks monk and ham shook off the ropes wheres my hog monk demanded back at that old tank farm doc said i had to leave him behind monk waved an ann what do you make of this mess doc their chief obviously robbed that kansas city bank the bronze man pointed out sure but what about those streaks of fire in the sky theyve got a connection with the gang and whyd they kill willard spanner and who is that girl and whats she doing here always thinking about women ham told monk sourly she acted queer monk said this whole thing makes me dizzy doc picked up the gun which had been carried by the man with the roving eyes he fired it twice the reports were earsplitting to make them think you have been executed the bronze man breathed that should give us a moment or so respite they eased back through the house until they encountered a door which seemed to be locked ordinarily a lock offered doc savage few difficulties but this was a padlock and hasp on the other side of the door we will try it through the basement the bronze man whispered the basement stairs were behind an adjacent door and squeaked a little but not too much as they went down the room below had once been a recreation chamber and held a huge billiard table the green covering mildewed and rotted the table must have been too ponderous to move away adjacent was the furnace room grimy windows afforded faint illumination monk stopped the instant he was inside the room lookit he gulped two men were handcuffed to the pipes which comprised the heating system one man was long and lean and his body looked as if it were made of leather and sticks he grinned at them and his grin was hideous because he must have had false teeth and was not wearing them now his clothing was fastidious when he tried to beckon at them it was evident that the thumb was missing from his right hand making that grotesque too i dunno who you are but you look like angels to me he said thickly you dont belong to this crowd turn us loose brother the second man was a sleek round butterball entirely bald not only was his body round but his head hands and his arms were like jointed elongated balls he wore a ring which had once held an enormous setting but the stone was missing now and the bent prongs of the ring showed it had been pried from place possibly without removing the ring from his fat rounded fingers yuss he said and his words were a mushy hissing turn us loose his loose sounded like lush monk lumbered forward asking smallvoiced who are you birds leases moore said the leathery man with the missing teeth and thumb quince randweil said the man with the rounded anatomy oh monk squinted the two missing men from tulsa ham snapped it was leases moores clothing that we got hold of in new york leases moore made a leathery grimace how do i know what they did with my duds they took em when they grabbed me and quince here out of my car a bulletproof sedan monk demanded thinking of the machine in which they had tried flight sure said leases moore are you gonna turn us loose or not doc went to the handcuffs examined the links and found them of no more than average strength the pipes formed an excellent anchorage he grasped the links set himself threw his enormous sinews into play and the thin metal parted with brittle snappings im a son of a gun quince randweil made it gunsh that tells me who you are doc said nothing he finished breaking the cuffs i heard them talking about you said randweil you are doc savage the way he said it the name sounded like savvash we had better get out of here doc said we will try that bulletproof car again they moved for the grimy window why were you being held monk asked leases moore that leases moore said promptly is the blackest mystery a man ever went up against they wouldnt tell us ransom they never mentioned it know their names only that runt stunted said leases moore i never saw any of them before neither has quince here the rounded man bobbed all of his layers of fat in agreement what is their game monk asked search us replied leases moore thats another mystery doc savage was working on the window and now it came open with only minor squeaks of complaint out said the bronze man and boosted lean leathery leases moore out through the aperture after first taking a look around quince randweil was helped out next he and moore ran for the car which had been wheeled back into the clearing and stood not many yards from the house they ran boldly with more haste than caution the dopes monk growled they oughta be careful until we get out then his jaw fell for leases moore and quince randweil had started the car and were racing wildly away the engine making a great deal of noise why the doublecrossers monk gritted the homely chemist had one pronounced failing when he got mad he was inclined to go into action without forethought of the consequences now he gave every indication of intending to climb out of the window and pursue the two fleeing men doc dropped a hand on monks shoulder and settled him back on the basement floor wait said the bronze man upstairs there was excited shouting they had heard the cars departure guns began going off they may not see who is in the car and think we have escaped doc said that will give us a chance to prowl about this place and possibly overhear something that will give us a better line on what is going on there was a staccato series of deafening reports undoubtedly the voice of stunteds cherished automatic rifle from which the barrel had been bobbed six guns made noises more nearly resembling firecrackers and a shotgun boomed deeply there was a general charge of men from the house they had obviously found in the hallway the senseless man with the queer eyes their wild rage might have been ludicrous under other circumstances doc had gotten the soiled cellar window shut they watched the excitement from behind its semiopaque screen monk grinned wonder how many ofem was around i was unable to ascertain doc told him looks like moren a dozen pulling out after that car monk offered bet theyre all leaving doc savage nodded admitting now is as good a time as any to look around they left the basement the stair squeaking as they went up seemed louder than before for the house was very silent i didnt see that girl leave monk whispered maybe we can find her and ask questions and probably get shot ham said pessimistically they listened outdoors in the morning sunlight birds were making sound wind fluttered scruboak leaves then they heard a voice it was a steady wellmodulated voice and it came in spells there was also an answering voice this one metallic and difficult to distinguish monk breathed the radio somebody is using it they made for the room which held the radio transmitting and receiving apparatus the door was open one of the gang crouched over the mechanism code book in one hand so you think the weather should be warmer out in san francisco he was saying yes old man thats probably true and if as you say the manual says frisco is a good place to be well go behind doc savage and his companions stunted yelled get them lunch hooks up you three guys stunted for all of his villainy seemed to have some of the spirit attributed to oldtime western bad men he disliked shooting down his victims in cold blood had he having come back unheard or possibly never having left the house started shooting without warning doc savage or one of the pair with him possibly all of them would have died then as it was they reacted unconsciously to the command they pitched forward into the radio room the man at the radio apparatus cried out in excitement and went for a gun he was infinitely slow doc savage lunging across the room sent out a fist and the man bounced from it to the apparatus table his weight ruptured wiring and sparks sizzled and blue smoke arose the fellow had succeeded in freeing his gun from a pocket and it bounced across the floor monk got it out in the corridor stunted bawled you guys aint got no sense atall come outa there this cannon of minell throw lead right through them walls monk lifted his captured revolver then lowered it grimacing to his companions maybe he wont shoot if he thinks were unarmed stunted lifted his voice yelling for assistance he did not enter the radio room his bellow was ample to carry to his associates the man on the radio table fell to the floor but did not move afterward a spot on his coat was smoking where it had been ignited by an electric arc ham went over and rubbed the smolder out with a foot doc threw up the window making ample noise for stunted to hear then he listened stunted had fallen silent doc picked up a chair and dropped it out of the window hitting the ground outside it sounded not unlike a man dropping from the window stunted swore and they could hear him rushing for the door which led outside doc led his two men out of the radio room not through the window but back into the corridor which stunted had just vacated they found a window on the opposite side of the house it was open and they dropped through some distance away men were calling excitedly they had heard stunteds yell the latter answered them advising what had happened doc and his men began to run it was the bronze mans sharp ears which ascertained that stunted was running around the house and would soon glimpse them doc breathed a command they all three slammed flat in the coarse grass stunted came puffing around the corner of the house and stopped his breathing was distinct loud he muttered in a baffled way doc and his men were perfectly motionless it seemed incredible that they had escaped discovery so far but stunted was certain to sight them monk held his revolver expectantly then a clear feminine voice called stunted they went around the other way doc and his two aides eyed the house the girl who had said her name was lanca jaxon was leaning from a second story window looking down at stunted and waving an arm around the building they got out of a window on this side she cried excitedly they ran around when they heard you coming hurry up they may he getting away stunted hesitated growling then he spun and sprinted around the house deceived by the girl the young woman looked at doc savage and his two men she could see them plainly looking down from above as she was her arm waved sharply gesturing that they should take advantage of the moment to escape they did so scrub brush hid just as a flood of men poured into the clearing which held the strange mansion monk had underestimated the numbers of the gang for there was nearer two dozen than one and all were heavily armed what say we stick around and bushwhack with em monk queried it was an idea which doc savage seemed to favor but which proved unfeasible for the gang found their trail and followed it with a rapidity which indicated that a skilled tracker was numbered among the enemy doc and his men were forced to retreat closely followed a small stream rocky of bottom gave them respite they waded along it first going up and making a false trail on the bank then reentering the water and wading downstream they turned back toward the house confident the pursuers would waste much time untangling the tracks that girl monk breathed wonderingly she helped us but before she stopped our getting away you know ham said slowly it strikes me that when she held us up the first time it might have been an accident she might have thought we were with the gang but what was she doing in the car monk countered ham shrugged i dont know possibly trying to get away herself monk looked at doc what about this girl the bronze man said that is why we are going back their flight had taken them almost two miles before they encountered the stream and now going back they were cautious they spread separating from each other by the space of a hundred feet or so in order that if one were discovered the other might be clear to render assistance it was ham who some ten minutes later stopped in a clearing and squinted intently he could see a building a large shack of a structure through a rent in the scruboak thickets the obvious newness of the building intrigued him he veered over to find doc he was surprised and a little chagrined to discover the bronze man had already sighted the structure and had climbed a small tree in order to view it more closely think it has any connection with this gang ham asked they have been around the building doc said all of them just went inside they had that girl along ham exploded but i thought they were tailing us they gave that up some minutes ago doc advised him the bronze man whistled a perfect imitation of a bird common to oklahoma giving the call twice it was the signal which they had agreed upon to summon each other and monk ambled up shortly his small eyes curious that shed of a building doc told him all of our friends seem to have gone inside it monk swung up a small tree with an ease that could not have been bettered by one of the apes which he so closely resembled he peered for a moment that thing dont look like an ordinary shed he said its kinda round for one thing the scrub oaks were thick and down in a small valley which they found it necessary to cross briars and small thorny bushes interlaced to form a barrier that they penetrated but slowly on either side of the defile trees grew high so that view of the shed was cut off completely they were still in the arroyo when they heard a long brittle crack of a noise it was distinct and very loud with an utterly distinct quality they had heard that noise before in new york city and in oklahoma it was a noise such as had been heard according to newspaper and radio reports by many persons in various parts of the united states always it had been accompanied by threads of flame in the sky doc and his two aides looked upward there was no trace of a fiery ribbon in the heavens come on doc rapped lets get to that shed they raced forward a moment later monk emitted an excited howl that shed he bawled its afire the shed must have been soaked with some inflammable compound some substance which burned even more readily than gasoline for it was a crackling pyre of flame when they reached it trees ignited by the terrific heat were bursting into flame as far as a score of yards from the structure doc and his men circled the spot they saw nothing heard no screams which would indicate human beings inside the burning structure they would have been dead by now anyway there was nothing for the bronze man and his aides to do but to stand by and extinguish such of the flames as threatened to spread and become a forest fire eventually they went back to the house where they had been first attacked their attackers had flown thoroughly the radio transmittingandreceiving apparatus had been smashed the odds and ends of clothing were gone doc savage had no fingerprinting outfit with him but managed to improvise one by employing a mixture of ordinary pulverized pencil lead and burned cork on white surfaces in the kitchen regions he examined these using the bottom which he broke from a milk bottle for a magnifier he looked intently for some time at the prints thus brought out monk and ham watched him both were fully aware of the facility with which the bronze man retained a mental image they were willing to bet he could run through a fingerprint classification days later and pick out any prints which matched those he was viewing now they searched for some time but the house offered nothing more to solve the mystery of what was behind the murder of willard spanner and the robbery of some millions of dollars from a kansas city bank neither was there a clue to the meaning of the streaks in the sky and the accompanying cracking noises they went back to the shed which had burned itself down poking through the hot embers was a procedure more fruitless than the search of the house the incredibly hot fire had consumed everything inflammable had melted together such metal work as there had been inside making it unrecognizable except for what apparently had been two large and excellent metalworking lathes were drawing blanks fast monk said ham was sober i wonder what happened to that gang and the girl were they burned to death doc savage said nothing they found the pig habeas corpus on their way back to tulsa chapter peril in frisco they spent four hours investigating in tulsa interesting things came to light the revolver which monk had secured from the man knocked out in the radio room of the strange house in the brush had been sold to leases moore a year previously further inquiry brought to light the fact that leases moore had purchased a number of firearms revolvers shotguns and automatic rifles during the past six months which makes me think of stunteds bobtailed automatic rifle monk growled the house in the hills had been built by an osage made wealthy by oil who had later died this fact corroborating what the gang had told monk doc savage secured from a rather remarkable morgue of personal sketches maintained by a feature writer on the graphic a tulsa morning newspaper the feature writer was a dresser whose sartorial perfection rivaled that of ham and he was a mine of information it seemed that he kept in his morgue bits of information about all persons of importance in and about tulsa doc savage was enabled through the morgue to make an interesting scrutiny of the careers of leases moore and quince randweil leases moore was a broker of oilfield leases in popular parlance a lease robber he had never been in the penitentiary that was about all that could be said for his business tactics he was sharp squeezing and scheming qualities it seemed which had made him a millionaire quince randweil had started life as a smalltime gambler had trafficked in liquor during prohibition and had later taken over the local dogracing track a profitable affair indeed he was also reported to be the undercover gambling czar locally and not above turning a dishonest penny now and then but like leases moore he had never been convicted of a crime more serious than overtime parking speeding parking without lights and even jay walking of these trivial offenses there was an incredible array of convictions doc savage asked about that the police tried to ride him out of town by picking him up on every conceivable charge advised the sartorially perfect graphic feature writer that was two years ago it didnt work the really important development of the investigation came from the local airport monk turned it up when he perused the list of passengers taking planes that morning he was excited when he got doc savage on the telephone at the graphic the frisco angle is getting hot doc he declared the bronze man queried yes leases moore and quince randweil caught the morning plane for san francisco monk advised doc savage did not hire a fast plane for the trip to san francisco as might ordinarily have been his course there was a regular airliner due shortly and it was faster than anything available for a quick charter when the liner pulled out he and his two aides were aboard it the plane had a radio doc communicated with new york consulting his three aides who were there johnny long tom and renny they had turned up nothing of importance in connection with the death of willard spanner at the first stop doc bought newspapers there was much news concerning the flame streaks in the sky police were beginning to connect the phenomena with criminal activities for in three distinct cases in addition to the bank robbery in kansas city profitable crimes had been committed shortly before the weird streaks appeared in the heavens doc and his two companions read the headlines while the plane was being fueled and punctuated their reading with munches at sandwiches secured at the airport restaurant perhaps that was why they failed to notice a lean neatly dressed man watching them the lean man was careful to keep his scrutiny furtive he had boarded the plane in tulsa along with three other passengers in addition to docs party he had two suitcases one of medium size one very large he had seated himself well forward in the plane and had not once looked in doc savages direction with anything bordering more than usual interest he was doing his watching now from outside the airport restaurant window after the fueling the man was first to enter the plane he stooped over quickly opened his small suitcase and took out an object which at first might have been mistaken for a bundle of tightly wound steel wire he walked back and tucked this in one of the baggage racks where it would not be observed he left the plane went hurriedly to the restaurant and put in a longdistance call to an arizona city the promptness with which the call was completed indicated the other party had been awaiting it the man consulted a code book the weather is perfect he said swell said the voice over the wire we will pick you up understand i understand said the man he hung up returned to the plane and resumed his seat just before the giant craft took the air motors making highpitched sound outside the sound proofed cabin the air was rough and the ship pitched slightly below was an expense of terrain not especially inviting to the eye being composed mostly of sand and sagebrush with here and there a butte hardly impressive from the air to break the monotony the plane flew for two hours the afternoon was well along the lean man stooped over and opened his large suitcase it held a parachute he had some difficulty wriggling into the harness bending over as he was in order to avoid notice when he had the harness almost in place he lifted his head to see if he had attracted attention he had doc savage was already in the aisle and coming forward the lean man dived for the door he had difficulty getting it open against the force of the propeller slipstream but finally succeeded and lunged through the face was triumphant but the expression changed quickly a hand it felt like the clamp of some metalcompressing machine had grasped his ankle the man cursed shrilly he hung down from the plane smashed about by the terrific rush of air only the grip on his ankle preventing him from falling clear his body battered the hard plane fuselage then he was slowly hauled upward toward the plane door desperate the man whipped out a gun he was not unlike a rag held in a stiff breeze and his first shot went wild then grasping the edge of the cabin door he took deliberate aim doc savage let him fall it was the only move that would preserve the bronze mans life the lean man fell away behind tuning over and over in the air that he had made parachute jumps before was evident from the way in which he kicked his legs to stop his gyrations in the air then he plucked the ripcord and the silk parachute blossomed out whitely the plane was in an uproar passengers yelled excitedly and crowded to the windows on the side of the door upsetting the equilibrium of the plane and causing the pilot to do some howling of his own doc savage lunged to the side of the pilot follow that man down he rapped such was the quality of compelling obedience in the bronze mans remarkable voice that the pilot obeyed without stopping to reason out why he should monk charged forward reached doc and demanded whyd that guy jump doc savage sent one glance fanning the horizon and saw nothing to cause alarm there was no signal visible below search the plane he said crisply passengers objected strenuously to having their baggage rifled and there was no time for explanations ham lost his temper and knocked out a young salesman who tried to defend a stout black case which when ham opened it proved to contain a small fortune in gem samples monk lost numerous of the red bristles which served him as hair to a fat woman who had no idea of seeing her fitted case opened by the simian chemist the pilot still fought the controls the associate pilot and the hostess trying to do their bit toward restoring calm only added to the bedlam it was doc savage who found the bomb that the lean man had hidden he smashed a window and heaved it overboard whether the missile exploded when it hit the hard earth below or slightly before was difficult to decide but a sizable cloud of smoke and debris arose enough of a cloud to prove that the plane would have been blown into fragments the pilot had followed the man with the parachute only until the balance of his plane had been affected by the shifting passengers and in the ensuing excitement he had forgotten the bronze mans orders the ship was now some distance from the parachute the white silk lobe was only a spot on the desert floor it had settled into a canyon they saw doc advanced again and spoke grimly to the pilot and that worthy suddenly apprised of the bronze mans identity and shown a small card hastened to send the plane toward the parachute the card doc displayed was one directing all employees of the air line to put themselves at his service upon request and had been issued partially because doc savage a man of more wealth than any one dreamed owned a goodly portion of the airline stock it was impossible to land in the canyon the nearest terrain for a safe descent was fully a mile distant the pilot put his ship down there armed doc asked the pilot the flier nodded doc monk and ham raced for the canyon it was rough going mesquite prongs raked their clothing and cactus prodded painfully once a rattlesnake whirred and shortly after that monk made a loud gulping noise and stopped he said something whatever he said was lost in a loud rending crack of a noise which seemed to come from the direction of the canyon theres that thing again monk growled and searched the sky in vain for some trace of a flame thread they ran on then they heard the crack of a noise again and once more listened and searched with their eyes again they saw nothing in the sky the perusal of the heavens might have been an omen they found no trace of their quarry when they reached the canyon they did locate the parachute where it had been abandoned tracks in the sand showed where the wouldbe killer had fled they followed these the tracks terminated in inexplicable fashion in the midst of an expanse of sand which bore every imprint with amazing distinctness but where the tracks vanished there was a queer disturbance as if a small and terrific whirlwind had sucked up the sand then let it sift back monk frowning insisted that some of the sand already floated in the air they hunted for an hour before they resigned themselves to conviction that in some manner as yet unexplained the one they sought had managed to vanish this thing has had a lot of dizzy angles so far monk grumbled but this one takes the cookies chapter the dead mans brother it was foggy in san francisco the air was full of moisture the newspapers which monk brought into doc savages hotel room were soft with wetness monk seemed baffled and he waved the papers its all over em he complained here weve been in frisco less than two hours and its all over the newspapers now what i want to know is who told em we were here doc savage said i did monk shook his head but we generally keep out of the papers all we can we have few clues to go on doc said none in fact dont i know it so if these men come to us even with the intention of getting us out of the way it will put us in contact with them at least doc said monk grinned doubtfully well thats one way of doing it doc savage took one of the newspapers but gave only brief attention to the story concerning his arrival in san francisco the item indicated among other things that the bronze man was on the west coast to investigate the murder of his friend willard spanner or had there been a murder there was another story concerning the willard spanner affair the newspaper publisher who had received the first letter demanding a money payment for spanners release had received a second missive insisting that spanner was still alive and demanding money for his safety this may be a newspaper publicity stunt monk suggested ive known some of the wilder papers to stoop to things like that doc savage lifted the telephone and got in communication with the publisher who had received the missives doc made his identity known i would like to see those notes he said the publisher tried to bargain in return for them youll have to let us write up your movements exclusively in our paper he said we will do nothing of the sort doc said promptly then you can whistle for the notes he was told the bronze man showed no emotion suit yourself he said the publisher sounded less certain when he asked what are you going to do about it tell the other newspapers what you are doing doc advised the fact that you are going so far as to block efforts to find spanner if alive for the sake of a story should make interesting reading i also have a federal agents commission the federal authorities will be interested in your refusal of information and cooperation to an agent i may think of other measures for instance the majority stock in your sheet is owned by a chain of which i am a director you win said the newspaperman ill send the notes over doc had hardly hung up when the telephone rang it was the clerk downstairs a mr nock spanner to see doc savage he said mr spanner says he is a brother of willard spanner send him up doc said and replaced the receiver the bronze man advised monk and ham that a visitor was coming up and told them his name willard spanners brother monk exploded i didnt know he had a brother he has doc said ever met him monk asked no doc said the brother is a military expert and has been in china for a number of years there was a knock at the door and doc arose and admitted the visitor nock spanner was a hardbodied man of more than average height although his hair was slightly gray at the temples his age was probably not much past thirty on his left hand he wore a rather large wrist watch the band of which was composed of chinese coins linked together i read in the newspapers that you were in san francisco investigating the mystery about my brother he said in a crisp voice which held a hint of the accent sometimes acquired by americans spending a period of years in a foreign land i just arrived this morning have you any idea why your brother was in san francisco doc queried nock spanner turned the wrist band of chinese coins which seemed to fit a bit too tight for comfort to meet me of course he said we had not seen each other for seven years i had finished my work in china and was coming back to the states to live you have any ideas about this nock spanner straightened the wrist band i have made enemies in china i did not think however that they would strike at me through my brother you think that possible nock spanner shrugged i am at a loss to think of anything else of course i knew little about my brothers connections in the states he might have made enemies of his own or some one may merely want money if so i am willing to pay fifty thousand was the sum demanded so the newspapers say you have it nock spanner nodded he took a large automatic with a thin barrel from a pocket then he brought out a roll of bills tapped them and returned them to the pocket i can pay he said but i want to know if my brother is alive i want the writers of those notes asked a question if they answer it correctly i will know my brother is alive is it a surefire question doc asked it is ill ask him my middle name which i havent used since childhood and which ill guarantee no one but my brother knows all right doc told him the notes will be here shortly a messenger brought the notes they were printed on rough brown paper the hardest kind of material to identify and there were no finger prints on them they were simple and intelligently worded stating that willard spanner was alive and would be released upon the payment of fifty thousand dollars in small bills the last line gave the method of communication will telephone you when we judge time proper theyre taking a chance when they use the telephone monk offered they can call from some remote spot and depart quickly doc replied the telephone rang yes doc said into the mouthpiece that newspaper guy said to call you stated a voice which held a deliberate artificial shrillness about what doc asked about willard spanner said the voice im one of the guys whos got him using the hand with which he was not holding the telephone doc savage made small rapid posturing motions monk watched these reading them for the gestures were those of the accepted onehand deafanddumb sign language and the homely chemist was being directed to trace the call monk departed hastily we have to know for certain that willard spanner is alive doc said it is reported that his body was found in new york somewhat less than three hours after he was seized in san francisco how we gonna do that the shrill voice asked ask willard spanner for his brother nocks middle name doc advised the answer will tell us if he is alive sure the other hung up it was some five minutes before monk entered the room wearing a downcast expression too fast he said the connection was down before we could trace it instantaneous tracing of telephone calls is successful in fiction doc told him in actual practice there are slips nock spanner had stood by fingering the tight band of chinese coins about his wrist during the last few minutes now he stepped forward just so there wont be any doubt he said and got a sheet of paper and an envelope from the room desk he wrote briefly on the paper standing so that none could see what he was imprinting then inserted the sheet in the envelope sealed it and gave it to doc savage the name is written inside he advised unless they come back at us with that name they havent got willard the telephone rang it was the voice with the disguising artificial shrillness the brothers middle name is morency the voice stated instantly afterward the other receiver clicked up there had been no chance to trace the call doc savage opened the envelope handed him by nock spanner there was one name printed on the stationery inside morency willard is alive said nock spanner this proves it to me judging that there would be future calls from the men who claimed to he holding willard spanner if incredibly enough he was still alive as it seemed now doc savage made preparations he got in touch with the telephone company and after some discussion succeeded in having the entire testboard crew set to work watching such calls as might come to his hotel they were to trace each call instantly with luck they might succeed it was fully an hour later when the call came the same disguised voice made it you will take the money get in an automobile and drive out of san francisco on the main los angeles road the voice directed watch the fences on your right when you see a piece of green cloth on a fence throw the money overboard well turn spanner loose there was a momentary pause while the other took a deep breath and listen doc savage he continued youre supposed to be a tough guy but if you cross me itll be tough for you and willard spanner both the other receiver clicked doc savage kept his own receiver to his ear and not more than twenty seconds passed before a briskly businesslike feminine telephone operator came in on the wire and said that last call was made from fantan road docs arrangement for the immediate tracing of incoming calls with the telephone company had worked nock spanner waved his arms wildly when the bronze man started for the door but arent you going to do what they demanded he barked no doc informed him the voice on the telephone was not sufficiently anxious about the money spanner blinked what do you mean i mean simply that the thing smells like an ingenious scheme to draw us to this fantan road monk and ham were following the bronze man a trap nock spanner exploded possibly doc agreed what are you going to do oblige the gentleman on the telephone to some extent doc replied nock spanner trailed along behind them looking very uneasy fantan road started auspiciously with fine mansions and new asphalt but that was down in the five and tenhundred number blocks and when doc savage had followed the thoroughfare out to the sixties it had dwindled to the remnant of some highpressure subdivision realtors bad dream finally there was no pavement at all and not much road only two ruts in sand and weeds even the telephone line draped slackly from poles which were not all of the same length it had been a long time since they had seen a house with a number on it and just why there should be numbers on a dwelling out this far without a rural designation attached was a mystery doc savage made no effort to pull their rented car off the road but stopped it and cut the engine nock spanner stood up in the seat the car was an open phaeton and peered about the radiator made boiling noises darned if i see a house he said it should be less than half a mile ahead doc told him they left the car with its hot sobbing radiator and advanced walking through sand that repeatedly filled their low shoes a circumstance which moved monk to take off his footgear and pad along barefooted the jungle ape in you coming out ham commented monk only grinned and kicked sand back against the overlong snout of the pig habeas who had paused to harass a large black frightened beetle on either side there was woodland the trees thick and large sprouting from a mat of brush doc savage watched the road closely and discerned the prints of tires they were not many at one point he noted in which direction spinning wheels had tossed sand before long he had concluded three cars had traversed the road recently two rather for one had come and returned and the other its tires of a different tread and state of wear had gone only one way all of the tracks had been made that day night dew has a way of altering the appearance of a trail doc savage left the other three abruptly without explanation and went ahead whats his idea nock spanner demanded suspiciously he does that regular monk explained hes gonna look things over wed better take it easy doc savage did not follow the two ruts along the sand that was the road but turned into the undergrowth and moved there it was uncanny the silence with which he traveled there was no sign of a house as yet but the telephone people had said there was a dwelling here so there must be one the bronze man was traveling downwind from the road and was scenting the air from time to time years of training had not quite given him the olfactory organs of a wild animal but his senses were developed far beyond those of ordinary ability he caught the odor of tobacco smoke he trailed it up wind and if his caution had been remarkable before it was miraculous now he made no sound in coming upon two figures crouched beside the road they were men they were arguing i tell you i heard a car one said it stopped down the road thats suspicious youre always hearing things said the other sourly possibly the hearing of both was a trifle deficient for it was hardly reasonable that neither should know of doc savages presence until the giant of bronze hurled down upon them but such was what happened doc had calculated his leap carefully and nothing went amiss he landed with a hand on the back of each mans neck and the shock of that drove them down burying their faces in the gritty earth they struggled one man managed to bleat out a cry he sounded like a caught rabbit terrific pressure skillfully administered began to tell so that the pair groveled with less violence finally becoming limp and all but unconscious doc turned them over they were leases moore and quince randweil chapter murder spree the piping bleat quince randweil had emitted it had been loud enough to carry to monk ham and nock spanner and they came up running on their toes for greater silence ah the two gentlemen of mystery ham said dryly they were watching the road doc told him doc savage had not induced the remarkable paralytic state which he could administer by pressure upon certain spinal nerve centers so quince randweil and leases moore soon revived enough to speak they behaved in a manner somewhat unexpected boy im glad to see you said leases moore who had put false teeth in his mouth and now did not look unhandsome you said it echoed quince randweil making it sound like shedd oh monk leered fearsomely so now youre glad to see us yes you are truly we are lisped quince randweil and why in blue blazes shouldnt we be leases moore demanded sourly we made a bad move and we know it now i see monk made his leer more impressive an explanation for everything i bet nuts said leases moore and began to look mad now now quince randweil lisped excitedly and made admonishing gestures it will not do good to get all bothered of course you gentlemen are aggravated with us thats a mild word for it monk told him randweil lisped on as if he had not heard saying it was our rugged individualism which made us act as we did yes our rugged individualism individualism was a strange sound the way he said it he made it inniwissilissim he continued you see we were mad very mad we had heard that our enemies were comingto san francisco to this house at fantan road we overheard that so being very mad and wanting to get even we came out here but we have not been having such good luck monk said its a good thing lightning dont strike liars you dont believe it randweil sounded hurt sure i do monk replied as sarcastically as possible randweil looked at doc savage do you believe mer doc savage asked by now have you any idea of what is behind all of this the murder of willard spanner the queer streaks in the sky and the rest not an idea declared randweil and thats the truth echoed leases moore rubbing the knob which was his missing thumb of course monk agreed more sarcastically than before leases moore yelled it is and all of you can go chase yourselves im not a guy you can horse around monk looked at doc hopefully shall i do some of my exercises on this guy doc replied nothing monk registered cheerfulness told leases moore therell be more than your thumb and teeth missing when i get through with you hold it doc said while i look around a bit the bronze man employed his usual caution in advancing through the brush and when he had traversed a hundred feet paused and listened at great length in order to ascertain if any one were approaching drawn by the noise made when moore and handweil were seized he heard nothing suspicious birds had fallen silent quieted by the sounds of the brief scuffle but now they became noisy so furtive was the bronze mans progress that not often were the feathered songsters disturbed the timber became thicker with less brush and higher more sturdy trees underfoot the brush gave way to moss and dead leaves ahead doc savage caught sight of a building of some kind the crack of a noise came then its note was the same as on other occasions sudden strange a noise unlike anything else doc savage ever had heard the bronze man whipped for the handiest tree his climbing was amazing he had picked a tree of somewhat thin foliage a moment later he was high up in it his eyes roved overhead and riveted there there was a strange thing in the sky no ribbon of weird fire it looked like a ball of some dull glassy substance in diameter the thing approached a score of feet and its surface was not all of the same obsidian nature but freckled with lighter and darker spots in an even pattern the fantastic ball was hanging back where monk and the others had been left it appeared to be little more than a hundred feet up nor was it perfectly stationary but bounced up and down slowly as if it had just landed on an invisible rubber mat the thing was surrounded by a faint haze which resembled steam and was steam doc surmised an instant later water particles in the mist being vaporized against the ball which had been made hot by its terrific rate of passage through the air the ball was an aerial conveyance obviously a thing of new and amazing design a vehicle along lines utterly at variance with those on which aeronautical engineers commonly worked most surprising of course was the lack of streamlining to be expected in a device capable of such unearthly speed it bore no resemblance to the fishbodied conformation sought after by designers it was a perfect globe there was an explanation somewhat startling in its possibility the planets in space the stars moon sun were round or nearly so and this some scientists maintained was a result of the application of the mysterious gravitational forces was some machination with gravity responsible for the amazing powers of this ball there was another explanation for the lack of streamlining a bit more sensible the ball seemed capable of moving in any direction without turning was not a spherical shape the most perfect attainable streamlining for a body which must move in any direction doc drove a hand inside his clothing where he carried a small powerful telescope but before he could focus the lenses the amazing ball dropped with eyedefying abruptness and was lost back of the trees judging by the swiftness of its descent there should have been a loud jar as it struck but there was no such sound doc savage released his grip on the limb to which he had been clinging he dropped halfway to the ground before he grasped another bough held to it long enough to break his fall then plunged on to the ground he sprinted through the growth at first he was cautious then something happened which led him to surrender silence to speed he heard a loud agonized bawl unmistakably monks voice some one cursed doc ran faster he heard brush crashings ahead then came the cracking sound it was something different this time starting with a whistle of something going with terrific speed and the crack followed long and mounting frightfully then dying away as if betaking itself into the distance at the first note doc halted stared his scrutiny was on the sky he thought he saw something he was not sure if anything what he glimpsed was a blurred streak which arched upward until it was entirely lost it was no fiery ribbon however the bronze man went on seeking the party he had left shortly before he found monk ham and nock spanner but not leases moore and quince randweil the first three were stretched out motionless in the brush there had been a terrific fight judging from the violence done and the state of the victims monk had two ugly cuts on the head ham one spanner had evidently been slugged in the face for his lips were stringing scarlet over the green leaves of a bush which he had mashed down in falling doc savage listened there was a leafy shuffling and the pig habeas came out of the brush looked at doc with small eyes then turned and went back into the undergrowth there was no other sound even the birds had fallen silent doc savage bent over the victims ham was already mumbling incoherently and endeavoring to sit up doc gave attention to monk and was working over him when hams head cleared the dapper lawyer stared at the prostrate apish chemist a horrified expression overspread his features as he saw the gore about monks head wounds monk he rasped is he dead doc savage said nothing ham staggered up and wailed monk is he all right hes the best friend ive got without opening his small eyes monk mumbled whos my friend i aint got a friend except habeas ham switched his anxiety for a black scowl and came over and kicked monk far from gently in the side i was not talking about you he snapped the pig habeas corpus came out of the brush again looked at them queerly then turned around exactly as he had done before and entered the brush monk sat up and began administering to himself and doc gave attention to nock spanner chafing his wrists pinching him to induce arousing pain until finally spanner rolled over and put bath hands to his bruised mouth the instant spanner was cognizant of his surroundings he whipped his hand from his mouth to the pocket in which he carried his money robbed he screamed fifty thousand dollars gone he began to swear loudly his profane remarks growing more and more shrill and violent until they were almost the utterings of a madman that wont help monk put his hands over his ears besides i aint used to such words my life savings spanner shrieked and you crack wise its no joke with this head of mine nothing is a joke monk growled only bellowing wont get it back habeas corpus came out of the brush and went back again doc savage said the pig is trying to show us something monk swayed erect weaved a small circle and fell down groaning he got up again nock spanner stared realizing that the homely chemist had been badly knocked out for the next few moments spanner was silent as if ashamed of his own hysterical outburst they went through the brush slowly for the three who had been attacked were in no shape for brisk traveling what happened doc savage asked them it was that thing in the sky monk said hoarsely we heard a crack of noise and looked over here he pointed ahead and there it was it looked like some kind of hard funny glass a new and unique terrestrial space ship doc interposed yeah monk frowned globe shaped doc elaborated it can move in any direction its actual propelling machinery i do not yet understand except that it is almost soundless soundless monk exploded that crack of a noise did you ever have a bullet pass very close to your ear doc asked have i grunted monk what did it sound like doc persisted was it a whine heck no said monk it was he stopped mouth open understanding coming over him exactly doc told him a body moving through the air at terrific speed pushes the air aside and leaves a vacuum behind and the air closing into this vacuum makes a distinct report that accounts for the noise these terrestrial ball ships make monk sighed mightily well if a devil with two spikes on his tail had jumped up we couldnt have been more surprised when we saw this ball thing ship or whatever it is he mumbled i was goggling at the thing when the lights went out for me leases moore picked up a stick and hit you ham told him about the same time that randweil struck me knocking me senseless nock spanner chimed in and they both piled onto me randweil held me and moore used his fist that was the last i remember monk said soberly funny thing ham snapped peevishly everything seems funny to you the last few days monk shook his damaged head as if he did not want to squabble when i was struck down i didnt go out immediately he said speaking slowly as if the information he were giving was painful i was in kind of a coma or something and just before i passed out ill swear that i saw the girl ham demanded what girl the one in oklahoma monk elaborated lanca jaxon hallucination ham said skeptically maybe monk nursed his head but she was coming through the brush with that runt stunted then she turned around and went back toward where that ball of a thing had been hanging in the sky doc savage stopped it was no hallucination i didnt think it was monk told him but how do you know doc pointed at the sandy ground underfoot it retained the impression of a foot narrow high of heel unmistakably feminine i wish we could talk to that young lady for a while ham said grimly she could deuced well explain a number of things they caught sight of the pig habeas the shotes enormous ears were thrown back in order that they might not be scratched by the thorny undergrowth and if actions were any indication he had been waiting to see if they were following him nock spanner said that is the most remarkable hog i ever saw hes been trained for years monk grunted say that ball of a jigger was hanging over here somewhere they stepped forward more briskly and came out in what amounted to a clearing although the place was furred over with short brush and tall grass this growth was mashed down over a spot a dozen feet across as if something heavy had come to rest upon it at the edge of the area where the brush was crushed there lay three dead men chapter death zone dead bodies have a certain distinctive grotesqueness which indicated their condition and these three were certainly dead bullets had finished one of them knives the other two the knife victims were not dressed as expensively as the one slain by lead their clothing being cheaply made nor did they seem as intelligent a type doc savage and his aides had seen the two knife victims before members of the gang monk exploded worthies who were with the crew in tulsa and in new york ham said more precisely doc glanced at nock spanner ever see them before spanner shook his head strangers to me doc savage bent over the victims searching but with little expectation of finding anything for he had already seen that the pockets were turned inside out indicating the unfortunates had been previously gone over the garments of the bullet victim held no label these had been cut out carefully there were labels in the clothing of the other two and these indicated not surprisingly that the suits had been purchased from a department store in tulsa oklahoma doc returned his attention to tile man who had been shot been dead at least ten hours he said monk and ham showed no surprise at that until monk watching the knife victims morbidly suddenly perceived that scarlet still oozed from their wounds hey he exploded these other two were killed only a few moments ago doc told him probably while that mysterious ball of a thing was resting here doc savage gave more attention to the body of the victim who had been dead the longer period he unscrewed lenses from his telescope and these served as excellent magnifiers in proper combination they afforded magnification which could be surpassed only by the more expensive of microscopes finding anything ham asked doc did not reply and ham showed no sign of being offended for he was accustomed to the bronze mans manner of lapsing into unexplained spells of apparent deafness usually when questioned upon points about which he had formed no opinion definite enough to voice or when asked about something which he wished to keep for himself possibly to spring later as a complete surprise monk nursed his gashed head and complained so far i dont make heads or tails of this its the dizziest dang thing ive run up against nock spanner waved his arms and growled what about my brother what about that house we came out here to investigate we havent done anything about that yet doc savage reassembled the parts of his telescope and pocketed it we will have a look at the house he said if any spanner muttered there is one doc told him i saw it through the trees just before this interruption the house was about what might be expected it was old once when this had been a more remote region and before some overenthusiastic real estate promoter had gotten hold of the region it had been a fruit ranch it looked as if it had not been lived in for a year or two they came upon a path that lay about a hundred and fifty yards from the structure and doc savage at once moved ahead voicing no word of explanation the others were too concerned with their own hurts to be overly inquisitive the path turned for a brief time doc savage was concealed from the others and during that interval he went through some rapid motions a bottle came out of his clothing it held a liquid which resembled rather thick colorless syrup and he sprinkled this over the path the bottle was out of sight when the others came in view they walked through the sticky substance on the path without noting its presence doc said nothing they went on behind weeds that grew thickly along the fence of what had once been a corral they waited and used their ears monk and the other two heard nothing but aware of the bronze mans supertrained hearing they glanced inquiringly at him apparently no one around doc said they eased toward the house its decrepit nature became more pronounced portions of the roof had no shingles at all most of the windows were gone monk suggested wonder if we hadnt better scatter out in case something happens if its a trap we dont want em to nab us all in one bunch good idea nock spanner agreed and when doc savage did not veto the proposal they separated flattening out in the weedy cover i will go in doc said he left the others worked ahead on all fours and gained the door only the top hinge supported the panel no sound came from within doc entered plaster had fallen off walls and ceiling and was in lumpy profusion underfoot powdered spots indicated where the stuff had been stepped on recently doc made a closer examination men had been in the house very recently he went on to another room equally as cluttered up and stood listening there was sound now rather strange sound a faint hipitched singing noise it did not undulate but came steadily proof that no cricket was making it although the note did sound vaguely like that insect doc whipped for the source of the noise an adjacent room the instant he was through the door he saw what was making it a portable radio transmitter stood on the floor it was in operation near by was another slightly larger box of apparatus and from that ran wires which progressed through cracks in the floor doc hurriedly examined the second box the workings of the thing were intricate but not so complex that the bronze mans scientific skill failed to perceive their nature the box was a delicate electrical capacity balance an instrument constructed to register by having its capacity balance upset when any new object came near it it was merely a development of the old regenerative radio receivers which howled when a hand was brought near them only this instead of howling actuated a sensitive relay which in turn set the radio transmitter to sending a steady oscillating signal exactly such a device as this must have been employed hack at the oyster plant in new york to detect the approach of doc savage here it had served the same purpose except that it started the radio transmitter in lieu of actuating some other signal doc spun about raced out of the room there was furious haste in his movements the instant he was outdoors his powerful voice crashed a warning get away from here he rapped its a trap monk heaved up instantly from among the weeds ham appeared a short distance to his right they waited spanner doc called nock spanner did not show himself doc called again only silence answered blazes monk snapped thats blasted strange where was nock spanner when you last saw him doc savage questioned monk pointed over there they went to the spot there was a trail where the leaves had been mashed down the weeds crushed but it only led for a short distance before it became difficult to follow he was heading back toward the brush ham said dryly now i wonder what his idea was might have seen some one monk said in a tone which indicated he doubted the prediction doc savage dug a small flat flask out of his clothing it was filled with greenish pellets hardly larger than common rice he began shaking these out on the ground and the moment they were exposed to the air they began turning into a rather biliouslooking vapor this was swept away quickly by the wind but the strange vaporized pellets did one remarkable thing to the surrounding growth and the ground they brought out tracks tracks that showed with a distinct sinister yellowish tint monk gulpedwell for he looked down and saw that he himself was leaving the yellowish footprints wherever he moved hams tracks likewise showed only doc savage left no trail a sticky chemical i let you walk through doc explained this vapor causes a chemical reaction which makes your tracks visible ham clipped then you suspected that just a precaution doc told him hurry weve got to find nock spanner and get away from here they began following the remarkable trail which spanner had unknowingly left any sign of nock spanners brother willard ham asked no doc replied they were in the woods now away from the corrals the rickety sheds the tracks became farther apart as if nock spanner had started running here darn his soul monk ejaculated i cant understand what got into him listen doc ripped suddenly he said only the one short word but it was hardly out of his mouth before their eardrums all but collapsed under a terrific rending crack of a report instinct made them look up surprise put expressions of blankness on their faces a fantastic glistening ball of a thing was suspended above them it was not the same ball they had seen before this one was smaller its color slightly different and stretching from it and away into the sky was a trail that might have been left by a fastmoving skyrocket the ball was hot they could feel its heat against their faces heat which undoubtedly came from the friction of the air against its shiny hull at tremendous speed as gusts of particularly damp mist struck it the gleaming skin threw off faint wisps of steam under cover doc shouted they lunged under the trees and a fractional moment later the ball dropped hitting with a pronounced jar where they had stood blazes monk gulped its a stout thing the ball seemed to be cooling off rapidly more rapidly than was quite natural probably has an inner and outer shell heavily insulated against heat doc said grimly otherwise it would get too hot inside for human life and that in only a short period of traveling and from the way its cooling off i judge that much of the heat is absorbed by refrigeration from within the ball lifted slowly and hung suspended in the air unpleasantly like a fantastic bird of prey monk scrambling through the undergrowth rasped the darn thing is trying to mash us the ball floated back and forth and peering closely doc and his men discovered what might possibly be periscopic windows showing outwardly as little more than big lenses at various points on the skin of the thing they were not in one spot but were located on top bottom sides got eyes all over like the head of a fly monk complained the terrestrial ship leaped to a spot above them as it moved it left a distinct trail of what resembled glowing red sparks that explains the fire streaks in the sky monk barked doc savage nodded the luminous particles are exhaust from whatever mechanism propels the thing but some of the balls dont leave a trail monk pointed out possibly more perfected specimens doc told him grimly they may have equipped some of the ships with digesters which eliminate the luminous exhaust that was a rank guess on the bronze mans part a guess which later developments showed was accurate doc and his men began to run seeking to keep under cover it was difficult almost impossible for the woodland here was open and the fabulous bulb sank itself in the trees and turned slowly as if it were a fantastic organism with eyes brain and perceptive senses all in its round gleaming torso then it lifted a little and drifted over doc and his men where they had been spied out there was a clicking noise and a small metal blob dropped earthward it thudded into the dead leaves and popped itself open not unlike a large and very rotten egg exactly the same thing happened a bit to the other side of docs party gas ham shouted then coughed violently stood up very straight grasped his throat with both hands and pulled at it as if trying to free something lodged there he was still pulling at his throat when he fell over monk tumbled over beside him whether it was due to his superior physical resistance or to the fact that he held his breath doc savage was able to run some distance and probably would have gotten away except that the gas seemed to be assimilated through the pores of the skin almost as effectively as through the lungs doc fell down a full hundred yards from the others when doc savage awakened the voice of the short man known as stunted was saying i didnt figure id live to see this day i sure didnt when the bronze man opened his eyes it was to see stunted standing over him a sawedoff automatic rifle tucked under an arm no sir i didnt think wed ever get you stunted told the bronze man doc moved his arms over an area of a few inches they were limited to that motion by handcuffs huge and strong one pair with oversize bands located above his elbows three more pairs above his wrists he shifted his ankles there were three more pairs of manacles there and his knees were roped together and the knots wired were getting cautious stunted told him doc moved his head monk and ham lay near by both handcuffed monk with nearly as many pair of manacles as secured the bronze man neither monk nor ham were conscious theyll come out of it stunted said that gas wasnt the kind that kills according to what the chief told us the man with the queerly behaving eyes came over scowling shoved stunted away and said still working that mouth overtime stunted glared at him my ropes got an end fella the lanky man with the queer eyes ignored that and frowned at doc savage where did leases moore and quince randweil go he demanded that doc told him slowly is something i also should like to know the other blackened his frown so they were around huh they were the man swore and the nature of his profanity indicated he had lived some of his past on a cow ranch the two locoed jugheads he finished we found two of our boys dead out in the brush where one of the balls had landed leases moore and quince randweil killed them and took charge of the ball didnt they the thought has occurred to me doc admitted just the thing weve been trying to prevent the man snarled and his eyes crossed horribly doc asked who was the third dead man the one who had been dead some time the other man opened his mouth as if in his absentmindedness he was about to make a correct answer then his eyes suddenly straightened never mind that he snapped where is the girl doc queried stunted said dryly them two skunks moore and randweil mustve kept her alive they would gonna use her the same way he was the man with the roving eyes yelled looks as if only a bullet will cork that trap of yours stunted advised any time you feel lucky you can try to put the cork in instead of taking up the challenge the other wheeled and stalked away the man with the uneasy eyes was back some five minutes later he looked rather happy you must have had a drink stunted suggested nuts the other grinned evilly i been in touch with the boss we all get an extra cut for nailing our big brass friend here when you bear such tidings all is forgiven stunted told him the boss is gonna handle the rest the thin man said what rest stunted questioned doc savage has three more men in new york said the other guys called long tom johnny and renny theyve got to be taken care of chapter the farmer gag renny had big fists a medical authority had once claimed they were the biggest fists ever known on a man including those of the cardiff giant renny was not a boasting man except on one point and that was the claim that there was not a wooden door made the panel of which he could not batter out with his fists renny as colonel john renwick was an engineer with a reputation that extended over much of the world he did not work at that profession much these days he loved excitement and to get it he was a soldier of trouble in doc savages little group renny sat in doc savages skyscraper headquarters in new york city there was a newspaper on his lap under the newspaper and hidden by it was one of the bronze mans supermachine pistols capable of discharging many hundreds of shots a minute there came another knock on the door come in renny invited the man who entered was a tower of bones he blinked at the newspaper then fingered a monocle which dangled by a ribbon from his lapel your demeanor instigates apprehensions he said in a scholastic voice didnt know it was you johnny renny rumbled in a voice that had the volume of an angry bear in a cave he pocketed the machine pistol the newcomer was william harper johnny littlejohn a gentleman with two loves excitement and big words that he was considered one of the most learned experts on archaeology and geology was incidental has long tom communicated with you in the preterlapsed hour or so johnny asked renny blinked that one got me long tom called me advised johnny in smaller words he indicated he possessed information of equiparable import i see renny said vaguely no he didnt call me johnny stalked into the library appearing thinner than any man could possibly be and still live and came back with a book only slightly smaller than a suitcase he opened it and began to pore over the pages of fine print it was a book on the life habits of the prehistoric pterodactyl which johnny himself had written brushing up renny asked i left something out johnny explained a matter of ponderable consequence too concerning the lapidification or progressive lapidescence of the oval spare me renny requested ive already got a headache any word from doc no johnny said shortly the door burst open admitting a pallid wan man who looked unhealthy enough to be in a hospital he was hardly of average height and his complexion had all of the ruddiness of a mushroom something important he yelled and waved a paper he was major thomas j long tom roberts electrical wizard extraordinary and he had never been ill a day in his life the paper bore typewritten words i know youre a right guy and know youre interested in this willard spanner killing go to carl street and you may learn something be careful though ill look you up later and if you want to do something for me for tipping you off thats all right too buzz whos buzz renny rumbled search me said long tom but this is worth looking into simply because the public dont know were interested in the affair this man knew it so he must have gotten a line on something worth while its eminently plausible johnny agreed renny after making remarkably hardlooking blocks out of his great fists grunted wonder what kind of a place this carl street is it was a swanky residential thoroughfare they found that out when a taxicab carried them along carl street half an hour later the street was lined with apartment buildings and it was necessary to look nearly straight up to see the sky the buildings looked new no when they passed it was one of the most imposing buildings its apartments having large windows and there were two uniformed doormen under the canvas canopy instead of the customary one what shall we do long tom pondered aloud thats a large place must be three hundred apartments and we dont know what were looking for charge in and start asking questions renny suggested aboriginal reasoning said johnny sure long tom agreed we wouldnt get to first base and maybe scare off our birds it wont hurt to take a look argued renny ill turn up my coat collar and go in wherell you put them fists long tom snorted ill do the gumshoeing they directed their taxi around the corner and got out long tom stood on the curb scratching his head its just as well not to walk in too boldly he declared these birds may know us by sight a bright idea apparently seized him then for he left the other two dodged traffic across the street and entered a telegraph office renny and johnny waited five minutes passed and the waiting pair became impatient they were on the point of investigating when a messenger came out of the telegraph office he was directly before them before they recognized long tom gave a kid two bucks to loan his uniform to me the electrical wizard grinned he went into the apartment building carrying a telegraph company envelope which was empty and when one of the doormen tried to stop him he glared and said nix you guys dont gyp me out of the tip for delivering this long tom walked on in and over to the directory board which displayed a list of the tenants officebuilding fashion this last was an unusual custom for an apartment house and a break for long tom long tom took one look then he wheeled walked out excitement was on his pale face when he joined the others guess what he exploded blazes grunted renny thats some way to start out whats eating you willard spanner had a laboratory and room down on staten island long tom said the police searched it but found nothing to indicate why he was murdered am i right right renny boomed yet willard spanner is listed in that apartment house as having an apartment there long tom advised renny lumbered forward there may be something to this angle after all what number is this apartment apartment said long tom fifteen minutes later renny and johnny appeared at the service entrance of the apartment building carrying a large wooden box which bore the designation apartment on its sides in black crayon their scheme did not go far without hitting a snag it seemed that the apartment house had a service department which delivered packages we were to install this thing renny rumbled and tapped the box dont bother ringing the apartment we got the keys a service elevator took them up and grunting a little they carried their big box down the corridor they stopped at the door and listened heard nothing exchanged glances then rang the bell there was no reply from a pocket renny removed a sizable array of skeleton keys these he had brought from docs headquarters he tried almost twenty of them and his long sober face was registering some anxiety before one of the keys threw the tumblers inside was a modernistic reception room done in black and shining chromium renny eyed it appreciatively he was a connoisseur in modernistic apartments himself possessing one of the most extremely decorated apartments in the city he and johnny skidded their box inside with little regard for the polished floor they closed the door hello renny called tentatively only echoes answered they passed through the first door if the reception hall had been modernistic this chamber was an extreme in the opposite direction being fitted up in early twelfth century style there were great broadswords over the fireplace the table was massive and hand hewn and two suits of armor stood at opposite ends of the room mounted boar heads set off the scheme of decoration not bad renny said they advanced the two suits of armor moved simultaneously each turned a steel gauntlet over revealing a small automatic pistol which had been hidden from view you walked right into it said a voice back of a slitted helmet renny broke into a grin it was a peculiar characteristic of renny that when the going got tough he seemed to become more cheerful by the same token when he looked most sad he was probably happiest you took a chance he rumbled oh we figured you wouldnt ring in the police said the man in the armor doc savages men dont work that way four other men now came out of the rear regions of the apartment they carried guns two of them searched johnny and renny thoroughly lock the door one suggested a man went to the corridor door and turned the key then came back juggling it in his palm get us out of these tin pants suggested one of the pair in the armor this was done johnny and renny said nothing but studied their captors and the appraisal was not particularly cheering for the six were not nervous and their manner was hard confident while the clipped unconcern of their speech indicated that they were no strangers to situations involving mental stress they were the kind of men who could be thoroughly bad none of them looked soft well snapped one how do you like us youd look better with a black hood over your head renny said dryly thats the way they fix you up before they put you in the electric chair aha the man waved an arm he threatens us another said dryly we got doc savage in california and now we collar these three strikes me weve about cleaned up our opposition the boss worked a sweat up for nothing said the first this doc savage wasnt such hot competition it was that damn willard spanner grumbled the first man he was tipped off about the thing and asked to get in touch with doc savage we had to smear him it wasnt so much the smearing the second man corrected it was the way we had to grab him in frisco at noon then croak him here in new york a couple of hours later when he tried to get away the first speaker nodded but he had mailed all of the dope to his new york apartment and we had to bring him here and make him get the letter for us renny did not ordinarily show surprise but now his eyes were all but hanging out you came from san francisco to new york in less than two hours he exploded sure sneered the other aint it wonderful i dont believe it renny rumbled johnny put a question which had been bothering him was this ever willard spanners apartment heck no the other chuckled we just fixed that up as a kind of sugar coating on the bait then the man snapped a finger loudly blast it theres one of these guys loose yet the one who looks like hes about ready to die long tom they call him the man who seemed to be in charge consulted his watch well take care of him later he decided they start unloading the seabreeze in just about an hour well have to move fast the men now began handcuffing binding and gagging johnny and renny working with swift ease a hard tranquility in their manner as if they were perfectly sure of their ground and expected no interruption they were more than mildly astounded when long tom said from the modernistic reception room door everybody stand very still behind long tom was the box in which renny and johnny had carried him upstairs against just such an emergency as this the six sinister men in the apartment had been calm before and their composure did not desert them now for they merely turned around saw the supermachine pistol in long toms pale hand were duly impressed and made no exciting gestures they slowly held their hands out from their sides let their guns fall on the carpet and raised their hands over their head hold that position long tom advised he went forward and freed renny and johnny who in turn searched their prisoners thoroughly disarming them the search was not as productive as they had hoped the pockets of their captives holding nothing but money the labels inside their clothing had been cut out carefully tie them up long tom suggested this was done curtain cords wire off floor lamps serving as binding long tom frowned at them asked what was that i heard about seabreeze whats seabreeze a race horse said one of the men promptly long tom shook his head you said something about unloading sure the other shrugged the horse just came in from the south on a train we gotta unload him renny boomed thats a lie the man looked hurt long tom lifted his brows inquiringly the seabreeze is a new ocean liner renny said i read about it in the newspapers it comes in today and theres a lot of gold bullion aboard the stuff is being shipped over from europe so long tom glared at their prisoners whats going to happen to the seabreeze no one said anything its just a coincidence growled one of the gang seabreeze is a race horse well see about that long tom waved at the door were going down to the pier where this ocean liner is docking somebodys gotta watchthese birds renny boomed you can have the job long tom told him you thought of it they argued briefly and it ended by them matching coins in which procedure renny lost so grumbling and looking very solemn he took over the job of guarding the captives while johnny and long tom went to the pier where the liner seabreeze was docking to see if it had any connection with the present affair long tom and johnny were jaunty indeed as they rode down in an elevator and hailed a taxi in front of the apartment building they would not have been as cheerful had they chanced to note the actions of a man at that moment in the act of parking his car down the street a score of yards the man in the car bent over hastily so that his face was concealed and when he bobbed up to watch long tom and johnny out of sight he held a newspaper before his features in a manner which was casual but effectively shielding when the man got out of his car he had a topcoat collar turned up and his hat brim snapped down very low he walked rapidly and entered the apartment house managing to keep his face averted from the doormen in his free hand the man was carrying a small case which might have contained a physicians tool kit an elevator let him out on the twentyseventh floor he waited until the cage departed then glided to the door of the apartment to which long tom johnny and renny had been decoyed the man opened his little case first he took out a rubber mask which fitted his face tightly the thing was literally a false face padded so that it now appeared that the man had bulging cheeks a crooked nose and more than one chin the case also disgorged a tin can with a screw top and a funnel the lower end or spout of which was flattened out the man inserted the flattened portion of the funnel under the door he poured the contents of the can into the funnel and the stuff a liquid ran into the apartment the man stepped back hurriedly and it became apparent that he was holding his breath he went to a window at the end of the corridor opened it and stood squarely in the stiff breeze which now blew in he breathed deeply he stood there fully five minutes consulting his watch then he turned and went to the apartment door drawing a key from his pocket fortunately the other key had not been left in the apartment door when it was locked from the other side so the man with the rubber mask admitted himself readily the stuff on the floor had evaporated the man held his breath until he had opened the windows then went outside and waited for the apartment to clear of the gas which he had poured under the door renny and the rest of the men in the apartment were now unconscious chapter man in the rubber mask the man in the rubber mask seemed to know a great deal about the effect of his gas and how to revive its victims for he went to work on the late prisoners first unbinding them and transferring a number of the ropes to the person of renny it was not long before inhalation of certain bottled compounds caused the men to blink and moan themselves awake the masked man shook one of them violently what happened he snapped the sound of the voice it was not a particularly unusual voice yet distinctive enough to be readily recognized snapped the man who heard it into wide wakefulness the big chief he exploded but whatre you wearin that mask for you look like a goblin the man in the mask ripped out i asked you what happened here i didnt ask for any wiseguy stuff the story of the raid by doc savages three men came out the narrators doing their best to gloss over the parts unfavorable to themselves but judging from the angry snorts of their leader not succeeding very well fools the man yelled you do things just like a herd of donkeys where did johnny and long tom go the one telling the bad news looked as if he had found a worm in his apple he hesitated he had neglected to tell about the seabreeze slip its bad he groaned and told the rest of it the masked leader proceeded to have something approaching a tantrum he swore and kicked those who were just regaining consciousness so that they awakened more hurriedly and scrambled erect to get the more sensitive portions of their anatomy out of foot reach you bunch of nitwits the man choked you should have told me that first it may be too late now he charged into another room grabbed a telephone and could be heard snapping the dialing device around madly when he got his number his voice dropped those in the other room did not hear a word he said except for a final sentence which showed the man had been speaking in the strange private code which the gang employed the cake should be baked half an hour earlier was his last sentence he came back into the room looking somewhat less mad than before and said maybe i managed to get the bacon out of the fire how he was asked i contacted the boys and told them to go through with it half an hour earlier than planned he consulted his watch that means right away they may get it done before johnny and long tom arrive on the scene the man eyed his watch again half an hour should see the job done at about the same moment long tom was examining a thin wafer of a watch which had cost the electrical society which had presented it to him a small fortune we wont make that pier much before the half hour he said to johnny however they had secured a driver who was willing to take chances and by stopping a traffic policeman and exhibiting their police commissions they too held them as well as did doc savage they persuaded the oficer to ride the running board the results were remarkable traffic split for them their horn blasted steadily they chopped fifteen minutes from long toms time estimate theres the pier long tom advised johnny craned his long neck the situation has certain aspects of a premonstration he said long tom looked puzzled a what did you from ahead came a sound as if a snare drum had been beaten hard for a short interval the driver stopped the cab so suddenly that the wheels skidded he heaved out of the seat took a good look there was a crowd ahead an excited crowd at the snare drum sound the crowd showed an abrupt tendency to leave the vicinity many policemen were running about policecar sirens made an unholy music this is as far as i go the taxi driver advised theres a young war ahead johnny and long tom were already getting out of the machine they forgot to pay the driver and he in turn did not think of collecting they ran forward men and women passed them two men led a woman who was having hysterics thev killed fifty men or morel the woman screamed the bodies were everywhere johnny registered incredulity and gasped a brobdingnagian exaggeration let us hope the snaredrum sound surely a machine gun rattled out again smaller firearms cracked shotguns went off gas bombs made rottenegg noises a burly policeman loomed up and yelled hey this aint no show get back where its safe long tom and johnny showed their policecommission cards whats going on the feeblelooking electrical wizard asked pirates said the officer theyre cleaning out the seabreeze going on long tom and johnny rounded the corner and came upon a surprising sight three very large trucks were backed up to the pier at which the bright new liner seabreeze was tied the van body of the outer truck had been shot away over a small area and it was evident that the interior was lined with thick steel the truck tires were ragged where bullets had struck but had not gone flat indicating they were of solid rubber the engine hoods and radiators also seemed to be armored although the engines were of a type which sat inside the cabs and thus were difficult to shoot into a man probably a news photographer was getting pictures on top of a nearby building a machine gun snarled from behind one of the trucks and he dashed for cover a fresh burst of firing started possibly fifty policemen were in sight others were arriving they had set up a regulation lewis gun and its drumming uproar burst out johnny got his bony length down behind a row of parked cars windows were shot from some of the cars trailed closely by long tom he worked to the side of a police sergeant he asked questions the seabreeze is carrying gold bullion the officer explained theyre looting her must be thirty or more of them the sergeant drew the pin of a gas bomb drew back and hurled it wont do any good he added them birds are wearing masks using regular army tactics long tom growled well get em said the cop we got men taking their pictures with telephoto lenses were blocking every street leading away from here it became evident that the ship raiders had thrown up a barricade of sand bags probably unloaded from the trucks behind which they could crawl to load the trucks only rarely did one of them show himself above the barrier each lapse of this kind drew a fusillade of bullets long tom unlimbered his machine pistol as did johnny they joined the police besiegers there was little else they could do consummately unbelievable said johnny referring to the whole affair it does seem to be about as big a thing as was ever pulled in new york long tom agreed hey somethings gonna happen truck engines had been turning over steadily now they roared the huge vehicles began to move this was the signal for the police everywhere officers leaped up emptying their guns crash and roar of firearms was terrific bits of aiding fell off the trucks the giant vehicles did not turn up or down the street as expected they continued straight across the wide waterfront thoroughfare they were aiming for a large wooden door in a building the first truck hit the door it was of very thin wood and caved in the truck vanished inside the others followed an instant later it was evident that a stout steel door had been put up from the inside of the building in place of the wooden one a great roar of gunfire came from the building as bricks fell out of the walls here and there exposing loopholes obviously prepared aforehand the police retreated occasionally one fell wounded the officers began to yell for ladder wagons from the fire department in order that they might scale the roofs of the buildings theres a court behind that building a bluecoat shouted try to get into that theyre trying he was informed the gang has the walls covered some fifteen minutes passed the vicinity began to take on the aspect of a battlefield out in the bay a tugboat maneuvered a light field gun secured from the fort in the bay on its after deck police in number had grown to several hundred whiteclad ambulance attendants were thick then something happened that knocked every one speechless there was a rending crack it really started with a whistle that might have been made by some body going at terrific speed the throng gazed stupefied at the sky scarcely believing what they saw a big ball a cop gasped it come up out of the court behind that building and went away so fast you danged near couldnt see it while they still goggled at the heavens there was another echoing report and a second ball sailed upward visible at first but rapidly gathering speed until it could hardly be followed with the eye no more balls arose shooting from the building had stopped policemen stormed the place theyll find exactly nothing is my guess long tom prophesied he was right the officers found the trucks badly riddled they found one bar of gold which had somehow been overlooked in the excitement considering the magnitude of the theft and the roaring manner in which it had been executed it was remarkable that only one gold bar had been overlooked six million dollars had been taken the seabreeze purser gave out that information not quite a dozen men had been killed although one excited tabloid newspaper placed the estimate at two hundred altogether it was the most spectacular bit of news which new yorkers had experienced in a long period most stunning of all perhaps was the manner in which the thieves had vanished when last seen they were fasttraveling specks in the sky nor was another trace of them discovered of course every one now connected the streaks in the sky at first thought to be peculiar comets with the mysterious balls there was one point which caused confusion at first the balls had made streaks in the sky now they made none long tom and johnny discussed that as they rode uptown baffled and a little sheepish because they had been of practically no assistance in preventing the robbery i dont understand it long tom said maybe the streaks werent made by balls after all and what kind of things are these balls anyway how do they work they got out of their cab in front of the apartment building where they had left renny guarding the prisoners paying the fare took a few moments they turned to go in look long tom exploded renny sat in a car across the street his head and shoulders showed plainly so that there was no doubt about it being renny what the hecks he doing down here long tom quipped the next instant one of rennys huge hands lifted and beckoned to them indicating that they should come over they ran across the street unsuspecting hands far from the armpit holsters which held their supermachine pistols two men came from behind a parked car on the right they flourished revolvers three came from the left also with guns they were members of the gang who had been in the apartment they said nothing they did not need to for their manner was fully explanatory of their intentions long tom and johnny put their hands up a small man got up from the floor of the car beside renny crouched down there out of sight he had grasped rennys arm and waved one of the engineers big hands thus giving the summons which had deceived long tom and johnny renny it became apparent was unconscious the gang was using three cars all large sedans of somber color in not more than twenty seconds after the first man with a gun had appeared the cars were in motion long tom in one johnny in the other a woman had been hanging with her head out of a nearby window now she began to scream her shrieks were so piercing that a baby in a perambulator up the street burst into loud crying one of the men stuck a gun out of a car window the weapon sent thunder along the street the womans head disappeared another man in the car snarled we aint killing women you louse whos killing women the other snorted i shot out a window twenty feet from where she had her head the cars did not travel swiftly enough to attract attention after a dozen blocks they stopped in an alley no one was in sight a shift was made to three other cars of entirely different color and model these separated long tom squirmed about as they began to bind his arms securely with bits of cotton rope there was little he could do what are you going to do with us he demanded plenty a man informed him long tom managed to grab a wrist and twist it causing the victim to cry out in pain and as he flounced about his gun was dislodged from his waistband where he had stuffed it long tom had been contriving at that he tried mightily to get the gun they beat him down and kicked him soundly for the trouble he was causing a long time later the car stopped in a woodland long tom peered out and discovered that the other two machines had also arrived by other routes far away through the trees the electrical wizard caught sight of a gleaming object what next asked one of the men the chief says to get doc savage and all of his men together replied the man in charge risky aint it the other shrugged were going to do some tall question asking chief wants to know just how much doc savage has learned about us and whether he has left a written record of what he has dug up squinting at the gleaming thing through the trees long tom suddenly decided it was a ball a large globe of some obsidian material one of the men came over took a bottle and a handkerchief from his pocket poured some of the contents of the bottle on the handkerchief and suddenly pounced upon long tom clamping the saturated cloth to the electrical experts nostrils long tom held his breath as long as possible but they punched him in the stomach until he had to take air the first whiff brought the odor of chloroform he coughed flounced he managed to get a lungful of fresh air endeavoring to make them think he had succumbed he tried to fake oncoming unconsciousness while holding his breath again full of tricks aint you snarled the man and hit him just above the belt long tom inhaled the anaesthetic in gobbling haste and before long felt it take hold his last impression was that of johnny and renny fighting against handkerchiefs being pressed against their nostrils chapter sinister organization the room was dark so very dark that it seemed filled with something solid at one point only did a trace of light show a small faint glow which on closer examination would have been ascertained to be the luminous dial of a wrist watch after a while there was noise of a door opening and a flashlight lunged out whitely picking up a prone figure the beam collapsed the motion of the watchdial light patch indicated the man was being lifted and borne into another room equally dark but into which jangling sound of a radio speaker penetrated he was dropped heavily and those who had borne him stalked out doc savages trained voice asked who is it the man who had just been carried in said nock spanner from elsewhere in the room monks small voice spoke up how did they get you and whyd you run off from us at that old ranch oh that nock spanner made a disgusted noise i saw somebody and followed them at first i wasnt sure it was some one you see i just saw a movement then when i did make sure it was some one skulking it was too late to turn back and get you i wish i had they grabbed me a little later ham said from close by i am getting very tired of this nock spanner asked you all tied up like mummies monk growled and handcuffs galore the radio ground out music steadily what do you think theyll do with us nock spanner asked no idea said monk have you learned if my brother is still alive spanner questioned monk hesitated then admitted no the radio stopped jangling music there was a station announcement then a news broadcaster with a staccato manner of speaking took over the microphone our affair of the flaming comets seems to be taking on the complexion of one of the most gigantic criminal rings of all time he said the radio loudspeaker reproducing each word distinctly at least half a dozen crimes of importance can be attributed to the comet gang so far today the largest being the fantastic robbery of bullion from a ship at a new york city pier only a short time ago in addition to this a jewelry concern was rifled in chicago and banks robbed in various other cities in each case it is certain that the robbers were members of what is now being called the comet gang and escaped in the fantastic ball vehicles which scientists admit to be some new type of terrestrial ship capable of traveling at terrific speed and of handling with remarkable facility the radio commentator went on and his broadcast became dryer and dryer as he ran out of concrete information and began generalizing hes been on the air steady pretty near monk grumbled boy am i getting tired of that voice nock spanner said it is evident that we are entangled with a gigantic criminal ring which has perfected this terrestrial ship or whatever you would call it and are using it as a getaway vehicle in the commission of huge crimes the radio in the other room suddenly went silent they cut the speaker into their private transmitterandreceiver hookup when they communicate with each other monk said in a stage whisper listen to what they say theyve sure got an organization shortly afterward the radio in the next room went into operation evidently a call had been picked up on a supplementary receiver and the large speaker cut in for convenience in operation this is wla coming back at my friend in california said the faint speaker voice this is wla in corona long island new york city coming back to california i just got all of the tubes in the box old man your system for doing it worked splendidly all three tubes are thoroughly boxed yes sir i am going to deliver them now so long and seventythrees old man that was all from the radio monk muttered in the darkness im getting able to pick out the general meaning of their code he grumbled take that conflab just now it meant theyve got something done in new york something involving three he left the words hanging silence was thick the ticking of the watch with the luminous dial was audible go ahead say it ham suggested that radio talk might have referred to renny long tom and johnny yeah said monk thats what i was thinking nock spanner snarled aint there any way of getting out of this i wouldnt worry too much monk told him spanner swore joyfully then you have a plan no monk told him but doc here is something of a magician spanner muttered if the police only knew where to look for us why in sam hill didnt we leave a note or something telling what we had learned or what we intended to do monk advised like lots of good ideas that one comes too late time passed it could not have been much more than an hour and a half they heard a cracking noise characteristic to the arrival departure or passage of one of the mysterious aerial globes then there came a voice there was something familiar about the voice it took them a moment to place it then ham gasped incredulously that voice the same one was on the radio from new york not over two hours ago he said sharply no one said anything for a while then they heard the voice of the newcomer again and within a few moments other voices and the tramp of feet these approached scuffling quality indicated men carrying heavy burdens they came inside they bore johnny long tom and renny all of whom were unconscious the trio were deposited in the darkness you birds enjoy yourselves a voice said were going to hold a party later the men departed doc savage heaved up and strained mightily against the handcuffs which held his wrists there was no hope of breaking them it was doubtful if even with his incalculable strength he could have broken one of them for they were very heavy and three manacles held his arms in addition there were many turns of rope it was against this that he struggled and he was loosening it getting a little play into his arms a stirring indicated that either johnny long tom or renny was reviving it was johnnys voice which first broke the silence ill be superamalgamated he mumbled the word was a favorite of johnnys he used it to express disgust despair surprise or any other violent emotion feel all right doc asked the ropes on the bronze mans arms had loosened somewhat enabling him by squirming mightily to reach the row of buttons on the front of his coat he tore one of these off got it between his fingers slipped it down between his manacled ankles and began to work with it johnny mumbled gloomily i feel like a valetudinarian a man who can think of a word like that cant be so bad monk told him doc savage had managed to unscrew one half of the button from the other half a threaded joint permitted this although so skillfully done that no casual examination would have disclosed it he carefully tilted the button and let the stuff in the hollow interior trickle on the handcuff links he did this most painstakingly nock spanner growled hopelessly isnt there some chance for us long tom and renny had both regained their senses now voices anxious they made sure doc and the others were unharmed they noted the luminous dial of nock spanners watch and asked the time he told them holy cow renny boomed we were brought from new york out here to california in not much more than two hours nock spanner demanded desperately didnt you fellows leave some sort of a trail by which the police may find us no renny said doc savage had taken four more buttons off his coat carefully unscrewed them and emptied the contents on the cuff links try as he would he could not reach the others he waited the radio in the next room had not been switched on silence was deep once monk pondered aloud i wonder what happened to that girl and leases moore and quince randweil ham echoed it must have been more than an hour later when voices became audible in one of the adjacent rooms theres nothing more to hold us up a voice said the balls are perfected to the point where they dont leave luminous trails at night as did the first ones we can go and come and no one on earth can stop us monk in the intense darkness of the inner room muttered so thats why there were streaks in the sky at first but none anymore what about the prisoners a voice from outside queried well get rid of them now stunteds voice spoke up saying i tell you jaspers i dont like the idea of shootin down anybody in cold blood aw dont be a sissy he was advised the door had been locked now the fastenings rattled and the panel opened men came in cautiously spraying light from flashes they cast the beams about look one of the men howled suddenly he raced the white funnel of his flashlight stunned profanity came from those with him doc savage was missing from among the prisoners the bronze man was not in the room stunted ran over and howled at monk how long has he been gone i dunno monk said truthfully the man with the queer eyes dashed inside heard what had happened and snapped out a revolver stunted shoved against him heavily use your head stunted snapped with those birds alive doc savage will come fooling around trying to get em loose that way well have a chance at him you have got a brain after all growled the crosseyed man and pocketed his weapon the man went over to the spot where doc savage had been lying he stooped picked up a bit of metal and examined it the thing was a portion of a handcuff link the man touched a finger to it then cried out in sudden pain and wiped the finger frantically on a handkerchief he threw the handkerchief away what is it stunted demanded some powerful chemical of an acid nature the man growled that infernal bronze fellow must have had it hidden somewhere on him and put it on the handcuff chains it weakened them until he could break them stunted mumbled thats a new one on me doc savage could hear the voices rather hear the murmur of them for he was not close enough to distinguish the words he was in the gloom just outside the old ranch house he had been free something like ten minutes but had not left the vicinity for more than one reason it was essential that he free the others and he wanted a look at one of the fantastic ball conveyances there was one of the mysterious vehicles off to the right its rounded hulk was vaguely distinguishable fog was making the night very dark doc eased toward the thing the size of the ball became more impressive as he drew close he touched its smooth surface it felt like glass he moved around it noting the polished nature of the covering probably made thus to reduce friction even then the heat generated must be tremendous he came finally to a door barely large enough for him to wedge through the door operated like a plug the walls were thick almost four feet he judged inside the thing a small electric bulb glowed furnishing illumination enough to get an idea of how the shell of the vehicle was constructed the outer surface some compound resistant to friction and heat no doubt was only a skin and under that was layer after layer of asbestos interlaced with cooling pipes and wires and tubes and mysterious channels having to do with the operation of the contrivance the interior chamber was roughly circular literally a bit of open space completely surrounded by machinery there were devices on the walls even the ceiling remarkable indeed was the fact that the control room seemed to have neither top nor bottom as far as arrangement of the mechanism went there were polished pipes crisscrossing their purpose hard to explain doc examined the machinery the first device he came to was an electrical mechanism for producing tremendous degrees of cold a contrivance utilizing liquid air as its cooling element in place of the more common ammonia this then was what kept the ball cool when in motion the liquid aircooling device was a commercial product in part trademarks of the manufacturer were distinguishable doc read the plate refrigerating inc new york the bronze man passed that up as not being of chief interest how was this device propelled what gave it the fantastic power to rip through space without benefit of propellers or as far as could be seen rocketlike discharges certain it was that the luminous exhaust which some of the balls exuded when in motion was not discharge of a rocket nature as some had at first thought doc savage began going over the largest and most intricate mass of apparatus he had already gathered an infinite respect for the brain which had conceived all this that respect became infinitely greater as he surveyed a set of huge motors which utilized a compressed gas as fuel the things were of fabulous horsepower for their size there were as far as doc knew no others like them in existence the exhaust of the motors explained the streams of sparks which some of the balls left the burned gas came out of the exhaust in the form of flame in this ball the exhaust led through a digester which cooled it without the digester the ball would leave a trail of the stillburning vapor the motors operated compact generators which undoubtedly delivered great voltage wires from the generators led into a metalcovered receptacle which undoubtedly held the secret of the whole incredible propulsion method this was locked doc went to work on the locks he had operated only a moment when he heard voices outside men were approaching well clear out of here before doc savage can come back with help stunteds voice said docs flakegold eyes whipped about interior arrangement of the ball was fabulously compact only a locker device to the left seemed to offer concealment doc lunged for it got the metal door open the place had evidently been intended as a storage place for loot it was empty now but yellowish marks on the rough metal showed where heavy gold bars had reposed no doubt loot from the liner robbery in new york doc closed the door there were slits for ventilation and through these he could look if he were not discovered he waited men clambered up the narrow channel that led through the thick hull the door was evidently heavy for they closed it mechanically then spent some moments with wrenches connecting the pipes from the door to the cooling machine stunted was among them under an arm stunted carried monks pet pig habeas corpus he had muzzled the porker to discourage biting tendencies lets go stunted said profuse and strange experiences had come doc savages way in the past including many that bordered on the incredible the fantastic but this was one which was to stand out always in his memory his great metallic frame seemed to grow suddenly and mysteriously light he lifted an arm instinctively and the effort was incredibly easy and once the arm was up it did not drop back to his side it seemed to possess no weight the effort made him start a little so that he lifted from the floor he hung there in midair it was necessary to push himself back to the floor out in the control room things were happening which would have driven a superstitious person into a frenzy men were walking on the walls the ceiling adjusting the controls and throwing switches the crisscrossing tubes which had seemed so useless before now advertised their use they were hand rails employed in going from one place to another a man ran up one spider fashion body seeming to float in the air then released his grip and floated where he was doc savage moistened his lips he rarely showed excitement but he was animated now here before his eyes he was seeing demonstrated the product of a fantastic scientific discovery a discovery so advanced that even the bronze man for all of his learning was somewhat dazed if he correctly interpreted what he was seeing the creator of this aerial device had discovered how to nullify that type of force generally designated as momentum as well as various forms of attraction gravitational and otherwise no unschooled person could hardly have been more amazed than the bronze man here was inertia gravitational attraction in all or most of its forms completely stifled some incredibly keen brain had penetrated one of the scientific fields probably least known to man modern science in general was not even quite sure what gravity was here was one who had mastered the subject the ball must be in motion the machinery was making a great uproar shouted orders could not be heard the men were communicating by gestures one man in particular watched a bank of electric thermometers which registered the outer temperature of the shell and warned of increasing friction heat generated by their passage through the air this man made a sudden gesture when the needles crept too high and the speed of the ball was evidently slowed other men glued eyes to periscope devices which evidently permitted them to look outside two more worked frantically with radio direction finders evidently keeping track of their position by spotting wellknown broadcasting stations on the earth below it was superscientific travel in its superlative degree and doc savage could only stare and marvel he was getting a vague idea of how the ball was made to move no doubt gravitational force was nullified on top on one side creating in effect a vacuum in the lines of force which sucked the ball along it was a vague theory capable of many refutations according to known scientific data but it was the best solution the bronze man could assemble until such time as he had an opportunity to inspect the power plant itself the ball seemed to be arriving at its destination men made gestures others jerked levers opened switches and turned valves so completely was momentum nullified that even their stop abrupt though it must have been was not apparent the noise of the mechanism ceased doc savage was conscious of an abrupt return of the normal heaviness of his limbs he was conscious of something else too a terrific force which hauled him against the locker door so that the door unfastened as it was fell open and he came crashing out into the control room too late he understood what had occurred the ball had stopped in a different position so that the locker was now on what had become the ceiling with the mechanism turned off he had simply fallen out chapter osage rendezvous stunted saw the bronze man first stunted knowing what would happen when the ball stopped was holding to one of the crisscrossing bars he let out a howl dropped from his perch and lunged for his sawedoff automatic rifle which he had tied to a stanchion with a bit of stout cord the devil himself stunted bawled two other men had gotten the hatch open and were making it fast the opening was now on the side they swung around but were in a bad position to fight doc lunged at stunted the latter was having trouble with the cord that held his rifle he had used a cord too strong for him to break he gave it up retreated and threw a wrench at doc the bronze man dodged it leaped upward and caught the crisscrossing bars he made for the men at the hatch doc was a master at this method of fighting where the others had to move slowly supporting themselves the bronze man whipped about with infinite agility one man at the hatch dropped away the other held his ground maintaining a grip with one hand trying to fend doc off with the other that was a mistake an instant later he slammed heavily down on the metal plates beneath a bronze clublike fist had knocked him senseless from his vantage point under the hatch doc saw that he had a moments respite before any of them would be in a position to use a gun the bronze man was curious about where the ball had landed he decided to look and bobbed his head up what he saw changed his whole plan he had intended to fight overpower the men take the ball fathom its secrets but he could never do that because outside there was a high concrete fence and inside that four other balls and something near two score of men if the bronze man escaped it would be a miracle a bullet smacked the rim of the hatch as he vaulted out stunted had gotten his rifle loose and fired it the pig habeas squealed shrilly doc poised on the hatch edge hanging by his fingers there were men below many of them it was too dark for them to make out details however doc savage exerted all of his powers of voice imitation and sent out a sharp excited shout somethings gone wrong he yelled this thing may blow up get away run it was stunteds voice which he imitated and the shout held an edge of terror and warning which sent those below surging back doc dropped down the ruse would give him not more than a second or two less than that it developed for stunteds real voice swore out from inside the ball advising his fellows of the deception doc ran for the wall it was high too high for him to leap but it had been poured in a rough plank form the planks stepped in toward the top for a narrowing effect it could be climbed the bronze man leaped caught hold climbed slipped then gained the top just as a spotlight caught him and guns began crashing he went over safely the other side he discovered was camouflaged with brush and transplanted vines he carried some of the stuff with him as he went down then he ran it was infinitely dark he kept hands out before his face in case he should run into something behind they were organizing a pursuit party then to the left a feminine voice called over here whoever you are it was the girl lanca jaxon doc savage found her a moment later we had better leave here he told her oh its their big bronze trouble she sounded relieved you are supposed to be dead according to whom doc asked leases moore and quince randweil she replied listen to that uproar were going to have some trouble the shooting from inside the concrete compound had lost its confused note a great many hand searchlights had appeared men were assembling outside the enclosure doc found the girls arm and they began to work through the undergrowth timber here was thick many of the trees large fallen logs made travel difficult three of the balls just arrived said the girl i guess you were in one of them where are your men prisoners doc said i suspect they are in the other balls how did you get away she asked doc told her very briefly making it sound rather simple and finishing his recital with a question what are you doing here leases moore and quince randweil let me out of their ball she replied they were afraid i would make trouble at the wrong time where do they hook into this the girl laughed harshly without humor they were slated for suckers doc was ahead now his superior agility and keener senses making for faster progress even at their best they could hardly hope to distance those behind the man who invented the balls got leases moore and quince randweil to finance him said the girl resuming their idea was to do what they are doing organize a gang and use the speedy balls for getaway vehicles in the commission of big robberies but leases moore and randweil were greedy they demanded too big a cut the gang grabbed them and held them they were prisoners when you found them and you doc prompted brush through which they traveled made swishing noises there seemed to be no night birds evidently these had been frightened away by the arrival of the balls theyve been holding me out here for six months the girl snapped i own the land around here theyre using it and theyve ordered all of the materials with which to build those balls in my name the idea being that i was the goat in case the law found out where the construction work had been done she gasped as a bough whipped her its too bad i didnt know who your two men monk and ham were when i tried to escape in that car yesterday she said we might have gotten away as it was i ruined their break a bullet whistled through the branches making sharp ugly sounds and the shot noise itself followed thumping and echoing from the surrounding hills this is the most deserted place in oklahoma the girl murmured nobody will hear that shooting the girl was breathing heavily now she had fallen before but she was falling more often now and more heavily she was slower getting up i havent slept for days she said i guess im tuckered out doc savage picked her up found what felt like a large tree and moved out until by jumping he located a branch with the grip of only one hand and still carrying the girl he swung up he mounted with surprising speed take it easy lanca jaxon said uneasily this stuff might do on a circus trapeze but i dont care for it here we will wait here doc told her quietly if they miss us excellent if not well try something else the bronze man waited listening with his free hand he tested the dryness of the bark on the tree then he sniffed the air it seemed that there had been a rain recently that meant they had left footprints the rapidity and sureness with which their pursuers approached indicated they were following a trail theyll come right to this tree the girl breathed let me have your shoes doc requested she began now what doc whipped the shoes off her feet without more argument carrying them he dropped downward and expended some moments locating the exact limb which he had seized from the ground in starting his climb from there he went on he used the girls shoes one in each hand to make tracks beside his own footprints light and time for a finished job was lacking he did the best haste permitted men with searchlights and guns came up rapidly they drew near the tree which held the girl just before they reached it doc grasped a dry limb and deliberately broke it the cracking noise rattled through the timber theyre ahead stunted roared and the gang charged past the tree which held lanca jaxon without dreaming of her close presence doc found another tree and climbed it he took a chance on the spreading boughs interlacing with other trees they did he went on reflected glow from the pursuing lights occasionally dashed palely among the treetops using that illumination doc picked the spreading limb of another tree and with a tremendous swing through space reached it a professional gymnast would have been proud of that feat shortly the gang came upon the spot where doc had gone aloft they wasted much time probing the treetops then spread out slowly searching fruitlessly but by now doc was safely away the pursuers were persistent it required fifteen minutes of hunting to disgust them and then all did not favor giving up aw well wait for daylight advised the voice of the man with the uneasy eyes they turned back aware that they might have left spies behind doc savage was more than ordinarily cautious in returning to lanca jaxon so silent was he that she gasped out sharply when he dropped to the limb beside her theyve given up she breathed when they passed under me i thought sure i did not get to ask you the most important question of all doc told her who is the individual behind all of this the inventor of the balls i dont know for sure she said you have an idea that man with the shifting eyes she said i have overheard things if he is the big chief not all of the gang know it what did you overhear that led you to that idea doc asked the man with the crossing eyes was arranging with some of the others about murdering the one they call stunted she said hes to be killed whenever they have a chance to make it look like you did it so theyre going to kill stunted doc murmured a moment later the bronze man was gone into the darkness doc savage traveled swiftly overtaking the party which was returning slowly toward the camouflaged compound which held the four weird ball craft and the workshops where they had been manufactured the men were traveling without haste all of them seemed to be tired they walked around logs rather than over them and their conversation was gloomy this is sure a swell kettle of fish stunted said gloomily right when were set for a cleanup quit grousing snapped the man with the queer eyes stunted stopped he put out his jaw his sawedoff automatic rifle shifted slightly under his arm so youre still tryin to push me around he gritted the other snapped pipe down you sawedoff runt stunted had ordinarily seemed a cheerful soul inclined to keep control of his emotions even when aggravated to the point of desiring to shoot someone but now he seemed changed he glared the gun moved under his arm his hand dropped back to the trigger the other men saw the signs they sprang forward growling angrily and got between stunted and the man with the uneasy eyes cut it out you two one ordered youre going to ride each other until one of you winds up picking lead out of himself stunted glaring said nothing shortly afterward he permitted himself to be urged on ahead some of the group accompanied him others remained behind with the shiftyeyed man these dropped well to the rear and there was something deliberate about their behavior we got a chance to talk now one muttered them guys ahead wont hear us whatre you gonna do about this bird stunted ill get him gritted the man with the roving eyes but i gotta be careful did you talk to the chief about disposing of stunted a man asked i did the others eyes crossed and uncrossed evilly in the flashlight glare and what do you think what the chief said that if anything queer happened to stunted hed croak me gritted the conspirator thats one for the book uhhuh the crosseyed man turned his flash off its kinda queer stunted seems plumb worthless to me him and his sawedoff rifles blah they were silent a while listening evidently to make sure no one was near then they dropped their voices a little and began to discuss something which was obviously of greater importance you found out for sure who the big chief is a man asked the one with the restless eyes cursed no he wears that mask all of the time you know that rubber hood of a business there was a meaningful pause our plan still goes eh one growled sure the uneasyeyed man swore again we croak this head guy we do it in a quiet way see then we just tell the boys that im really the guy who invented the balls and they wont know the difference ill get the chiefs cut you gents get yours swell said one when soon as we can they went on walking rapidly now as if their tiredness was gone overtaking the others doc savage clung to them like their own shadows he had been close during the conference and what he had heard was interesting refuting as it did the girls conviction that the man with the peculiar eyes was the actual mastermind they drew near the compound a shrill anxious challenge tipped out who is it us said the man with the uneasy eyes retune that capacity alarm to compensate for our arrival doc savage heard that and moved even closer to the others in the darkness one of the delicate capacitybalance alarms was in operation here it seemed and by adding or subtracting capacity at the controls the operator managed to maintain a balance which would show the arrival of even a single man in the vicinity docs plan was to get close enough to the other that his own presence would be allowed for he seemed to succeed the men filed through an opening in the high compound wall doc did not follow them that was too risky the bronze man tackled the high wall and covered by the noise of the others arrival managed to surmount it he lowered himself slowly down the other side utilizing the indentations left in the concrete by the original plank forms chapter plans sinister there was some faint light inside the compound men who had been working had moved over to the entrance a gatelike affair flanked on one side by a building and on the other by a round tank evidently they were interested in how the search had come out and being informed on that point they scattered and busied themselves making the balls secure doc savage glided back through the shadows reached one of the balls and got under it undiscovered he was interested in getting inside in examining the mechanism a stepladder evidently led up to the hatch he climbed it being careful that the ladder did not squeak at the top he explored with his fingers but felt only the smooth rounded obsidian chillness of the hull the hatch was there its outlines barely traceable but it was fastened and there seemed to be no lock visible feet scuffed the hard earth doc dropped from the ladder scrambled behind the ball and crouched there men were approaching stunted led them the short mans chest was out and he looked pleased with himself he came to the ball and climbed the ladder flashlights were turned on him from a pocket stunted took what was unmistakably ordinary copper wires a telegraph key and a battery hooked in series he touched the wires to two portions of the ball hull where there were evidently contacts held them there then covering the key with his coat so no one could see just what combination he tapped out he manipulated the key the hatch was evidently operated by some electrical combination for it opened stunted clambered inside replacing his unique battery key inside his clothing he came out a moment later with a box larger than a suitcase he handled this with great care he passed it to those below watch it he snapped this is the heart of the invention take that away and there aint nobody can figure out how these balls work he descended the ladder closed the hatch which locked itself then visited the other balls and from each removed a similar case of mechanism whats the idea of taking these out he was asked dont we always do it stunted demanded supposin that doc savage would get inside one of them balls thatd be a swell howdydo well put these pieces of apparatus where we can watch em every minute very gently they carried the boxes to the large building beside the gate all lights in the compound were now extinguished by way of precaution against being sighted by some nocturnal plane they seemed surprisingly careless in the matter of a guard too evidently placing full dependence in the capacity alarm doc savage was not foolhardy enough to try to get into the building by the door he moved to the right felt along the rough concrete wall and found an open window an instant later he was inside in the murk a generator made shrill hum over to the left something hot glowed doc studied it and decided it was a forge with a banked fire directly ahead ranging along the side of the interior was a partition perforated with doors and some of these apertures were lighted the men were toward the front doc approached them there was enough machinery to hide him big drill presses lathe beds and other metalworking devices little expense had been spared in equipping the shop for the manufacture of the ball conveyances stunted was saying loudly everybody stay here and everybody stay awake you can sleep later whats up some one asked him the chief is coming stunted said he told me to tell all of you that he wanted you on hand when he got here hes gonna outline our next job and its to be bigger than anything weve pulled before since when did you become the chiefs mouthpiece demanded the man with the shifting eyes stunted grinned does it hurt he asked he was sworn at some one evidently an admirer of stunted laughed the man with the uncontrollable eyes got off by himself and mumbled doc savage eased closer he was seeking his five aides and spanner a moment later he saw them all except nock spanner monk and ham were tied together probably because one of the gang had overheard them squabbling and had mistaken their vocal hate as genuine renny was by himself trying to work his big fists through handcuff links long tom and johnny were barely discernible all five prisoners were in the room with the gang possibly twenty of the latter were present every one armed if doc savage had any impulse to charge in and attempt a rescue he suppressed it carefully he took chances but never suicidal ones he moved back from the door as the lean man with the restless eyes came out of the lighted room accompanied by two others they lighted cigarettes then strolled off stick around stunted called well be in the radio room one of the trio growled doc savage noted the direction they were taking toward the monotonous hum of the generator he put on speed himself cutting in ahead of them reaching the door of the room where the generator ran he sought the corner by the door and got down behind what was evidently a spare motorgenerator unit the man with peculiar eyes came in he cast a flash beam about theyre all with stunted one of the pair with him grunted watch the doors the crosseyed man went to the radio apparatus and turned on a light with a green shade the radio was very modern the man seemed to know a great deal about it for he adjusted knobs and watched meters intently then picked up a microphone the other two were at the door no one coming they advised their leaders eyes crossed and uncrossed and he spoke into the microphone saying hello hello hello three times very rapidly with pauses between as if it were a signal out of the loudspeaker came a lisping hissing voice how are things coming the voice made things sound like thingsh slow said the man with the roving eyes but well get the big shot tonight hes due here before long stunted just said the lisping voice came over the radio again doc knew it he could not be mistaken the speaker was quince randweil who must be cruising the skies somewhere near by in the stolen ball leases and me just loaded a few hundred quarts of nitro said quince randweil whats the idea demanded the man at the radio if it comes to that we can blow that dump down there off the map imparted randweil heres what well do if everything else fails you and the guys working with you clear out and leave the others before you go turn this radio transmitter on and leave it turned on i dont get this said the man with the roving orbs well use a direction finder on the radio said randweil thatll guide us to you then well use this nitro thatll clean up the gang and wipe out their chief but itll mess up the balls the other objected weve got one said randweil shortly thats enough we can duplicate it if we have to ok agreed the man at the radio he laid down the microphone switched off the apparatus laughed once and walked out followed by his two companions doc savage gave them time to join the others he had plenty to think about to keep him from being impatient these men were not conspiring alone as it had at first seemed but were associated with leases moore and quince randweil moore and randweil in turn were proving more canny than hitherto doc savage left the radio room he did not go too near the door beyond which the gang awaited the room which held the prisoners the bronze man stationed himself to the side of the gate against the tank the tank was large and smelled as if it held gasoline possibly fuel for engines that ran the machine tools the night had quieted down remarkably and the cries of nocturnal birds had resumed there came a faint scraping from the gate a voice it was the man with the peculiar eyes demanded who is it me said another voice shortly the chief there was a short scuffling sound a blow ugly but not loud followed by a cry a wispy hideous thing that never really got started doc savage whipped from his cover took half a dozen steps then halted sane reason had told him he was late by the gate a man laughed the sound was strained some one lighted a cigarette a man put his head out of the workshop door and yelled was that the chief hell no said a man at the gate cut out the smoking said the workshop voice might be seen from the air sure sure the head withdrew into the workshop a moment later doc savage heard three men coming from the gate toward the tank they were infinitely furtive and walked as if burdened doc retreated slowly before them and as they came around behind the tank one displayed a flash beam cautiously it was the crosseyed man and his two conspirators and they carried the limp form of a fourth the latter wore a long topcoat and a dark suit seen in the flashlight glow the limp individuals face was covered by a grotesque mask of flexible rubber it could be seen plainly that the mask was padded so as to alter the apparent contour of the wearers features its the big shot the brains the flashlight wielder grunted lets have a look at that kisser of his they yanked off the rubber mask then they stared they looked as if they were about to fall over one dropped the flashlight the uncovered face was that of the girl lanca jaxon chapter death rode the sky the crosseyed man didnt hear doc savage coming didnt dream of his near presence probably never did know exactly what happened his two companions knew it helped them little for there was not time to do anything about it they heard a jarring thump and awakened from their surprise to see their chief collapsing under a tower of bronze then went for their guns they carried the weapons in the open in lowslung holsters and oldtime western badmen could not have gone for them in more accepted style one gun barely left its holster the other stayed in the leather the two struggled a bit madly their tongues ran out and their faces purpled even if they were not being choked nothing they did loosened the clutch on the backs of their necks a grip of awful fingers which kneaded about as if searching for something down close to the spinal cords after a while the pair went limp doc dropped them he yanked the topcoat off the girl the topcoat was big loosely made and doc was just able to get into it he picked up the mask the rubber was of good quality and it stretched he got it down over his metallic features he had some difficulty with the eyeholes the girl was limp when he picked her up but there was life in her she had been struck over the head probably a man came out of the tool house he was not excited i heard something else he said was it the chief this time doc savage stumbled toward him with the girl quick yelled the bronze man doc savage is in here the other jumped as if a firecracker had gone off under his feet he hit the ground with a gun in either hand running the fellow had nerve whered he go he bawled doc savage was not using his normal voice but a shrill nondescript tone which might easily be mistaken for the unknown leader he did not risk speaking now but wheeled and leveled an arm toward the gate more men came out of the workshop their wild exodus somehow remindful of the comic movies wherein a lion is discovered in a filled room they saw doc savage and since the bronze man was crouching to shorten his apparent stature they mistook him for the mysterious leader whom they were awaiting docs leveled arm sent them toward the gate whered you get the girl one man yelled she was with savage doc said and that was no lie doc savage looked into the room which held the prisoners there were two men on guard both pressing close to the one window watching the pursuit conducted by their fellows the two were lax at the moment whereas a bit later they would have been alert but the moment was sufficient doc put the girl down rushed them they saw him just as he descended upon them it was too late during the brief struggle as the bronze man accomplished the by no means easy feat of holding a man with each hand and making them senseless simultaneously monk began to thrash about on the floor and the pig habeas corpus came out of a corner where he had been secreted monk and his pet had recognized doc when the two men were unconscious doc lowered them he leaped to the prisoners and began working on their bindings he loosened their legs first wrists would have to wait for they might need to move fast monk got the gag out of his mouth he was only handcuffed at the wrists and hence could move his fingers what happened he gulped help me loosen the others doc rapped renny ankles loosened heaved erect what do you think he boomed what do you think about that nock spanner monk growled aw you cant hardly blame spanner they promised spanner that if hed tell them what all we had learned about them theyd turn him loose renny growled so he told them we hadnt learned much of anything and they did turn him loose back there in california before they brought us here in them infernal balls spanner wanted to save his neck monk defended you cant blame him that runt stunted made the deal with spanner i think stunted didnt want any more killing than was necessary i think he got spanner turned loose ham got up and wrenched his gag out then snapped ive been wondering if that nock spanner couldnt really be the chief of the ring doc savage made no comment on that a circumstance which caused monk to look suddenly suspicious where did they put the apparatus that is the heart of those balls doc asked theyve got a big iron safe in the next room monk explained locked em up in there doc savage left the prisoners to free each other and lunged into the adjoining room he found the safe it was big modern and the lock was evidently similar to the electrical devices on the balls for there was no knob visible the bronze man began to work at the door seeking a method of opening it it was a baffling problem he had no special tools the vault was as burglarproof as science could devise doc backed away and went into the workshop searching for a cutting torch there was almost certain to be one around eventually he did locate one but the tanks were disconnected and he had to assemble them and the torch he had selected did not function properly he was working madly when two shots ripped out noisily and a man shouted doc lunged to the door three men had returned through the gate and discovered that something was wrong an instant later rennys big hand appeared in a window it held a gun evidently one taken from the guards the gun went off four times so swiftly that it required a sharp ear to distinguish the reports one man fell down then dragged himself out of sight shot through the legs the other two bounded back through the gate there was shouting from the woods it did not come from very far away the searchers were coming back against such a force almost forty men doc and his group had little chance the bronze man ran out into the open well have to get out he shouted renny bounded into view still carrying the revolver long tom johnny and ham followed supporting between them the girl lanca jaxon who seemed to be regaining consciousness monk did not appear monk doc called there was a pause and no answer monk doc made it louder the homely chemist popped through the door he had his pig he gulped if i only had a minute or two more come on doc clipped they did not run for the gate the men outside would make exit by that route difficult they moved back to the rear and climbed the wall doc assisted in getting the girl up and over she was able to help herself a little five revolver bullets made the final stages of their climb exciting going down the other side they carried much of the camouflaging along renny produced a flashlight found it on the floor he boomed its sure gonna help it will doc agreed it may save our lives they used the flashlight as little as possible at first not wishing to draw more bullets the girl dropped alongside of doc savage she fell down frequently her voice was hoarse i made a bad move she said i got tired of waiting in that tree i was worried about you doc advised you should have stayed there i know it she took a header got up at once i climbed out of the tree and went toward the compound and pretty soon i heard some one he used a flashlight and i saw it was their chief wearing his rubber mask so i got a stick and clubbed him kill him doc asked she gasped out no he was still alive i felt of his pulse doc queried then what i put on his regalia she said swiftly i thought maybe i could get in and help you or free some of the other prisoners before they got wise i can make my voice hoarse listen she made her voice hoarse and it sounded almost masculine as she continued i got as far as the gate and was coming in when some one must have struck me down i saw that part doc told her she sobbed once ive made an awful mess she wailed ive got men killed and everything got men killed two of them she elaborated the first was one of the gang whom i bribed to send a message to willard spanner you see i knew willard spanner and knew that he was a friend of yours and i wanted you on this affair and thought id get you through spanner so thats how it was doc helped her pursuit was overtaking them they must have spied on the man who took the message made him tell about it then killed him she said then they killed spanner first seizing him in san francisco then taking him to new york and making him get a letter telling the whole story which he had mailed to his new york address in case anything happened to him he marked the envelope so it would be turned over to the police if he did not appear to claim it i heard them talking about it monk howled were gonna have to travel faster than this doc savage stopped very suddenly listen they halted i heard it too monk muttered chapter holocaust it was a faint moan of a noise and seemed to come out of the sky far above persisting only a moment before it died away doc savage listening made a faint exotic trilling noise a sound which he made under profound emotion surprise sometimes puzzlement it was an indistinct tone eerie in quality and covering a large range then with a snapping leap he was at monks side whats wrong monk gulped what were you doing back there when we called you doc rapped why uh i was in their radio room the imperative tone of docs demand had taken the homely chemists breath why doc barked monk let his pet pig fall something was up uh i thought id send out an sos he explained somebody might have picked it up and notified the cops we need all of the help we can get i intended to tell you about it did you leave the transmitter on doc queried with a studied calm sure why it was a long moment before the bronze man answered and during that interim it was noticeable that sounds of pursuit had ceased indicating those behind had also heard the moaning sound in the night sky and correctly interpreted its meaning leases moore and quince ranweil had an arrangement with their friends in the gang to drop nitroglycerine on that enclosure if the radio was turned on and left on doc said monk said cheerfully well that oughta wipe the place off the map good riddance id call it but doc savage seemed to have other ideas he listened shouting of their pursuers was faintly audible leases moore and quince randweil are above us in their ball a man yelled wed better get back to the pen sure barked another well rig our own balls itll be daylight soon then well chase this doc savage in the balls and use gas on him we may be able to spot moore and randweil too doc savage left his own group suddenly and went toward the pursuers he moved swiftly sounds told him they were going back you fellows he called sharply they stopped silence held them then one shouted suspiciously whatcha want this is doc savage doc told them we know that voice one barked whatcha want doc hesitated he had faced this problem before whether to guarantee his own safety and the safety of his friends by permitting others to die but it was against his policy a policy to which he adhered rigidly to see human life taken needlessly if there was any possible method of avoidance he reached the decision he had known he would reach do not go back to that compound he shouted leases moore and quince randweil may drop nitroglycerine on it stunned silence fell over the darkened timberland the quiet held for some moments and toward the end of the interval doc was not looking at the spot where the foes stood in the darkness but at the sky above the compound the compound was lighted brilliantly now illumination having been switched on during the excitement the lights were very bright they threw a glow upward some distance a gleaming object was outlined above the compound it poised there bobbing up and down a little its presence marked only by the vague rays from below the ball vehicle of leases moore and quince randweil its a trick a man shrilled the bronze guy is trying to keep us away from the pen they ran back and although doc savage called out again it had no effect doc fell silent and stood there unpleasant expectancy gripping him renny came up splashing a flashlight beam didnt do much good he said dryly doc made no reply the others of his party gathered nearer the ball was still above the compound swaying up and down as if the control device was not perfected to a point where the thing could be held absolutely stationary then a rifle smacked others followed a machine gun made rapid stuttering sounds from within the compound they were shooting at the ball striving to drive it away the gunfire became a continuous volley suddenly a round spot of light appeared on the undersurface of the ball a port had been opened below the ball dropping swiftly came something small and black it fell lazily in size it was like a beer keg another of the articles appeared then a third a fourth a fifth all five of them were in the air when the first hit the ground the world turned blasting white as the nitroglycerine struck and the earth heaved and tumbled and trees fell over bushes lost their leaves the wind of the explosion reaching as far as where doc and his party stood upset them and the ground shaking tossed them about as if in an earthquake from the compound there was no screaming possibly no man lived to scream after the blasts flame and debris were in the sky and the ball fantastic thing that it was had backed up into dark nothingness until it was now invisible debris falling back made a great roar it added more fuel to the flaming compound and slavering copious quantities of black smoke kited upward the gasoline tank lanca jaxon said hoarsely after that no one said anything the balls in the compound had been shattered they could not see them the smoke spread mushrooming and the light of the flames jumped above it and played like scariet goblins on a black toadstool doc said we had better see if we can do something but before they could move there came a sobbing noise from above as of a gigantic bat in swift passage and the ball of moore and randweil was suddenly above them theyre gonna attack us monk shouted they were standing in an open space plainly lighted by the flames they had been seen doc sent out an arm and started them for the cover of the nearest tree the girl was past running swiftly and he carried her as soon as they were under the foliage such of it as still stuck to the trees the bronze man urged them sharply to the left fallen limbs were thick on the ground get down under this stuff and crawl doc directed they did that a minute passed two then the earth heaved under them a fabulous crash set their eardrums ringing and there was white fire in the air as if lightning had struck debris fell all about making sounds like fast running animals nitro renny howled theyre trying to finish us the branches under which they lay had shifted a little and doc savage looking up could see the ball the open hatch like a round evil red eye it bobbed toward them something hideous and incredible in its movement they could hear the noise of machinery inside a man had head and shoulders over the hatch opening he was a plump rounded man quince randweil no doubt and he was looking down they could see him waving an arm behind his back he had seen them was directing leases moore at the controls to bring the ball directly over them then quince randweil drew back for a moment and when he showed himself again he was gripping a container of nitro as large as a beer keg he had some difficulty holding it and leaning down made ready to drop it monk said in a dry shrill voice ham if were gonna die now i want to apologize for riding you ham mumbled you big ape doc savage rapped renny that revolver you are a revolver went bang beside them there was a louder report overhead so infinitely much louder that it beggared description doc savage who was looking directly at the ball and randweil knew the nitro randweil held had exploded one instant the ball was there the next it was not and the bronze mans eyes held only pain and knowledge of terrible danger from exploding parts of the aerial vehicle he did not know how long afterward it was that some one spoke it was rennys voice i didnt intend to do that renny said he was shifting his revolver from one hand to another as if it were hot he looked at doc what else could i do he mumbled nothing doc told him i didnt intend to hit the nitro renny groaned honest i didnt i figured on shooting past that randweil bird and scaring him into dropping the stuff before he reached us but no man can shoot straight in this light you didnt do bad said monk who was inclined to be the bloodthirsty member of docs crowd no man can shoot straight in light like this renny grumbled again i shouldve let doc do it you were asking for the gun just as i shot werent you doc yes said the bronze man come on let us see what we can do at the compound they could do nothing that was evident when they came close the blast of the nitro had been terrific and had shattered not only the four balls but the workshop and the tank as well one missile must have landed directly on the workshop possibly more for hardly a trace of the place remained other than twisted steel and blasted woodwork even the compound walls had been broken into surprisingly small pieces doc savage gave particular attention to where the safe had been hope that it had survived faded for he distinguished one side and back standing where the flames were hottest the floor of the workshop had been low and the ruptured gasoline tank had poured it contents into the depression there was no hope that the hearts of the weird aerial balls the mechanism which was the secret of their amazing performance had survived holy cow renny said gloomily it looks like nobody is ever gonna know how them things worked doc savage nodded slowly he would investigate of course but it was doubtful if the secret could be solved some new theory must have been stumbled upon by accident but he would work on it work hard for the next few months he resolved monk took his eyes from the flames and looked pained as if something bad just stung him we should have thought of it before he exploded what renny boomed lanca jaxon here knocked out the mastermind the bird who invented these balls monk explained she said she left him unconscious maybe hes around somewhere if so we can grab him and make him tell no use lanca jaxon said hoarsely why monk eyed her puzzled i left him close to the compound wall she said he was killed with the rest i am sure of it monk returned to gloomy depths but almost at once started again seized by another thought who did you knock senseless he asked stunted said the girl that runty fellow stunted renny made some comment that had to do with the way things had come out his voice was a throaty roaring as doc savage listened to it it might have been a forewarning of what the future held but renny not having been gifted with the ability to fathom what the future held went on with his roaringvoiced conversation the end
