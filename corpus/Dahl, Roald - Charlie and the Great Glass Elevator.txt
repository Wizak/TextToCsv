roald dahl charlie and the great glass elevator mr wonka goes too far the last time we saw charlie he was riding high above his home town in the great glass lift only a short while before mr wonka had told him that the whole gigantic fabulous chocolate factory was his and now our small friend was returning in triumph with his entire family to take over the passengers in the lift were charlie bucket our hero mr willy wonka chocolatemaker extraordinary mr and mrs bucket charlies father and mother grandpa joe and grandma josephine mr buckets father and mother grandpa george and grandma georgina mrs buckets father and mother grandma josephine grandma georgina and grandpa george were still in bed the bed having been pushed on board just before takeoff grandpa joe as you remember had got out of bed to go around the chocolate factory with charlie the great glass lift was a thousand feet up and cruising nicely the sky was brilliant blue everybody on board was wildly excited at the thought of going to live in the famous chocolate factory grandpa joe was singing charlie was jumping up and down mr and mrs bucket were smiling for the first time in years and the three old ones in the bed were grinning at one another with pink toothless gums what in the world keeps this crazy thing up in the air croaked grandma josephine madam said mr wonka it is not a lift any longer lifts only go up and down inside buildings but now that it has taken us up into the sky it has become an elevator it is the great glass elevator and what keeps it up said grandma josephine skyhooks said mr wonka you amaze me said grandma josephine dear lady said mr wonka you are new to the scene when you have been with us a little longer nothing will amaze you these skyhooks said grandma josephine i assume one end is

whispered to the two old women please he said dont spoil everything mr wonka is a fantastic man hes my friend i love him charlies right whispered grandpa joe joining the group now you be quiet josie and dont make trouble we must hurry said mr wonka we have so much time and so little to do no wait cross that out reverse it thank you now back to the factory he cried clapping his hands once and springing two feet in the air with two feet back we fly to the factory but we must go up before we can come down we must go higher and higher what did i tell you said grandma josephine the mans cracked be quiet josie said grandpa joe mr wonka knows exactly what hes doing hes cracked as a crab said grandma georgina we must go higher said mr wonka we must go tremendously high hold on to your stomach he pressed a brown button the elevator shuddered and then with a fearful whooshing noise it shot vertically upward like a rocket everybody clutched hold of everybody else and as the great machine gathered speed the rushing whooshing sound of the wind outside grew louder and louder and shriller and shriller until it became a piercing shriek and you had to yell to make yourself heard stop yelled grandma josephine joe you make him stop i want to get off save us yelled grandma georgina go down yelled grandpa george no no mr wonka yelled back weve got to go up but why they all shouted at once why up and not down because the higher we are when we start coming down the faster well all be going when we hit said mr wonka weve got to be going at an absolutely sizzling speed when we hit when we hit what they cried the factory of course answered mr wonka you must be whackers said grandma josephine well all be pulpified well be scrambled like eggs said grandma georgina that said mr wonka is a chance we shall have to take youre joking said grandma josephine tell us youre joking madam said mr wonka i never joke oh my dears cried grandma georgina well be lixivated every one of us more than likely said mr wonka grandma josephine screamed and disappeared under the bedclothes grandma georgina clutched grandpa george so tight he changed shape mr and mrs bucket stood hugging each other speechless with fright only charlie and grandpa joe kept moderately cool they had travelled a long way with mr wonka and had grown accustomed to surprises but as the great elevator continued to streak upward further and further away from the earth even charlie began to feel a trifle nervous mr wonka he yelled above the noise what i dont understand is why weve got to come down at such a terrific speed my dear boy mr wonka answered if we dont come down at a terrific speed well never burst our way back in through the roof of the factory its not easy to punch a hole in a roof as strong as that but theres a hole in it already said charlie we made it when we came out then we shall make another said mr wonka two holes are better than one any mouse will tell you that higher and higher rushed the great glass elevator until soon they could see the countries and oceans of the earth spread out below them like a map it was all very beautiful but when you are standing on a glass floor looking down it gives you a nasty feeling even charlie was beginning to feel frightened now he hung on tightly to grandpa joes hand and looked up anxiously into the old mans face im scared grandpa he said grandpa joe put an arm around charlies shoulders and held him close so am i charlie he said mr wonka charlie shouted dont you think this is about high enough very nearly mr wonka answered but not quite dont talk to me now please dont disturb me i must watch things very carefully at this stage splitsecond timing my boy thats what its got to be you see this green button i must press it at exactly the right instant if im just half a second late then well go too high what happens if we go too high asked grandpa joe do please stop talking and let me concentrate mr wonka said at that precise moment grandma josephine poked her head out from under the sheets and peered over the edge of the bed through the glass floor she saw the entire continent of north america nearly two hundred miles below and looking no bigger than a bar of chocolate someones got to stop this maniac she screeched and she shot out a wrinkled old hand and grabbed mr wonka by the coattails and yanked him backwards on to the bed no no cried mr wonka struggling to free himself let me go i have things to see to dont disturb the pilot you madman shrieked grandma josephine shaking mr wonka so fast his head became a blur you get us back home this instant let me go cried mr wonka ive got to press that button or well go too high let me go let me go but grandma josephine hung on charlie shouted mr wonka press the button the green one quick quick quick charlie leaped across the elevator and banged his thumb down on the green button but as he did so the elevator gave a mighty groan and rolled over on to its side and the rushing whooshing noise stopped altogether there was an eerie silence too late cried mr wonka oh my goodness me were cooked as he spoke the bed with the three old ones in it and mr wonka on top lifted gently off the floor and hung suspended in midair charlie and grandpa joe and mr and mrs bucket also floated upwards so that in a twink the entire company as well as the bed were floating around like balloons inside the great glass elevator now look what youve done said mr wonka floating about what happened grandma josephine called out she had floated clear of the bed and was hovering near the ceiling in her nightshirt did we go too far charlie asked too far cried mr wonka of course we went too far you know where weve gone my friends weve gone into orbit they gaped they gasped they stared they were too flabbergasted to speak we are now rushing around the earth at seventeen thousand miles an hour mr wonka said how does that grab you im choking gasped grandma georgina i cant breathe of course you cant said mr wonka theres no air up here he sort of swam across under the ceiling to a button marked oxygen he pressed it youll be all right now he said breathe away this is the queerest feeling charlie said swimming about i feel like a bubble its great said grandpa joe it feels as though i dont weigh anything at all you dont said mr wonka none of us weighs anything not even one ounce what piffle said grandma georgina i weigh one hundred and thirtyseven pounds exactly not now you dont said mr wonka you are completely weightless the three old ones grandpa george grandma georgina and grandma josephine were trying frantically to get back into bed but without success the bed was floating about in midair they of course were also floating and every time they got above the bed and tried to lie down they simply floated up out of it charlie and grandpa joe were hooting with laughter whats so funny said grandma josephine weve got you out of bed at last said grandpa joe shut up and help us back snapped grandma josephine forget it said mr wonka youll never stay down just keep floating around and be happy the mans a madman cried grandma georgina watch out i say or hell lixivate the lot of us space hotel usa mr wonkas great glass elevator was not the only thing orbiting the earth at that particular time two days before the united states of america had successfully launched its first space hotel a gigantic sausageshaped capsule no less than one thousand feet long it was called space hotel usa and it was the marvel of the space age it had inside it a tenniscourt a swimming pool a gymnasium a childrens playroom and five hundred luxury bedrooms each with a private bath it was fully airconditioned it was also equipped with a gravitymaking machine so that you didnt float about inside it you walked normally this extraordinary object was now speeding round and round the earth at a height of miles guests were to be taken up and down by a taxiservice of small capsules blasting off from cape kennedy every hour on the hour mondays to fridays but as yet there was nobody on board at all not even an astronaut the reason for this was that no one had really believed such an enormous thing would ever get off the ground without blowing up but the launching had been a great success and now that the space hotel was safely in orbit there was a tremendous hustle and bustle to send up the first guests it was rumoured that the president of the united states himself was going to be among the first to stay in the hotel and of course there was a mad rush by all sorts of other people across the world to book rooms several kings and queens had cabled the white house in washington for reservations and a texas millionaire called orson cart who was about to marry a hollywood starlet called helen highwater was offering one hundred thousand dollars a day for the honeymoon suite but you cannot send guests to an hotel unless there are lots of people there to look after them and that explains why there was yet another interesting object orbiting the earth at that moment this was the large transport capsule containing the entire staff for space hotel usa there were managers assistant managers deskclerks waitresses bellboys chambermaids pastry chefs and hall porters the capsule they were travelling in was manned by the three famous astronauts shuckworth shanks and showler all of them handsome clever and brave in exactly one hour said shuckworth speaking to the passengers over the loudspeaker we shall link up with space hotel usa your happy home for the next ten years and any moment now if you look straight ahead you should catch your first glimpse of this magnificent spaceship ahha i see something there that must be it folks theres definitely something up there ahead of us shuckworth shanks and showler as well as the managers assistant managers deskclerks waitresses bellboys chambermaids pastry chefs and hall porters all stared excitedly through the windows shuckworth fired a couple of small rockets to make the capsule go faster and they began to catch up very quickly hey yelled showler that isnt our space hotel holy rats cried shanks what in the name of nebuchadnezzar is it quick give me the telescope yelled shuckworth with one hand he focused the telescope and with the other he flipped the switch connecting him to ground control hello houston he cried into the mike theres something crazy going on up here theres a thing orbiting ahead of us and its not like any spaceship ive ever seen thats for sure describe it at once ordered ground control in houston its its all made of glass and its kind of square and its got lots of people inside it theyre all floating about like fish in a tank how many astronauts on board none said shuckworth they cant possibly be astronauts what makes you say that because at least three of them are in nightshirts dont be a fool shuckworth snapped ground control pull yourself together man this is serious i swear it cried poor shuckworth theres three of them in nightshirts two old women and one old man i can see them clearly i can even see their faces jeepers theyre older than moses theyre about ninety years old youve gone mad shuckworth shouted ground control youre fired give me shanks shanks speaking said shanks now listen here houston theres these three old birds in nightshirts floating around in this crazy glass box and theres a funny little guy with a pointed beard wearing a black tophat and a plumcoloured velvet tailcoat and bottlegreen trousers stop screamed ground control thats not all said shanks theres also a little boy about ten years old thats no boy you idiot shouted ground control thats an astronaut in disguise its a midget astronaut dressed up as a little boy those old people are astronauts too theyre all in disguise but who are they cried shanks how the heck would i know said ground control are they heading for our space hotel thats exactly where they are heading cried shanks i can see the space hotel now about a mile ahead theyre going to blow it up yelled ground control this is desperate this is suddenly his voice was cut off and shanks heard another quite different voice in his earphones it was deep and rasping ill take charge of this said the deep rasping voice are you there shanks of course im here said shanks but how dare you butt in keep your big nose out of this who are you anyway this is the president of the united states said the voice and this is the wizard of oz said shanks who are you kidding cut the piffle shanks snapped the president this is a national emergency good grief said shanks turning to shuckworth and showler it really is the president its president gilligrass himself well hello there mr president sir how are you today how many people are there in that glass capsule rasped the president eight said shanks all floating floating were outside the pull of gravity up here mr president everything floats wed be floating ourselves if we werent strapped down didnt you know that of course i knew it said the president what else can you tell me about that glass capsule theres a bed in it said shanks a big double bed and thats floating too a bed barked the president whoever heard of a bed in a spacecraft i swear its a bed said shanks you must be loopy shanks declared the president youre dotty as a doughnut let me talk to showler showler here mr president said showler taking the mike from shanks it is a great honour to talk to you mr president sir oh shut up said the president just tell me what you see its a bed all right mr president i can see it through my telescope its got sheets and blankets and a mattress thats not a bed you drivelling thickwit yelled the president cant you understand its a trick its a bomb its a bomb disguised as a bed theyre going to blow up our magnificent space hotel whos they mr president sir said showler dont talk so much and let me think said the president there were a few moments of silence showler waited tensely so did shanks and shuckworth so did the managers and assistant managers and deskclerks and waitresses and bellboys and chambermaids and pastry chefs and hall porters and down in the huge control room at houston one hundred controllers sat motionless in front of their dials and monitors waiting to see what orders the president would give next to the astronauts ive just thought of something said the president dont you have a television camera up there on the front of your spacecraft showler sure do mr president then switch it on you nit and let all of us down here get a look at this object i never thought of that said showler no wonder youre the president here goes he reached out and switched on the tv camera in the nose of the spacecraft and at that moment five hundred million people all over the world who had been listening in on their radios rushed to their television sets on their screens they saw exactly what shuckworth and shanks and showler were seeing a weird glass box in splendid orbit around the earth and inside the box seen not too clearly but seen none the less were seven grownups and one small boy and a big double bed all floating three of the grownups were barelegged and wearing nightshirts and far off in the distance beyond the glass box the tv watchers could see the enormous glistening silvery shape of space hotel usa but it was the sinister glass box itself that everyone was staring at and the cargo of sinister creatures inside it eight astronauts so tough and strong they didnt even bother to wear spacesuits who were these people and where did they come from and what in heavens name was that big evillooking thing disguised as a double bed the president had said it was a bomb and he was probably right but what were they going to do with it all across america and canada and russia and japan and india and china and africa and england and france and germany and everywhere else in the world a kind of panic began to take hold of the television watchers keep well clear of them showler ordered the president over the radio link sure will mr president showler answered i sure will the linkup inside the great glass elevator there was also a good deal of excitement charlie and mr wonka and all the others could see clearly the huge silvery shape of space hotel usa about a mile ahead of them and behind them was the smaller transport capsule the great glass elevator was in the middle and of course everybody even grandma josephine knew very well what was going on they even knew that the three astronauts in charge of the transport capsule were called shuckworth shanks and showler the whole world knew about these things newspapers and television had been shouting about almost nothing else for the past six months operation space hotel was the event of the century what a load of luck cried mr wonka weve landed ourselves slap in the middle of the biggest space operation of all time weve landed ourselves in the middle of a nasty mess said grandma josephine turn back at once no grandma said charlie weve got to watch it now we must see the transport capsule linking up with the space hotel mr wonka floated right up close to charlie lets beat them to it charlie he whispered lets get there first and go aboard the space hotel ourselves charlie gaped then he gulped then he said softly its impossible youve got to have all sorts of special gadgets to link up with another spacecraft mr wonka my elevator could link up with a crocodile if it had to said mr wonka just leave it to me my boy grandpa joe cried charlie did you hear that were going to link up with the space hotel and go on board yippeeeeee shouted grandpa joe what a brilliant thought sir what a staggering idea he grabbed mr wonkas hand and started shaking it like a thermometer be quiet you balmy old bat said grandma josephine were in a hot enough stew already i want to go home me too said grandma georgina what if they come after us said mr bucket speaking for the first time what if they capture us said mrs bucket what if they shoot us said grandma georgina what if my beard were made of green spinach cried mr wonka bunkum and tummyrot youll never get anywhere if you go about whatiffing like that would columbus have discovered america if hed said what if i sink on the way over what if i meet pirates what if i never come back he wouldnt even have started we want no whatiffers around here right charlie off we go then but wait this is a very tricky manoeuvre and im going to need help there are three lots of buttons we have to press all in different parts of the elevator i shall take those two over there the white and the black mr wonka made a funny blowing noise with his mouth and glided effortlessly like a huge bird across the elevator to the white and black buttons and there he hovered grandpa joe sir kindly station yourself beside that silver button there yes thats the one and you charlie go up and stay floating beside that little golden button near the ceiling i must tell you that each of these buttons fires booster rockets from different places outside the elevator thats how we change direction grandpa joes rockets turn us to starboard to the right charlies turn us to port to the left mine make us go higher or lower or faster or slower all ready no wait cried charlie who was floating exactly midway between the floor and the ceiling how do i get up i cant get up to the ceiling he was thrashing his arms and legs violently like a drowning swimmer but getting nowhere my dear boy said mr wonka you cant swim in this stuff it isnt water you know its air and very thin air at that theres nothing to push against so you have to use jet propulsion watch me first you take a deep breath then you make a small round hole with your mouth and you blow as hard as you can if you blow downward you jetpropel yourself up if you blow to the left you shoot off to the right and so on you manoeuvre yourself like a spacecraft but using your mouth as a booster rocket suddenly everyone began practising this business of flying about and the whole elevator was filled with the blowings and snortings of the passengers grandma georgina in her red flannel nightgown with two skinny bare legs sticking out of the bottom was trumpeting and spitting like a rhinoceros and flying from one side of the elevator to the other shouting out of my way out of my way and crashing into poor mr and mrs bucket with terrible speed grandpa george and grandma josephine were doing the same and well may you wonder what the millions of people down on earth were thinking as they watched these crazy happenings on their television screens you must realize they couldnt see things very clearly the great glass elevator was only about the size of a grapefruit on their screens and the people inside slightly blurred through the glass were no bigger than the pips of the grapefruit even so the watchers below could see them buzzing about wildly like insects in a glass box what in the world are they doing shouted the president of the united states staring at the screen looks like some kind of a wardance mr president answered astronaut showler over the radio you mean theyre red indians said the president i didnt say that sir oh yes you did showler oh no i didnt mr president silence said the president youre muddling me up back in the elevator mr wonka was saying please please do stop flying about keep still everybody so we can get on with the docking you miserable old mackerel said grandma georgina sailing past him just when we start having a bit of fun you want to stop it look at me everybody shouted grandma josephine im flying im a golden eagle i can fly faster than any of you cried grandpa george whizzing round and round his nightgown billowing out behind him like the tail of a parrot grandpa george cried charlie do please calm down if we dont hurry those astronauts will get there before us dont you want to see inside the space hotel any of you out of my way shouted grandma georgina blowing herself back and forth im a jumbo jet youre a balmy old bat said mr wonka in the end the old people grew tired and out of breath and everyone settled quietly into a floating position all set charlie and grandpa joe sir said mr wonka all set mr wonka charlie answered hovering near the ceiling ill give the orders said mr wonka im the pilot dont fire your rockets until i tell you and dont forget who is who charlie youre port grandpa joe youre starboard mr wonka pressed one of his own two buttons and immediately booster rockets began firing underneath the great glass elevator the elevator leaped forward but swerved violently to the right hard aport yelled mr wonka charlie pressed his button his rockets fired the elevator swung back into line steady as you go cried mr wonka starboard ten degrees steady steady keep her there soon they were hovering directly underneath the tail of the enormous silvery space hotel you see that little square door with the bolts on it said mr wonka thats the docking entrance it wont be long now port a fraction steady starboard a bit good good easy does it were nearly there to charlie it felt rather as though he were in a tiny rowboat underneath the stern of the biggest ship in the world the space hotel towered over them it was enormous i cant wait thought charlie to get inside and see what its like the president half a mile back shuckworth shanks and showler were keeping the television camera aimed all the time at the glass elevator and across the world millions and millions of people were clustered around their tv screens watching tensely the drama being acted out two hundred and forty miles above the earth in his study in the white house sat lancelot r gilligrass president of the united states of america the most powerful man on earth in this moment of crisis all his most important advisers had been summoned urgently to his presence and there they all were now following closely on the giant television screen every move made by this dangerouslooking glass capsule and its eight desperatelooking astronauts the entire cabinet was present the chief of the army was there together with four other generals there was the chief of the navy and the chief of the air force and a swordswallower from afghanistan who was the presidents best friend there was the presidents chief financial adviser who was standing in the middle of the room trying to balance the budget on top of his head but it kept falling off standing nearest of all to the president was the vicepresident a huge lady of eightynine with a whiskery chin she had been the presidents nurse when he was a baby and her name was miss tibbs miss tibbs was the power behind the throne she stood no nonsense from anyone some people said she was as strict with the president now as when he was a little boy she was the terror of the white house and even the head of the secret service broke into a sweat when summoned to her presence only the president was allowed to call her nanny the presidents famous cat mrs taubsypuss was also in the room there was absolute silence now in the presidential study all eyes were riveted on the tv screen as the small glass object with its boosterrockets firing slid smoothly up behind the giant space hotel theyre going to link up shouted the president theyre going on board our space hotel theyre going to blow it up cried the chief of the army lets blow them up first crash bang wallop bangbangbangbang the chief of the army was wearing so many medalribbons they covered the entire front of his tunic on both sides and spread down on to his trousers as well come on mr p he said lets have some really superduper explosions silence you silly boy said miss tibbs and the chief of the army slunk into a corner listen said the president the point is this who are they and where

whos there said the chief spy courteney courteney who courteney one yet said the president there was a brief silence the president asked you a question said miss tibbs in an icy voice have you courteney one yet no maam not yet said the chief spy beginning to twitch well heres your chance snarled miss tibbs quite right said the president tell me immediately who those people are in that glass capsule ahha said the chief spy twirling his false moustache that is a very difficult question you mean you dont know i mean i do know mr president at least i think i know listen we have just launched the finest hotel in the world right right and who is so madly jealous of this wonderful hotel of ours that he wants to blow it up miss tibbs said the president wrong said the chief spy try again well said the president thinking deeply in that case could it not perhaps be some other hotel owner who is envious of our lovely hotel brilliant cried the chief spy go on sir youre getting warm its mr savoy said the president warmer and warmer mr president mr ritz youre hot sir youre boiling hot go on ive got it cried the president its mr hilton well done sir said the chief spy are you sure its him not sure but its certainly a warm possibility mr president after all mr hiltons got hotels in just about every country in the world but he hasnt got one in space and we have he must be madder than a maggot by gum well soon fix this snapped the president grabbing one of the eleven telephones on his desk hello he said into the phone hello hello hello wheres the operator he jiggled furiously on the little thing you jiggle when you want the operator operator where are you they wont answer you now said miss tibbs theyre all watching television well this onell answer said the president snatching up a bright red telephone this was the hot line direct to the premier of soviet russia in moscow it was always open and only used in terrible emergencies its just as likely to be the russians as mr hilton the president went on dont you agree nanny its bound to be the russians said miss tibbs premier yugetoff speaking said the voice from moscow whats on your mind mr president knockknock said the president whos there said the soviet premier warren warren who warren peace by leo tolstoy said the president now see here yugetoff you get those astronauts of yours off that space hotel of ours this instant otherwise im afraid were going to have to show you just where you get off yugetoff those astronauts are not russians mr president hes lying said miss tibbs youre lying said the president not lying sir said premier yugetoff have you looked closely at those astronauts in the glass box i myself cannot see them too clearly on my tv screen but one of them the little one with the pointed beard and the top hat has a distinctly chinese look about him in fact he reminds me very much of my friend the prime minister of china great garbage cried the president slamming down the red phone and picking up a porcelain one the porcelain phone went direct to the head of the chinese republic in peking hello hello hello said the president wings fish and vegetable store in shanghai said a small distant voice mr wing speaking nanny cried the president banging down the phone i thought this was a direct line to the premier it is said miss tibbs try again the president picked up the receiver hello he yelled mr wong speaking said a voice at the other end mister who screamed the president mr wong assistant stationmaster chungking and if you asking about ten oclock tlain ten oclock tlain no lunning today boiler burst the president threw the phone across the room at the postmaster general it hit him in the stomach whats the matter with this thing shouted the president it is very difficult

chuondat hooray said the chief of the army lets blow everyone up bangbang bangbang silence barked miss tibbs ive done it cried the chief financial adviser look at me everybody ive balanced the budget and indeed he had he stood proudly in the middle of the room with the enormous billion dollar budget balanced beautifully on the top of his bald head everyone clapped then suddenly the voice of astronaut shuckworth cut in urgently on the radio loudspeaker in the presidents study theyve linked up and gone on board shouted shuckworth and theyve taken in the bed i mean the bomb the president sucked in his breath sharply he also sucked in a big fly that happened to be passing at the time he choked miss tibbs thumped him on the back he swallowed the fly and felt better but he was very angry he seized pencil and paper and began to draw a picture as he drew he kept muttering i wont have flies in my office i wont put up with them his advisers waited eagerly they knew that the great man was about to give the world yet another of his brilliant inventions the last had been the gilligrass lefthanded corkscrew which had been hailed by lefthanders across the nation as one of the greatest blessings of the century there you are said the president holding up the paper this is the gilligrass patent flytrap they all crowded round to look the fly climbs up the ladder on the left said the president he walks along the plank he stops he sniffs he smells something good he peers over the edge and sees the sugarlump ahha he cries sugar he is just about to climb down the string to reach it when he sees the basin of water below hoho he says its a trap they want me to fall in so he walks on thinking what a clever fly he is but as you see i have left out one of the rungs in the ladder he goes down by so he falls and breaks his neck tremendous mr president they all exclaimed fantastic a stroke of genius i wish to order one hundred thousand for the army immediately said the chief of the army thank you said the president making a careful note of the order i repeat said the frantic voice of shuckworth over the loudspeaker theyve gone on board and taken the bomb with them stay well clear of them shuckworth ordered the president theres no point in getting your boys blown up as well and now all over the world the millions of watchers waited more tensely than ever in front of their television sets the picture on their screens in vivid colour showed the sinister little glass box securely linked up to the underbelly of the gigantic space hotel it looked like some tiny baby animal clinging to its mother and when the camera zoomed closer it was clear for all to see that the glass box was completely empty all eight of the desperadoes had climbed into the space hotel and they had taken their bomb with them men from mars there was no floating inside the space hotel the gravitymaking machine saw to that so once the docking had been triumphantly achieved mr wonka charlie grandpa joe and mr and mrs bucket were able to walk out of the great glass elevator into the lobby of the hotel as for grandpa george grandma georgina and grandma josephine none of them had had their feet on the ground for over twenty years and they certainly werent going to change their habits now so when the floating stopped they all three plopped right back into bed again and insisted that the bed with them in it be pushed into the space hotel charlie gazed around the huge lobby on the floor there was a thick green carpet twenty tremendous chandeliers hung shimmering from the ceiling the walls were covered with valuable pictures and there were big soft armchairs all over the place at the far end of the room there were the doors of five lifts the group stared in silence at all this luxury nobody dared speak mr wonka had warned them that every word they uttered would be picked up by space control in houston so they had better be careful a faint humming noise came from somewhere below the floor but that only made the silence more spooky charlie took hold of grandpa joes hand and held it tight he wasnt sure he liked this very much they had broken into the greatest machine ever built by man the property of the united states government and if they were discovered and captured as they surely must be in the end what would happen to them then jail for life yes or something worse mr wonka was writing on a little pad he held up the pad it said anybody hungry the three old ones in the bed began waving their arms and nodding and opening and shutting their mouths mr wonka turned the paper over on the other side it said the kitchens of this hotel are loaded with luscious food lobsters steaks icecream we shall have a feast to end all feasts suddenly a tremendous booming voice came out of a loudspeaker hidden somewhere in the room attention boomed the voice and charlie jumped so did grandpa joe everybody jumped even mr wonka attention the eight foreign astronauts this is space control in houston texas usa you are trespassing on american property you are ordered to identify yourselves immediately speak now ssshhh whispered mr wonka finger to lips there followed a few seconds of awful silence nobody moved except mr wonka who kept saying ssshhh ssshhh who are you boomed the voice from houston and the whole world heard it i repeat who are you shouted the urgent angry voice and five hundred million people crouched in front of their television sets waiting for an answer to come from the mysterious strangers inside the space hotel the television was not able to show a picture of these mysterious strangers there was no camera in there to record the scene only the words came through the tv watchers saw nothing but the outside of the giant hotel in orbit photographed of course by shuckworth shanks and showler who were following behind for half a minute the world waited for a reply but no reply came speak boomed the voice getting louder and louder and ending in a fearful frightening shout that rattled charlies eardrums speak speak speak grandma georgina shot under the sheet grandma josephine stuck her fingers in her ears grandpa george buried his head in the pillow mr and mrs bucket both petrified were once again in each others arms charlie was clutching grandpa joes hand and the two of them were staring at mr wonka and begging him with their eyes to do something mr wonka stood very still and although his face looked calm you can be quite sure his clever inventive brain was spinning like a dynamo this is your last chance boomed the voice we are asking you once more who are you reply immediately if you do not reply we shall be forced to regard you as dangerous enemies we shall then press the emergency freezer switch and the temperature in the space hotel will drop to minus one hundred degrees centigrade all of you will be instantly deep frozen you have fifteen seconds to speak after that you will turn into icicles one two three grandpa whispered charlie as the counting continued we must do something we must quick six said the voice seven eight nine mr wonka had not moved he was still gazing straight ahead still quite cool perfectly expressionless charlie and grandpa joe were staring at him in horror then all at once they saw the tiny twinkling wrinkles of a smile appear around the corners of his eyes he sprang to life he spun round on his toes skipped a few paces across the floor and then in a frenzied unearthly sort of scream he cried fimbo feez the loudspeaker stopped counting there was silence all over the world there was silence charlies eyes were riveted on mr wonka he was going to speak again he was taking a deep breath bungo buni he screamed he put so much force into his voice that the effort lifted him right up on to the tips of his toes bungo buni dafu duni yubee luni again the silence the next time mr wonka spoke the words came out so fast and sharp and loud they were like bullets from a machinegun zoonkzoonkzoonkzoonkzoonk he barked the noise echoed around and around the lobby of the space hotel it echoed around the world mr wonka now turned and faced the far end of the lobby where the loudspeaker voice had come from he walked a few paces forward as a man would perhaps who wanted a more intimate conversation with his audience and this time the tone was much quieter the words came more slowly but there was a touch of steel in every syllable kirasuku malibuku weebee wize un yubee kuku alipenda kakamenda pantz forldun ifno suspenda fuikika kanderika weebe stronga yubee weeka popokota borumoka veri riski yu provoka katikati moons un stars fanfanisha venus mars mr wonka paused dramatically for a few seconds then he took an enormous deep breath and in a wild and fearsome voice he yelled out kitimbibi zoonk fumboleezi zoonk gugumiza zoonk fumikaka zoonk anapolala zoonk zoonk zoonk the effect of all this on the world below was electric in the control room in houston in the white house in washington in palaces and city buildings and mountain shacks from america to china to peru the five hundred million people who heard that wild and fearsome voice yelling out these strange and mystic words all shivered with fear before their television sets everybody began turning to everybody else and saying who are they what language was that where do they come from in the presidents study in the white house vicepresident tibbs the members of the cabinet the chiefs of the army and the navy and the air force the swordswallower from afghanistan the chief financial adviser and mrs taubsypuss the cat all stood tense and rigid they were very much afraid but the president himself kept a cool head and a clear brain nanny he cried oh nanny what on earth do we do now ill get you a nice warm glass of milk said miss tibbs i hate the stuff said the president please dont make me drink it summon the chief interpreter said miss tibbs summon the chief interpreter said the president where is he right here mr president said the chief interpreter what language was that creature spouting up there in the space hotel be quick was it eskimo not eskimo mr president ha then it

you dont know this one it is not a language of this world mr president nonsense man barked miss tibbs i understood some of it myself these people miss vicepresident maam have obviously tried to learn just a few of our easier words but the rest of it is a language that has never been heard before on this earth screaming scorpions cried the president you mean to tell me they could be coming from from from somewhere else precisely mr president like where said the president who knows said the chief interpreter but did you not notice mr president how they used the words venus and mars of course i noticed it said the president but whats that got to do with it ahha i see what youre driving at good gracious me men from mars and venus said the chief interpreter that said the president could make

chief of the army shut up snapped miss tibbs youre fired hooray said all the other generals well done miss vicepresident maam miss tibbs said weve got to treat these fellows gently the one who spoke just now sounded extremely cross weve got to be polite to them butter them up make them happy the last thing we want is to be invaded by men from mars youve got to talk to them mr president tell houston we want another direct radio link with the space hotel and hurry invitation to the white house the president of the united states will now address you announced the loudspeaker voice in the lobby of the space hotel grandma georginas head peeped cautiously out from under the sheets grandma josephine took her fingers out of her ears and grandpa george lifted his face out of the pillow you mean hes actually going to speak to us whispered charlie ssshhh said mr wonka listen dear friends said the wellknown presidential voice over the loudspeaker dear dear friends welcome to space hotel usa greetings to the brave astronauts from mars and venus mars and venus whispered charlie you mean he thinks were from ssshhssshhssshh said mr wonka he was doubled up with silent laughter shaking all over and hopping from one foot to the other you have come a long way the president continued so why dont you come just a tiny bit farther and pay us a visit down here on our humble little earth i invite all eight of you to stay with me here in washington as my honoured guests you could land that wonderful glass airmachine of yours on the lawn in back of the white house we shall have the red carpet out and ready i do hope you know enough of our language to understand me i shall wait most anxiously for your reply there was a click and the president went off the air what a fantastic thing whispered grandpa joe the white house charlie were invited to the white house as honoured guests charlie caught hold of grandpa joes hands and the two of them started dancing round and round the lobby of the hotel mr wonka still shaking with laughter went and sat down on the bed and signalled everyone to gather round close so they could whisper without being heard by the hidden microphones theyre scared to death he whispered they wont bother us any more now so lets have that feast we were talking about and afterwards we can explore the hotel arent we going to the white house whispered grandma josephine i want to go to the white house and stay with the president my dear old dotty dumpling said mr wonka you look as much like a man from mars as a bedbug theyd know at once theyd been fooled wed be arrested before we could say how dyou do mr wonka was right there could be no question of accepting the presidents invitation and they all knew it but weve got to say something to him charlie whispered he must be sitting down there in the white house this very minute waiting for an answer make an excuse said mr bucket tell him were otherwise engaged said mrs bucket you are right whispered mr wonka it is rude to ignore an invitation he stood up and walked a few paces from the group for a moment or two he remained quite still gathering his thoughts then once again charlie saw those tiny twinkling smiling wrinkles around the corners of the eyes and when he began to speak his voice this time was like the voice of a giant deep and devilish very loud and very slow in the quelchy quaggy sogmire in the mashy mideous harshland at the witchy hour of gloomness all the grobes come oozing home you can hear them softly slimeing glissing hissing oer the slubber all those oily boily bodies oozing onward in the gloam so start to run oh skid and daddle through the slubber slush and sossel skip jump hop and try to skaddle all the grobes are on the roam in his study two hundred and forty thousand miles below the president turned white as the white house jumping jackrabbits he cried i think theyre after us oh please let me blow them up said the exchief of the army silence said miss tibbs go stand in the corner in the lobby of the space hotel mr wonka had merely paused in order to think up another verse and he was just about to start off again when a frightful piercing scream stopped him cold the screamer was grandma josephine she was sitting up in bed and pointing with a shaking finger at the lifts at the far end of the lobby she screamed a second time still pointing and all eyes turned toward the lifts the door of the one on the left was sliding slowly open and the watchers could clearly see that there was something something thick something brown something not exactly brown but greenishbrown something with slimy skin and large eyes squatting inside the lift something nasty in the lifts grandma josephine had stopped screaming now she had gone rigid with shock the rest of the group by the bed including charlie and grandpa joe had become as still as stone they dared not move they dared hardly breathe and mr wonka who had swung quickly around to look when the first scream came was as dumbstruck as the rest he stood motionless gaping at the thing in the lift his mouth slightly open his eyes stretched wide as two wheels what he saw what they all saw was this it looked more than anything like an enormous egg balanced on its pointed end it was as tall as a big boy and wider than the fattest man the greenishbrown skin had a shiny wettish appearance and there were wrinkles in it about threequarters of the way up in the widest part there were two large round eyes as big as teacups the eyes were white but each had a brilliant red pupil in the centre the red pupils were resting on mr wonka but now they began travelling slowly across to charlie and grandpa joe and the others by the bed settling upon them and gazing at them with a cold malevolent stare the eyes were everything there were no other features no nose or mouth or ears but the entire eggshaped body was itself moving very very slightly pulsing and bulging gently here and there as though the skin were filled with some thick fluid at this point charlie suddenly noticed that the next lift was coming down the indicator numbers above the door were flashing l there was a slight pause the door slid open and there inside the second lift was another enormous slimy wrinkled greenishbrown egg with eyes now the numbers were flashing above all three of the remaining lifts down they came down down down and soon at precisely the same time they reached the lobby floor and the doors slid open five open doors now one creature in each five in all and five pairs of eyes with brilliant red centres all watching mr wonka and watching charlie and grandpa joe and the others there were slight differences in size and shape between the five but all had the same greenishbrown wrinkled skin and the skin was rippling and pulsing for about thirty seconds nothing happened nobody stirred nobody made a sound the silence was terrible so was the suspense charlie was so frightened he felt himself shrinking inside his skin then he saw the creature in the lefthand lift suddenly starting to change shape its body was slowly becoming longer and longer and thinner and thinner going up and up towards the roof of the lift not straight up but curving a little to the left making a snakelike curve that was curiously graceful up to the left and then curling over the top to the right and coming down again in a halfcircle and then the bottom end began to grow out as well like a tail creeping along the floor creeping along the floor to the left until at last the creature which had originally looked like a huge egg now looked like a long curvy serpent standing up on its tail then the one in the next lift began stretching itself in much the same way and what a weird and oozy thing it was to watch it was twisting itself into a shape that was a bit different from the first balancing itself almost but not quite on the tip of its tail then the three remaining creatures began stretching themselves all at the same time each one elongating itself slowly upward growing taller and taller thinner and thinner curving and twisting stretching and stretching curling and bending balancing either on the tail or the head or both and turned sideways now so that only one eye was visible when they had all stopped stretching and bending this was how they finished up scram shouted mr wonka get out quick people have never moved faster than grandpa joe and charlie and mr and mrs bucket at that moment they all got behind the bed and started pushing like crazy mr wonka ran in front of them shouting scram scram scram and in ten seconds flat all of them were out of the lobby and back inside the great glass elevator frantically mr wonka began undoing bolts and pressing buttons the door of the great glass elevator snapped shut and the whole thing leaped sideways they were away and of course all of them including the three old ones in the bed floated up again into the air the vermicious knids oh my goodness me gasped mr wonka oh my sainted pants oh my painted ants oh my crawling cats i hope never to see anything like that again he floated over to the white button and pressed it the boosterrockets fired the elevator shot forward at such a speed that soon the space hotel was out of sight far behind but who were those awful creatures charlie asked you mean you didnt know cried mr wonka well its a good thing you didnt if youd had even the faintest idea of what horrors you were up against the marrow would have run out of your bones youd have been fossilized with fear and glued to the ground then theyd have got you youd have been a cooked cucumber youd have been rasped into a thousand tiny bits grated like cheese and flocculated alive theyd have made necklaces from your knucklebones and bracelets from your teeth because those creatures my dear ignorant boy are the most brutal vindictive venomous murderous beasts in the entire universe here mr wonka paused and ran the tip of a pink tongue all the way around his lips vermicious knids he cried thats what they were he sounded the k knids like that i thought they were grobes charlie said those oozywoozy grobes you were telling the president about oh no i just made those up to scare the white house mr wonka answered but there is nothing made up about vermicious knids believe you me they live as everybody knows on the planet vermes which is eighteen thousand four hundred and twentyseven million miles away and they are very very clever brutes indeed the vermicious knid can turn itself into any shape it wants it has no bones its body is really one huge muscle enormously strong but very stretchy and squishy like a mixture of rubber and putty with steel wires inside normally it is eggshaped but it can just as easily give itself two legs like a human or four legs like a horse it can become as round as a ball or as long as a kitestring from fifty yards away a fully grown vermicious knid could stretch out its neck and bite your head off without even getting up bite off your head with what said grandma georgina i didnt see any mouth they have other things to bite with said mr wonka darkly such as what said grandma georgina ring off said mr wonka your times up but listen everybody ive just had a funny thought there i was fooling around with the president and pretending we were creatures from some other planet and by golly there actually were creatures from some other planet on board do you think there were many charlie asked more than the five we saw thousands said mr wonka there are five hundred rooms in that space hotel and theres probably a family of them in every room somebodys going to get a nasty shock when they go on board said grandpa joe theyll be eaten like peanuts said mr wonka every one of them you dont really mean that do you mr wonka charlie said of course i mean it said mr wonka these vermicious knids are the terror of the universe they travel through space in great swarms landing on other stars and planets and destroying everything they find there used to be some rather nice creatures living on the moon a long time ago they were called poozas but the vermicious knids ate the lot they did the same on venus and mars and many other planets why havent they come down to our earth and eaten us charlie asked theyve tried to charlie many times but theyve never made it you see all around our earth there is a vast envelope of air and gas and anything hitting that at high speed gets red hot space capsules are made of special heatproof metal and when they make a reentry their speeds are reduced right down to about two thousand miles an hour first by retrorockets and then by something called friction but even so they get badly scorched knids which are not heatproof at all and dont have any retrorockets get sizzled up completely before theyre halfway through have you ever seen a shooting star lots of them charlie said actually theyre not shooting stars at all said mr wonka theyre shooting knids theyre knids trying to enter the earths atmosphere at high speed and going up in flames what rubbish said grandma georgina you wait said mr wonka you may see it happening before the day is done but if theyre so fierce and dangerous charlie said why didnt they eat us up right away in the space hotel why did they waste time twisting their bodies into letters and writing scram because theyre showoffs mr wonka replied theyre tremendously proud of being able to write like that but why say scram when they wanted to catch us and eat us its the only word they know mr wonka said look screamed grandma josephine pointing through the glass over there before he even looked charlie knew exactly what he was going to see so did the others they could tell by the high hysterical note in the old ladys voice and there it was cruising effortlessly alongside them a simply colossal vermicious knid as thick as a whale as long as a lorry with the most brutal vermicious look in its eye it was no more than a dozen yards away eggshaped slimy greenishbrown with one malevolent red eye fixed intently upon the people floating inside the great glass elevator the end has come screamed grandma georgina hell eat us all cried mrs bucket in one gulp said mr bucket were done for charlie said grandpa joe charlie nodded he couldnt speak or make a sound his throat was seized up with fright but this time mr wonka didnt panic he remained perfectly calm well soon get rid of that he said and he pressed six buttons all at once and six boosterrockets went off simultaneously under the elevator the elevator leaped forward like a stung horse faster and faster but the great green greasy knid kept pace alongside it with no trouble at all make it go away yelled grandma georgina i cant stand it looking at me dear lady said mr wonka it cant possibly get in here i dont mind admitting i was a trifle alarmed back there in the space hotel and with good reason but here we have nothing to fear the great glass elevator is shockproof waterproof bombproof bulletproof and knidproof so just relax and enjoy it oh you knid you are vile and vermicious cried mr wonka you are slimy and soggy and squishous but what do we care cause you cant get in here so hop it and dont get ambitious at this point the massive knid outside turned and started cruising away from the elevator there you are cried mr wonka triumphant it heard me its going home but mr wonka was wrong when the creature was about a hundred yards off it stopped hovered for a moment then went smoothly into reverse coming back toward the elevator with its rearend now in front even going backwards its acceleration was unbelievable it was like some monstrous bullet coming at them and it came so fast nobody had time even to cry out crash it struck the glass elevator with the most enormous bang and the whole thing shivered and shook but the glass held and the knid bounced off like a rubber ball what did i tell you shouted mr wonka triumphant were safe as sausages in here hell have a nasty headache after that said grandpa joe its not his head its his bottom said charlie look theres a big bump coming up on the pointed end where he hit its going black and blue and so it was a purple bruisy bump the size of a small car was appearing on the pointed rearend of the giant knid hello you dirty great beast cried mr wonka hello you great knid tell us how do you do youre a rather strange colour today your bottom is purple and lavender blue should it really be looking that way are you not feeling well are you going to faint is it something we cannot discuss it must be a very unpleasant complaint for your backsides as big as a bus let me get you a doctor i know just the man for a knid with a nasty disease hes a butcher by trade which is not a bad plan and he charges quite reasonable fees ah here he is now doc you really are kind to travel so far into space theres your patient the knid with the purple behind do you think its a desperate case great heavens above its no wonder hes pale said the doc with a horrible grin theres a sort of balloon on the end of his tail i must prick it at once with a pin so he got out a thing like an indian spear with feathers all over the top and he lunged and he caught the knid smack in the rear but alas the balloon didnt pop cried the knid what on earth am i going to do with this painful preposterous lump i cant remain standing the whole summer through and i cannot sit down on my rump its a bad case of rearache the medico said and its something i cannot repair if you want to sit down you must sit on your head with your bottom high up in the air gobbled up on the day when all this was happening no factories opened anywhere in the world all offices and schools were closed nobody moved away from the television screens not even for a couple of minutes to get a coke or to feed the baby the tension was unbearable everybody heard the american presidents invitation to the men from mars to visit him in the white house and they heard the weird rhyming reply which sounded rather threatening they also heard a piercing scream and a little later on they heard someone shouting scram scram scram nobody could make head or tail of the shouting they took it to be some kind of martian language but when the eight mysterious astronauts suddenly rushed back into their glass capsule and broke away from the space hotel you could almost hear the great sigh of relief that rose up from the peoples of the earth telegrams and messages poured into the white house congratulating the president upon his brilliant handling of a frightening situation the president himself remained calm and thoughtful he sat at his desk rolling a small piece of wet chewinggum between his finger and thumb he was waiting for the moment when he could flick it at miss tibbs without her seeing him he flicked it and missed miss tibbs but hit the chief of the air force on the tip of his nose do you think the men from mars have accepted my invitation to the white house the president asked of course they have said the foreign secretary it was a brilliant speech sir theyre probably on their way down here right now said miss tibbs go and wash that nasty sticky chewinggum off your fingers quickly they could be here any minute lets have a song first said the president sing another one about me nanny please the nurses song this mighty man of whom i sing the greatest of them all was once a teeny little thing just eighteen inches tall i knew him as a tiny tot i nursed him on my knee i used to sit him on the pot and wait for him to wee i always washed between his toes and cut his little nails i brushed his hair and wiped his nose and weighed him on the scales through happy childhood days he strayed as all nice children should i smacked him when he disobeyed and stopped when he was good it soon began to dawn on me he wasnt very bright because when he was twentythree he couldnt read or write what shall we do his parents sobbed the boy has got the vapours he couldnt even get a job delivering the papers ahha i said this little clot could be a politician nanny he cried oh nanny what a super proposition okay i said lets learn and note the art of politics lets teach you how to miss the boat and how to drop some bricks and how to win the peoples vote and lots of other tricks lets learn to make a speech a day upon the tv screen in which you never never say exactly what you mean and most important by the way is not to let your teeth decay and keep your fingers clean and now that i am eightynine its too late to repent the fault was mine the little swine became the president bravo nanny cried the president clapping his hands hooray shouted the others well done miss vicepresident maam brilliant tremendous my goodness said the president those men from mars will be here any moment what on earth are we going to give them for lunch wheres my chief cook the chief cook was a frenchman he was also a french spy and at this moment he was listening at the keyhole of the presidents study ici monsieur le president he said bursting in chief cook said the president what do men from mars eat for lunch mars bars said the chief cook baked or boiled asked the president oh baked of course monsieur le president you will ruin a mars bar by boiling the voice of astronaut shuckworth cut in over the loudspeaker in the presidents study request permission to link up and go aboard space hotel he said permission granted said the president go right ahead shuckworth its all clear now thanks to me and so the large transport capsule piloted by shuckworth shanks and showler with all the hotel managers and assistant managers and hall porters and pastry chefs and bellboys and waitresses and chambermaids on board moved in smoothly and linked up with the giant space hotel hey there weve lost our television picture called the president im afraid the camera got smashed against the side of the space hotel mr president shuckworth replied the president said a very rude word into the microphone and ten million children across the nation began repeating it gleefully and got smacked by their parents all astronauts and one hundred and fifty hotel staff safely aboard space hotel shuckworth reported over the radio we are now standing in the lobby and what do you think of it all asked the president he knew the whole world was listening in and he wanted shuckworth to say how wonderful it was shuckworth didnt let him down gee mr president its just great he said its unbelievable its so enormous and so its kind of hard to find words to describe it its so truly grand especially the chandeliers and the carpets and all i have the chief hotel manager mr walter w wall beside me now he would like the honour of a word with you sir put him on said the president mr president sir this is walter wall what a sumptuous hotel this is the decorations are superb have you noticed that all the carpets are walltowall mr walter wall said the president i have indeed mr president all the wallpaper is all walltowall too mr walter wall yes sir mr president isnt that something its going to be a real pleasure running a beautiful hotel like this hey whats going on over there somethings coming out of the lifts help suddenly the loudspeaker in the presidents study gave out a series of the most ghastly screams and yells ayeeeee owwwww ayeeeee hellllp hellllllp hellllllllllp what on earths going on said the president shuckworth are you there shuckworth shanks showler mr walter wall where are you all whats happening the screams continued they were so loud the president had to put his fingers in his ears every house in the world that had a television or radio receiver heard those awful screams there were other noises too loud grunts and snortings and crunching sounds then there was silence frantically the president called the space hotel on the radio houston called the space hotel the president called houston houston called the president then both of them called the space hotel again but answer came there none up there in space all was silent something nastys happened said the president its those men from mars said the exchief of the army i told you to let me blow them up silence snapped the president ive got to think the loudspeaker began to crackle hello it said hello hello hello are you receiving me space control in houston the president grabbed the mike on his desk leave this to me houston he shouted president gilligrass here receiving you loud and clear go ahead astronaut shuckworth here mr president back aboard the transport capsule thank heavens what happened shuckworth whos with you were most of us here mr president im glad to say shanks and showler are with me and a whole bunch of other folks i guess we lost maybe a couple of dozen people altogether pastry chefs hall porters that sort of thing it sure was a scramble getting out of that place alive what do you mean you lost two dozen people shouted the president how did you lose them gobbled up replied shuckworth one gulp and that was it i saw a big sixfoottall assistantmanager being swallowed up just like youd swallow a lump of icecream mr president no chewing nothing just down the hatch but who yelled the president who are you talking about who did the swallowing hold it cried shuckworth oh my lord here they all come now theyre coming after us theyre swarming out of the space hotel theyre coming out in swarms youll have to excuse me a moment mr president no time to talk right now transport capsule in trouble attack no while shuckworth shanks and showler were being chased out of the space hotel by the knids mr wonkas great glass elevator was orbiting the earth at tremendous speed mr wonka had all his boosterrockets firing and the elevator was reaching speeds of thirtyfour thousand miles an hour instead of the normal seventeen thousand they were trying you see to get away from that huge angry vermicious knid with the purple behind mr wonka wasnt afraid of it but grandma josephine was petrified every time she looked at it she let out a piercing scream and clapped her hands over her eyes but of course thirtyfour thousand miles an hour is dawdling to a knid healthy young knids think nothing of travelling a million miles between lunch and supper and then another million before breakfast the next day how else could they travel between the planet vermes and other stars mr wonka should have known this and saved his rocketpower but he kept right on going and the giant knid kept right on cruising effortlessly alongside glaring into the elevator with its wicked red eye you people have bruised my backside the knid seemed to be saying and in the end im going to get you for that they had been streaking around the earth like this for about fortyfive minutes when charlie who was floating comfortably beside grandpa joe near the ceiling said suddenly theres something ahead can you see it grandpa straight in front of us i can charlie i can good heavens its the space hotel it cant be grandpa we left it miles behind us long ago ahha said mr wonka weve been going so fast weve gone all the way around the earth and caught up with it again a splendid effort and theres the transport capsule can you see it grandpa its just behind the space hotel theres something else there too charlie if im not mistaken i know what those are screamed grandma josephine theyre vermicious knids turn back at once reverse yelled grandma georgina go the other way dear lady said mr wonka this isnt a car on the motorway when you are in orbit you cannot stop and you cannot go backwards i dont care about that shouted grandma josephine put on the brakes stop backpedal the knidsll get us now lets for heavens sake stop this nonsense once and for all mr wonka said sternly you know very well my elevator is completely knidproof you have nothing to fear they were closer now and they could see the knids pouring out from the tail of the space hotel and swarming like wasps around the transport capsule theyre attacking it cried charlie theyre after the transport capsule it was a fearsome sight the huge green eggshaped knids were grouping themselves into squadrons with about twenty knids to a squadron then each squadron formed itself into a line abreast with one yard between knids then one after another the squadrons began attacking the transport capsule they attacked in reverse with their pointed rearends in front and they came in at a fantastic speed wham one squadron attacked bounced off and wheeled away crash another squadron smashed against the side of the transport capsule get us out of here you madman screamed grandma josephine what are you waiting for theyll be coming after us next yelled grandma georgina for heavens sake man turn back i doubt very much if that capsule of theirs is knidproof said mr wonka then we must help them cried charlie weve got to do something there are a hundred and fifty people inside that thing down on the earth in the white house study the president and his advisers were listening in horror to the voices of the astronauts over the radio theyre coming at us in droves shuckworth was shouting theyre bashing us to bits but who yelled the president you havent even told us whos attacking you these dirty great greenishbrown brutes with red eyes shouted shanks butting in theyre shaped like enormous eggs and theyre coming at us backwards backwards cried the president why backwards because their bottoms are even more pointy than their tops shouted shuckworth look out here comes another lot bang we wont be able to stand this much longer mr president the waitresses are screaming and the chambermaids are all hysterical and the bellboys are being sick and the hall porters are saying their prayers so what shall we do mr president sir what on earth shall we do fire your rockets you idiot and make a reentry shouted the president come back to earth immediately thats impossible cried showler theyve busted our rockets theyve smashed them to smithereens were cooked mr president shouted shanks were done for because even if they dont succeed in destroying the capsule well have to stay up here in orbit for the rest of our lives we cant make a reentry without rockets the president was sweating and the sweat ran all the way down the back of his neck and inside his collar any moment now mr president shanks went on were going to lose contact with you altogether theres another lot coming at us from the left and theyre aiming straight for our radio aerial here they come i dont think well be able to the voice cut the radio went dead shanks cried the president where are you shanks shuckworth shanks showler showlworth shucks shankler shankworth show shuckler why dont you answer me up in the great glass elevator where they had no radio and could hear nothing of these conversations charlie was saying surely their only hope is to make a reentry and dive back to earth quickly yes said mr wonka but in order to reenter the earths atmosphere theyve got to kick themselves out of orbit theyve got to change course and head downwards and to do that they need rockets but their rocket tubes are all dented and bent you can see that from here theyre crippled why cant we tow them down charlie asked mr wonka jumped even though he was floating he somehow jumped he was so excited he shot upwards and hit his head on the ceiling then he spun round three times in the air and cried charlie youve got it thats it well tow them out of orbit to the buttons quick what do we tow them with asked grandpa joe our neckties dont you worry about a little thing like that cried mr wonka my great glass elevator is ready for anything in we go into the breach dear friends into the breach stop him screamed grandma josephine you be quiet josie said grandpa joe theres someone over there needs a helping hand and its our job to give it if youre frightened youd better just close your eyes tight and stick your fingers in your ears the battle of the knids grandpa joe sir shouted mr wonka kindly jet yourself over to the far corner of the elevator there and turn that handle it lowers the rope a ropes no good mr wonka the knids will bite through a rope in one second its a steel rope said mr wonka its made of reinscorched steel if they try to bite through that their teeth will splinter like spillikins to your buttons charlie youve got to help me manoeuvre were going right over the top of the transport capsule and then well try to hook on to it somewhere and get a firm hold like a battleship going into action the great glass elevator with booster rockets firing moved smoothly in over the top of the enormous transport capsule the knids immediately stopped attacking the capsule and went for the elevator squadron after squadron of giant vermicious knids flung themselves furiously against mr wonkas marvellous machine wham crash bang the noise was thunderous and terrible the elevator was tossed about the sky like a leaf and inside it grandma josephine grandma georgina and grandpa george floating in their nightshirts were all yowling and screeching and flapping their arms and calling for help mrs bucket had wrapped her arms around mr bucket and was clasping him so tightly that one of his shirt buttons punctured his skin charlie and mr wonka as cool as two cubes of ice were up near the ceiling working the boosterrocket controls and grandpa joe shouting warcries and throwing curses at the knids was down below turning the handle that unwound the steel rope at the same time he was watching the rope through the glass floor of the elevator starboard a bit charlie shouted grandpa joe were right on top of her now forward a couple of yards mr wonka im trying to get the hook hooked around that stumpy thing sticking out in front there hold it ive got it thats it forward a little now and see if it holds more more the big steel rope tightened it held and now wonder of wonders with her boosterrockets blazing the elevator began to tow the huge transport capsule forward and away full speed ahead shouted grandpa joe shes going to hold shes holding shes holding fine all boosters firing cried mr wonka and the elevator leaped ahead still the rope held mr wonka jetted himself down to grandpa joe and shook him warmly by the hand well done sir he said you did a brilliant job under heavy fire charlie looked back at the transport capsule some thirty yards behind them on the end of the towline it had little windows up front and in the windows he could clearly see the flabbergasted faces of shuckworth shanks and showler charlie waved to them and gave them the thumbsup signal they didnt wave back they simply gaped they couldnt believe what was happening grandpa joe blew himself upward and hovered beside charlie bubbling with excitement charlie my boy he said weve been through a few funny things together lately but never anything like this grandpa where are the knids theyve suddenly vanished everyone looked round the only knid in sight was their old friend with the purple behind still cruising alongside in its usual place still glaring into the elevator just a minute cried grandma josephine whats that i see over there again they looked and this time sure enough away in the distance in the deep blue sky of outer space they saw a massive cloud of vermicious knids wheeling and circling like a fleet of bombers if you think were out of the woods yet youre crazy shouted grandma georgina i fear no knids said mr wonka weve got them beaten now poppyrot and pigwash said grandma josephine any moment now theyll be at us again look at them theyre coming in theyre coming closer this was true the huge fleet of knids had moved in at incredible speed and was now flying level with the great glass elevator a couple of hundred yards away on the righthand side the one with the bump on its rearend was much closer only twenty yards away on the same side its changing shape cried charlie that nearest one whats it going to do its getting longer and longer and indeed it was the mammoth eggshaped body was slowly stretching itself out like chewinggum becoming longer and longer and thinner and thinner until in the end it looked exactly like a long slimygreen serpent as thick as a thick tree and as long as a football pitch at the front end were the eyes big and white with red centres at the back a kind of tapering tail and at the very end of the tail was the enormous round swollen bump it had got when it crashed against the glass the people floating inside the elevator watched and waited then they saw the long ropelike knid turning and coming straight but quite slowly toward the great glass elevator now it began actually wrapping its ropy body around the elevator itself once around it went then twice around and very horrifying it was to be inside and to see the soft green body squishing against the outside of the glass no more than a few inches away its tying us up like a parcel yelled grandma josephine bunkum said mr wonka its going to crush us in its coils wailed grandma georgina never said mr wonka charlie glanced quickly back at the transport capsule the sheetwhite faces of shuckworth shanks and showler were pressed against the glass of the little windows terrorstruck stupefied stunned their mouths open their expressions frozen like fish fingers once again charlie gave them the thumbsup signal showler acknowledged it with a sickly grin but that was all oh oh oh screamed grandma josephine get that beastly squishy thing away from here having curled its body twice around the elevator the knid now proceeded to tie a knot with its two ends a good strong knot left over right then right over left when it had pulled the knot tight there remained about five yards of one end hanging loose this was the end with the eyes on it but it didnt hang loose for long it quickly curled itself into the shape of a huge hook and the hook stuck straight out sideways from the elevator as though waiting for something else to hook itself on to it while all this was going on nobody had noticed what the other knids were up to mr wonka charlie cried look at the others what are they doing what indeed these too had all changed shape and had become longer but not nearly so long or so thin as the first one each of them had turned itself into a kind of thick rod and the rod was curled around at both ends at the tail end and at the head end so that it made a doubleended hook and now all the hooks were linking up into one long chain one thousand knids all joining together and curving around in the sky to make a chain of knids half a mile long or more and the knid at the very front of the chain was leading them in a wide circle and sweeping in toward the great glass elevator hey shouted grandpa joe theyre going to hook up with this brute whos tied himself around us and tow us away cried charlie to the planet vermes gasped grandma josephine eighteen thousand four hundred and twentyseven million miles from here they cant do that cried mr wonka were doing the towing around here theyre going to link up mr wonka charlie said they really are cant we stop them theyre going to tow us away and theyre going to tow the people were towing away as well do something you old fool shrieked grandma georgina dont just float about looking at them i must admit said mr wonka that for the first time in my life i find myself at a bit of a loss they all stared in horror through the glass at the long chain of vermicious knids the leader of the chain was coming closer and closer the hook with two big angry eyes on it was out and ready in thirty seconds it would link up with the hook of the knid wrapped around the elevator i want to go home wailed grandma josephine why cant we all go home great thundering tomcats cried mr wonka home is right what on earth am i thinking of come on charlie quick reentry you take the yellow button press it for all youre worth ill handle this lot charlie and mr wonka literally flew to the buttons hold your hats shouted mr wonka grab your gizzards were going down rockets started firing out of the elevator from all sides it tilted and gave a sickening lurch and then plunged downward into the earths atmosphere at a simply colossal speed retrorockets bellowed mr wonka i mustnt forget to fire the retrorockets he flew over to another series of buttons and started playing on them like a piano the elevator was now streaking downward head first upside down and all the passengers found themselves floating upside down as well help screamed grandma georgina all the bloods going to my head then turn yourself the other way up said mr wonka thats easy enough isnt it everyone blew and puffed and turned somersaults in the air until at last they were all the right way up hows the towrope holding grandpa mr wonka called out theyre still with us mr wonka sir the ropes holding fine it was an amazing sight the glass elevator streaking down toward the earth with the huge transport capsule in tow behind it but the long chain of knids was coming after them following them down keeping pace with them easily and now the hook of the leading knid in the chain was actually reaching out and grasping for the hook made by the knid on the elevator were too late screamed grandma georgina theyre going to link up and haul us back i think not said mr wonka dont you remember what happens when a knid enters the earths atmosphere at high speed he gets redhot he burns away in a long fiery trail he becomes a shooting knid soon these dirty beasts will start popping like popcorn as they streaked on downward sparks began to fly off the sides of the elevator the glass glowed pink then red then scarlet sparks also began to fly on the long chain of knids and the leading knid in the chain started to shine like a redhot poker so did all the others so did the great slimy brute coiled around the elevator itself this one in fact was trying frantically to uncoil itself and get away but it was having trouble untying the knot and in another ten seconds it began to sizzle inside the elevator they could actually hear it sizzling it made a noise like bacon frying and exactly the same sort of thing was happening to the other one thousand knids in the chain the tremendous heat was simply sizzling them up they were redhot every one of them then suddenly they became whitehot and they gave out a dazzling white light theyre shooting knids cried charlie what a splendid sight said mr wonka its better than fireworks in a few seconds more the knids had blown away in a cloud of ashes and it was all over weve done it cried mr wonka theyve been roasted to a crisp theyve been frizzled to a fritter were saved what do you mean saved said grandma josephine well all be frizzled ourselves if this goes on any longer well be barbecued like beefsteaks look at that glass its hotter than a fizzgig have no fears dear lady answered mr wonka my elevator is airconditioned ventilated aerated and automated in every possible way were going to be all right now i havent the faintest idea whats been going on said mrs bucket making one of her rare speeches but whatever it is i dont like it arent you enjoying it mother charlie asked her no she said im not nor is your father what a great sight it is said mr wonka just look at the earth down there charlie getting bigger and bigger and us going to meet it at two thousand miles an hour groaned grandma georgina how are you going to slow down for heavens sake you didnt think of that did you hes got parachutes charlie told her ill bet hes got great big parachutes that open just before we hit parachutes said mr wonka with contempt parachutes are only for astronauts and sissies and anyway we dont want to slow down we want to speed up ive told you already weve got to be going at an absolutely tremendous speed when we hit otherwise well never punch our way in through the roof of the chocolate factory how about the transport capsule charlie asked anxiously well be letting them go in a few seconds now mr wonka answered they do have parachutes three of them to slow them down on the last bit how do you know we wont land in the pacific ocean said grandma josephine i dont said mr wonka but we all know how to swim do we not this man shouted grandma josephine is crazy as a crumpet hes cracked as a crayfish cried grandma georgina down and down plunged the great glass elevator nearer and nearer came the earth below oceans and continents rushed up to meet them getting bigger every second grandpa joe sir throw out the rope let it go ordered mr wonka theyll be all right now so long as their parachutes are working rope gone called out grandpa joe and the huge transport capsule on its own now began to swing away to one side charlie waved to the three astronauts in the front window none of them waved back they were still sitting there in a kind of shocked daze gaping at the old ladies and the old men and the small boy floating about in the glass elevator it wont be long now said mr wonka reaching for a row of tiny pale blue buttons in one corner we shall soon know whether we are alive or dead keep very quiet please for this final bit i have to concentrate awfully hard otherwise well come down in the wrong place they plunged into a thick bank of cloud and for ten seconds they could see nothing when they came out of the cloud the transport capsule had disappeared and the earth was very close and there was only a great spread of land beneath them with mountains and forests then fields and trees then a small town there it is shouted mr wonka my chocolate factory my beloved chocolate factory you mean charlies chocolate factory said grandpa joe thats right said mr wonka addressing charlie id clean forgotten i do apologize to you my dear boy of course its yours and here we go through the glass floor of the elevator charlie caught a quick glimpse of the huge red roof and the tall chimneys of the giant factory they were plunging straight down on to it hold your breath shouted mr wonka hold your nose fasten your seatbelts and say your prayers were going through the roof back to the chocolate factory and then the noise of splintering wood and broken glass and absolute darkness and the most awful crunching sounds as the elevator rushed on and on smashing everything before it all at once the crashing noises stopped and the ride became smoother and the elevator seemed to be travelling on guides or rails twisting and turning like a rollercoaster and when the lights came on charlie suddenly realized that for the last few seconds he hadnt been floating at all he had been standing normally on the floor mr wonka was on the floor too and so was grandpa joe and mr and mrs bucket and also the big bed as for grandma josephine grandma georgina and grandpa george they must have fallen right back on to the bed because they were now all three on top of it and scrabbling to get under the blanket were through yelled mr wonka weve done it were in grandpa joe grabbed him by the hand and said well done sir how splendid what a magnificent job where in the world are we now said mrs bucket were back mother charlie cried were in the chocolate factory im very glad to hear it said mrs bucket but didnt we come rather a long way round we had to said mr wonka to avoid the traffic i have never met a man said grandma georgina who talks so much absolute nonsense a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men mr wonka said why dont you pay some attention to where this crazy elevators going shouted grandma josephine and stop footling about a little footling round about will stop you going up the spout said mr wonka what did i tell you cried grandma georgina hes round the twist hes bogged as a beetle hes dotty as a dingbat hes got rats in the roof i want to go home too late said mr wonka were there the elevator stopped the doors opened and charlie found himself looking out once again at the great chocolate room with the chocolate river and the chocolate waterfall where everything was eatable the trees the leaves the grass the pebbles and even the rocks and there to meet them were hundreds and hundreds of tiny oompaloompas all waving and cheering it was a sight that took ones breath away even grandma georgina was stunned into silence for a few seconds but not for long who in the world are all those peculiar little men she said theyre oompaloompas charlie told her theyre wonderful youll love them ssshh said grandpa joe listen charlie the drums are starting up theyre going to sing alleluia sang the oompaloompas oh alleluia and hooray our willy wonkas back today we thought youd never make it home we thought youd left us all alone we knew that you would have to face some frightful creatures up in space we even thought we heard the crunch of someone eating you for lunch all right shouted mr wonka laughing and raising both hands thank you for your welcome will some of you please help to get this bed out of here fifty oompaloompas ran forward and pushed the bed with the three old ones in it out of the elevator mr and mrs bucket both looking completely overwhelmed by it all followed the bed out then came grandpa joe charlie and mr wonka now said mr wonka addressing grandpa george grandma georgina and grandma josephine up you hop out of that bed and lets get cracking im sure youll all want to lend a hand running the factory who us said grandma josephine yes you said mr wonka you must be joking said grandma georgina i never joke said mr wonka now just you listen to me sir said old grandpa george sitting up straight in bed youve got us into quite enough tubbles and trumbles for one day ive got you out of them too said mr wonka proudly and im going to get you out of that bed as well you see if i dont how wonkavite was invented i havent been out of this bed in twenty years and im not getting out now for anybody said grandma josephine firmly nor me said grandma georgina you were out of it just now every one of you said mr wonka that was floating said grandpa george we couldnt help it we never put our feet on the floor said grandma josephine try it said mr wonka you might surprise yourself go on josie said grandpa joe give it a try i did it was easy were perfectly comfortable where we are thank you very much said grandma josephine mr wonka sighed and shook his head very slowly and very sadly oh well he said so thats that he laid his head on one side and gazed thoughtfully at the three old people in the bed and charlie watching him closely saw those bright little eyes of his beginning to spark and twinkle once again haha thought charlie whats coming now i suppose said mr wonka placing the tip of one finger on the point of his nose and pressing gently i suppose because this is a very special case i suppose i could spare you just a tiny little bit of he stopped and shook his head a tiny little bit of what said grandma josephine sharply no said mr wonka its pointless you seem to have decided to stay in that bed whatever happens and anyway the stuff is much too precious to waste im sorry i mentioned it he started to walk away hey shouted grandma georgina you cant begin something and not go on with it what is too precious to waste mr wonka stopped slowly he turned around he looked long and hard at the three old people in the bed they looked back at him waiting he kept silent a little longer allowing their curiosity to grow the oompaloompas stood absolutely still behind him watching what is this thing youre talking about said grandma georgina get on with it for heavens sake said grandma josephine very well mr wonka said at last ill tell you and listen carefully because this could change your whole lives it could even change you i dont want to be changed shouted grandma georgina may i go on madam thank you not long ago i was fooling about in my inventing room stirring stuff around and mixing things up the way i do every afternoon at four oclock when suddenly i found i had made something that seemed very unusual this thing i had made kept changing colour as i looked at it and now and again it gave a little jump it actually jumped up in the air as though it were alive what have we here i cried and i rushed it quickly to the testing room and gave some to the oompaloompa who was on duty there at the time the result was immediate it was flabbergasting it was unbelievable it was also rather unfortunate what happened said grandma georgina sitting up what indeed said mr wonka answer her question said grandma josephine what happened to the oompaloompa ah said mr wonka yes well theres no point in crying over spilled milk is there i realized you see that i had stumbled upon a new and tremendously powerful vitamin and i also knew that if only i could make it safe if only i could stop it doing to others what it did to that oompaloompa what did it do to that oompaloompa said grandma georgina sternly the older i get the deafer i become said mr wonka do please raise your voice a trifle next time thank you so much now then i simply had to find a way of making this stuff safe so that people could take it without er without what snapped grandma georgina without a leg to stand on said mr wonka so i rolled up my sleeves and set to work once more in the inventing room i mixed and i mixed i must have tried just about every mixture under the moon by the way there is a little hole in one wall of the inventing room which connects directly with the testing room next door so i was able all the time to keep passing stuff through for testing to whichever brave volunteer happened to be on duty well the first few weeks were pretty depressing and we wont talk about them let me tell you instead what happened on the one hundred and thirtysecond day of my labours that morning i had changed the mixture drastically and this time the little pill i produced at the end of it all was not nearly so active or alive as the others had been it kept changing colour yes but only from lemonyellow to blue then back to yellow again and when i placed it on the palm of my hand it didnt jump about like a grasshopper it only quivered and then ever so slightly i ran to the hole in the wall that led to the testing room a very old oompaloompa was on duty there that morning he was a bald wrinkled toothless old fellow he was in a wheelchair he had been in the wheelchair for at least fifteen years this is test number one hundred and thirtytwo i said chalking it up on the board i handed him the pill he looked at it nervously i couldnt blame him for being a bit jittery after what had happened to the other one hundred and thirtyone volunteers what had happened to them shouted grandma georgina why dont you answer the question instead of skidding around it on two wheels who knows the way out of a rose said mr wonka so this brave old oompaloompa took the pill and with the help of a little water he gulped it down and then suddenly the most amazing thing happened before my very eyes queer little changes began taking place in the way he looked a moment earlier he had been practically bald with just a fringe of snowy white hair around the sides and the back of his head but now the fringe of white hair was turning gold and all over the top of his head new gold hair was beginning to sprout like grass in less than half a minute he had grown a splendid new crop of long golden hair at the same time many of the wrinkles started disappearing from his face not all of them but about half enough to make him look a good deal younger and all of this must have given him a nice tickly feeling because he started grinning at me then laughing and as soon as he opened his mouth i saw the strangest sight of all teeth were growing up out from those old toothless gums good white teeth and they were coming up so fast i could actually see them getting bigger and bigger i was too flabbergasted to speak i just stood there with my head poking through the hole in the wall staring at the little oompaloompa i saw him slowly lifting himself out of his wheelchair he tested his legs on the ground he stood up he walked a few paces then he looked up at me and his face was bright his eyes were huge and bright as two stars look at me he said softly im walking its a miracle its wonkavite i said the great rejuvenator it makes you young again how old do you feel now he thought carefully about this question then he said i feel almost exactly how i felt when i was fifty years old how old were you just now before you took the wonkavite i asked him seventy last birthday he answered that means i said it has made you twenty years younger it has it has he cried delighted i feel as frisky as a froghopper not frisky enough i told him fifty is still pretty old let us see if i cant help you a bit more stay right where you are ill be back in a twink i ran to my workbench and began to make one more pill of wonkavite using exactly the same mixture as before swallow this i said passing the second pill through the hatch there was no hesitating this time eagerly he popped it into his mouth and chased it down with a drink of water and behold within half a minute another twenty years had fallen away from his face and body and he was now a slim and sprightly young oompaloompa of thirty he gave a whoop of joy and started dancing around the room leaping high in the air and coming down on his toes are you happy i asked him im ecstatic he cried jumping up and down im happy as a horse in a hayfield he ran out of the testing room to show himself off to his family and friends thus was wonkavite invented said mr wonka and thus was it made safe for all to use why dont you use it yourself then said grandma georgina you told charlie you were getting too old to run the factory so why dont you just take a couple of pills and get forty years younger tell me that anyone can ask questions said mr wonka its the answers that count now then if the three of you in the bed would care to try a dose just one minute said grandma josephine sitting up straight first id like to take a look at this seventyyearold oompaloompa who is now back to thirty mr wonka flicked his fingers a tiny oompaloompa looking young and perky ran forward out of the crowd and did a marvellous little dance in front of the three old people in the big bed two weeks ago he was seventy years old and in a wheelchair mr wonka said proudly and look at him now the drums charlie said grandpa joe listen theyre starting up again far away down on the bank of the chocolate river charlie could see the oompaloompa band striking up once more there were twenty oompaloompas in the band each with an enormous drum twice as tall as himself and they were beating a slow mysterious rhythm that soon had all the other hundreds of oompaloompas swinging and swaying from side to side in a kind of trance they then began to chant if you are old and have the shakes if all your bones are full of aches if you can hardly walk at all if living drives you up the wall if youre a grump and full of spite if youre a human parasite then what you need is wonkavite your eyes will shine your hair will grow your face and skin will start to glow your rotten teeth will all drop out and in their place new teeth will sprout those rolls of fat around your hips will vanish and your wrinkled lips will get so soft and rosypink that all the boys will smile and wink and whisper secretly that this is just the girl they want to kiss but wait for that is not the most important thing of which to boast good looks youll have weve told you so but looks arent everything you know each pill as well to you will give an extra twenty years to live so come old friends and do whats right lets make your lives as bright as bright lets take a dose of this delight this heavenly magic dynamite you cant go wrong you must go right its willy wonkas wonkavite recipe for wonkavite here it is cried mr wonka standing at the end of the bed and holding high in one hand a little bottle the most valuable bottle of pills in the world and that by the way he said giving grandma georgina a saucy glance is why i havent taken any myself they are far too valuable to waste on me he held the bottle out over the bed the three old ones sat up and stretched their scrawny necks trying to catch a glimpse of the pills inside charlie and grandpa joe also came forward to look so did mr and mrs bucket the label said wonkavite each pill will make you younger by exactly years caution do not take more than the amount recommended by mr wonka they could all see the pills through the glass they were brilliant yellow shimmering and quivering inside the bottle vibrating is perhaps a better word they were vibrating so rapidly that each pill became a blur and you couldnt see its shape you could only see its colour you got the impression that there was something very small but incredibly powerful something not quite of this world locked up inside them and fighting to get out theyre wriggling said grandma georgina i dont like things that wriggle how do we know they wont go on wriggling inside us after weve swallowed them like those mexican jumping beans of charlies i swallowed a couple of years back you remember that charlie i told you not to eat them grandma they went on jumping about inside me for a month said grandma georgina i couldnt sit still if im going to eat one of those pills i jolly well want to know whats in it first said grandma josephine i dont blame you said mr wonka but the recipe is extremely complicated wait a minute ive got it written down somewhere he started digging around in the pockets of his coattails i know its here somewhere he said i cant have lost it i keep all my most valuable and important things in these pockets the trouble is theres such a lot of them he started emptying the pockets and placing the contents on the bed a homemade catapult a yoyo a trick friedegg made of rubber a slice of salami a tooth with a filling in it a stinkbomb a packet of itchingpowder it must be here it must be it must he kept muttering i put it away so carefully ah here it is he unfolded a crumpled piece of paper smoothed it out held it up and began to read as follows recipe for making wonkavite take a block of finest chocolate weighing one ton place chocolate in very large cauldron and melt over redhot furnace when melted lower the heat slightly so as not to burn the chocolate but keep it boiling now add the following in precisely the order given stirring well all the time and allowing each item to dissolve before adding the next the hoof of a manticore the trunk of an elephant the yolks of three eggs from a whifflebird a wart from a warthog the horn of a cow the front tail of a cockatrice six ounces of sprunge from a young slimescraper two hairs from the head of a hippocampus the beak of a redbreasted wilbatross a corn from the toe of a unicorn the four tentacles of a quadropus the hip of a hippopotamus the snout of a proghopper a mole from a mole the hide of a spotted whangdoodle the whites of twelve eggs from a treesqueak the three feet of a snozzwanger the squareroot of a south american abacus the fangs of a viper the chest of a wild grout when all the above are thoroughly dissolved boil for a further twentyseven days but do not stir at the end of this time all liquid will have evaporated and there will be left in the bottom of the cauldron only a hard brown lump about the size of a football break this open with a hammer and in the very centre of it you will find a small round pill this pill is wonkavite goodbye georgina when mr wonka had finished reading the recipe he carefully folded the paper and put it back into his pocket a very very complicated mixture he said so can you wonder it took me so long to get it just right he held the bottle up high and gave it a little shake and the pills rattled loudly inside it like glass beads now sir he said offering the bottle first to grandpa george will you take one pill or two will you solemnly swear said grandpa george that it will do what you say it will and nothing else mr wonka placed his free hand on his heart i swear it he said charlie edged forward grandpa joe came with him the two of them always stayed close together please excuse me for asking charlie said but are you really absolutely sure youve got it quite right whatever makes you ask a funny question like that said mr wonka i was thinking of the gum you gave to violet beauregarde charlie said so thats whats bothering you cried mr wonka but dont you understand my dear boy that i never did give that gum to violet she snatched it without permission and i shouted stop dont spit it out but the silly girl took no notice of me now wonkavite is altogether different i am offering these pills to your grandparents i am recommending them and when taken according to my instructions they are as safe as sugarcandy of course they are cried mr bucket what are you waiting for all of you an extraordinary change had come over mr bucket since he had entered the chocolate room normally he was a pretty timid sort of person a lifetime devoted to screwing caps on to the tops of toothpaste tubes in a toothpaste factory had turned him into a rather shy and quiet man but the sight of the marvellous chocolate factory had made his spirits soar what is more this business of the pills seemed to have given him a terrific kick listen he cried going up to the edge of the bed mr wonkas offering you a new life grab it while you can its a delicious sensation mr wonka said and its very quick you lose a year a second exactly one year falls away from you every second that goes by he stepped forward and placed the bottle of pills gently in the middle of the bed so here you are my dears he said help yourselves come on cried all the oompaloompas together come on old friends and do whats right come make your lives as bright as bright just take a dose of this delight this heavenly magic dynamite you cant go wrong you must go right its willy wonkas wonkavite this was too much for the old people in the bed all three of them made a dive for the bottle six scrawny hands shot out and started scrabbling to get hold of it grandma georgina got it she gave a grunt of triumph and unscrewed the cap and tipped all the little brilliant yellow pills on to the blanket on her lap she cupped her hands around them so the others couldnt reach out and snatch them all right she shouted excitedly counting them quickly theres twelve pills here thats six for me and three each for you hey thats not fair shrilled grandma josephine its four for each of us four each is right cried grandpa george come on georgina hand over my share mr wonka shrugged his shoulders and turned his back on them he hated squabbles he hated it when people got grabby and selfish let them fight it out among themselves he thought and he walked away he walked slowly down toward the chocolate waterfall it was an unhappy truth he told himself that nearly all people in the world behave badly when there is something really big at stake money is the thing they fight over most but these pills were bigger than money they could do things for you no amount of money could ever do they were worth at least a million dollars a pill he knew plenty of very rich men who would gladly pay that much in order to become twenty years younger he reached the riverbank below the waterfall and he stood there gazing at the great gush and splash of melted chocolate pouring down he had hoped the noise of the waterfall would drown the arguing voices of the old grandparents in the bed but it didnt even with his back to them he still couldnt help hearing most of what they were saying i got them first grandma georgina was shouting so theyre mine to share out oh no theyre not shrilled grandma josephine he didnt give them to you he gave them to all three of us i want my share and no ones going to stop me getting it yelled grandpa george come on woman hand them over then came the voice of grandpa joe cutting in sternly through the rabble stop this at once he ordered all three of you youre behaving like savages you keep out of this joe and mind your own business said grandma josephine now you be careful josie grandpa joe went on four is too many for one person anyway thats right charlie said please grandma why dont you just take one or two each like mr wonka said and thatll leave some for grandpa joe and mother and father yes cried mr bucket id love one oh wouldnt it be wonderful said mrs bucket to be twenty years younger and not have aching feet any more couldnt you spare just one for each of us mother im afraid not said grandma georgina these pills are specially reserved for us three in the bed mr wonka said so i want my share shouted grandpa george come on georgina dish them out hey let me go you brute cried grandma georgina youre hurting me ow all right all right ill share them out if youll stop twisting my arm thats better heres four for josephine and four for george and four for me good said grandpa george now whos got some water without looking around mr wonka knew that three oompaloompas would be running to the bed with three glasses of water oompaloompas were always ready to help there was a brief pause and then well here goes cried grandpa george young and beautiful thats what ill be shouted grandma josephine farewell old age cried grandma georgina all together now down the hatch then there was silence mr wonka was itching to turn around and look but he forced himself to wait out of the corner of one eye he could see a group of oompaloompas all motionless their eyes fixed intently in the direction of the big bed over by the elevator then charlies voice broke the silence wow he was shouting just look at that its its incredible i cant believe it grandpa joe was yelling theyre getting younger and younger they

thirty again wait a minute you look younger than thirty you cant be a day more than twenty now but thats enough isnt it i should stop there if i were you twentys quite young enough mr wonka shook his head sadly and passed a hand over his eyes had you been standing very close to him you would have heard him murmuring softly under his breath oh deary deary me here we go again mother cried mrs bucket and now there was a shrill note of alarm in her voice why dont you stop mother youre going too far youre way under twenty you cant be more than fifteen youre youre youre ten youre getting smaller mother josie shouted grandpa joe hey josie dont do it josie youre shrinking youre a little girl stop her somebody quick theyre all going too far cried charlie they took too much said mr bucket mothers shrinking faster than any of them wailed mrs bucket mother cant you hear me mother cant you stop my heavens isnt it quick said mr bucket who seemed to be the only one enjoying it it really is a year a second but theyve hardly got any more years left wailed grandpa joe mothers no more than four now mrs bucket cried out shes three two one gracious me whats happening to her wheres she gone mother georgina where are you mr wonka come quickly come here mr wonka something frightfuls happened somethings gone wrong my old mothers disappeared mr wonka sighed and turned around and walked slowly and quite calmly back toward the bed wheres my mother bawled mrs bucket look at josephine cried grandpa joe just look at her i ask you mr wonka looked first at grandma josephine she was sitting in the middle of the huge bed bawling her head off wa wa wa she said wa wa wa wa wa shes a screaming baby cried grandpa joe ive got a screaming baby for a wife the other ones grandpa george mr bucket said smiling happily the slightly bigger one there crawling around hes my wifes father thats right hes my father wailed mrs bucket and wheres georgina my old mother shes vanished shes nowhere mr wonka shes absolutely nowhere i saw her getting smaller and smaller and in the end she got so small she just disappeared into thin air what i want to know is wheres she gone to and how in the world are we going to get her back ladies and gentlemen said mr wonka coming up close and raising both hands for silence please i beg you do not ruffle yourselves theres nothing to worry about you call it nothing cried poor mrs bucket when my old mothers gone down the drain and my fathers a howling baby a lovely baby said mr wonka i quite agree said mr bucket what about my josie cried grandpa joe what about her said mr wonka well a great improvement sir said mr wonka dont you agree oh yes said grandpa joe i mean no what am i saying shes a howling baby but in perfect health said mr wonka may i ask you sir how many pills she took four said grandpa joe glumly they all took four mr wonka made a wheezing noise in his throat and a look of great sorrow came over his face why oh why cant people be more sensible he said sadly why dont they listen to me when i tell them something i explained very carefully beforehand that each pill makes the taker exactly twenty years younger so if grandma josephine took four of them she automatically became younger by four times twenty which is wait a minute now four twos are eight add a nought thats eighty so she automatically became younger by eighty years how old sir was your wife if i may ask before this happened she was eighty last birthday grandpa joe answered she was eighty and three months there you are then cried mr wonka flashing a happy smile the wonkavite worked perfectly she is now precisely three months old and a plumper rosier infant ive never set eyes on nor me said mr bucket shed win a prize in any baby competition first prize said mr wonka cheer up grandpa said charlie taking the old mans hand in his dont be sad shes a beautiful baby madam said mr wonka turning to mrs bucket how old may i ask was grandpa george your father eightyone wailed mrs bucket he was eightyone exactly which makes him a great big bouncing oneyearold boy now said mr wonka happily how splendid said mr bucket to his wife youll be the first person in the world to change her fathers nappies he can change his own rotten nappies said mrs bucket what i want to know is wheres my mother wheres grandma georgina ahha said mr wonka ohho yes indeed where oh where has georgina gone how old please was the lady in question seventyeight mrs bucket told him well of course laughed mr wonka that explains it what explains what snapped mrs bucket my dear madam said mr wonka if she was only seventyeight and she took enough wonkavite to make her eighty years younger then naturally shes vanished shes bitten off more than she could chew shes taken off more years than she had explain yourself said mrs bucket simple arithmetic said mr wonka subtract eighty from seventyeight and what do you get minus two said charlie hooray said mr bucket my motherinlaws minus two years old impossible said mrs bucket its true said mr wonka and where is she now may i ask said mrs bucket thats a good question said mr wonka a very good question yes indeed where is she now you dont have the foggiest idea do you of course i do said mr wonka i know exactly where she is then tell me you must try to understand said mr wonka that if she is now minus two shes got to add two more years before she can start again from nought shes got to wait it out where does she wait said mrs bucket in the waiting room of course said mr wonka boomboom said the drums of the oompaloompa band boomboom boomboom and all the oompaloompas all the hundreds of them standing there in the chocolate room began to sway and hop and dance to the rhythm of the music attention please they sang attention please attention please dont dare to talk dont dare to sneeze dont doze or daydream stay awake your health your very lifes at stake hoho you say they cant mean me haha we answer wait and see did any of you ever meet a child called goldie pinklesweet who on her seventh birthday went to stay with granny down in kent at lunchtime on the second day of dearest little goldies stay granny announced im going down to do some shopping in the town dyou know why granny didnt tell the child to come along as well shes going to the nearest inn to buy herself a double gin so out she creeps she shuts the door and goldie after making sure that she is really by herself goes quickly to the medicine shelf and there her little greedy eyes see pills of every shape and size such fascinating colours too some green some pink some brown some blue all right she says lets try the brown she takes one pill and gulps it down yumyum she cries hooray what fun theyre chocolatecoated every one she gobbles five she gobbles ten she stops her gobbling only when the last pills gone there are no more slowly she rises from the floor she stops she hiccups dear oh dear she starts to feel a trifle queer you see how could young goldie know for nobody had told her so that grandmama her old relation suffered from frightful constipation this meant that every night shed give herself a powerful laxative and all the medicines that shed bought were naturally of this sort the pink and red and blue and green were all extremely strong and mean but far more fierce and meaner still was grannys little chocolate pill its blast effect was quite uncanny it used to shake up even granny in point of fact she did not dare to use them more than twice a year so can you wonder little goldie began to feel a wee bit mouldy inside her tummy something stirred a funny gurgling sound was heard and then oh dear from deep within the ghastly rumbling sounds begin they rumbilate and roar and boom they bounce and echo round the room the floorboards shake and from the wall some bits of paint and plaster fall explosions whistles awful bangs were followed by the loudest clangs a man next door was heard to say a thunderstorm is on the way but on and on the rumbling goes a window cracks a lampbulb blows young goldie clutched herself and cried theres something wrong with my inside this was we very greatly fear the understatement of the year for wouldnt any child feel crummy with loud explosions in her tummy granny at half past two came in weaving a little from the gin but even so she quickly saw the empty bottle on the floor my precious laxatives she cried i dont feel well the girl replied angrily grandma shook her head im really not surprised she said why cant you leave my pills alone with that she grabbed the telephone and shouted listen send us quick an ambulance a child is sick its number fifty fontwell road come fast i think she might explode were sure you do not wish to hear about the hospital and where they did a lot of horrid things with stomachpumps and rubber rings lets answer what you want to know did goldie live or did she go the doctors gathered round her bed theres really not much hope they said shes going going gone they cried shes had her chips shes dead shes dead im not so sure the child replied and all at once she opened wide her great big bluish eyes and sighed and gave the anxious docs a wink and said ill be okay i think so goldie lived and back she went at first to grannys place in kent her father came the second day and fetched her in a chevrolet and drove her to their home in dover but goldies troubles were not over you see if someone takes enough of any highly dangerous stuff one will invariably find some traces of it left behind it pains us greatly to relate that goldie suffered from this fate shed taken such a massive fill of this unpleasant kind of pill it got into her blood and bones it messed up all her chromosomes it made her constantly upset and she could never really get the beastly stuff to go away and so the girl was forced to stay for seven hours every day within the everlasting gloom of what we call the ladies room and after all the wc is not the gayest place to be so now before it is too late take heed of goldies dreadful fate and seriously all jokes apart do promise us across your heart that you will never help yourself to medicine from the medicine shelf vitawonk and minusland its up to you charlie my boy said mr wonka its your factory shall we let your grandma georgina wait it out for the next two years or shall we try to bring her back right now you dont really mean you might be able to bring her back cried charlie theres no harm in trying is there if thats the way you want it oh yes of course i do for mothers sake especially cant you see how sad she is mrs bucket was sitting on the edge of the big bed dabbing her eyes with a hanky my poor old mum she kept saying shes minus two and i wont see her again for months and months and months if ever at all behind her grandpa joe with the help of an oompaloompa was feeding his threemonthold wife grandma josephine from a bottle alongside them mr bucket was spooning something called wonkas squdgemallow baby food into oneyearold grandpa georges mouth but mostly all over his chin and chest big deal he was muttering angrily what a lousy rotten rotten this is they tell me im going to the chocolate factory to have a good time and i finish up being a mother to my fatherinlaw everythings under control charlie said mr wonka surveying the scene theyre doing fine they dont need us here come along were off to hunt for grandma he caught charlie by the arm and went dancing towards the open door of the great glass elevator hurry up my dear boy hurry up he cried weve got to hustle if were going to get there before before what mr wonka before she gets subtracted of course all minuses are subtracted dont you know any arithmetic at all they were in the elevator now and mr wonka was searching among the hundreds of buttons for the one he wanted here we are he said placing his finger delicately upon a tiny ivory button on which it said minusland the doors slid shut and then with a fearful whistling whirring sound the great machine leaped away to the right charlie grabbed mr wonkas legs and held on for dear life mr wonka pulled a jumpseat out of the wall and said sit down charlie quick and strap yourself in tight this journeys going to be rough and choppy there were straps on either side of the seat and charlie buckled himself firmly in mr wonka pulled out a second seat for himself and did the same we are going a long way down he said oh such a long way down we are going the elevator was gathering speed it twisted and swerved it swung sharply to the left then it went right then left again and it was heading downward all the time down and down and down i only hope said mr wonka the oompaloompas arent using the other elevator today what other elevator asked charlie the one that goes the opposite way on the same track as this holy snakes mr wonka you mean we might have a collision ive always been lucky so far my boy hey take a look out there quick through the window charlie caught a glimpse of what seemed like an enormous quarry with a steep craggybrown rockface and all over the rockface there were hundreds of oompaloompas working with picks and pneumatic drills rockcandy said mr wonka thats the richest deposit of rockcandy in the world the elevator sped on were going deeper charlie deeper and deeper were about two hundred thousand feet down already strange sights were flashing by outside but the elevator was travelling at such a terrific speed that only occasionally was charlie able to recognize anything at all once he thought he saw in the distance a cluster of tiny houses shaped like upsidedown cups and there were streets in between the houses and oompaloompas walking in the streets another time as they were passing some sort of a vast red plain dotted with things that looked like oil derricks he saw a great spout of brown liquid spurting out of the ground high into the air a gusher cried mr wonka clapping his hands a whacking great gusher how splendid just when we needed it a what said charlie weve struck chocolate again my boy thatll be a rich new field oh what a beautiful gusher just look at it go on they roared heading downward more steeply than ever now and hundreds literally hundreds of astonishing sights kept flashing by outside there were giant cogwheels turning and mixers mixing and bubbles bubbling and vast orchards of toffeeapple trees and lakes the size of football grounds filled with blue and gold and green liquid and everywhere there were oompaloompas you realize said mr wonka that what you saw earlier on when you went round the factory with all those naughty little children was only a tiny corner of the establishment it goes down for miles and miles and as soon as possible i shall show you all the way around slowly and properly but that will take three weeks right now we have other things to think about and i have important things to tell you listen carefully to me charlie i must talk fast for well be there in a couple of minutes i suppose you guessed mr wonka went on what happened to all those oompaloompas in the testing room when i was experimenting with wonkavite of course you did they disappeared and became minuses just like your grandma georgina the recipe was miles too strong one of them actually became minus eightyseven imagine that you mean hes got to wait eightyseven years before he can come back charlie asked thats what kept bugging me my boy after all one cant allow ones best friends to wait around as miserable minuses for eightyseven years and get subtracted as well said charlie that would be frightful of course it would charlie so what did i do willy wonka i said to myself if you can invent wonkavite to make people younger then surely to goodness you can also invent something else to make people older ahha cried charlie i see what youre getting at then you could turn the minuses quickly back into pluses and bring them home again precisely my dear boy precisely always supposing of course that i could find out where the minuses had gone to the elevator plunged on diving steeply toward the centre of the earth all was blackness outside now there was nothing to be seen so once again mr wonka went on i rolled up my sleeves and set to work once again i squeezed my brain searching for the new recipe i had to create age to make people old old older oldest haha i cried for now the ideas were beginning to come what is the oldest living thing in the world what lives longer than anything else a tree charlie said right you are charlie but what kind of a tree not the douglas fir not the oak not the cedar no no my boy it is a tree called the bristlecone pine that grows upon the slopes of wheeler peak in nevada usa you can find bristlecone pines on wheeler peak today that are over four thousand years old this is fact charlie ask any dendrochronologist you like so that started me off i jumped into the great glass elevator and rushed all over the world collecting special items from the oldest living things a pint of sap from a yearold bristlecone pine the toenail clippings from a yearold russian farmer called petrovitch gregorovitch an egg laid by a yearold tortoise belonging to the king of tonga the tail of a yearold horse in arabia the whiskers of a yearold cat called crumpets an old flea which had lived on crumpets for years the tail of a yearold giant rat from tibet the black teeth of a year old grimalkin living in a cave on mount popocatepetl the knucklebones of a yearold cattaloo from peru all over the world charlie i tracked down very old and ancient animals and took an important little bit of something from each one of them a hair or an eyebrow or sometimes it was no more than an ounce or two of the jam scraped from between its toes while it was sleeping i tracked down the whistlepig the bobolink the skrock the pollyfrog the giant curlicue the stinging slug and the venomous squerkle who can spit poison right into your eye from fifty yards away but theres no time to tell you about them all now charlie let me just say quickly that in the end after lots of boiling and bubbling and mixing and testing in my inventing room i produced one tiny cupful of oily black liquid and gave four drops of it to a brave twentyyearold oompaloompa volunteer to see what happened what did happen charlie asked it was fantastic cried mr wonka the moment he swallowed it he began wrinkling and shrivelling up all over and his hair started dropping off and his teeth started falling out and before i knew it he had suddenly become an old fellow of seventyfive and thus my dear charlie was vitawonk invented did you rescue all the oompaloompa minuses mr wonka every single one of them my boy one hundred and thirtyone all told mind you it wasnt quite as easy as all that there were lots of snags and complications along the way good heavens were nearly there i must stop talking now and watch where were going charlie realized that the elevator was no longer rushing and roaring it was hardly moving at all now it seemed to be drifting undo your straps mr wonka said we must get ready for action charlie undid his straps and stood up and peered out it was an eerie sight they were drifting in a heavy grey mist and the mist was swirling and swishing around them as though driven by winds from many sides in the distance the mist was darker and almost black and it seemed to be swirling more fiercely than ever over there mr wonka slid open the doors stand back he said dont fall out charlie whatever you do the mist came into the elevator it had the fusty reeky smell of an old underground dungeon the silence was overpowering there was no sound at all no whisper of wind no voice of creature or insect and it gave charlie a queer frightening feeling to be standing there in the middle of this grey inhuman nothingness as though he were in another world altogether in some place where man should never be minusland whispered mr wonka this is it charlie the problem now is to find her we may be lucky and there again we may not rescue in minusland i dont like it here at all charlie whispered it gives me the willies me too mr wonka whispered back but weve got a job to do charlie and we must go through with it the mist was condensing now on the glass walls of the elevator making it difficult to see out except through the open doors do any other creatures live here mr wonka plenty of gnoolies are they dangerous if they bite you they are youre a gonner my boy if youre bitten by a gnooly the elevator drifted on rocking gently from side to side the greyblack oily fog swirled around them what does a gnooly look like mr wonka they dont look like anything charlie they cant you mean youve never seen one you cant see gnoolies my boy you cant even feel them until they puncture your skin then its too late theyve got you you mean there might be swarms of them all around us this very moment charlie asked there might said mr wonka charlie felt his skin beginning to creep do you die at once he asked first you become subtracted a little later you are divided but very slowly it takes a long time its long division and its very painful after that you become one of them couldnt we shut the door charlie asked im afraid not my boy wed never see her through the glass theres too much mist and moisture shes not going to be easy to pick out anyway charlie stood at the open door of the elevator and stared into the swirling vapours this he thought is what hell must be like hell without heat there was something unholy about it all something unbelievably diabolical it was all so deathly quiet so desolate and empty at the same time the constant movement the twisting and swirling of the misty vapours gave one the feeling that some very powerful force evil and malignant was at work all around charlie felt a jab on his arm he jumped he almost jumped out of the elevator sorry said mr wonka its only me ohhh charlie gasped for a second i thought i know what you thought charlie and by the way im awfully glad youre with me how would you like to come here alone as i did as i had to many times i wouldnt said charlie there she is said mr wonka pointing no she isnt oh dear i could have sworn i saw her for a moment right over there on the edge of that dark patch keep watching charlie there said charlie over there look where said mr wonka point to her charlie shes shes gone again she sort of faded away charlie said they stood at the open door of the elevator peering into the swirly grey vapours there quick right there charlie cried cant you see her yes charlie i see her im moving up close now mr wonka reached behind him and began touching a number of buttons grandma charlie cried out weve come to get you grandma they could see her faintly through the mist but oh so faintly and they could see the mist through her as well she was transparent she was hardly there at all she was no more than a shadow they could see her face and just the faintest outline of her body swathed in a sort of gown but she wasnt upright she was floating lengthwise in the swirling vapour why is she lying down charlie whispered because shes a minus charlie surely you know what a minus looks like like that mr wonka drew a horizontal line in the air with his finger the elevator glided close the ghostly shadow of grandma georginas face was no more than a yard away now charlie reached out through the door to touch her but there was nothing there to touch his hand went right through her skin grandma he gasped she began to drift away stand back ordered mr wonka and suddenly from some secret place inside his coattails he whisked out a spraygun it was one of those oldfashioned things people used to use for spraying flyspray around the room before aerosols came along he aimed the spraygun straight at the shadow of grandma georgina and he pumped the handle hard once twice three times each time a fine black spray spurted out from the nozzle of the gun instantly grandma georgina disappeared a bulls eye cried mr wonka jumping up and down with excitement i got her with both barrels i plussed her good and proper thats vitawonk for you wheres she gone charlie asked back where she came from of course to the factory shes a minus no longer my boy shes a one hundred per cent redblooded plus come along now lets get out of here quickly before the gnoolies find us mr wonka jabbed a button the doors closed and the great glass elevator shot upwards for home sit down and strap yourself in again charlie said mr wonka were going flat out this time the elevator roared and rocketed up toward the surface of the earth mr wonka and charlie sat side by side on their little jumpseats strapped in tight mr wonka started tucking the spraygun back into that enormous pocket somewhere in his coattails its such a pity one has to use a clumsy old thing like this he said but theres simply no other way of doing it ideally of course one would measure out exactly the right number of drops into a teaspoon and feed it carefully into the mouth but its impossible to feed anything into a minus its like trying to feed ones own shadow thats why ive got to use a spraygun spray em all over my boy thats the only way it worked fine though didnt it charlie said oh it worked all right charlie it worked beautifully all im saying is that theres bound to be a slight overdose i dont quite know what you mean mr wonka my dear boy if it only takes four drops of vitawonk to turn a young oompaloompa into an old man mr wonka lifted his hands and let them fall limply on to his lap you mean grandma may have got too much asked charlie turning slightly pale im afraid thats putting it rather mildly said mr wonka but but why did you give her such a lot of it then said charlie getting more and more worried why did you spray her three times she must have got pints and pints of it gallons cried mr wonka slapping his thighs gallons and gallons but dont let a little thing like that bother you my dear charlie the important part of it is weve got her back shes a minus no longer shes a lovely plus shes as plussy as plussy can be shes more plussy than you or than me the question is how just how old is she now is she more than a hundred and three the oldest person in the world we return in triumph charlie cried mr wonka as the great glass elevator began to slow down once more your dear family will all be together again the elevator stopped the doors slid open and there was the chocolate room and the chocolate river and the oompaloompas and in the middle of it all the great bed belonging to the old grandparents charlie said grandpa joe rushing forward thank heavens youre back charlie hugged him then he hugged his mother and his father is she here he said grandma georgina nobody answered nobody did anything except grandpa joe who pointed to the bed he pointed but he didnt look where he was pointing none of them looked at the bed except charlie he walked past them all to get a better view and he saw at one end the two babies grandma josephine and grandpa george both tucked in and sleeping peacefully at the other end dont be alarmed said mr wonka running up and placing a hand on charlies arm shes bound to be just a teeny bit overplussed i warned you about that what have you done to her cried mrs bucket my poor old mother propped up against the pillows at the other end of the bed was the most extraordinarylooking thing charlie had ever seen was it some ancient fossil it couldnt be that because it was moving slightly and now it was making sounds croaking sounds the kind of sounds a very old frog might make if it knew a few words well well well it croaked if it isnt dear charlie grandma cried charlie grandma georgina oh oh oh her tiny face was like a pickled walnut there were such masses of creases and wrinkles that the mouth and eyes and even the nose were sunken almost out of sight her hair was pure white and her hands which were resting on top of the blanket were just little lumps of wrinkly skin the presence of this ancient creature seemed to have terrified not only mr and mrs bucket but grandpa joe as well they stood well back away from the bed mr wonka on the other hand was as happy as ever my dear lady he cried advancing to the edge of the bed and clasping one of those tiny wrinkled hands in both of his welcome home and how are you feeling on this bright and glorious day not too bad croaked grandma georgina not too bad at all considering my age good for you said mr wonka atta girl all weve got to do now is find out exactly how old you are then we shall be able to take further action youre taking no further action around here said mrs bucket tightlipped youve done enough damage already but my dear old muddleheaded mugwump said mr wonka turning to mrs bucket what does it matter that the old girl has become a trifle too old we can put that right in a jiffy have you forgotten wonkavite and how every tablet makes you twenty years younger we shall bring her back we shall transform her into a blossoming blushing maiden in the twink of an eye what good is that when her husbands not even out of his nappies yet wailed mrs bucket pointing a finger at the oneyearold grandpa george so peacefully sleeping madam said mr wonka let us do one thing at a time i forbid you to give her that beastly wonkavite said mrs bucket youll turn her into a minus again just as sure as im standing here i dont want to be a minus croaked grandma georgina if i ever have to go back to that beastly minusland again the gnoolies will knickle me fear not said mr wonka this time i myself will supervise the giving of the medicine i shall personally see to it that you get the correct dosage but listen very carefully now i cannot work out how many pills to give you until i know exactly how old you are thats obvious isnt it it is not obvious at all said mrs bucket why cant you give her one pill at a time and play it safe impossible madam in very serious cases such as this one wonkavite doesnt work at all when given in small doses youve got to throw everything at her in one go youve got to hit her with it hard a single pill wouldnt even begin to shift her shes too far gone for that its all or nothing no said mrs bucket firmly yes said mr wonka dear lady please listen to me if you have a very severe headache and you need three aspirins to cure it its no good taking only one at a time and waiting four hours between each youll never cure yourself that way youve got to gulp them all down in one go its the same with wonkavite may i proceed oh all right i suppose youll have to said mrs bucket good said mr wonka giving a little jump and twirling his feet in the air now then how old are you my dear grandma georgina i dont know she croaked i lost count of that years and years ago dont you have any idea said mr wonka of course i dont gibbered the old woman nor would you if you were as old as i am think said mr wonka youve got to think the tiny old wrinkled brown walnut face wrinkled itself up more than ever the others stood waiting the oompaloompas enthralled by the sight of this ancient object were all edging closer and closer to the bed the two babies slept on are you for example a hundred said mr wonka or a hundred and ten or a hundred and twenty its no good she croaked i never did have a head for numbers this is a catastrophe cried mr wonka if you cant tell me how old you are i cant help you i dare not risk an overdose gloom settled upon the entire company including for once mr wonka himself youve messed it up good and proper this time havent you said mrs bucket grandma charlie said moving forward to the bed listen grandma dont worry about exactly how old you might be try to think of a happening instead think of something that happened to you anything you like as far back as you can it may help us lots of things happened to me charlie so many many things happened to me but can you remember any of them grandma oh i dont know my darling i suppose i could remember one or two if i thought hard enough good grandma good said charlie eagerly now what is the very earliest thing you can remember in your whole life oh my dear boy that really would be going back a few years wouldnt it when you were little grandma like me cant you remember anything you did when you were little the tiny sunken black eyes glimmered faintly and a sort of smile touched the corners of the almost invisible little slit of a mouth there was a ship she said i can remember a ship i couldnt ever forget that ship go on grandma a ship what sort of a ship did you sail on her of course i sailed on her my darling we all sailed on her where from where to charlie went on eagerly oh no i couldnt tell you that i was just a tiny little girl she lay back on the pillow and closed her eyes charlie watched her waiting for something more everybody waited no one moved it had a lovely name that ship there was something beautiful something so beautiful about that name but of course i couldnt possibly remember it charlie who had been sitting on the edge of the bed suddenly jumped up his face was shining with excitement if i said the name grandma would you remember it then i might charlie yes i think i might the mayflower cried charlie the old womans head jerked up off the pillow thats it she croaked youve got it charlie the mayflower such a lovely name grandpa charlie called out dancing with excitement what year did the mayflower sail for america the mayflower sailed out of plymouth harbour on september the sixth sixteen hundred and twenty said grandpa joe plymouth croaked the old woman that rings a bell too yes it might easily have been plymouth sixteen hundred and twenty cried charlie oh my heavens above that means youre you do it grandpa well now said grandpa joe take sixteen hundred and twenty away from nineteen hundred and seventytwo that leaves dont rush me now charlie that leaves three hundred and and fiftytwo jumping jackrabbits yelled mr bucket shes three hundred and fiftytwo years old shes more said charlie how old did you say you were grandma when you sailed on the mayflower were you about eight i think i was even younger than that my darling i was only a bitty little girl probably no more than six then shes three hundred and fiftyeight gasped charlie thats vitawonk for you said mr wonka proudly i told you it was powerful stuff three hundred and fiftyeight said mr bucket its unbelievable just imagine the things she must have seen in her lifetime said grandpa joe my poor old mother wailed mrs bucket what on earth patience dear lady said mr wonka now comes the interesting part bring on the wonkavite an oompaloompa ran forward with a large bottle and gave it to mr wonka he put it on the bed how young does she want to be he asked seventyeight said mrs bucket firmly exactly where she was before all this nonsense started surely shed like to be a bit younger than that said mr wonka certainly not said mrs bucket its too risky too risky too risky croaked grandma georgina youll only minus me again if you try to be clever have it your own way said mr wonka now then ive got to do a few sums another oompaloompa trotted forward holding up a blackboard mr wonka took a piece of chalk from his pocket and wrote fourteen pills of wonkavite exactly said mr wonka the oompaloompa took the blackboard away mr wonka picked up the bottle from the bed and opened it and counted out fourteen of the little brilliant yellow pills water he said yet another oompaloompa ran forward with a glass of water mr wonka tipped all fourteen pills into the glass the water bubbled and frothed drink it while its fizzing he said holding the glass up to grandma georginas lips all in one gulp she drank it mr wonka sprang back and took a large brass clock from his pocket dont forget he cried its a year a second shes got two hundred and eighty years to lose thatll take her four minutes and forty seconds watch the centuries fall away the room was so silent they could hear the ticking of mr wonkas clock at first nothing much happened to the ancient person lying on the bed she closed her eyes and lay back now and again the puckered skin of her face gave a twitch and her little hands jerked up and down but that was all one minute gone called mr wonka shes sixty years younger she looks just the same to me said mr bucket of course she does said mr wonka whats a mere sixty years when youre over three hundred to start with are you all right mother said mrs bucket anxiously talk to me mother two minutes gone called mr wonka shes one hundred and twenty years younger and now definite changes were beginning to show in the old womans face the skin was quivering all over and some of the deepest wrinkles were becoming less and less deep the mouth less sunken the nose more prominent mother cried mrs bucket are you all right speak to me mother please suddenly with a suddenness that made everyone jump the old woman sat bolt upright in bed and shouted did you hear the news admiral nelson has beaten the french at trafalgar shes going crazy said mr bucket not at all said mr wonka shes going through the nineteenth century three minutes gone said mr wonka every second now she was growing slightly less and less shrivelled becoming more and more lively it was a marvellous thing to watch gettysburg she cried general lee is on the run and a few seconds later she let out a great wail of anguish and said hes dead hes dead hes dead whos dead said mr bucket craning forward lincoln she wailed there goes the train she must have seen it said charlie she must have been there she is there said mr wonka at least she was a few seconds ago will someone please explain to me said mrs bucket what on earth four minutes gone said mr wonka only forty seconds left only forty more years to lose grandma cried charlie running forward youre looking almost exactly like you used to oh im so glad just as long as it all stops when its meant to said mrs bucket ill bet it doesnt said mr bucket something always goes wrong not when im in charge of it sir said mr wonka times up she is now seventyeight years old how do you feel dear lady is everything all right i feel tolerable she said just tolerable but thats no thanks to you you meddling old mackerel there she was again the same cantankerous grumbling old grandma georgina that charlie had known so well before it all started mrs bucket flung her arms around her and began weeping with joy the old woman pushed her aside and said what may i ask are those two silly babies doing at the other end of the bed one of thems your husband said mr bucket rubbish she said where is george im afraid its true mother said mrs bucket thats him on the left the other ones josephine you you chiselling old cheeseburger she shouted pointing a fierce finger at mr wonka what in the name of now now now now now said mr wonka let us not for mercys sake have another row so late in the day if everyone will keep their hair on and leave this to charlie and me we shall have them exactly where they used to be in the flick of a flys wing the babies grow up bring on the vitawonk said mr wonka well soon fix these two babies an oompaloompa ran forward with a small bottle and a couple of silver teaspoons wait just one minute snapped grandma georgina what sort of devilish dumpery are you up to now its all right grandma said charlie i promise you its all right vitawonk does the opposite to wonkavite it makes you older its what we gave you when you were a minus it saved you you gave me too much snapped the old woman we had to grandma and now you want to do the same to grandpa george of course we dont said charlie i finished up three hundred and fiftyeight years old she went on whats to stop you making another little mistake and giving him fifty times more than you gave me then id suddenly have a twentythousandyearold caveman in bed beside me imagine that and him with a big knobby club in one hand and dragging me around by my hair with the other no thank you grandma charlie said patiently with you we had to use a spray because you were a minus you were a ghost but here mr wonka can dont talk to me about that man she cried hes batty as a bullfrog no grandma he is not and here he can measure it out exactly right drop by drop and feed it into their mouths thats true isnt it mr wonka charlie said mr wonka i can see that the factory is going to be in good hands when i retire you learn very fast i am so pleased i chose you my dear boy so very pleased now then whats the verdict do we leave them as babies or do we grow them up with vitawonk you go ahead mr wonka said grandpa joe id like you to grow my josie up so shes just the same as before eighty years old thank you sir said mr wonka i appreciate the confidence you place in me but what about the other one grandpa george oh all right then said grandma georgina but if he ends up a caveman i dont want him in this bed any more thats settled then said mr wonka come along charlie well do them both together you hold one spoon and ill hold the other i shall measure out four drops and four drops only into each spoon and well wake them up and pop it into their mouths which one shall i do mr wonka you do grandma josephine the tiny one ill do grandpa george the oneyearold heres your spoon charlie took the spoon and held it out mr wonka opened the bottle and dripped four drops of oily black liquid into charlies spoon then he did the same to his own he handed the bottle back to the oompaloompa shouldnt someone hold the babies while you give it said grandpa joe ill hold grandma josephine are you mad said mr wonka dont you realize that vitawonk acts instantly its not one year a second like wonkavite vitawonk is as quick as lightning the moment the medicine is swallowed ping and it all happens the getting bigger and the growing older and everything else all happens in one second so dont you see my dear sir he said to grandpa joe that one moment youd be holding a tiny baby in your arms and just one second later youd find yourself staggering about with an eightyyearold woman and youd drop her like a ton of bricks on the floor i see what you mean said grandpa joe all set charlie all set mr wonka charlie moved around the bed to where the tiny sleeping baby lay he placed one hand behind her head and lifted it the baby awoke and started yelling mr wonka was on the other side of the bed doing the same to the oneyearold george both together now charlie said mr wonka ready steady go pop it in charlie pushed his spoon into the open mouth of the baby and tipped the drops down her throat make sure she swallows it cried mr wonka it wont work until it gets into their tummies it is difficult to explain what happened next and whatever it was it only lasted for one second a second is about as long as it takes you to say aloud and quickly onetwothreefourfive and that is how long it took with charlie watching closely for the tiny baby to grow and swell and wrinkle into the eightyyearold grandma josephine it was a frightening thing to see it was like an explosion a small baby suddenly exploded into an old woman and charlie all at once found himself staring straight into the wellknown and muchloved wrinkly old face of his grandma josephine hello my darling she said where have you come from josie cried grandpa joe rushing forward how marvellous youre back i didnt know id been away she said grandpa george had also made a successful comeback you were betterlooking as a baby grandma georgina said to him but im glad youve grown up again george for one reason whats that asked grandpa george you wont wet the bed any more how to get someone out of bed i am sure said mr wonka addressing grandpa george grandma georgina and grandma josephine i am quite sure the three of you after all that will now want to jump out of bed and lend a hand in running the chocolate factory who us said grandma josephine yes you said mr wonka are you crazy said grandma georgina im staying right here where i am in this nice comfortable bed thank you very much me too said grandpa george at that moment there was a sudden commotion among the oompaloompas at the far end of the chocolate room there was a buzz of excited chatter and a lot of running about and waving of arms and out of all this a single oompaloompa emerged and came rushing toward mr wonka carrying a huge envelope in his hands he came up close to mr wonka he started whispering mr wonka bent down low to listen outside the factory gates cried mr wonka men what sort of men yes but do they look dangerous are they acting dangerously and a what a helicopter and these men came out of it they gave you this mr wonka grabbed the huge envelope and quickly slit it open and pulled out the folded letter inside there was absolute silence as he skimmed swiftly over what was written on the paper nobody moved charlie began to feel cold he knew something dreadful was going to happen there was a very definite smell of danger in the air the men outside the gates the helicopter the nervousness of the oompaloompas he was watching mr wonkas face searching for a clue for some change in expression that would tell him how bad the news was great whistling whangdoodles cried mr wonka leaping so high in the air that when he landed his legs gave way and he crashed on to his backside snorting snozzwangers he yelled picking himself up and waving the letter about as though he were swatting mosquitoes listen to this all of you just you listen to this he began to read aloud the white house washington dc to mr willy wonka sir today the entire nation indeed the whole world is rejoicing at the safe return of our transport capsule from space with souls on board had it not been for the help they received from an unknown spaceship these people would never have come back it has been reported to me that the courage shown by the eight

united states ps could you please bring me a few wonka fudgemallow delights i love them so much but everybody around here keeps stealing mine out of the drawer in my desk and dont tell nanny mr wonka stopped reading and in the stillness that followed charlie could hear people breathing he could hear them breathing in and out much faster than usual and there were other things too there were so many feelings and passions and there was so much sudden happiness swirling around in the air it made his head spin grandpa joe was the first to say something yippeeeeeeeeeee he yelled out and he flew across the room and caught charlie by the hands and the two of them started dancing away along the bank of the chocolate river were going charlie sang grandpa joe were going to the white house after all mr and mrs bucket were also dancing and laughing and singing and mr wonka ran all over the room proudly showing the presidents letter to the oompaloompas after a minute or so mr wonka clapped his hands for attention come along come along he called out we mustnt dilly we mustnt dally come on charlie and you sir grandpa joe and mr and mrs bucket the helicopter is outside the gates we cant keep it waiting he began hustling the four of them toward the door hey screamed grandma georgina from the bed what about us we were invited too dont you forget that it said all eight of us were invited cried grandma josephine and that includes me said grandpa george mr wonka turned and looked at them of course it includes you he said but we cant possibly get that bed into a helicopter it wont go through the door you mean you mean if we dont get out of bed we cant come said grandma georgina thats exactly what i mean said mr wonka keep going charlie he whispered giving charlie a little nudge keep walking toward the door suddenly behind them there was a great swoosh of blankets and sheets and a pinging of bedsprings as the three old people all exploded out of the bed together they came sprinting after mr wonka shouting wait for us wait for us it was amazing how fast they were running across the floor of the great chocolate room mr wonka and charlie and the others stood staring at them in wonder they leaped across paths and over little bushes like gazelles in springtime with their bare legs flashing and their nightshirts flying out behind them suddenly grandma josephine put the brakes on so hard she skidded five yards before coming to a stop wait she screamed we must be mad we cant go to a famous party in the white house in our nightshirts we cant stand there practically naked in front of all those people while the president pins medals all over us ohhhh wailed grandma georgina oh what are we going to do dont you have any clothes with you at all asked mr wonka of

george what with said grandma josephine we dont have any money money cried mr wonka good gracious me dont you go worrying about money ive got plenty of that listen said charlie why couldnt we ask the helicopter to land on the roof of a big shop on the way over then you can all pop downstairs and buy exactly what you want charlie cried mr wonka grasping him by the hand what would we do without you youre brilliant come along everybody were off to stay in the white house they all linked arms and went dancing out of the chocolate room and along the corridors and out through the front door into the open where the big helicopter was waiting near the factory gates a group of extremely importantlooking gentlemen came toward them and bowed well charlie said grandpa joe its certainly been a busy day
