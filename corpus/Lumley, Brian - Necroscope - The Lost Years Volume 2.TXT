a soft sound as of soil crumbling behind him the thing would sneak up on him oh so slowly daham drakesh turned his head on its scrawny neck and looked back and down a mound of dirt was forming pushing up from the loose lumpy floor and in a moment a small eruption when a leprous greygreen tentacle or pseudopod pulsed up into view it thickened swaying like some weird subterranean cobra and formed a rudimentary eye in its tip what the thing saw if it saw or recognized or remembered anything at all in the accepted sense of those words drakesh couldnt say but what it sensed was food the food in his lapor perhaps drakesh himself the tentacle thickened more yet and he felt a creeping shuddering threatening motion in the earth all around then the eye dissolved reforming into faceless gaping jaws and twin rows of nightmarish teeth the swaying increased the earth trembled violently and the drooling jaws came ever closer the thing was on the point of striking when drakesh turned abruptly towards

accustomed to the idea to the feel and looks of his new self which would be problem enough without the additional complications of being harry keogh for harry is the necroscope the man who talks to dead people in their graves moreover employing the formulae of the longdead mathematician and astronomer august ferdinand mobius he has learned the secret of instantaneous travel in space and time hes a teleport but since his death and metempsychosis the necroscopes problems have been unending his wife brenda traumatized by past events and faced with the prospect of life with a total stranger has taken their infant child and vanished off the face of the earth the agents of ebranch the british londonbased espionage agency harry worked for cannot find her and despite his skills harry too is at a loss as to brendas whereaboutsor perhaps not he knows his sons powers are at least as great as his own it is possible that the baby has taken his mother and hidden her away but where in order to devote himself to the search harry has left ebranch and returned to his home outside bonnyrig near edinburgh scotland unknown to him however darcy clarke head of ebranch has taken certain measures to ensure the necroscopes unique skills cant be put to use by alien powers for british ebranch isnt the only parapsychological intelligence organization in the world red china and the soviet union have long followed similar lines of research and run similar covert agencies clarke couldnt simply let harry walk and take a chance that he wouldnt be recruited or coerced by some foreign agency or criminal organization indeed the necroscopes wife and baby may well have been stolen away by such an agency which is why before harry left ebranch brian lumley clarke had him drugged hypnotized and his mind seeded with posthypnotic commands forbidding him to divulge or display his powers to anyone else that was three and a half years ago in some ways clarkes scheme has worked out in harrys favour in others it has added to the complications of his rehabilitation his comingtoterms with the weirdness of his situation in scotland lonely and plagued by nightmares residual echoes of alec kyles precognition inexplicable glimpses of future events harry has developed a romantic relationship with bonnie jean mirlu a wrongheaded girl who helped him out of trouble on a case in london with a staff of attractive girls b j runs a wine bar in a seedy area of edinburgh but the bar is a front and b j mirlu is more than she seems in fact she is a twohundredyearold vampire thrall who all her life has kept watch over an ancient horror from a monstrously alien parallel world her master is radu lykan whose lair is an inaccessible cavern complex in the high cairngorms waiting out his time in suspended animation as he has waited for six centuries radu is wamphyri the first of the wamphyri were banished into our world almost two thousand years ago there were four nonari the gross ferenczy the drakul brothers and the doglord radu lykan a werewolf and they brought with them a bloodfeud that was already hundreds of years old but our world was different its teeming tribes were warriors who had their own bloodwars in which the wamphyri might easily get caught up and crushed it was a far cry from their home world where they had only one real enemy themselves at first they failed to adjust the times were many when they came close to extinction before learning the golden rule for survival that longevity is synonymous with anonymity then gradually they began to blend in with their metamorphism it wasnt dif ficult to play the roles of men in their own world they had been men before they were wamphyri now they must be men again find positions bestsuited to their skills use them to build their powerbases in this new world so the banished vampire lords went their diverse ways they became sparing in the dissemination of their evil they chose their eggsons carefully and made fewer bloodsons mainly they settled in remote areas and kept themselves secret from the affairs of men the drakuls built their redoubts inthetransyhranian mountains where in nine hundred years they became powerful boyars nonari ferenczy fled east from the doglord radu lykan he changed his name became a citizen of rome and eventually the necrosfope the lost years vol ii governor of a small province on the black sea he got vampire sons out of comely slave women these made fives of their own in the gloomy eastfacing mountains which asiatic invaders were loath to climb generally the drakuls and ferenczys would remain covert in their ways they desired that the legends arising out of their earlier days on the danube and the wooded hills of dacia terrible legends of bloodsucking beasts and loping manwolves be forgotten by men in the wake of all the bloody wars that had washed across those parts and in the main they were forgotten but as for radu lykan with that of a wolf in him he was the wild one initially radu ignored the tenets of the rival lords he would not hide himself away but go out in the world become a mercenary revel in the reek and roil of warfare which he did with tremendous enthusiasm and as the other vampire lords established themselves in their various places radu and his pack became warhounds caring nothing for isolation or anonymity but lusting after the spoil of sacked cities they fought as mercenaries for personal gain as well as for the sheer joy of it under human warlords whose knowledge and skill in battle was varied far beyond that of any vampire lord in the world of radus origin thus he became an artful warrior in his own right but eventually following an act of human treachery radu knew it was time to take stock returning to romania the doglord determined to isolate himself in a mountain den except he must find a livelihood and the only way he knew was by the blood which is the life wherefore he built an aerie and set himself up as voevod a warlord protector to the mountaindwelling peasants of the eastern carpathians but the drakuls longestablished in the western arms of the carpathian horseshoe knew his plan they swept down on him to murder him and destroy his manse radu wasnt to house but when he returned and saw what was donehe knew who to blame there was nothing he could do about it yet again his pack had been decimated and radu hadnt the manpower to fight back but at least the drakuls had shown their true colours and from now on radu would know where he stood with them indeed he had always known but this was in effect the first actual declaration of war a bloodwar aye down all the centuries from that time forward no quarter would be given or expected by the rival wamphyri factions drakuls and ferenczys their descendants and thralls radu and the pack they formed a farflung triangle of mutal animosity of a hatred and loathing far beyond the passions of any merely human adversaries from time to time they might come into contact though usually they would find it prudent to avoid one another but in the right place at the right time brian lumley blood wiu out and blood will be let out keeping his band small and fighting in many of the ancient worlds great battles radu went on as a mercenary when times allowed he would return to romania which he considered a home of sorts but he knew that the drakuls continued to lord it in the mountains and that his worst enemies the ferenczys were still abroad in the world he begged of his mistress moon that eventually he would meet up with them to right the wrongs they had worked against him and in a way though not entirely as he had wished it his prayers were eventually answered time went by the world changed a new terror came ravaging from the east no conquering mongol horde this time but a horde of rats the black death had come to europe and vampires as well as entirely human beings were dying from it in the vampire world thered been only one human disease that the wamphyri feared leprosy which infected their metamorphic flesh faster than their leeches could repair or replace it now in this world there was another it seemed grotesquely ironic that where the wamphyri were the greatest parasites of all this plague was spread by the very smallest the fleas that infested the asiatic rats the last drakul lived in poland for the duration of the terror poland suffered little or no plague mortality as for any remaining ferenczys at least one may have seen out the plague years on some easilydefended island for at that time they were powerful in the mediterranean but radu lykan was ever the mercenary the adventurer and wanderer and he was caught out in the open fleeing west through a panicstricken plagueridden europe radu was attacked wounded and infected with the plague overburdened with radus strenuous physical lifestyle and the disease in his blood both his parasite grew weak and began to ml him so that by the time he and the survivors of his pack reached scotland he felt exhausted and had but one recourse for a long time the doglord had pondered the preservative perhaps curative powers of resin now he would take refuge in a resin tomb immerse himself in a great vat of the stuff and place his trust in the tenacity of his leech relieved of some of its burden his parasite would have an opportunity first to cure itself then to work on him and it would have ample time in which to perform its duties radu had a skill other than his hypnotism and mentalism he was a server on future times which he glimpsed in oneiromantic dreams scanning the future however is a dubious art the events witnessed may not come to pass exactly as foreseen but the one thing radu saw quite clearly was the duration of his planned sleep more than six hundred years it came as a blow at first but as the doglord got necroscope the lost years vol ii weaker so he resigned himself to the idea in the high cairngorms he prepared a lair and set watchers over it when all was done he consigned himself to the resin that was then and this is now the centuries are flown and the time is right radu will return except first he awaits the coming of a certain mysterious one a manwithtwofaces whom he has scried close at hand in the imminent hour of his resurgence and b j mirlu has brought just such a one to her masters attention the necroscope harry keogh radu communicates telepathically with b j from the resin vat in his cairngorms hideaway when she attends him they converse as if he were up and about he has ordered her to present harry at her earliest opportunity he wants to know the necroscopes mind to see if this is indeed the man of his dreams of the future but radu is not merely curious since his mind is mainly divorced from his physical body by virtue of his long period of suspended animation he cannot be sure that his body is fit and well and that his leech has beaten off his disease however and even in a worstcase scenario he believes he may still survive resurgence by use of metempsychosis mind transference to the body of harry keogh in which event the keogh identity would be entirely subsumed and harry would be radu bonnie jean knows radus plan and is in two minds about it soon to be wamphyri hi her own right if indeed she has not already ascended she would have harry for herself for the moment however she is under radus spell no less than the necroscope is under hers she must obey her master even though her every fibre cries out against it perhaps if she knew harrys history his esoteric skills she would be of a different mind but she cant know for despite that bj is a powerful beguiler second only to radu himself ebranch got to the necroscope first even twicehypnotized he is forbidden to reveal his talents radus hypnotism on the other hand is of a different order it is possible he can even use it to enter harrys mind indeed to achieve metempsychosis he will have to do just that thus harrys secrets may yet be discovered radu is not the only great vampire who survived the turbulent centuries the only original yes but not the last on tibets tingri plateau daham drakesh a drakul is the selfproclaimed high priest of a monastery where he is breeding an army of vampire thralls ostensibly he is in league with a parapsychological unit of the chinese red army based in chungking but in a region as desolate and inaccessible as the roof of the world drakesh is left much to his own devices he knows that radu lykan is still alive and that hell brian lumley soon return as a power in the world drakesh emissaries vampire disciples are searching for radus lair to destroy him before he can reestablish himself likewise the last ferenczys twin brothers have risen to the status of dons of dons in sicily they are not part of the mafia as such but they are advisers to the heads of all the families on a worldwide scale also they are parttime advisers to the kgb the cia and other intelligence organizations their oracle the source of their information is the vastly mutated angelo ferenczy greatgrandson of nonari the gross some three hundred years ago angelos parasite suffered a metabolic breakdown his metamorphism overran him reducing him to a freakish lunatic thing who is now confined to a pit under le manse madonie a villa in the sicilian mountains of the same name his bloodsons anthony and francesco feed him extorting the information that keeps them in business for paradoxically angelos vampire talents have been enhanced by his disorder he is a server and seer of extraordinary power being wamphyri however and mad angelos solutions his answers are seldom direct he obfuscates and plays wordgames to keep his bloodsons guessing but he has warned them of radu lykans imminent return and of what the doglord will do when he returns that hell seek them out to destroy them recently then both daham drakesh and the ferenczys have set to with greater determination to find radu and kill him in his lair before his planned resurrection they have discovered his keeper bj mirlu and know that she has the assistance of harry keogh except they believe him to be alec kyle also it would appear that this same kyle has somehow contrived to break into the ferenczys treasure vault at their impregnable manse and make off with millions in negotiable currencys daham drakesh who has kept himself secret even from the ferenczys is playing agent provocateur he has sent disciples into scotland to take out bonnie jean mirlu and stir up additional trouble between radu and the ferenczys drakeshs plan has backfired protected by the necroscope bj has survived drakeshs bloodson and a thrall have paid the ultimate price at le manse madonie the ferenczys are furious over their own losses they believe the breakin was a preemptive strike by radus people to discover their weaknesses before the doglords return and the commencement of allout war in addition they are now aware of a third player for one of their thralls a sleeper in scotland has witnessed something of the death of drakeshs disciples at the hands of harry keogh but while drakeshs losses are considerable he still plans to be the necroscope the lost years vol h ultimate agent provocateur in possession of a means to set not only vampires but nations at each others throats the last drakul is simply biding his time while continuing to plot against his own kind and humanity in generaland bj mirlu and alec kyle specifically there are desperate dangerous times ahead for harry and bonnie jean not least because the necroscopes mind is under her control already many of the things that have happened to him are blank spaces in his memory missing from his life like pages ripped from a book as such they are part of the lost years o s i two of them waited in the snow both predators however disparate in means and motives the first was a man while the otherwas other it was other than wholly human that of humanity was in it but there was a great deal of something else it was parthuman female and part other though the man was unaware of the things presence it had been here for some time watching him put the finishing touches to his lair this was something that it understood well enough the compulsion to build a lair a base of operations a secret private place to call ones own indeed far to the north inaccessible in a mountain fastness the thing knew of just such a lair not its own but that of a higher one normally at this time of the year the month the thirtyday cycle at this ohsodangerous time the shething might even be there attending her master in his lair but not this time for this time one of her own was threatened which meant that she herself was threatened and this was her response to watch and wait for the moment while the human predator prepared his lair but there are lairs and there are lairs the mans lair wasnt intended as a permanent structure scarcely a structure at all it wasa hollow a burrow a low cave scooped out of the snow drifted against the side of a knoll at the foot of the hills like a playplace such as children might make except it wasnt a playplace and he wasnt a child its roof was the hard crystallized snow that crusted the drift layered now with the grey camouflaging cover of a fresh fall its floor was of hardpacked snow compressed by the body weight of the man during the process of excavation the cavity was eight feet long four and a half wide three and a quarter deep a fragiletemporary place at best yet still a lair the den of a monstrous human beast and the beast had completed his work on it a full ten minutes ago ntcroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley something less than one hundred and fifty feet away and seventy higher up the steep hillside in the lee of a rocky outcrop the thing sat watched scented generally sensed the mans activity she knew what he had done the preparations he had made and those he was making even now her eyes of a penetrating feral yellow with crimson cores yet alive with a sentience far beyond the ken of the wild a more than merely animal cunning gazed down on the snowcapped knoll and the mans lair at its base she watched the soft outlines and silhouettes disrupted by his work gradually regaining their bland white anonymity as the snow continued to fall penetrating eyes yes they saw the fault red glimmer of a torch switched on even through the caves icecrystal roof and a second torch to lend the lair a sensual bloodhued illumination at last all grew still except to the things differently intelligent mind her alien perceptions a sense of the mans actions inside his lair his final preparations at which she knew that the human predator intended to go through with it then maintaining a low profile her chest ploughing the snow which tumbled before her in a small silent avalanche the thing came down from the hillside where the ground was uneven she wriggled where the snow was thin she slid on belly and paws but on a weathered snowcovered scree saddle between the hillside and the knoll she halted crouched down low listened and continued to sense she was now less than sixty feet from die mans lair and only twenty feet higher as yet the things telepathy wasnt of a high order it could scarcely be compared with the mentalism of her master in his northern lair but there are other arts and the human predator wasnt unknown to her for which reason she attempted to reach out to him across the distance of two dozen paces and implant this message in his mind you were given a warning there is still time to heed it what you do now is of your own free will and its result win be as you willed it perhaps something of it got through to the man he switched off a penlight torch paused in his pigeyed scrutiny of grotesquely lewd photographs in a wallet of pornographic poses cocked his head on one side and adopted a frowning listening attitude but there was nothing to hear except in his head like a memory this one is not for you to pursue and take her will place you in extreme jeopardy no not like a memory it was a memory but from where from when some thought hed had some premonition the customary lump in his throat as the final phase of an operation moved towards its inevitable conclusion an attack ofwhat conscience scarcely that his good side then telling him this need not be inevitable but it was it was and he must have her by now she would at be on her way coming soon hed be coming too then her blood cominghot spurts from the raw red gash of her throat gradually slowing like a well drying up the well of her life her hot breasts cooling elastic for now but slowly stiffening her face pale as the snow eyes glazed as the ice on the beck he shuddered it was awfuland it was wonderful like being a strange dark god the power of life and death but not really for a god has a choice and the man had none afterwardsshe must die only let her live and shed talk it would be the end of everything they would find him shed identify him theyd crucify him not like the son of a god but like a beast not on a cross but in a cell behind bars forever or for as long as the other inmates allowed him to live strange how even the most vile and violent men hated his sort he had been to the place where she worked a darkish place and red like his snow cave of red light so shed lived and so she would die like a temptress all who lived as she had lived luring and teasing and promising but never living up to the promise took their chances so shed taken hers and he had taken his just going there to the place where she workedbut of course he must in order to know all about her hed gone there two or three times yet couldnt remember a thing about it exceptit was dark redlit with darkeyed loreleis serving drinks the loreleia legend out of germanyit was associational thered been places like it hi hamburg low music low lights lowlife he had been a sergeant then but his rank had given him no special privileges with the nightclub girls oh the men in his platoon had had them whores galore but the only way hed been able to get it was to pay for it how hed hated that the fact that they rarely took him a second time not even for his lousy geld thered been something about his eyes somethingcold in his eyes cold yes for other men it was heat that went with lust but for him it was the cold that turned him on six years ago in die harz mountains on a winter warfare course he remembered being holedup for a week on a snowcovered mountain allegedly acquiring survival skills while in fact fantasizing about sex with hot quivering naked women that was where die notion had first occurred to him in die harz in germany brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii but snow is snow the world over and women are women good for nicking but small use for anything else except a man cant be a real man without he at least has the use of a womans body but only the use since the permanent possession of a woman the burden of ownership will very quickly reduce him to less than a man that was the lairbunders understanding of malefemale relationships anyway a paradox where the man always came out the loser and it had seemed to him that there ought to be an alternative well and so there was and this was it but since it served only the needs of a minority of one it was unacceptable to the majority sofuck the majority how he wished he could except from his point of view the society that rejected him had its own predators they were called police and he was their prey or would be but he was wily and they hadnt caught him yet almost but not quite not yet there are predators and predators known and unknown even among the known sort you are only a small creature of the kind while among the unknown things you are a speck a mote a minuscule so back off now while yet you may what talking to himself again that recurrent dream hed been having of something awesome stalking him not conscience no but guilt pure and simple for he was the stalker the awesome one he shrugged off the feeling of eyes where there were no eyes and warning voices where there couldnt possibly be a short distance away the thing crouching at the crest of the scree saddle sensed the mans rejection of her her what her reminder its suggestion sensed anyway the human beasts resolution his determination the fact that he would indeed go through with it so be it it was of his own free will beyond the knoll the narrow road was an icy black ribbon chopped two feet deep through the snow maintained by the snowplough team that serviced the local villages the road had last been cleared two hours ago since when it had furred over again with a pelt of fresh snow through which the tarmacs black ice glittered like jet in these parts conditions such as this were common the weather would have to be a lot harsher to dose the roads completely and in any case this was only a service road to the hamlet the mam highway to perth in the north and dunfermline and edinburgh in the south lay a mile and a half away through a pass hi the ochil hills the tiny hamlet itself sma auchterbecky lay in a valley or reentry in the ochils this was the only road hi it came to an abrupt halt at a wooden footbridge over the currently frozen beck where the road ended a blacktopped rectangle served a dual purpose as a turning place for vehicles and as the hamlets communal car park the squat humped anonymous shapes of jacketed cars three of them sma auchterbeckys total vehicular complement crouched on the parking area like a trio of oddly frozen mammoths on some siberian tundra no longer black but greytopped under a layer of snow the rectangle turned briefly to glittering white as the light of a full moon penetrated the threatening cloud blanket only a momentary effect a churning of leaden snowladen clouds allowing just one blink of the silver cyclops eye still the thing felt it like the jab of a cattle prod magnetized by the moon a ridge of erectile fur stiffened along her spine lured by the lunar orb sound died unborn aborted with difficulty in her throbbing throat but at the same time a need was born in her belly the crimson cores of her eyes expanded driving back the feral yellow her jaws dripped saliva her head turned muzzle twitching from the safely sealed vault of the sky back to the cyst in the snow that was the mans lair all of her awareness was now centred on the cavern of the beast the human beast where he lay on his back masturbating by red torchlight to a pornographic centrefold ripped from a mens magazine the thing smelled his sex heard his pounding heartbeat and sensed the coursing of his rich blood but this was scarcely the climax of the mans activity merely a part of it the last part as hereadied himself for everything was now in position and the predator was poised only one thing was missing the prey and she was coming it called for one final effort on the part of the thing for to simply let this go ahead to encourage it if only by noninterference might in the long run mean endangering herself indeed in any other scenario but this one the man might even be considered her ally her cover but not when he threatened one of her own wherefore you are making a mistake there is great danger here but despite all the effort she put into it the man heard nothing or if he heard anything at all it was only an echo from that dream again of the redlit darknessof the loreleis taunting and flaunting their fleshof the awesome stalker not himselfafter all but some other or rather some others voice in his head questioning whose simple questions he couldnt refuse but must answer that was what really stalked him gnawed at him the idea that he might have told someone his innermost thoughts butin a dream it returned as dreams are wont to do unexpectedly finally he remembered it something of it at least he stood on a black road on a black night and gazed into the yawning throat of a black tunnel cut in a black mountainside and he was frozen there bereft of will unable to move a muscle as something approached bearing down on him in dreadful inexorable slowmotion out of the tunnel its yellow headlights shone on him fixed him in their brian lumley necroscope the last years vol ii blinding glare froze him like a rabbit in his tracks then from the utter darkness behind the dazzling yellow lights a question why and he knew the meaning of it also that he must answer because i want her for her body yes only for that and for her life my i cant leave a tndl cant leave any tracks tracks i mean she would talk youve done it before have you done it before yes how often i three times p murder not for the sake of murder but for the sake of my needsat first anyway youve killed innocents they werent innocent shaking their backsides flashing their tits they were asking for it and att the while the yellow headlights expanding coming ever closer and the darkness behind them and surrounding them growing darker yet when soon when it snows good and deep where hesitation he shouldnt be telling this not even in a dream not even to himself but he couldn t refuse to answer th do it where she lives how ill wait for her and do it in the snow a long pause and then ofyour own free witt aye but i warn you rtts one is not for you to pursue and take her witt place you in extreme jeopardy but if you must so be it then the headlights sweeping upon him expanding to envelop him the darkness opening as if to swallow him whole a rumbling growl that wasnt the thunder of an engine and the headlightsthe headlights not yellow but i red the man gave his head a shake snapped out of it he had been daydreaming staring at his red torches where hed rammed their tubes into the soft snow walls staring as if hypnotized by them hypnotized had he been hypnotized by someone somewhere he blinked then issued a snort of selfderision maybe he was losing it maybe he was mad but it didnt change anything neither did his dream already slipping away fading into the mists of his twisted mind nothing had been changed his course was set he was going to do it so be it hidden in the shadow of the hillside the thing slid and tobogganed on her chest and belly down the slope of the saddle to level ground she was only fifty feet or so from the predators lair now his mans scent hung heavy in the sharp otherwise clean night air which pulsed with his vibrations he was a strong one just as she remembered him good and his timing was perfect headlights on full beam sliced the night cut twin swaths through the silently falling snow swung like searchlight beams towards the hamlet across the frozen beck but without reaching it myriads of drifting snowflakes diffused the light reducing its penetrative power likewise the sound of the taxis engine muffled by the snow maybe this was what the predator had been dreaming of the arrival of the taxi its lights and the purr of its engine and out from his lair he crept invisible in a white nylon tracksuit and parka the hood zipped to the neck and his face hidden behind a white stocking mask meanwhile the taxi had slowed turned halted on the hardstanding a female figure was getting out standing in the pale glow from the drivers window the oval of her face was visible inside the furlined hood of her coat she fumbled with payment for her ride then the taxis door slammed it pulled carefully away in a crump of crushed snow and a puff of exhaust smoke and clasping the neck of her coat close to her throat the girl tramped freshfallen snow towards the footbridge but before she could reach it out of nowhere the predator was there before her her instinctive involuntary gasp galvanized him to violent action as her eyes went wide and she tried to jerk herself out of reach he stifffingered her deep in the stomach and as the air shed drawn to scream whooshed uselessly out of her and she folded forward from the first blow he hit her again this time in the throatbut not hard enough to kill not yet choking she crumpled her feet shot out from under her on the necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley icy surface if he hadnt caught her she would have fallen and with his right arm under her neck breast and armpit and his other hand in her hair he dragged her writhing form back across the road to the side of the knoll he was tittering now but couldnt help it little girls laughter that bubbled up in his throat to spill from his mouth in short bursts hyena laughter excited but muted the call of a wild dog to the pack as it tracks its wounded prey hooting and giggling but softly and between each crazed burst a guttural frothing spray of obscenity fuck fuckwe fuck fuck fuck and his flesh hard and throbbing under the zipper of his tracksuit trousers the girl was making a recovery she fought harder as he dragged her round the foot of the knoll to his snowcaves low entrance he paused to grip her throat and crush it shake her head like the head of a rag doll until she went quiet then he was dragging her into his denhis redglowing lustlair inside he hauled her up alongside kneeled over her she moaned and clutched her throat trying to breathe as he showed her his mad smile his teeth his pig eyes he wrenched at his zipper and his steaming meat jerked and nodded into view smelling it her eyes went wide with knowledge she knew his intention what he would do her coat was open his hand raked down the front of her blouse caught at her bra popped buttons and ripped material her breasts lolled out hot and quivering for you he waved his swollen throbbing penis at her urururghf she gurgled and choked trying to rise up on her elbows he backhanded her not too hard just a slap to let her know who was boss here which rocked her head back and stretched her prone then reached down snatched up her short skirt and groped between her legs for her panties god hed be into her in a minutebiting her titsshooting his spunk a whole years worth into her hot slimy little his obscene giggling and mouthings were cut short in a moment for holding her neck looking down between her legs looking back at the burrow entrancesomeone was there he recognized the scene immediately the prescience of it falling like a hammer blow on his mind so that he jerked back from it as if shot his dream but no longer a dream the dark tunnel and yellow headlights except as he now saw the headlights were eyes great yellow eyes triangular unblinking hypnotic and oh so intelligent and the voice when it came that soft burr of a scottish brogue more growled than spoken but hinting of a monstrous strength no longer the suppressed memory of a conversation but real immediate now you were warned were ye no warned ye wha wha wha i warned ye this one was no for ye to pursue her would place ye in jeopardy most extreme aye but ye ignored mah warning so be it ma wha wha he groped for his knife found it the blade gleamed red in red torchlight but the thing inching forward in the tunnel wasnt in the least afraid and suddenly it was as if the predator were really there back in his dream once again he stood on a black road gazing into the yawning black throat of a tunnel and as before he was frozen unable to move a muscle as something awesome bore down on him in a dreadful inexorable slowmotion its yellow eyes shone on him freezing him rigid while the darkness surrounding those eyes grew darker yet it had never been a dream but it was a nightmare the headlight eyes expanding to envelop him the darkness opening to swallow him whole the rumbling growl that wasnt the roar of an engine but the eyes those awful eyes no longer feral yellow the face emerging from the darkness wasnt human it was triangular ears pointing forward pointing at the man bottom jaw yawning open great yellow headlight eyesturning luminous red as red as blood eh said the man simply that it scarcely qualified as a question and wasnt even close to a scream no more than a squeak or a whimper as a hand a paw something reached out of the tunnel arched for a moment like a great grey furry spider over his leg and drove home inches deep through tracksuit trousers and flesh to scrape the bone of his thigh tjien he screamed dropped the knife tried to hang on to the girl where she had finally managed to sit upand where she sat there smiling at him but there are smiles and there are smiles and her eyes were as yellow as the things had been just a moment ago rapt on him watching him being dragged into the tunnel and her ears seemed to reach tremblingly forward like the things ears eager for his panting bubbling screams and the terrible rrrip of his clothing and flesh as talons sharp as razors opened him up the middle like a steaming screaming joint of meat after that amid all the slobbering snarling and panting it was as much as the girl could do to cram herself in a corner and so avoid the hot red splashes knowing the thing the way she did she knew how dangerous it would be to try to take her share well not for a little while at least part one the sleeping and the undead inspector ianson investigates it was ten in the morning but at this time of year in this place it might just as easily be four in the evening under a heavy blanket of lowering snow clouds and in the shadow of the hills the time made little or no difference everything looked greyexcept that which now lay exposed with the snow shovelled back from it under the canopy of a scenesofcrime canvas rigged up by the local police that what was left of it was not grey but red very red and torn animal said old angus mcgowan giving a curt knowing nod a creature did it an a big yin at that aye thats what we thought inspector lanson returned the old mans nod a beast for sure thats why we called you in angus but now the big question what sort of a beast and how a beasti mean up here in the snow and all eh angus mcgowan looked at the police inspector curiously even scathingly up here in the snow and a whywhere else man lanson shrugged and shivered but not entirely from the cold where else he frowned as he pondered his old friend and rivals meaning then shrugged again just about anywhere else i should think the african veldt maybe the australian outback india but scotland what and auld windy edinburgh herself little more than seven or eight miles away no lions or tigers or bears up here angus not unless they escaped from a zoo which is the other reason i called you in on it as well you know angus glanced at him through rheumy watering eyes the cold and just as the inspector himself had felt it maybe something other than the cold had seeped through to the old vefs bones but then the sight of bloody violent unnatural death will have a similar effect on most men necroscope the lost yean vol ii brian lumley inspector lanson was tall well over six feet and thin as a pole but for all that he was getting on a bit in years george lanson remained spry and alert mentally and physically active homicide was his job and this was his beat his area of responsibility a roughly kiteshaped region falling between edinburgh and glasgow east to west stirling and dumfries north to south outside that kite a man could get himself killed however he might or might not choose and his body never have to suffer the cold calculating gaze of george lanson but inside it africa india angus echoed the gangling inspector then squinted at the tossed and tangled corpse before shaking his head in denial no no george she was no big cat this yin nor a dogbut like a dog aye it was lansons turn to study the other dour old angus mcgowan whom hed known for years a living caricature typically a canny old scotsman hugging his knowledge as close to his chest as a gambler with his cards or a rich man with his wealth his rheumy grey eyes the eyes of a hawk for all that they were misted missed nothing his blueveined nose seemed sensitive as a bloodhounds his knowledge brimmed in the library of his brain like an encyclopaedia of feral lore quite simply as the inspector was gifted to know men their ways and minds and in his case especially their criminal minds so angus was gifted to know animals between the two of them on those rare occasions when the one might call upon the other for his expert knowledge it had become a game a competition no less than the chess game they played once a week in the inspectors study at his home in dalkeith for here too however serious the case they vied one with the other trying each others minds to see which would come closest to the truth the beauty of it was this in chess theres only one winner but here they could both win like a dog lanson looked again deeply into mcgowans watery eyes his wrinkled face old angus all five foot four or five of him shrivelled as last years walnuts but standing tall now with some sure knowledge some inner secret that loaned him stature nodding and careful to avoid the bloodied snow he went to one knee not that it mattered greatly no need to worry about the destruction of evidence now the scenesofcrime men had been and gone all of an hour ago but angus didnt want this poor devils blood on his good overcoat looking up at lanson from where he kneeled and had the situation been other than it was the slighter man might well have grinned instead he grimaced tapped the side of his dripping nose with his index finger and answered shall we say oh ah dinnae ken a dog o sorts shall we say a dog or a bitch o a different colour like maybe grey a great grey dog angus could mean only one sort of beast ridiculous except he wasnt given to making ridiculous statements wherefore from a zoo lanson gripped mcgowans shoulder as he made to straighten up or maybe a circus have you heard of an escape then has one got out one what the other was all wideeyed innocence come now angus the inspector tuttutted a wild creature of the snows like a great grey handsome dog you can only be hinting at a wolf surely hintin is it the other chuckled however drily and was serious in a moment ahm no hintin george ye want mah opinion this was a wolf aye an one hell of a wolf at that but escaped frae a zoo he shook his head not in denial more out of puzzlement ahve never come across a beast this size no in any zoo in england scotland or wales at least and as for yere circuses what at this time of year certainly no up here an so well ah really canna say ah mean ah wouldnae care to commit mahsel but youve done exactly that the inspector pointed out the piece is moved angus you cant put it back wolf aye the other snapped more decisively now but as for how she got here her origin he offered a twitch of his thin shoulders stamped numb feet blew into cupped hands if s your move george its your move mei say we move in out of the cold lanson shook himself both mentally and physically breathed deeply of the wintry air deliberately forced himself to draw back from the morbid spell the dreadful fascination of the case for the moment anyway for if mcgowan was right which in all likelihood he was then it was out of his hands murder by a man is one thingbut by a dog a wolf or some other wild creature then it becomes something else a savaging a misadventure simply a killing but mcgowan was right then theyd need to call in a different kind of hunter with a very different brief to kill on sight old angus guessed what he was thinking the latter part of it anyway and was quick to say but first we must try to prove it or narrow down the suspects at least back to the house lanson ducked out into the open with his small friend close behind the house he referred to was one of a picturesque cluster standing some three hundred yards away across brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol u the footbridge once a great farm with outbuildings now sma auchterbecky housed a small community scarcely a hamlet in the very lee of the mountains ah can make a few calls frae there aye angus nodded dye see the telephone wires and ive a few more questions for the girl the inspector replied turning up the collar of his coat he scanned the land all about noted that it had started to snow again great fat flakes that fell straight out of a leaden sky in the lowering atmosphere there was little or no wind a pretty enough place in the summer mcgowan commented but in the winter a hell o a place for a man tae die huh an a hell o a way for one tae die too they stood side by side a while scanning the valley between the hills nearby a police land rover hunched on the verge at the side of the road also a squad car fitted with snow chains and an ambulance with its rear doors open waiting the blue lights of the vehicles silently revolving loaned eerie intermittent illumination to the handful of stamping armflapping uniformed policemen and paramedics in attendance exhaust fumes from the land rover went up in a bluegrey spiral mimicking the smoke from the cluster of neardistant cottage chimneys lanson signalled the paramedics forward now they could take the body its remains out of here the forensic lab in edinburgh would be its next port of call then the morgue but there wouldnt be much gutting of this one hed had more than his fair share of that already a hell of a way to die the inspector echoed his companion curiously enigmatically or maybe a weird sort ofi dont know justice maybe there was that in his voice which caused old mcgowan to glance at him sharply something hed not been informed of then oh the vet would stand by his claim to the bitter end that this was the work of a wolf for hed seen evidence which to him was indisputable but lanson was the policeman after all and a damned good one anyway it wouldnt do to press the point a man cant be seen to know too much or he might have too much explaining to do a hunch is one thing but an assertion needs proving justice angus let his sharp tone reveal his own suspicions somethin yeve nae told me george it was hardly surprising this was the way their game usually went lansons smile was grim oh a lot to come from this yet angusnot least from you nothings solved until everything is known and before the other could question further lets get on over to the house now we can talk as we go i know him lanson admitted as they crossed the footbridge the victim victim villain whatever the inspector shrugged john moffafs his name i wouldnt have known his body who would but i recognized his face moffat aye prime suspect in a murder case in glasgow just a year ago then too hed done it in the snow a park on the outskirts of the city in the wee small hours of the morning the same modus operandi he dug a hole in a snowdrift chose a prostitute on her way home and dragged her in he raped and murdered her slit her throat ear to ear hed been seen in the park earlier there were one or two other bits of inconclusive evidencenot enough to pin it on him he walked away frae it mcgowan nodded but not away from this one lansons voice was grim so its one downbut its still one to go yere saying that this waswhat revenge which means ye believe it was a man a man and his bloody big dog maybe lanson glanced at him out the corner of his eye maybe he answered which would put the whamrny on your wolf theory the other made no reply it suited him either way he knew that lanson wouldnt have asked him along if he hadnt at least suspected a large canine or some other animal the inspector had admitted as much i only know that someone protected the girl lanson went on except he did too damn thorough a job of it someone close to the glasgow prostitute maybe eh aye possibly close to that one anyway oh has there been more than one then unfair george mcgowan tuttutted a man cannae play if the lights are out ah have tae know all yere moves one more at least lanson said gleneagles two winters ago in the snow again and no too far away at that a prostitute was she aye we didnt find that one until the first of the warm weather when the snow melted shed been there a month or more any evidence had been washed away our wee man back there could have done it though again same modus operandi but of course we didnt know him then he didnt come into the picture until the glasgow thing and thats it thats it for the prostitute murderswell as far as im aware of course there could be others we dont know about people disappear and are never found as well you know and again he gave that sideways glance but if our man john moffat wasnae linked to the gleneagles murder and if who or whatever killed him was somebody out for brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii revenge then this new killer can only be someone who knew the glasgow girl surely lanson frowned or someone who knew john moffat what he was doing someone close to him maybe who thought it was time he was stopped no just someone protectin this girl especially then eh lanson paused and stared hard at the other when i said shed been protected i meant by accident by someone just happening on the scene as it were ye hadnae thought o the other sort o protection then that this ones pimp might have been lookin out for her pimp well it follows that if yere man only kills whores the girl must be one and if so she probably has a pimp someone and his dog who was waiting for her when she got dropped off last night the inspector started then grinned and took the others arm above the elbow frail as old angus seemed the resilience of his flesh never failed to surprise lanson he felt the muscles move under the mans clothing bunching at his unexpected grip as if resenting it now see lanson said what a grand team we make why its possible yeve just hit the nail right on the head mcgowan freed himself and said maybe but its like ye said nothings solved until everything is known and now it was time to change direction again personally well ah still opine tae a big animal on its own a wild thing come down out o the hills tae hunt i thought we had discounted the wolf theory the inspector was making for the houses again no you had mcgowan told him but me ah have several theories see if yed no told me about they other murders or that this john moffat was a suspect ahd still be thinkin in terms o a wild yin and deep down inside ah still am a wild one how long ago since there was a wild wolf in scotland angus two hundred and fifty years that we know of the other answered but scotlands a big place and plenty of wild country still all over the world the wolves are stealin back down frae the north so why not here because were an island angus thats why is that so then explain the big cats on bodmin moor and dartmoor and other places sheep killers them and real not proven lanson said proven for mah money mcgowan snorted ah was down in devon and cornwall remember they called me in on it no ah didnae see the beasts in question but ah saw their handiwork big cats george take mah word for it my god youll be swearing an oath on nessie yet lanson grinned they called you in on that one too didnt they that american team three months work there george it was the easiest money ah ever made in mah life what a summer holiday on the banks o loch ness with all found and money in the bank mcgowan chuckled and smacked his lips and then was serious again anyway ah was only a technical adviser ah didnae have tae believeno as long as they thought ah did but a wolf is no a plesiosaur george they big yins have been gone a long time but there are still wolves in the world not in scotland the other was stubborn ah but there could be soon enough eh theres talk o stocking a sanctuary somewhere up north theyd have tae cull them o course or shoot any that strayed too far but theres a study on it really well why not the wolves have been here just as long as we have and there are still foxes after all even the cities have foxes ah mean is it no ridiculous the irish have their irish wolfhounds and never a wolf to be found except here but angus only shrugged from now on he would take a back seat and only do or say what was expected of him he had talked of men and he had talked of wolves but hed not once mentioned the creature in between nor would he unlike the loch ness monster who really didnt exist that would be just too close for comfort but in the final analysis if and when it should come to it it would be no bad thing for inspector george lanson to have a wolf on his mindor even a werewolf for as a legend the creature was far enough removed from certain other myths to make it unique in its own right no one in his right mind would confuse an isolated case of strictly medical or pathological lycanthropy with vampirism it might alert humanity to the one type of monster in its midst but the other would remain obscure as ever while the inspector talked to the girl margaret macdowell old angus spent the time on the telephone when both were done they thanked the girl for coffee and sandwiches then walked back to lansons car it was snowing again and the path was white under foot on their way into edinburgh they talked no whore that lady lanson said she sells booze not her body works at a wine bar in edinburgh thats why she was late home late opening hours it might easily have been later still but her boss lets brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii her off early if the forecast is bad as you probably overheard moffat had been frequenting the bar chatting up the other girls too but paying particular attention to margaret macdowell she knew his first name thats all she did recognize him however barely or briefly during the attack after hed dragged her into hiswhat his den and she knew that he would kill her before she passed out she sensed that someone else was there and she woke up toall that mess she thinks she remembers snarling and savage motion and something of mof fats gibbering and thats about it ye spoke to her before the police drove me up here old angus was thinking out loud didnae ye get any o this then she was tired shaken shocked lanson shrugged still is but refuses treatment cant say i blame her she has a few bruises thats all shes young and the shock wont last yes i got something of it but the stuff about the snarling is new she may remember more as she settles down so no whore mcgowan mused but easily mistaken for one the other returned a bar girl all long legs a backside like an apple and a halfbare bosom decked out in a short dress black stockings and garters serving drinks to a mainly male clientele oh our mr moffat could easily get the wrong idea im sure a modern jack the ripper mcgowan grunted except this one got ripped lanson reminded him grimly and no surgical instruments did that to him be sure a man and his dog old angus mused but no tracks the snow the inspector grunted so whats next for you i expect youll carry on contacting and checking out all the zoos and wildlife parks in the area lanson glanced at the smaller man so that we can be absolutely sure that theres been no escape id certainly appreciate it angus for theytl talk more easily to you than to me as for meill need to be talking to the other girls at margaret macdowells place of work b js wine bar in town but ive little doubt theyll corroborate all shes said so why bother oh routine lanson shrugged who knows maybe they can tell me more about john moffat did he have any enemies or such that they might know of that sort of thing like a man and his dog just so or the inspector wondered maybe a woman and her dog on that point thered been several occasions when the old vet had mentioned a she in connection with his wolf like she was a big yin and so forth and anyway why had angus strayed so far from his argument his original conclusion had he or hadnt he given up on his wolf theory what about his telephone calls who did you speak to angus lanson glanced at him the zoo people in edinburgh theyre on mah list ah have tae do it ye understand if only tae settle it in mah own mind but in fact youve given up on it now old angus merely shrugged well murder by dog it seems more and more feasible the inspector was mildly concerned mcgowan was saying so very little now probably because he waswhat hiding something this was usually how he was before making some surprise move on the chess board maybe lanson should look more closely at the case from old anguss point of view wherever that was coming from since he now seemed to be making light of his wolf theory perhaps the inspector should pay more attention to it except if angus was onto something lanson felt certain he wouldnt get much more out of him just yet wherefore a second opinion might be in order and if his memory served him he knew just where he might find a lead to that second opinion in the unsolved files at police hq in edinburgh after dropping mcgowan off at his place in a sagging decaying district east of the city the inspector called in at police hq and made a request to records for a list of attacks savagings by animals of people and livestock occurring in the last five years then a quick call to new scotland yard for more information and by the time he was through records had run off some stuff for him too much stuff the incidence of animal attacks usually by pet dogs was surprisingly high he spoke to the clerk in charge and asked him about older cases some thirty years ago i was new on the force but seem to remember a case somewhere up north that made a big splash at die time a sighting a savaging at one of the wildlife parks followed by the resignation of a local policeman he quit after his report was rubbished and he was ridiculed do you think you could dig it out for me the clerk a man thin and tall as lanson himself wearing spectacles squinted at him and said thirty years ago thats a heu of a memory youve got inspector but fm afraid those old files arent on microfiche it could take a while however make a search if thats what youd like lanson nodded yes go ahead if you find the file you can contact me at home brian lumley he took the sheaf of papers home with him to his spacious garret flat in dalkeith made himself a light lunch then took his food and work both into his study and sat with them at his desk under a huge sloping skylight lanson liked natural light best even when it was the dim grey light of winter his chess board stood on a small table to one side of the room with the pieces in position just as he and old angus had left them some nights earlier they would get to finish the game eventually but now there was bigger game afoot munching on chicken salad sandwiches the inspector began scanning the pages of information printed out for him from police hqs microfiche files but after a minute or two realizing that it would take a while to separate out the stuff that interested him and because tonight he intended to visit bjs wine bar in the city he paused to make a telephone call and reserve a little time with the boss of the bar now margaret macdowell had given him the number using it he found his call answered by a female voice with a soft scottish burr he asked for the proprietor and was told that be mahsel bonnie jean mirlu miss mirlu or is it it missus perhaps youre already aware of the attack on one of your girls last night and following that up quickly in case she hadnt heard im talking about margaret macdowell but id like to reassure you that she came to no harm im the inspector on the case its miss the voice told him just call me bj and ahve heard yes margaret called and told me is there somethin ah can do for ye inspector er lanson george lanson ive a question or two you could perhaps help me with routine stuff perhaps tonight opening hours fll make it brief as possible and try not to keep you from your business but what could ah possibly know it was miles frae here and he wasnae even a regular customer just a pest to the lassies thats all you knew him then i really must come to see you bj she sighed and answered well if ye must ye must but ah cannae see what yere hopin tae learn frae me how many of you are therein the bar i mean four all girls and mahsel but yell surely no be wanting to question us all now will ye probably but only a few minutes each i promise verra well then she agreed grudgingly say eightish thatll do nicely he told her until tonight then but after putting the phone down the inspector sat frowning to himself before returning to his papers something about her accent necroscope the lost years vol ii he thought oh it was a very good imitation but it wasnt the real thing wasnt the genuine article or maybe it was too genuine he pondered it a while longer then snapped his fingers that was it b j mirlus accent wasnt phony at all it was simply out of date not quite the modern vernacular he was used to hearing in the city she sounded more like something out of the last century out of the highlands maybe like granny lanson god bless her when george was a lad maybe this b j mirlu was from up north then and the highfalutin accents of edinburgh still alien to her tongue it was something he would have to ask her if only to satisfy his own curiosity it took the inspector some two hours to sort through the photocopy files closed cases went into one sheaf and open cases into another then this second sheaf was subdivided into attacks on animals on people and sightings the latter because there was no lack of reports of large generally unspecified creatures wandering in the wild just such cases as interested angus mcgowan but the inspector would have nothing to do with the likes of bodmin moor wildcats great hounds of dartmoor or nessie o the loch his monsters the monsters of his calling were invariably human or in this case maybe a bit of both a man and his dog aye or maybe a woman and her dog before lanson could look at the relevant parts of the subdivided paperwork his phone rang a call from a friend at new scotland yard in criminal records george we got your request peter yanner told him yanner was an exinspector seeing out his time to retirement behind a desk and i saw the mornings sitreps youll be working on that case at er auchterbecky sma auchterbecky lanson corrected him nasty stuff peter one case closed and another opened indeed said the other and i suppose youll be torn two ways glad to see the one go down but unhappy that a new ones come up like the gang wars down here were never too unhappy about it when a bad lad gets hit but theres always the question of who did it a pity they cant all kill themselves oft eh murder is murder lanson replied john moffats paid his dues but who to he shrugged if only to himself then asked so what have you got for me im just trying to clarify things the other answered big dog attacks you said animals but what about lycanthropy brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii eh we had this bloke who thought he was a werewolf a copkiller too that was three maybe three and a half years ago we got himbut the whole case was weird there were a lot of threads left dangling you know but when the home office puts the cap on something thats it case closed so the inspectors mind had begun to switch elsewhere as soon as lycanthropy was mentioned he couldnt see any connection with the current case he had taken in very little of what hed been told no big savage dog then no genuine big dog anyway well thats why i phoned you the other explained i mean you cant get much bigger than a werewolf now can you finally lansons mind focused he knew that this wasnt for him yet his instincts told him to follow it up you say the case is closed you got him so what makes you think that id be interested i mean lycanthropy peter whats on your mind its just funny thats all funny not haha just funny ok youre probably not in the picture so let me explain this thing with the werewolf the guy was killed with a crossbow with silvered arrowheads what the police used a crossbow lanson was lost again no whoever killed him did we had outside help then the sas no secret service not that i know of just someone out to get him as far as i know and before lanson could question further then a couple of months ago we had this other case up in your neck of the woods what case was that murder up on the spey not far from kincraig you surely remember those tibetans who got killed george sectarian warfare or some such two dead up there in a wrecked car and a whole bunch of them got tossed out of the country lanson frowned i remember the headlines but i wasnt on the case it was outside my jurisdiction anyway what does it have to do with attacks by big dogs or lycanthropy for that matter a possible connection thats all yanner told him it was the same kind of murder weapon a crossbow the same silvered arrowheads too boltheads lanson growled more to himself than to the other whats that a crossbow doesnt shoot arrows but bolts whatever yanner answered but a silver bolt killed our werewolf nut and likewise one of these hari krishna types the other one fried in the wrecked car it might not mean anything i dont know i just sort of connected it up thats all a socalled werewolf and a crossbow with silvered arrowheads er tomeads and your request for stuff on dog or big animal attacks scotland murder and silver boltheads again a bit of a tangle i know but thats how my mind works lanson licked his lips then shook his head despite that yanner couldnt see him but what is there to connect the murder last night and these killings on the spey i mean how does our john moffat fit in i dont see it peter me neither but thats not what im paid for i only keep the books youre the man on the ground anyway maybe i should have kept my nose out im sorry if ive confused the issue no no not at all in fact youve interested me greatly let me have all youve got on this lycanthropy thing will you i mean as well as the routine stuff sure and the case is closed you say yep without a murderer a second murderer i mean the guy was a copkiller george and everyone involved was satisfied with the conclusion apparently weird thats what i told you peter thanks for calling youre welcome and this stuff will be on its way asap cheers and slowly lanson put the phone down after that the paperwork was boringfor a while until the inspector began glancing through the sightings list at first he would read shake his head and muttering disbelievingly to himself put the report aside these socalled sightings covered just about every eventuality nessie was in there of course also feral cats in an attack on a chicken farm at aboyne stray dogs worrying sheep at braemar near balmoral and also at the foot of arthurs seat in edinburgh itself and and wolves seen at newtonmore blair atholl and in the pass of killiecrankie also at crianlarich under ben more and at carrbridge and nethybridge on the spey great grey wolves by god half a dozen cases too many bloody wolves by far so perhaps old mcgowan did know something after all but if so brian lumley why wasnt he saying anything or could it be that he george lanson was simply letting himself get tangled up in this thing in a load of hogwash that is and what the hell werent there always boogy men in these outoftheway places and wouldnt there always be a nessie lurking in the loch well yes just as long as there were tourists there would be for sure a great grey dog with eyes like lanterns seen padding the road on a misty night at newtonmorea wolf not a bit of it just a big dog and the pair spied in the pass of killiecrankie rationalization a man out walking his alsatian dogs steps into the bushes for a pee his dogs stand waiting they maybe rear up a little and draw back onto the verge as a car passes the motorist with a dram or two under his belt no doubt sees their eyes turn to flames in his main beams as for the valley of the spey why a man could swear to seeing anything on a misty moonlit night on those winding wooded lanes and rocky hillsides damn it was only a year ago that theyd been seeing flying saucers and the same down in sussex and crop circles in devon and dorset so what was it that was bothering him lanson wondered and a moment later believed he had the answer he hadnt been able to remember much about it at police hq but now recalled it clearly enough these damned silly reports had jogged his memory about that constable who had quit his job some thirty years ago over just such a sighting but thered been more to it than that nothsf a sightingbut a killing too not of a man but an animal and not just any animal but a bison a creature as big as that gutted as for the location it had taken place at the highland wildlife park near kincraig then the park had been the merest nucleus of what it was now indeed it hadnt opened properly until sixteen years later even so it had been stocked with a canny complement of highland creatures many of which had vanished from scotland centuries ago brown bears beaver reindeer and the like and bison yes kincraig on the river spey and these tibetans had died there too and then thered been those sightings up at carrbridge and nethybridge but as for wolves and bloody werewolves by god why lanson could almost break out laughing at himself but he didnt and wouldnt not until he checked with the wildlife park that they didnt have wolves too was that what old angus had been hinting at had he been laughing up his sleeve at lanson when hed told him there was a scheme afoot to reintroduce wolves into some wild place up north had he known that they had already introduced them in which case necroscope the lost years vol ii he was cheating what old angus huh his a man cannae play if the lights are out and ah have tae know a yere moves george the canny old devil it should be easy enough to check out a call to the park could settle it right now except the inspector knew that something else was bothering him something out of myth and legend he snapped his fingers as suddenly it came to him silver silvered crossbow bolts and youd need a silver weapon to kill a werewolf wouldnt you so just whatsorf of outside help had the metropolitan police called in that time to deal with their lycanthrope or rather their lunatic and whoever the hunter was why had he used a silvered crossbow bolt not for the obvious reason surely or was he some kind of lunatic too the inspector sat there a long time just thinkingor not thinking very much at all sometimes things worked themselves out better that way the light was fading short days long nights and a full moon rising lanson remembered it from a night or two ago when hed sat in here with some case or other the moon nearing its full hanging low over the horizon so last nightwould it have been full now what was he thinking what the hell was he thinking he stood up stretched glanced at his watch god it was already the afternoon had flown and going to the window he looked out across the rooftops of dalkeith to where a full moon was threequarters free of the grey evening haze he turned on the lights headed back towards his desk and jumped like a shot rabbit when the phone rang it was the records clerk at central hq ill be shutting up shop in a couple of minutes he said just thought youd like to know i found your case file that business at kincraig nearly thirty years ago will you call in for it tomorrow or what no lanson told him ill be in town tonight leave it with the information desk will you ill pick it up there very well as long as youh sign for it and one other thing that constable you mentioned who resigned i traced him through the pay officea disability pension for some small injury he got as a serving officer hes gavin strachan a kingussie man but he moved down here shortly after quitting down here one of those coincidences lives not far from you in dalkeith a tenminute walk along the penicuik road the inspector was grateful and said thanks that takes a lot of the effort out of it youre welcome and goodnight necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley goodnight lanson answered automatically and glancing at the moon again through his window he hoped it would be it had started out good anyway since it was too early to eat and much too early to get ready for his appointment at bjs wine bar lanson checked through the reports again now he was looking at cases covering attacks on people and though five years was a long time still in his opinion based on the number of savagings alone there were far too many rottweilers and dobermanns around as for the incidence of people bitten in the faceit was horrific worse several of these attacks had been fatals what the hell is it in a dog the inspector wondered that will make it bite a child in the face and what the hell was it that caused them to carry on even after theyd reduced the victim to a bundle of red rags the wolf in them he supposed the only good thing was that in almost every case where a rogue pet dog had savaged someone the beast had been easily tracked back to its owner and nine out of ten such animals the dogs that is had been destroyed lanson had never been much of a doglover and he didnt go a lot on their owners either and then there were the unsolved cases but the inspectors eyes were tired the rest of the reports could wait he would take a break from the paperwork and try contacting exconstable gavin strachan instead he was in the book several of them were in fact lanson matched addresses with the one hed got from the records clerk and gave his man a call eh said a rough voice at the other end of the line good evening sir lanson answered gavin strachan aye what is it exconstable strachan eh no for a long time it isnt anyway what of it inspector lanson lanson told him we never met but i would certainly like to why oh routine a case you dealt with up in kincraig thirty years ago something that happened at the wildlife park for a moment there was silence then some kind o joke strachans voice was harsher still joke not at all id just like to hear it from you what really happened that night what you think you saw think is it but ah told them what ah think thirty years ago told the newspapers too hah tellin mah story was like pissin in the wind aye and it pissed mah career away too mr strachan i tuck ye the other cut him off and slammed the phone down necroscope the lost years vol ii n strachan bonnie jean andmcgowan if there was one thing guaranteed to get george lansons back up it was someone talking to him like that very well maybe the man had cause or thought he had hed better have or by god lanson would see to it that his bad manners brought him a great deal of trouble easiest thing in the world to have him called in to the local police station and there let him cool his heels for an hour before seeing him aye and the law was on lansons side all the way judges rule number one whenever a police officer is endeavouring to discover the author of a crime there is no objection to him putting questions in respect thereof to any person or persons whether suspected or not from whom he believes useful information may be obtained so fuck ye too gavin strachan lanson thought as he knocked solidly on the door of the mans groundfloor flat in the penicuik road we can do it the hard way or the easy way its up to you his knock was answered by a tall surlylooking stocky man in his mid to late fifties he stood straight but still had to look up a little at lanson and he recognized a policeman when he saw one by which the inspector knew that this was indeed his man one copper can spot another a mile away even an excopper to prove the point strachan squinted at him through redrimmed eyes and grunted inspector lanson well now and is it no strange ah was expectin ye it wasnt a question gavin strachan lanson replied i need to talk to you whats more i will talk to you here or elsewhere in my time or yours if s your choice and have ah done somethin wrong not that i know of i was hoping youd want to do something right thats all it could be you cant help me if so this wont take very long and not bother you again its only on an offchance that im here buthere i am the other grunted stood aside and let him in huh he said ye may have gathered that ahm no well pleased tae see ye polis aye ah was one and a good yin much good it did me so its bad enough tae have tae entertain ye without that ye have tae revive a that stuff up at the wildlife park but i do have to strachan i do lanson answered and there was that in his voice that made the other turn sharply and peer at him sowhats happened it could do no harm to tell him in any case the story was in the newspapers a killings what happened like the one up at the wildlife park but this time it wasnt a bison murder strachan it could be it probably is that the two cases are unconnected but its one of those things i have to check on thats why i need your story i remember some of it from the time from the newspapers yes and m be reading up on the case file tomorrow until then the details have sort of faded in my memory though not in yours i suspect while he had talked to the man the inspector had looked him over gavin strachan looked gritty tired and bitter the bitterness had been there a long time it was etched into his face like coal dust in the pores of a miner behind their red rims his bluegrey eyes seemed trapped while the bags under his eyes spoke of sleepless nights and in his every word and move there was a whole world of suspicion just as lanson had detected it during their brief telephone conversation on the other hand the inspector had always considered himself a judge of character and it had to be said that he could find little to actively dislike in strachan well apart from the mans obvious dislike of him and even that seemed to be on the wane now as finally strachan waved him into a chair in his drab sittingroom and said coffee might just as well for as ye say yere here now indeed strachan had appraised his visitor and the inspectors open attitude and honesty had stood him in good stead for a policeman and a senior one at that used to at least a modicum of respect he was a hard man to dislike coffee will be fine he answered with a little somethin in it maybe just a touch lanson answered thanks what on duty strachan had gone into his tiny kitchen the inspector couldnt see him but he could hear the genuine note of surprise in his voice are ye sure this isnt official gavin if i may call you that im here on spec as i said the other came back out of the kitchen stood feeing him he had a bottle of good whisky and two glasses that he placed on an occasional table close at hand guid he said for if yere wantin me necnscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley tae go back over a that business ah for one will pour mahsel a dram ye can join me or no as ye will and why not one shot couldnt hurt the kettle whistled as lanson poured himself a drink and strachan went off again to fix their coffees and by now the atmosphere was much more relaxed exceptthe inspector could feel a definite tension in strachan when finally the man sat himself down facing him and so said strachan in a tone that said he was resigned to it now we get tae it he picked up his glass and poured a double shot straight into the back of his throat lanson watched his gasping mouth reform then said is that what it takes george said the other if ye spend thirty years trying tae forget somethin and when it still comes back tae ye in yere dreams if s no easy thing tae talk aboot when yere conscious yeve asked me what happened that nicht up at the wildlife park and ahm goin tae tell ye but yed best hang on mah words man for ah wont be repeatin them ever then forcing himself to relax a little in his chair he lay back and halfclosed his eyes and sipping alternately of whisky and coffee he unfolded his tale for lansons inspection it had been one of those nights ask any policeman anywhere in the world hell be able to tell you about that one night when right out of nowhere everything decided to happen all at once just such a night then when constable gavin strachan got caught up in the occurrences at the kincraig wildlife park but in the highlands and the night not even a friday or saturday when you might expect a bit of trouble from the lads at the various socials and community dancehalls with a couple of drinks too many in them and their bright young eyes full of the other fellows girlfriends in fact it was a wednesday wintry even for the middle of may the sort of night when anyone with tuppence worth of sense would be home toasting his feet in front of a warm fire anyone but a policemen on duty that is and over the past threemonth strachan hadnt covered anything worse than a bad traffic accident on an icy road so he certainly hadnt been on the lookout for anything big going down midweek on a night as wild as this so maybe it was the full moonbut whatever he hadnt stopped moving from the moment he woke up the dayshift man at the tiny police post in kingussie and relieved him of his duties that had been about pm and of course thered been nothing for the dayshift constable to pass on the daily occurrence book showed a blank page like yesterday and the day before that and the nights in between too ah but this had been one of those nights strachan had no sooner got settled in made some coffee opened a book to the first page of a science fiction thriller when the phone rang a breakin at the museum at newtonmore a threemile drive along the spey road an hour spent examining a broken window and recording statements and three miles back again but before he could enter the details in the book another callout to the aviemore holiday centre where a guest was drunk and wrecking the hotel bar ten miles each way this time and strachan righteously annoyed and fully prepared to arrest the man except he was sleeping it off when he arrived and the manager of the hotel wouldnt put him to the trouble besides he was sure he could recoup his damages in the morning er but in the event there should be any problemwell maybe the constable would like to make a note of the breakages now while he was here and that had taken another hour but at least strachan was given a wee dram on the house just the one to warm him up a bit which should have been ample for one quiet night in the vale of the badenoch but no the phone was ringing when strachan got back to kingussie a traffic accident at a bad bend on the coylumbridge road damn it to hell but hed only been a mile or two from the site up at aviemore if hed known he could have gone out onto the road and waited for it to happen except that was a bit of irish and he was a scot and a policemans lot is not a happy one but it wasnt all that bad two cars had glanced off each other one of the drivers a young woman had scraped her knees and shaken herself up a bit when shed run off the road and hit a tree strachan had dabbed her pretty knees with an antiseptic swab and as always when there was an accident hed taken along a brandy flask so hed given the drivers a tot each and one for himself then let the male driver of the other car go off while he and the young lady sat in his police vehicle and waited for the towtruck she was a pretty wee thing far better than sitting there with some grumbly old codger by the time hed set off again to drive back to kingussie it had been something after eleventwenty and a cold mist coming up off the spey to shroud a full moon hanging low over the valley which was when it happened level with the wildlife park suddenly there was someone on the road a man with a torch wreathed in mist desperately waving strachan down it was old andrew bishop the owner of the site and keeper of the brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii park his eyes were wild and fearful as strachan pulled off the road and drew to a halt on the verge and as he got out of the police car bishop was on him in a frenzy is it gavin strachan he panted as he glanced back over his shoulder at the misted park outbuildings and wiremesh enclosures gavin lad thank goodness yere up and aboot ehpwhafsup up my god up ill tell ye whats up somethins in wi the animals strachan caught at andrews arms tried to hold him still where are the boys no back frae the dance in dalwhinnie and liz is locked in the bedroom at the hoose locked in yere wife ah locked her in mahsel have ye no a weapon gavin a weapon now andrew what would ah be doing wi a weapon bishop was fairly dancing in his anxiety ah have a shotgun in the hoose he cried but ahm out o shells oh hell oh damnation now strachan held him tighter still andrew now come to yere senses man what on earths wrong wi ye somethins in wi the animals ye said aye ah did the other wrenched himself loose and more than one somethin ah fancy man deer are oot and runnin wild frae whatever its that tore its way in tae the pens come on strachan said making for the track to the outbuildings barns and pens lets see what weve got here but old man bishop at once dragged on his arm what and will ye go in there wioot a gun which stopped strachan in his tracks the quaver in bishops voice where the constable never before heard a tremor in all his life the fact that hed locked his wife safely away in a bedroom but safe from what and in that same moment gavin strachan knew there was something terrible here then distracting him even unnerving him there came the furious frenzied squawking of terrified chickens mah hens bishop gasped theyre in wi mah poor chickens let me get mah licht strachan quietly growled taking a heavyduty torch from the back of the car and yere truncheon bishop whined but by god a gun would be a sight better already the mad fluttering squawking and screeching was dying down they were on the track approaching the outbuildings when a different sound brought them to a halt but there are sounds and there are sounds this one was a cry eerie ululant electrifying and unmistakable dog strachan breathed hurrying forward again out in the woods back o the house a big yin probably returned tae the wild even as he spoke the howl was answered from closer at hand and when the sound had died away strachan added or dogs theres been some sheep worrying south o here ye say old bishop seemed to breathe a sigh of relief dogs ye think why what else strachan moved forward again yere animals must o smelled em smelled em heared em seen em probably the old man seemed steadier now god theyve been howlin this last halfhour put the wind up me and liz ah can tell ye we saw one o they frae the upstairs window but gavin again he clutched at the constables armye can damn mah eyes for liars if they didnae see him stand up on his hind legs and bigman he was one big yin there came a rustling from the nearest enclosure and a moment later a squawk mah hens old bishop aimed his torch sprang forward skidded to a halt in swirling ground mist where a hole had been torn in the high wiremesh boundary and strachan saw that the wire was of a heavy gauge then dogs strachan whispered again his own beam flickering this way and that but nervously now big yins aye old andrew turned to him and his mouth was slack god they chewed through this wire like it was cheese and again it was the old mans voice that did it to strachan got through to him like nothing else could have and yet again he asked himself just exactly what had bishop seen that caused him to lock up his wife and run dancing down the road an old stoic like andrew bishop why there wasnt a more downtoearth man in all the highlands and so far old bishop had been entirely too reticent like he hadnt wanted to destroy his saltoftheearth image strachan checked himself he was now as nervous as the old man it wasnt good enough two of us he said which should be more than enough for a couple of rogue dogs and anyway the birds are quiet now in we go he climbed in through the large hole in the wire with old man bishop right behind him the enclosure was a big one free range with henhouses on both sides and a boardwalk up the centre but as the beams of their torches sliced deeper into the swirling mist they saw that the houses had been wrecked wrenched apart and the carcasses of dead birds were everywhere old bishop picked one up in a trembling hand not a mark on it it was as if the creature had died of fright but others were bloody and some were without heads various alternatives passed uselessly through strachans mind necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley uselessly because they didnt work this could have been done by foxes indeed the wanton destruction of so many birds was precisely the foxs modus operandi but foxes would have dug under the wire not through it they couldnt have chopped through it as for wildcats they would never come this close and certainly not at this time of year when there was plenty of food in the wild well whatever he was hes out o here now the constable croaked and cleared his throat the birds would tell us if he was still here old bishop was wandering among the shattered henhouses gathering up corpses what birds he said his face a fearful mask in strachans torch beam theres no a one o they left and he went stumbling to the far side of the enclosure what about the deer pens strachan was acutely aware of the eerie silence and he didnt like it ye told me the deer had been scared off stampeded aye me and the wife saw them scattering away intae the woods yed think the place was on fire by god but gavin its time ye knew ah dont think the things ah saw oot here were dogs ahm no sure ah cannae say what they werebut no dogs they yins before he could continue there came an uproar of chattering and screeching from a large cage set well apart from the other enclosures the pine martens old bishop gasped quick back out through the hole strachan husked but no came bishops answer this wa be better strachan stumbled to him across the shattered boards of a wrecked henhouse and found him shaking like a man in a fever beside a second hole in the wiremesh his eyes stared fixedly at a trail of bloodied feathers wings and bird debris in general that led off into the night and the mist enough o this strachan was furious with himself disgusted at the fear that the situation and the old mans obvious terror had inspired in him lets see what thefee this thing is they went through the hole in the perimeter and ran stumblingly towards the pine marten cage where it was at once seen that the animals had only been complaining about or warning of the presence of outsiders and possible danger but despite the fact that the cage wasnt damaged certainly something had been here the pine martens fear was manifest in the way they clung close together spreadeagled on the wiremesh ceiling of their cage the mist was thicker now swirling kneedeep and sending tendrils up into the trees bordering the park this mist old bishop complained and shivered uncontrollably man it clings tae ye it was true the mist seemed alive like the thick breath of a beast they moved through it torch beams stabbing ahead towards the next enclosure a small corral containing bishops five prized bison of a species long absent from the highlands proper which was when things livened up again and in a single moment the night became a nightmare first the agonized bellowing of a beast from beyond the corrals fourbar fencing then the fence itself splintering outwards as a pair of stampeding bison smashed into it hurling boards and then themselves in bishops and strachans direction and a moment later the sound of breaking glass and a cry a scream from the dimly visible dark silhouette of the old mans house andrew andrew andrew let me outoh let me out sent flying as the wildeyed fearful bison went thundering off into darkness the two men picked themselves up only to stumble aside as two more animals came snorting and kicking through the break then old bishop was off at a run heedless of life and limb towards the house liz he shouted ahm comin lass ahm comint and strachan was on his own fairly certain that whatever was plaguing the beasts was in the corral but all he could see through the break was a lake of mist with milky tendrils lapping outwards from some central disturbance then the black and crimson hump of a thrashing animals back heaved up into view breaking the surfaceand other things reached up to pull it under again strachan wasnt sure what hed seen it had happened too quickly but an afterimage of thick white ropes or arms fitted with grapples or claws or taloned hands burned on his riveted retinae he stood there as if nailed in position smelling hot blood and listening to tearing soundsand the bisons panting and bellowing quickly dying away and then the snarling and slobbering of frenzied what gluttony as the ripples of mist continued to swirl outwards from that deadly central area how long difficult to say minutes that felt like hours before strachan could think again or before he was galvanized to activity as the kneedeep mist began swirling and rippling in his direction and vague outlines were seen within the mist with eyes like lamps that burned on him he had no weapon but a torch glancing this way and that he saw pieces of shattered fence at his feet and snatched up a twofoot length of inchbyfour sharpened to a splintery point where it had broken along the grain there were three pairs of luminous eyes in the mist three whatever they were were in there they spread out as they moved towards strachan but seen out of the corner of strachans eye coming from the necroscopt the lost years vol ii brian lumley direction of the house and heading for the woods a figure not bishop buta figure that leaned oddly forward upright like a badly formed man or woman loping through the mist and its eyes were luminous too then old bishop was back and a doublebarrelled shotgun in his trembling hands ah found a coupleay shells he found time to pantbefore the scene at the corral impacted on his mind and cursing as he pointed his gun without even bothering to aim he let fly with both barrels there came a flash and a roar both dazzling and deafening which for a single second blew apart the menacing dark and stunned silence halfblinded by the flash strachan threw up an arm before him as the mist erupted he was bowled over something bowled him over and raked at the sleeve of his jacket in its passing then there was a blur of sinuous motion an angry snarling receding rapidly into the woods behind the animal park and an urgent howling ringing down from the foothills beyond the trees almost as ifas if they were being called off and there was a gasping and sobbing from old andrew bishop stretched prone on the earth its mah damn leg the old man groaned mah bleddy leg it has tae be broken but did ye see gavin did ye see no white as a ghost the constable went to him nothing that makes sense anyway butdogs the old man pressed and as their eyes met strachan was obliged to admit no ah cannae say they were dogs what then bishops voice was a whisper strachan could only shake his head the sleeve of his uniform and shirt had been sliced as by razors down to the skin but by some miracle his skin was unmarked and no matter what he might think he had seen what he thought hed seen couldnt possibly have done that not unless it or she had a handful of razor blades at the house liz bishop was in a bad state of hysteria shuddering and almost incoherent she told a story that night that she could never repeat to any court nor ever commit to paper her husband wouldnt let her and he himself would later deny all knowledge of anything but an attack by wild or rogue animals probably dogs on the creatures of the park perhaps he feared ridicule but strachan thought not knowing andrew bishops character it seemed more likely he believed that in denying what he truly believed he might make it go away like a man whistling in the dark and later the constable might have wished that he had taken a similar course as for mrs bishops story alarmed by the squawking of the chickens and the frenzy of the pine martens shed gone to the window of her upstairs bedroom and looked out immediately beyond the window a balcony overlooked the park and down below there was the mist of course a milky lake lapping between the trees and various enclosures but also down there crouching by the wall of the house and staring up at her something wild and naked and awful and human or perhaps not human for as its yellow triangular eyes met hers the creature had snarled sprung upright bounded all of fifteen feet into the air to grasp the balcony rail and vault over it and its face had stared at her through the window as its lips became a muzzle that drew back from teeth like bone daggers at which she had picked up a chair and smashed it at the thing through the window then screamed for her husband and for her life but when next she had dared look the thing had gone and all mrs bishop could remember of it was that it looked likeah could swearah mean it wasnae all animal andrew am ah mad or what it looked something likeah mean it reminded me oa lassie but what sort o lassie andrew what sort and her last few words had been spoken in little more than an awed and frightened whisper that was what shed said that night but the next day she was in too bad a way to record a statement and old man bishop too busy looking after her meanwhile mah report had gone in strachan finished ah was young and eager ah would hae made a good cop ah tol it the way ah saw it big mistake when finally they bishops did speak about it huh it was animals did the job no specific creature ye ken but most likely dogs me ah was left holdin the bleddy baby and it came out how ahd had a coupleay wee drams that night so that was that as for the rest ah got no peace frae then on in until ah got out what an idiot eh for like ah said ah tol it the way ah saw it and ah tol what ah saw that was mah error but what did you see inspector lanson pressed fascinated by the sweat on strachans brow despite that his flat was cool the other nodded hear me well he said for if s the last time ah swear ah had seen wolves george white wolves or things that moved crept and snarled like wolves certainly ah had seen one wolf the one that came frae the house after scarin liz bishop half tae death but the hell o it is that as the thing made for the trees just before old bishop let go wi that double blast it looked more like a lassie aye just like the old lady had said but wolf bitch girl or some r necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley sort of weird mixture whatever it was it stood on its hind feet george upright now how can ye explain that the inspector believed he had evidence that might explain it what if she wasnt a dog he queried or a shewolf if you insist could it be that what you saw was a mad woman running with rogue dogs how about it gavin could i be right eh strachan licked his lips frowned and finally said theres more tae yere visit than meets the eye now how about you tell me a story for a change like how it is wi this case yere workin on there are might be similarities lanson admitted then sighing he said ok its a deal ill tell you something of it on the understanding its for your ears only done but lets go through intae mah studywell ah call it a study as for what ahm studyin what ahve been readin intae for years ahve learned better than tae put it on open display he got up crossed the floor and opened a door to a room scarcely bigger than a closet there was space for a desk two chairs and bookshelves built into the walls and there was one small high window to let in a little light in daylight hours that was all as strachan saw lanson seated and went off to fetch his bottle and glasses the inspector stared at the shelved books so close at hand and read off some of their tides to himself and because of recent events and conversations it didnt take him long to recognize the nature of strachans obsession lycanthropy werewolves anything and everything in literature to do with them but there were also a good many books on predators reallife predators in general but mainly wolves even comic books aye strachan said grimly as he entered sat opposite his guest and poured a drink if if s tae do wi the beast ah probably have it an obsession maybe he offered the inspector the bottle but lanson turned it down thanks no ive other people to see tonight but gavin are you telling me that all of this springs from that night up in the wildlife park strachans nod was his answer qualified by so maybe ah really am as daft as they say eh anyway now ye know what ah dream of nights and why ahm reluctant tae talk about it and now its yere turn tae talk lanson had spotted a book he recognized its subject was natures meateaters its predators of course but the inspector was more interested in the author if only because he knew him and as he told strachan some of the details of the murder at sma auchterbecky so he took the book down opened it and idly flipped the pages wild dogs big cats by angus mcgowan this was an earlier printing than the one lanson had seen previously at anguss place during a rare rare visit it was an old and shoddy copy strained at the spine and badly thumbed with creased and discoloured pages throughout later editions contained a lot more information the inspector knew it was definitely mcgowans work though despite that the paint had flaked out of the spines stamping still the lettering clearly displayed his name and then there was his picture on the inside back flap finally lanson finished telling strachan about the murder and putting down the book he said so now you see why i remembered that business at the wildlife park and wanted to talk to you even now the connection may be weak to nonexistent but however remote the chance still i had to look into it strachan nodded oh ah see well enough but now tell me george and honestly mind do ye believe mah story the inspector thought about it til tell you what i believe he finally answered t believe there are some things we simply dont know cant understand but i also believe that fear is contagious and that when people are afraid theybecome victims of their own imaginations strachan said huh so ye dont believe even now eh lanson shrugged what does it matter he said i certainly believe that you believe and also that when you left the force we lostwell a good yin he glanced at his watch it was time he was on his way but at the door he paused frowned again and looked back in the direction of strachans small study strachan followed his gaze lifted an eyebrow and asked is there somethin do you mind the inspector said he crossed to the tiny room entered and picked up mcgowans book again and turning to the opening pages he checked something then frowning yet more deeply he said may i borrow this and when i return it can we talk again as ye will the other shrugged as long as we can talk about yere case not mine the inspector agreed and taking the book with him went to keep his appointment with bonnie jean mirlu but first he called in at police hq to pick up the file on strachans highland incident and some photographs of john moffat plus one or two other pieces of information that had begun to trickle in for one thing the inspectors investigators had tracked down moffats address and for another theyd found his car in a snowdrift half a mile from sma auchterbecky at least the frame of the jigsaw was taking shape if not the finer details brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii the street was awash in snow turning to slush as the inspector was let into bjs just ten minutes ahead of his appointment but she was ready to see him and as ye see she said in the barroom business suffers a bit on nights like this who in his right mind wants tae turn out for a drink on a night like this eh so ahm sorry but as ye can see no all mah girls are in tonight margarets no in ahve given her a few days off and no point bringing all four of the others in tae sit around doing nothing so theres only mahself and these two and besides as ah told ye on the phone ah cant see how we can help anyway lansons coat was taken from him by one of the girls and as he gave the place a cursory onceover bj said wed best talk upstairs in mah rooms it being so quiet ah dont expect well be disturbed she was right there were only two men in the place one was at the bar chatting to the second girl and the other at a table head down nursing his drink so now the inspector could concentrate more fully on b j her accent puzzled him facetoface no less than on the phone it was antique yet modern too stage scottish when she used it it sounded unreal a sort ofdesigner brogue maybe she had an upperclass background while her assumed tongue was that of the lower to middleclasses as befitted her position for what was she in reality but a barmaid lanson told himself that this wasnt his own snobbish attitude but merely a factual observation and perhaps that was the essence of it she didnt want her clients thinking she was a posh yin as for the girl or woman herself well her age was hard to gauge as witness lansons indecision but then again what is the difference between a girl and a woman anyway and has age got anything to do with it or is it a matter of experience as for his own experience lanson had never been much of a one for the girls having never married he had to admit that his knowledge was limited bj was undeniably attractive tall and wellformed her figure was all curves and her posture selfassured as any models her hazel eyes were interesting they had an almost eurasian slant and yellow flecks in their cores that loaned them a golden gleam in the bars muted lighting one might even say she had feral eyes her ears were large but not obtrusive they lay flat to her head and seemed elflike with their pointed tips bj was probably sensitive about them however for she kept them notquitehidden in the swirl and bounce of her shining oddly neutral hair her nose was tiptilted and a little flattened and her mouth too ample by far yet perfect in the curve of its bow and her teeth were as white and wellcared for as any the inspector had ever seen thus he captured her description as years of practice had taught him to do while she took him upstairs and made him comfortable in her livingroom over the bar there she offered him a drink which he politely refused and when she was settled he quickly got down to it did you know the man who attacked margaret macdowell his name was john mof fat and he lodged on the other side of town he showed her a photograph taken from moffaf s lodgings ah recognize him yes she answered staring at the picture but did ah know him now she glanced at lanson not at all the girls get tae know some o them but ah steer clear your girls mean your staff form romantic attachments no such thing she bridled they get tae know the regulars thats all just as yell know all the crooks i see but he did used to come in here a frequent customer was he as ah said ah recognize him he was in once maybe twice a week but it has tae be said he did fancy margaret she didnt encourage him b j sighed patiently lanson thought mah girls are no like that inspector ah pay them tae work not flirt and just in case yere wonderin if this is a whorehouse ah can tell ye now its no ah rim a wine bar nothin more than that i never once thought differently lanson could afford to be truthful with her for in fact he hadnt formed any opinions as yet as was his wont however he now pulled something right out of the blue how about dogs he said his eyes riveted to bjs face she blinked just once and her expression registered surprise if not alarm dogs do you have one miss mirlu a big dog a guarddog maybe to look after downstairs after you lock up i never considered it she shook her head ive always thought the place was reasonably secure anyway i dont especially like the smelly things and lanson had to smile if only to himself for while shed retained her composure that accent of hers had vanished into thin air and your girls does one of them have a big dog margaret macdowell for instance she shrugged not that theyve ever brought here no so what is it that upset you when i mentioned dogs eh she looked confused startled whats that ye say ah appeared upset and the accent was back again youre not from these parts are you lansons smile was open this time my how ye jump about she managed to smile back at him brian lumley however tightly one minute its dogs and the next yere wonderin where ah come frae tour accent he told her me im an edinburgh man but i try to keep my accent under control i only fail when im excited not that im ashamed of it you understand but if s my nature to be precise butyeare no frae edinburgh an no amount o fraes and yes can convince me otherwise and is it part of your investigation to discover my origins she was just a little bit angry now well to put your mind at rest and so that we may get on im originally from the highlands my parents were from garve and strathpeffer but we moved to london when i was a child so youre right my accent is phony or not quite phony but necessary my customers like to think im a wee jock so if only for their sake im a wee jock are you satisfied now and if theres nothing else she made as if to stand up but lanson caught her hand applying just enough pressure to hold her in place a policeman he explained develops certain habits not all of them good i apologize miss mirlu bj she cut him off well to my friends anyway for my devious methods the inspector continued but you see it looks like john mof fat was killed by a large dog or hound and i have to satisfy myself that someone from here wasnt protecting her inspector to my knowledge no one even dreamed such a thing might happen bad snow was forecast and i let margaret go early thats standard procedure if were expecting bad weather i always let the girls from outside the city off early i myself called the taxi for margaret and it took her right off the doorstep then the next thing we know the poor girl has been attacked she held up her hands what else can i tell you thats all there is to it well not quite all lanson frowned her attacker was murdered or should we say killed after all and murder is murder bj whether its done to or by a beast that wasnt entirely correct but it accurately described his feelings he tried a different tack could john mof fat have known shed be let off early hed been in often enough yes b j answered but suddenly she was frowning a great hound she murmured someone with a big dog hmm like how big oh lanson leaned towards her again and is there perhaps something i should know i dont know she said im not sure necroscope the lost years vol ii well tell me anyway and decide who is it you know who has a big dog bj oh ah dinnae ken him she fell almost naturally with a sigh of relief as it were back into her brogue ah only wish ah did sos ah could tell ye his name all ah know is he watches man place he watches this place lansons voice had tightened in a moment someone has been watching you and your girls someone with a dog itits probably nothin ah mean ah hope its nothin b j answered sometimes he has his dog with him others hes on his own she stood up said come on ahll show ye she took him upstairs to the top floor her bedroom then to a small window that looked down at a shallow angle on a recessed doorway across the road thats where we saw him first she said him and his dog aye she was lying about the dog at least but the inspector couldnt know that how long ago he queried oh years she answered ah used tae think it was maybe the father of one o mah girls lookin out for his daughter if ye take mah meanin or maybe a detective on the trail of a wayward husbandah mean ahm bound tae get all sorts in here tae ogle the girls and a but this has been recurrent lanson was eager now on and off aye recently about a fortnight the last time butwhy didnt you speak of this before on the phone for instance or when i first mentioned a dog she shrugged easily maybe apologetically it slipped mah mind it didnae connect until now oh ah worried about the wee man at first but nothin came o it he watched but didnae try tae do anythin and wesort o got used tae him we me and the girls aye oh and theres somethin else he has been known tae follow them once oronce or twice suddenly she gasped her hand flew to her mouth and her eyes grew big and round do ye think mah god that wee man and his big alsatian describe him lanson snapped and as bj drew back from the force of his voice in a gentler tone please as best you can tell me what he looks like and she did later standing at the kerb outside the winebar breathing the cold night air and feeling the slush turning to ice the inspector waited for brian lumley his taxi and thought through the way events were shaping up there were some odd circumstances and queer coincidences here and george lanson had never quite believed in the latter his years on the force had taught him otherwise bjs description of the watcher had been a good one too good to have been conjured out of thin air even if it had been her purpose to deceive but as it was the description had been so real it could even fit one or two persons of lansons aquaintanceand one in particular ridiculous to attempt to match it with the latter however wasnt it and yet the inspector could feel angus mcgowans book weighing in the large inside pocket of his overcoat that old edition probably a first but wrapped in a dust jacket from a more recent edition surely well that was possible it must sometimes happen lanson was sure yet to the best of his knowledge the later editions one of which he had handled at anguss place during a rare visit didnt have the old vets picture in the back and it was that photograph that concerned him most for if the jacket did go with the book if they were both originals he was tempted to go back inside and show it to bj mirlu he would if he didnt feel so stupid about it but he did feel stupid about it and rightly so what a bloody book that was twentyeight years old embellished with a photograph that looked like it had been taken yesterday but it was the price of the book that really stymied him the price on the replacement dust jacket if it was a replacement just seven shillings and sixpence which nowadays wouldnt even buy you a paperback ffl dead serious talk bonnffi jeans dilemma on and under the riverbank it was dark cold and inhospitable above the cold was the natural chill of a winters night and the grass was glazed and brittle with rime if not for a recent melt upcountry the release of a torrent to stir the water and keep it liquid there might even be a treacherous skim on the river itself without a doubt the water was treacherous in that place but in a small backwater where the current was subdued and the ripples sluggish the ice had more of a chance there under the overhanging bank under the water itself in the deep mud of the weedy bottom the cold was unnatural a dead cold for in and around an unmarked watery grave it was the cold of death itself and she was mary the mother of the necroscope harry keogh there she lay all mud and bones and weed and to all intents and purposes to everyone except harry himself it was as if she had never been because there was nothing physical left of her to remind anyone she was dead and departed almost but not quite forgotten but forgotten by the living anyway for the living cannot know and wouldnt care to be told and if they were told they would want it proved and even then they still wouldnt believethat death isnt like that it isnt the absolute end that most men in their hearts believe it to be not entirely the flesh dies but the mind goes on the great majority go on in their fashion great thinkers continue to think their great thoughts to be shared among their teeming dead colleagues great architects build fantastic cities of the mind which may only exist in their minds for their voices have been silenced except to the necroscope harry keogh great mathematicians and astronomers continue to puzzle out the nature of a universe whose secrets they can never expose except to those gone brian lumley necroscope the last yean vol ii down with them into the earth and to one other or maybe two others thus while on the surface the waters of the pool in that small bite of a bight might seem relatively calm rippled by a mournful wind and awash with stars reflected on the darkly mobile mirror and the night silent bar the wind itself and the ether void of all evidence of lifeunderneath was less than calm was indeed unquiet where the dead conversed and maybe seventyfive yards upriver set back from the water behind a high wall and a long wild garden and standing central between two sagging derelict companions an old house gloomed put across the ruffled ribbon upstairs a pair of dim lights behind matching windows were like bleary closeset eyes harry keoghs bedroom where the necroscope had fallen asleep with the lights still burning and now lay dreaming this time harry dreamed in sounds not pictures and the voices in his pillow were quiet and secretive as whispers and shielded so that he wouldnt overhear them or if he did so that he would know he was only dreaming mary can we really afford to take that chance dare we do or not do as you advise surely you know how we ache from our inactivity why its been years that weve lain here doing nothing but its harry mary harry himself and your son has done so very very much for us so why wont you let us at least try to do something for him the dead voice was sir keenan gormleys harry would know it anywhere any time and yes it had been years three years at least since he had been in london and talked to sir keenan for there could be no mistaking the fact that the teeming dead were talking about him and because his mother was close he could separate out these individual sources from the background static which he alone knew to be the murmur of a million voices the private conversations of the great majority but this time that static was far less evident and harry knew why across a vast swath of land or under it the dead in their graves werent talking but listening to this same conversation and if for that and no other reason he knew it must be very important to them but he must listen carefully like an eavesdropper yes despite that he was the subject of their conversation or because he was else they would sense him and close him out do you think i dont want to help dont want you to help can you think of anything i wouldnt do for him can you name anything i havent done for him indeed not for thered been a time when she had even risen from the river for him but no buts keenan gormley i gave him life remember while it was you and yours who took it from him for it was the work he did for you that killed him in the end unfair said another voice when gormley failed to answer and the necroscope knew this one too it was his old physical training instructor graham sergeant lane speaking from his grave in a harden cemetery oh harrys your son mary keogh but you only had him for a few short years me i watched him grow up i saw the grit in him and i knew how special he was hes a fighter that one i know it for ive had the privilege of fighting with and through him we all know it which is why we cant bear to see him crash now and unfair in another sense too sir keenan at last put in its true that his work with ebranch got him in trouble but he knew what he was getting into and always remember if harry hadnt learned what he did when he was with ebranch about the mobius continuum then when he died he would have stayed dead his metempsychosis wouldn t have been possible we wouldn t be talking about him now but to him and in our own medium on our own level he died mary yes but now he lives again and we want to keep it that way harrys ma let him finish but she was still considering what sergeant had said before him crash how crash do you mean die and join us here what and are we to ignore all the talented people weve listened to and lifting her dead voice for everyone to hear what of our precogs keenan gormley who have told us that my son is to go on and singling out sergeant how can you even think to presume to know my son better than i were of one flesh why even when hes silent when he shuts himself off from me still i know what hes thinking but weve all known something of that mary no not like that at all i meanthe feelings at the very core of him i mean all the aches and hurts and moods of his heart i know him likelike a mother and who else could have put it better than that and we know him as the one shining light in our darkness sergeant was as rough as ever but a rough diamond for all his bluntness which we arent about to see blown out a babble of ready agreement went up from at least a dozen more dead voices that harry hadnt recognized as yet yes our precogs tell us that harry will go on but its the future were talking about and thats an inexact science who can secondguess tomorrow who wants to risk it so harry is going to live going to go on is he but who or what as himselfor something else necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley knowing the depth of sergeants feelings that he too had come to harrys rescue in the past as all of them would if given the chance mary keogh wasnt overwhelmed or outraged by his passion she merely tuttutted and quietly inquired of all the rest so what would you have me do what would you do if you were closest to him what advice would you give him we would simply tell him the truth sir keenan answered and we would want to know why he hasnt seen it for himself i mean we know hes in trouble again things have come into our world that are not human things that were human but have suffered a change things that lived between life and death and even truly dead still they are evil and the great majority of us hold them at bay ostracised the necroscopesent them here but we cant blame him for that theyre a plague that had to be cut out of a world where our children and loved ones still live so youd tell him the truth harrys ma was patient and how would you go about it harry we know there are still evil creatures in your world we know because you keep sending them to our world so tell us what is it thats caused you to team up with one of them and not just a vampire harry but a shewolfa werewolf toois that what youd tell him something like that yes but sir keenan was cautious listen to me all of you she said then my son is in as much danger from himself as he is from them its been a long time since he spoke to me or to any of us but the last time he did he asked me if i thought he was going mad he thought he might have a drink problem not of his making but one passed on to him in his new body he thought he might have inherited something of alec kyles talent too his dreams were insane nightmares in the truest sense of the word and even awake during a conversation with me he saw strange visions portent of things to come im sure but far beyond his understanding and beyond mine and in life i was a psychic in my own right but because was a psychic and because hes my son i heard more than his spoken words i understood more than he was trying to convey to me and i knew that he didnt know what was wrong with him she paused to clear her thinking see her way and then continued so i spied on him in his waking hours and sleeping hours alike to see if i could discover what was wrong and i discovered more than i had bargained for this female thing who holds him in her spell she this bonnie jean has caused him to live in two different worlds even different minds in one of these he knows what she is and it horrifies him but yet he is bound to her in thrall to herbut no thank god not as a vampire thrall yet in his other mind hes also enthralled butdifferently which any man who ever loved will understand complicated oh but that isnt the half of it dont you see whats become of him he is literally a splitperson if not a splitpersonality but even before bj his difficulties defied description what his mind in another mans body his wife and child fled from him gone off to a place where even he where even we cant find them in his search for them my son has discovered vampires in his world but he cant admit it or do anything about it until bj lets him she hashypnotized him absolutely but more than that i suspect theres something else wrong with him that neither he nor i understand something that interferes with his talents his use of the mobius continuum even his willingness to talkto talk to his own mother now tell me dont you think harry has problems enough she fell silent and for a while the great majority could feel her anguish like grief then keenan gormley asked her whats your point mary my point she repeated him but isn t that obvious if my son is on the brink of madness wouldnt telling him the truth push him over would he accept the truth or deny it would he accept his selfdeception and try to put it right or escape into the unreality of madness quite simply how much can his mind take it was heavily overburdened before but now which is why we cant tell him because we dont know all the answers but even though you dont seem able to understand that this bj knows it only too well and she keeps him on a tight leash she wants him sane for her own purposes and for herself i hate it hate to admit it but she may well be his salvation thisshething anchors him and while she keeps him safe she keeps him sane for that reason weve got to let it be for now at least all of them let her words sink in until sergeant clarified the situation with you mean we do nothing from his tone of voice the idea disgusted him but then another dead voice came to the fore well maybe not exacly nothin and the dreaming harry knew this one too it was r l stevenson jamieson indebted to the necroscope as a result of some work theyd done together down in london rl stevensons brother had been the lycanthrope that harry and his team had dealt with at the time hed first met bonnie jean mirlu in the main rl owed his acceptance by the great majority the respect they gave both him and his name to harry and he wasnt about to forget it how do you mean rl sir keenan wanted to know is there some way we can help harry without jeopardizing his sanity well i sure can came the answer at once see i has obi thats obeah to you its in my blood come down to me from poppy but here in this place i has no great use for it excep to keep my brother arthur brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii conan in check not thatacs much trouble not any more now i wants you to understand my obis the gentle kind like poppys before me white magic you d call it see poppy wouldn t a harmed a soul he was j fust happy with his charms and love potions over in haiti where i was brung up he never once messed with poisons or dead folkser i means the zombies beggin your pardon my poppy was more into protection yeah and in that line well he did have somethin more than the simple stuff heck he coulda used it to make himself a big man why in haiti whole governments has stood or fallen on stuff such as my poppys obi yeah for he had the power to look into a enemys mind and so know his every move and me i has it too only not so strong now that i is dead see when a man dont use his obi he loses it it grows strong with practice and shrinks without it and down here among the dead folks i well i havent had much use for it not too many enemies down herej but i knows the necroscope we worked together to put some stuff right mean with my brother arthur conan and i knows that if t harry coulda found a different way but there you go a c couldn t give a damn for anyone elses life so in the end his own was forfeit anyway i know harrys aura so in a way i guess im somethin like his ma its not just that hear him when he talks to us but i also knows how he feels i can feel for him and i can feel out his enemies too oh im not oneforgettin into their heads like a c could but i knows when tkeys around and how many they is and where theys comin from stuff like that i couldnt wouldnt tell him who they is but i could at least let him know that theys there sowhat you think and harrys ma said good yes its a start down inside harry knows hes in trouble and rls obeah can emphasize the truth of it without being specific after that it will be up to harry to work it out for himself step by step stage by stage but sir keenan gormley wanted to know and is that all we cant do anything else oh we could probably do a lot mary answered but slowly and very carefully for if it comes to it well eventually we may have to do an awful lot mean our very utmost and each and every one of the teeming dead they knew what she meant but in a while frustrated beyond measure sergeant who was once a man of action said and meanwhile were even forbidden to advise him i mean theres no other way to help him except by leaving him alone only if he asks for our advice she answered and only if he asks for our help for that will be the first sure sign that hes coming to terms with it and is ready to fight back i remember when i was a girl my mother used to tell me no one can help the man who wont help himself ive lived by that maxim and so has harry and hell go on doing it there you have it we darent show him the light but must wait till he sees it for himself and when he doeshes going to be one mad necroscope not crazy just mad as hell so maybe youre right and its for the best oh hell be a lot madder than hell hotter too and i fancy that will be his main problem for thats when hell need to be at his coolest then when harry keogh is coolwell just watch youll see hell itself freeze right over all talking done their meeting concluded they could go their own ways now and withdraw to the only places they knew their graves in the lonely earth where they lay in their dust and decay and the endless night of death but in that interminable darkness a lonely candle flickering one source of light and warmth one heart still beating one necroscope tossing in his tumbled bed the telephone was ringing the voices of the dead receded took on the form of genuine dreaming metamorphosed into the periodic clamour of the phone harry knew he should try to hang on to his dream but was afraid to and so let it slide into limbo then the voices were gone and any significance to events in the necroscopes waking world gone with them he woke up brrrring brrrringgg nervejanglingly with which the last ring echoed into silence but the answering machine had clicked on and a red light glowed to indicate a message what who harry scrambled to reach for the monitor and almost tumbled out of bed his mind was fuzzy hed only been asleep for an hour or so and hed only gone to sleep to kill some time until b j called if she called and now this could be her he grabbed the monitor too late the answering machine clicked off he sat up breathed heavily ran his fingers through his hair time just before ten hed been dreaming and hed wanted to remember his dreamshadnt he and then the phone he played back the message harry mah wee man call me back will ye bjs husky voice coming out of his answering machine had a weird effect on him on the one hand he shuddered as a mournful howling came echoing out of nowhere while a wolfs head in silhouette angled itself sharply against a full and shining moon its throat throbbing with its song and on the other he brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii recognized and was helpless to fight against his dependency his desire for bj and the fact that he hadnt seen her for over a week now then the howling was gone into limbo and all that remained was the fact that bj had called and hed missed it as indeed hed missed bj herself for the last six or seven days too long by far he blinked his eyes rubbed at them forced himself more fully awake which wasnt easy his mind was buzzing with halfmemories dreams and fancies and fantasies almost as if he hadnt woken up at all or wished he hadnt six or seven days well the last couple of days without her were only to be expected it was her time when she would or should have been up in the highlands doing her own thing hunting and living off the land what even in this weatherbut the necroscope didnt even give that a second thought it was one of the many things he wasnt allowed to question something that might from time to time register until his mind made an automatic compensation for until she said otherwise bj was an innocent and even then despite that in a hidden place inside he knew something of who and what she really was still harry was in thrall to her beguiled by her in love with her he shivered because in his hidden place he did know what was behind her yet took pleasure in her voice even her recorded voice and thrilled to her reality for his dependency was as much physical as mental the addiction of her body her companionship and the fact that she was all he had all he had yes it was true and the necroscope felt obliged to admit it he seemed to be shutting himself down hed long since severed his connections with his friends at ebranch his only real living friends cut himself off almost entirely from the real world and even neglected the dead including his beloved ma something of his dream came back again fleetingly only to dissolve into atoms a moment later as for brendabut who was brenda shed been gone so long now that her face its memory was only a blur harry only remembered her as she had been as a girl his childhood sweetheart and the child harry jrwould be four years old now hed be walking talking and doingwhatever he did except that wouldnt be what other infants did not him for just like his father he was a necroscope too he could talk to the dead and knew all the secrets of the mttbius continuum he can go wherever he wants the necroscope told himself out loud they can hideanywhere or be anywhere as long as he wasnt there and he knew that if they wanted to be found he and the whole professional army of investigators that he had bought would have found them well they obviously didnt want to be found and so were gone but because it was his obsession now he had to keep on looking it was unreal everything except bj whose number he was already dialling chase around after her like a puppy he thought then laughed however drily because it seemed such an accurate analog or simile then stopped laughing because he didnt know why it seemed accurate a puppy the phone was answered by one of her girls zahanine he recognized her slow sultry voice bj he said and zahanine didnt even ask who it was then b j was on the phone harry aye he mimicked the brogue he knew she affected its yere wee man and after a moments thoughtful silence but are youangry about something the note of anxiety had turned to curiosity now harry shook his head blinked his eyes thought well am i or was he just blaming her for something that wasnt her fault something he didnt understand but which couldnt be her fault anyway because she was innocent no he said not angry just fucked up another pause and something you want to talk about radu he said almost automatically the word or name slipped off his tongue as easily as that popped from the forbidden limbo of subconscious mind into his real thoughts like a champagne cork teased too far too soon and for the life of him harry couldnt understand why hed said it but deep down inside something churned the champagne he thought but long since turned to vinegar to bile and now he felt sick to his stomach still without knowing why on the other end of the line b j was in the bar two of her girls were with her tidying up catching their attention she put a finger to her lips and when they were still forget what you just said to me harry she told him as naturally as she could youre not to talk about that or even think about it if its bothering you you can tell me why when you see me in an hours time maybe is that ok see you tonight he replied after a while sounding distant and dazed iveive really missed you b j and with that she believed she knew what had happened it had been some time since she last reinforced the posthypnotic commands separating his two levels of consciousness and a week necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley since shed had contact with him but this was no ordinary man left to its own devices harrys mind had been trying to bridge the divide however slowly things were beginning to leak from one level to the other if the process should speed up and the two flow directly into each otherit was possible he could even go into shock catatonic withdrawal harry a cabbage bjs harry no she corrected herself radus harry her masters manwithtwofaces and her tilted eyes narrowed to feral slits as a growl sounded deep in her throat bj harrys voice sounded tinny and more distant yet sad lonely and lost suddenly fearful for him and nothing else despite that there was plenty to be worried about she said be with you as soon as possible so why dont you just take it easy now and rest and wait for me yes he said ok and a moment later b j yes i think i may have been dreaming well dream together she promised soon and she listened for the click as he put the phone down driving west for harrys place along lonely country roads outside the city b j thought so its finally beginning to get to him hes wondering whats wrong with him and openly admitting that hes fucked up well so he is because of me but at least he has something someone to believe in to hang onto even if its only me but what do i have and like a stab of pain felt deep inside coming out as a cry oh harry mah wee man you can take it from me ignorance is bliss knowing whats happening could be far worse than not knowing and it wouldnt solve or change a thing it hasnt for me anyway hah and you think that yourre fucked up it was true she was and just as she had done it to harry so he had done it to her differently but in the end it worked out the same not so long ago hed been just one small part of a big equation one small cog in a vast wheel now he was a big spanner in the works the one part of the equation that refused to work out harrys mind was a computer and she had put a bug in it two bugs in fact one was a lie and the other was love he had become her personal toy but the lovebug had been virulent and it had escaped back into bjs system harry keogh her wee man not any longer and not for quite some time now mah wee man was the phrase she used to activate harrs posthypnotic implants and change his mental mode employing it as an opening she could tell him impress upon his mind anything she desired him to know and before closing she could delete anything deemed undesirable for him to know or remember but as well as a trigger the phrase now seemed to be mutating into a term of endearment and in so doing it had lost some of its potency b j had to reinforce it for his sake as much as hers before his two halves clashed and destroyed each other her master radu lykan had once told bj that he would need a strong man in the hour of his resurgence not a sot that was after she had used an ancient addictive wine to weaken harrys resistance and the doglord had further pointed out that there were other ways to enthrall a man than by poisons he had meant her body her womans wiles which in the course of two hundred years she had learned to use very efficiently but love and sex are twoedged swords and harry keogh was something of a beguiler in his own right a vee man scarcely that for it now seemed more than likely that he was indeed the man of radus dreams of the future in whom the doglord might yet rise up again resurrected from his vat of resin all well and goodif b j didnt want harry for herself but she did exceptnothing was that straightforward everything was convoluted bj was fucked up yes without the gradual encroachment of the ferenczys and the recent declaration of war on the part of the drakuls then things might be easier and bjs choice less fraught but at last the enemy had shown his hand and bj had realized her own weakness for all that she was a werewolf she was no warrior not by wamphyri standards as for harry keogh while he would appear to be both a skilful warrior and tactician or maybe a reckless madman still he was merely a man despite that hed been lucky once bj knew that in the long run he would be no match for the wamphyri dealing with enemies as terrible as drakuls or ferenczys was to have been the doglords province the doglord radu her master bjs thoughts skipped this way and that contradicting themselves as they went radu lykan he had become the bane of bjs life and no small threat to harrys and she was still amazed at the speed of her conversion which was something she scarcely dared to think about even now bonnie jean mirlu the guardian of radus lair for more than one hundred and seventy years his minder as it were whose every effort had been towards his safety and eventual resurrection brian lumley bj a traitor to his cause not yet not physically but the thought had been there certainly and not only the thought but now with harry the motive too what was it with harry she wondered what was his attraction he was only a manyet the first man who had ever put his life in jeopardy for her which had perhaps been the turning point so that now even thinking such things she in turn was putting hers in jeopardy for him but was it only harry his natural attractions or was it a different kind of nature entirely was it her own nature as the change more surely shaped her was it something some physical thing inside her deflecting her devotion from radu and pandering to her own gratification and again her thoughts switched tracks perhaps to escape the inevitable conclusion radu who had burned so brightly in her mind like a god the creator and father of his own species a sleeping god aye and bj the one who watched over him in his undead tomb that was how it had been for as long as she could remember so that it was no easy thing to consider the termination of everything that shed worked so long and so hard for the efforts and aspirations of a lifetime not a life as long as bjs had been or one as long as it might yet be the past passed before her in short order at first as a girl radus cause had been hard work but in the course of a century it had become an almost unbreakable habit and in the next fifty years a binding duty shed lived her entire life so that her master might live his again which now if she would go on living it seemed he must for without the doglord sooner or later her enemies must surely take her out they knew her even now and would have moved against her long ago but they were greedy and wanted her master too so much for the past and the present but what of the future what would it be how could it be without radu would she even have a future what with harry but he was only a manand so she was back to that again so many uncertainties and bjs life in the balance and harrys too harry why was he always there in the back of her mind she could do without him didnt actually need him in her lifedid she well did she perhaps notbut it seemed certain she would need radu his guidance when he was up again she would need to learn from him all the secrets he had promised her in order to understand the nature of the wamphyri and so understand herself no less important she would need his protection thus for all her dithering the doglord was her safest route safe tfajthe truth of it was that she was radus thrall and feared necroscope the lost years vol ii him she even feared her own wayward thoughts that he might discover a germ of treachery in them or more than a germ and find her wanting so the doglords cause lived on if only through revulsion and fascination fear and need and bj continued to be torn two ways between loyalty to a nightmarish creature from an alien world and a past time and love of a man who was very much of this world and ahead of his time but it was true that her loyalty to radu wasnt what it used to be else there were no contest in the first place oh upon a time she had worshipped him with the fervour of a dozen thrall forebears before her moonchildren in their own right but that was all they had been radus thralls and caretakers while bonnie jean mirluwas wamphyri there it was out she had come down to it at last like the doglord himself b j was of that same high order of vampire and must soon ascend to a lady how this had come about was hard to say by the regular voluntary transfusion of bjs blood into radus system but surely that was impossible she had always understood it to be a oneway transfer and in all her time in radus service bj had never had physical contact with him except through fluids which had already left her body how could she possibly while he lay in a vat of semisolid resin ah but even the wamphyri couldnt know everything about theircondition its mysteries were diverse as life itselfperhaps b j was a throwback then through genes as tenacious as the wamphyri themselves to starside in a vampire world or could it be that radu had inadvertently issued a spore to surface gradually through the resin and pass into her system but whichever she knew she was possessed of a leech and that her parasite was rapidly maturing she knew felt it as surely as she felt the powerful beat of her own heart or the breath going in and out of her lungs and if ever she doubted it there was always the corroboration of her vampire metamorphosis which she had had for full forty years now the change at or near the full of the moon by which shed be transformed into something else something other than a woman in addition there was this burning desire in her a need to howl to run with the pack wild in the moonlight and to hunt the feel of emotions of passions that rose way above the merely human scale a raging ravaging love of life and a lusting after the blood which is that life wamphyri passions all and one other trait that identified her species like a fingerprint and made it undeniable bjs territorialism for almost two hundred years the mountains over the long wooded valley of the spey had been her territory which she had protected her small pack the girls shed recruited to make them brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii moonchildren replacing them as and when necessary were hers even the doglords cavern lair was more familiar to bj than it had ever been to him to radu it was merely a refuge a hideaway a tomb but to bj an aerie her seat the secret heart of her operations when at last she ascended and became a fullblown lady of the wamphyri perhaps it was an idea that had been in her head for some time even decades as the year of radus rebirth loomed ever closer so that she had often wondered how will it be when my master is up again when he is back what will be allowed and what disallowed and she had thought what if he should return to romania and take back his horseshoe mountains now that the drakuls and ferenczys are no longer there if so he might even leave b j behind to watch over the lair in the cairngorms and become a true lady in her own right then he and she would be equals an incredible concept once when she had been delirious from letting too much of her blood drain down into radus vat she had even broached the subject and now she remembered his answer ah my bonnie but think just think if i am a doglord and the female equivalent of a vampire lord is a ladywhat would that make you a bitchlady or would you be more bitch than lady and then his coughing barking laughter had sounded in her mindbut behind his laughter the deep and thoughtful rumble of a growl too she hadnt understood but he had brushed it aside saying let it be my bonnie for in any case its all a hundred years away but you wamphyri first be a wench then a witch or a bitch whichever that had been only the first time that radu denied bjs destiny but there had been many times since he hadnt wanted her to think along such lines and bj believed she knew why for in the doglords vision of a future world there wouldnt be room for other lords or ladies the headlights of an oncoming car flashed in bjs eyes and as the car swept by her mind was drawn back to the present giving herself a shake she sat up straighter behind the steering wheel and tried to concentrate on where she was going who she was going to and why the present was more important than the past and what she had been thinking about was long before harrys time now even more than she worried about radus future or even her own she worried about his need him what sense was there in fooling herself any longer of course she did even loved her wee man madness aye and again bjs mind went off at a tangent radu had warned her against contaminating harry she could seduce him by all means but on no account let anything of herself get into him the doglord wanted him pure and of course she knew why if radus vampire leech had failed to cure him of the plague in his blood then he would attempt metempsychosis the transfer of his entire personality into the body of another into harrys body for radu had dreamed oneiromantic dreams of a mysterious one a manwithtwofaces who would be there at the hour of his resurgence harry keogh was just such a man with survival skills worthy of the wamphyri themselves in one way the idea was intriguing while in others it was appalling the thought of harry with the awful strength of radu appealed to bj his longevity assured and with the skills of a special agent he would make the perfect mate but she knew that would not be the way of it for he would have radus mind and eventually his metamorphosis and b j knew how harry would look then as radu lykan looked now he would be as clay in the doglords hands to be rebuilt in radus image and picturing her socalled master in his great vat his grotesque mandog outline as seen through the semiopaque resin crust even b j shivered no she couldnt even contemplate that not for a moment and yet in three months time in the spring she would have to do just exactly that for that was when radu had determined to be up he might even be up now but had wanted to see harry in advance of the event he should have seen him three months ago and barring the intervention of a drakul lieutenant and thrall would have done so it had been then that harry keogh had once again demonstrated his talent for survival and his feelings for bonnie jean that he would protect her with his life for now those drakuls were no more and halfway to harrys place near bonnyrig b j remembered what little she had seen of the drakul attack and how it had been afterwards necroscope the lost years vol ii iv let sleeping doglords lie covert surveillance auld johns report the limbo interface bj had taken harry north for a long weekends climbing hunting living off the land and generally roughing it in the highlands so shed told him anyway but in fact theyd been going to see the sleeping doglord in his lair she had had all kinds of misgivings about it shed grown inordinately fond of harry too fond perhaps hed aroused emotions in her other than the grand passions of her kind and she had known that to let radu see him talk to him would mean simply giving him up to the doglord but in any case they hadnt made it on the unseasonably warm autumn morning scheduled for the climb as bj and harry headed for the starting point in auld johns car then the drakuls had launched their attack there had been two of them redrobed priests in a station wagon that they used as a juggernaut trying to force bj off the road she had switched harry on told him that these were two of the enemies shed warned him about but as soon as she had gained a little distance rounded a bend and so passed out of sight of their pursuers harry had asked to be dropped off she had done it and a minute or two later when the drakuls failed to catch up shed gone back for him somehow he had caused them to crash their station wagon had left the road over a wooded gorge and fallen to earth nosefirst through trees which had scarcely broken its fall one of the occupants the driver a lieutenant by his looks and by the way he later died had got himself skewered on his steering column the other a thrall was uninjured b j had come on the scene barely in time to prevent the latters attack on harry she had put a crossbow bolt through the thralls heart and harry had set fire to the petrol leaking from their shattered car both of the drakuls had burned melting down in the furnace heat as bj and harry backed off that had been a horrific thing but it had served to confirm that the driver was a lieutenant through the envelope of blueshimmering heat his blazing figure had been plainly visible where he tried to lift himself off the steering column failing hed then looked out through the wall of fire with eyes like peeled grapes a moment later his torso had burst open and put out corpsewhite tentacles or feelers to lash in the superheated interior of the car twining together the tentacles had blossomed outwards through the strippedaway roof and upward into the fiery slipstream where they floated in the incendiary updraft like the arms of a crippled anemone other tentacles had uncoiled like worms from the open car door they pissed an orange fluid all around that smoked where it fell to earth then the lieutenants vampire had submitted and he had withdrawn his molten appendages crumpled down into himself and begun to slop out of the door around the shoulders of his companion as for that one he had sat there lifelessly with bj s bolt through him and it had been over they had driven to dalwhinnie and during the journey bj had cancelled the episode from harrys mind hed seen things that just didnt fit the innocent image he had of her things out of her dark side that he wasnt ready for and from then on from harrys point of view at least they had simply been on a climbing and hunting trip which for reasons of her own bj had cried off nothing more complicated than that but of course harry was thinking and acting under hypnosis and for bj it wasnt that easy to throw off indeed she darent forget a single detail for it was life and death from dalwhinnie she had phoned auld john in inverdruie and told him to see to radu unlike bj who was radus lieutenant auld john was merely in thrall to the doglord though he had been a moonchild all his long life he would never run with the pack under a full moon it wasnt in him to be a werewolf but he was a very capable climber and he knew the way to the lair indeed as a gamekeeper in the protected preserve of the badenoch valley john had guarded the routes to radus lair for most of his life and of course he would attend to the doglord in bjs absence that is to say he would see to radus feeding and to the feeding of his creature and doubtless radu would probe johns all too eager mind to see what had gone wrong the plan had worked two days later auld john had called bj at the winebar to tell her all was well but as for him in his high place well he wasnae verra pleased his time was fast approaching and his resurgence could not be delayed come hell or high water bj necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley would present the mysterious one to him when next duty called her to the cairngorms lair which should have been this past weekend the three months reprieve had flown and despite that the weather had worsened dramatically and that she was less inclined than ever to part with her vee man thered seemed no putting it off but at least this would only be harrys initial audience after that there would still be six months left before radus actual resurgence then with less than two weeks to go before the scheduled visit things had started to happen in fact a variety of things had been happening all along ever since the failed attack of the drakuls for just a day or so after the release of the story of a fatal spey valley accident in the newspapers bj had been pleased to read how the home office had issued expulsion orders on several members of an obscure tibetan religious order believed to have been engaged in intersectarian warfare in the british isles not only were they being expelled but others of their order the emissaries of drakesh had been refused entrythis had gone hand in hand with the story of a firefight and the discovery of weapons and evidence of their use at the scene of what was previously and mistakenly considered a traffic accident it all fitted especially that reference to these emissaries of drakesh but a religious order hah an order of drakuls no less and in no way engaged in sectarian or any other kind of warfare but in spying and building up their numbers in advance of the doglords resurgence well at least radu would now know where to look for them or for him dd the last of his line in tibet but if this sneaking drakul in his fardistant monastery hideaway knew of radus imminent return then what of the ferenczys for a long time even decades bj had suspected that she was being watched just as she had watched out for and on occasion even tried to seek out others of her own and the doglords kind some years ago she had lost one of her girls mysteriously vanished in london radus opinion had been that it was the work of ferenczys who were seeking him out in anticipation of his rising since when bj had been doubly careful but not watchful enough or perhaps familiarity had bred contempt and time had worn down her vigilance it had been harry keogh who first brought to her attention the fact of a secret observer the little man she had told the inspector about for on harrys first visit to bjs wine bar he had seen this strange figure lurking in a shop doorway across the street apparently taking pictures but it was only after harry had described this watcher to bj that she realized shed seen him toofrequently over the years in and around the city and the rundown district of her wine bar but only at night or when it was cloudy and overcast then bj had remembered a hundred occasions when shed sensed eyes on her in a crowd or heard soft footsteps sounding behind her in quiet lanes or glimpsed pinpricks of gold in the shade of a vaguely familiar broadbrimmed hat and not only b j but most of her girls too so was this watcher a ferenczy spy such as radu had warned her about it seemed more than likely a spy a sleeper sent to scotland thirty or more years ago with no orders but to establish himself seek out the doglords thralls and minders and through them find radu himself in his secret place well so far he had failed b j felt reasonably sure her base was so far removed from radu and her precautions when she paid him her quarterly visits so strict and the climb to his lair so arduous with auld john to watch the routes for strangers that radus safety seemed assured but she herself and the pack her girlsthey had been discovered long ago so why had this ferenczy scum waited a hundred or more times he could have put a silver bullet through bjs head yet hadnt the answer seemed simple to take her out would be to alert radus other thralls if any such existed jeopardizing both the watcher and his masters wherever they were also the ferenczys could afford to wait for while radu was down he was no real threat and obviously this dd the last drakul felt the same let the sleeping doglord lie and while he lay investigate his thralls discover his lair and find out everything there was to be known about him and his then in the hour of his resurgence strike full force before his strength had time to flow back into him it all made sense or would do if the drakuls hadnt preempted things so what had caused them to jump the gun and as for harryhe had seemed edgy from his first glimpse of the redrobed priests what was it with him and them or was it simply coincidence or bj reading too much into too little but that aside in the quarter gone by since the drakuls failed attack ferenczy surveillance on the wine bar on bjs girls and herself had gone up one hundred per cent it was no lie when shed told inspector lanson about the observer since alerting her girls to his presence the furtive little man had been spotted a dozen times the only lie had been in regard to his great dog no such dog existed but a wolf a great white shewolf as for the drakuls themselves bj had read in a third newspaper report how the police were looking for four more members of the sect believed to be hiding out in the country it made sense originally the group had been six members strong so four of them were still here and probably not brian lumley too far away well no way they could sneak up on b j now not in their red robes anyway and be sure that she and her girls would avoid asiatics of any description or if need be strike back at them a second time so then all these reasons to let auld john stand in for her again put off her quarterly visit to radu in his den and so for a second time delay his meeting with harry a meeting which would surely seal the latters fate all these reasons and not one of them good enough the doglord would doubtless tell her that since she knew the problems to be overcome she must simply take greater precautions that was all worse he would probably wonder at her reticence too then with only a week to go the reprieve when fate had delivered a pair of far more acceptable excuses the fact that one of her girls margaret macdowell had been threatened a matter which bj must attend to herself and severe weather conditions making any kind of cairngorms venture more treacherous yet despite that shed had harry in training he was by no means the expert climber she certainly wouldnt want to lose him on some icy vertiginous face on the route to the doglords lair better far if his first audience with radu were delayed a further threemonth when the weather should be improved and the climb so much easier so her excuses were finally sufficient and shed called auld john in inverdruie and told him her decision and because she took time to list all of her reasons impressing them into johns memory she could be sure that when radu used his mentalism to dig them out again which he surely would he would know that bonnie jean mirlu was his true and devoted servant but in fact bj knew what she was treacherous and she knew why she was because she was wamphyri wamphyri aye and devious to a fault as every great vampire before her and yet devoted too to harry bjs jumbled thoughts returned to the present she was driving across an old stone bridge a quarter of a mile away along the river silhouetted against a threatening sky harrys house stood like an old watchful but blearyeyed owl between two sleeping brothers watchful but tired yes it was only then that bj paused to consider how anxious and tired she was and her actions since harrys call for the first time in a long time she hadnt bothered to take any precautions against being followed but it had been a week since shed last seen harry and he was feeling down and troubled in his mind and what with all of bjs other worries not least the inspectors visit and the fact that she was still waiting for a call from auld john la inverdruie to confirm that all was well with radu well little wonder she wasnt quite with it and necroscope the lost yean vol ii anyway what the hell who would be out following her on a night as cold and dark as this they would thats who but too late now to cry over spilled milk and anyway the odds were that they already knew about harry on the other hand they would also know he was only a man her human lover and of no great concern to them the ferenczys would think so anyway and the handful of drakuls were still in hiding so there was really no way she could have seriously compromised anything still as she pulled up outside the old house and dimmed her lights b j narrowed her slanted eyes and looked long and searchingh into her rearview and finally sighed her relief there was nothing back there but the dark ribbon of the river suddenly silvered by moonlight as a gap opened in the low cloud ceiling moonlight aye but two days past its full in another moment the gap had closed and it was dark again bj got out of her car locked it and almost ran up the path to harrys front door but across the river and roughly opposite harrys place on the grass verge of the country road and hidden beneath the overhanging branches of tall trees a second car sat in darkness and silence with only the occasional tick tick from an engine that was already cooling in the frosty night air the car was an old but reliable volkswagen beetle whose driver had known from several previous visits the best place to park for the next halfhour or so he would simply sit and watch and wait for the lights to go out then take his departure but at first light hed be back in time to see the girl leave nor was this any kind of weird longdistance voyeurism but simply his sinister job for b j mirlus habits were allimportant to him especially in connection with the man she was visiting and two hundred yards back up the same road on the same grass verge a third vehicle sat in darkness and silence but inspector george lanson was here for a very different reason not to spy on the girl not at all but on the spy and to wonder what in hell old angus mcgowan thought he was up to the inspector was here by virtue of a series of coincidences which was odd in itself because hed never believed in them his street was a noparking area wherefore he garaged his car the best part of a mile from home exconstable gavin strachan lived only a short walk away but in the other direction wherefore on leaving strachans place lanson had taken taxis to and from bjs but on his way home still wrestling with this thing about old anguss book brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii he had decided to pay the vet a visit it was rather latish true and mcgowan didnt much care for visitors at any time but lanson knew him for a nightowl and hoped he wouldnt mind also he could disguise the real purpose of his visit by asking the vet about his zoo queries how he was getting on with themthough why he would want to use such a subterfuge he couldnt quite say so he had taken the taxi to his garage then driven himself to mcgowans place east of the city towards the sea but as hed driven into the poorlylit street of tall dark houses where his quarry lived he had been barely in time to see the man himself leaving in his battered beetle it was the car that gave mcgowan away unless it was the way mcgowan was crouched over his steering wheel intent on his driving staring straight aheadhis furtive attitude in general or not even his attitude but lansons the way he was beginning to feel about this whole damn business a gut feeling yes a hunch the instinct that sometimes makes a good policeman great and sometimes the thing that makes him feel guiltytoo be that as it may lanson had turned his car around and used covert pursuit techniques learned twentyfive years earlier in the metropolitan police to follow the vet through edinburghs wintry night streets mercifully there had been just enough traffic that he could stay two or three cars back out of sight without losing mcgowan fortunate too that lansons sevenyearold car was an anonymous brown model of which there were hundreds in the city but in a little while it had dawned on the inspector that he was backtracking much the same route his taxi had taken from bjs winebar returning in fact to bjs wine bar a wild guess but it had proved to be an accurate one and as he drove into the bars district lansons gutfeeling had begun to knot into something else inside him once there mcgowan had found a space in a line of parked cars some little distance from the bar while he was engaged in manoeuvring into position lanson had taken the opportunity to overtake and find a space of his own from where hed been able to keep an eye on his rearview and watch both mcgowans car and the street in front of the wine bar then for some fifteen minutes he had sat there rubbing his hands to keep the circulation flowing and hoping that the heater wasnt running his battery low but mainly hed been wondering what was going on here what old angus doing some investigating of his own that wasnt acceptablemcgowan was a vet not a policeman what was more he so perfectly fitted bjs description of a watcher who had been seen on several occasions before the attack on margaret macdowell deep in thought the inspector had been very nearly taken by surprise when a party of girls exited from the recess leading to the wine bars entrance they were wellwrapped against the cold and too far away for him to identify any of them and in any case they had quickly split up and gone their own ways into the night it was approximately an hour since the inspector had left the bar obviously b j had closed early well that was selfexplanatory she had had little in the way of business to keep her open but as the girls dispersed so old anguss beetle had pulled out and driven away in some haste so that lanson must hurry to keep up with it and now where was the little man going his route lay west on a fairly major road out of the city so that once again lanson was able to sit back behind a car or two as he followed the distinctive shape of the volkswagen to whatever was its destination but as the flow of traffic dropped off and the night grew murkier yet the beetle turned onto a farm track reversed and came to a halt and its lights went out two hundred yards behind his quarry lanson hadnt thought that the track would lead anywhere perhaps mcgowan had feared he was being followed and pulled off the road to test the theory so the inspector had turned in through an open gate onto a lesser track turned about and pulled forward for a quick exit and waited the glint of the beetles windows had been visible through a neardistant hedgerow and by then there had been only a few vehicles on the main road most of them heading into edinburgh the next five minutes had passed slowly until a silvergrey car had come speeding along the main road from tile direction of the city as it passed mcgowans farm track so the volkwagens dipped lights had come on and mcgowan had turned back onto the main road following him lanson had driven on dipped lights too and now he had been sitting here in this place for half an hour and he was still wondering what was going on and what it was all leading up to but there was old mcgowan down the road out of his car now and leaning on its curving rear end doubtless for the warmth from the engine and gazing through binoculars at the lighted windows of the house across the river well enough of this lanson had just made up his mind to move on go home ask angus about it tomorrow when the lights in the house were suddenly turned down low a moment later and angus had got into his car and switched on the sidelights and it was as much as lanson could do to squeeze down in his seat out of sight as mcgowan turned the beetle about on the narrow road and headed back his way but as the car went by he couldnt resist it the urge to brian lumley lever himself up a little and look directly at the driver angus mcgowan absolutely but in that same moment mcgowan looked back at himand it was a different mcgowan how different lanson couldnt say he couldnt even say if the other had recognized him probably not and he had only recognized mcgowan because he knew it was him but that look on the little mans face the suspicion in those rheumy eyes those feral yellow eyes the evil aggressive thrust of the mans jaw for a good three minutes after the car had gone the inspector sat there then finally gave himself a shake started his car and crossed the river by the old bridge on the far side he parked and walked as quietly as he could along a rutted service road to where the silvergrey car stood in front of the middle house just one car the one mcgowan had been following lanson memorized the number plate checked that he knew his exact location went back to his car and drove home half an hour earlier im sorry im late bj breathlessly told harry in his bedroom i had to see to the takings talk to the girls lock up i got here as quickly as i could harry was fully awake now but still holloweyed the last week had been a trying time in fact the last three months had been trying even if he didnt know why but thered been this feeling of an impending something that had worked on his nerves like sandpaper and looking at bj he knew that it hadnt been easy on her either whatever it was but she should level with me he thought again wondering why b j wasnt a telepath the germ of the talent was in her as it was in most of the wamphyri to one degree or another but it wasnt an art yet by any means still perhaps she got something of what was on his mind harry im sorry she started to say and bit her tongue i mean im sorry that youre feeling down sure he said but without conviction and changing the subject did you go away this last weekend did you go north er no she shook her head i was busy and the weather he sought excuses for her and the new year just in we didnt have much of a christmas b j christmas that was scarcely bjs time but still er no she answered we didnt and im sorry but you know how busy the bar is inthe silly season she tapered off its been a week bj he said then and a week before that and before that etcetera in fact its been this way for months and when nectvscope the lost years vol ii were together youre always looking over your shoulder avoiding my eyes havingsecond thoughts she had been standing there looking at him now her heart gave a mighty lurch as she flew into his arms and said second thoughts not about you harry no not about you then say it he held her tightly mumbled into her hair say it she wasnt thinking straight couldnt not now that she was in his arms again call me yere wee man and put everything right he told her put it right even if it isnt well and she would have to switch him on if she wanted to use the phone in his presence else thered be things she said to auld john that he wouldnt understand harry mah wee man she said and at once felt him reel a little the sway of his upper body as the full moon blazed down and ike great wolf lifted his head in tribute howling from a throat that pulsed with the power of his song then b j felt harry tighten up a little in her arms and released him its all right she said fixing him with those hypnotic eyes of hers but i have to call auld john harry nodded to see how he is yes she nodded and then we can talk real talk its always real harry always for me anyway but bj knew what he meant and said real talk yes she leaned towards him and gave him a quick kiss and he didnt try to draw back but neither did he respond then bj sat at the side of the bed and phoned auld john at his cottage in inverdruie auld john was just done wrapping his wrist when the phone rang his bleddy wrist man if only his wounds would heal like the wee mistresss but they wouldnae he still had scars frae three months ago where on bonnie jean theyd be quite invisible by now and the telephone was ringing even as he tied a knot and tugged it tight with his teeth this would be the wee mistress hersel no doubt but it wasnae his fault hed no called hed been down and out for twentyfour hours aye a full nicht and a day and even now he wasnae feelin too guid john guiney he barked into the phone using a strong voice to disguise the fact of his physical weakness wha is it its me john the wee mistresss voice came back and he could almost taste the relief in it i was worried you didnt call me ah woulda done it this minute john protested trying not to whine but its no gone easy wi me bonnie jean the climb took it brian lumley necroscope the last years vol ii outa me and him up thereoh but he was a hungry yin lassie john are you all right she was anxious now ah am the

feel stronger than ever for think bonnie jean just think its mah blood that sustains him the noo but a moment later the excitement ebbed from his voice excep and he paused except she prompted him is there something john trembling auld john sat down with the telephone bonnie he wasnae pleased no not this time and far worse than last ah tol him a ye said ah shid it wouldnae do he spoke tae me in mah head ye ken and oh he was angry no so much wi ye as wi they others they ferenczys and drakuls but angry anyway ah could feel it boilin in him and its the wee mistress he needs no this auld sod if yell excuse mah language what did you tell him what did he get from you bjs tone was anxious again john could almost hear her heart pounding why only what yed tol me he trembled again his old head swimming in a sudden dizzy bout excep ye ken ah didnae tell him anythin much but he took it right out o mah head yes yes but what did he tell you oh ahve a message for ye be sure john answered no more

wee man that harry keogh hes tae be wi ye aye for hes verra important that yin for a moment there was silence on the line only a faint crackle of static in auld johns ear he could hear a log hissing sap in his grate and the wind in the eaves then at last bjs voice again but faint as a whisper will heis hedoes he think hell be up eh the great wolf up ye say no no that wasnae mah meanin six months he said but thats why he must see yere harry next time so that he may know the way of it but ahm no the clever yin bonnie jean as well ye ken ah wasnae too sure what he meant no but on the other end of the line bonnie jean believed she understood only too well what the doglord meant sitting beside her drawn and holloweyed harry keogh might well have understood it too if hed heard he hadnt however and dont worry about it john she told her old friend i can sort things out and she was at once concerned again for him but what about the climb was it really that bad oh aye but ah took the easy route up and killed a fine beast along the way for his creature that yinswell hes comin on ye ken tes she agreed i know auld john heard the dubious note in her answer very much as his query had sounded dubious lassie is a well as well as it can be she answered and before he could question that too john we have he has enemies here i hope you were careful not to be followed are there any strangers up your way have you noticed anything odd no one and nothin he answered but ye know me ahm no the one tae take chances why even when ah answer the door mah gun goes wi me ah reckon it was sheer luck they picked ye up that time and as for mahsel why ahm just a cranky old gillie as anyone hereabouts will be pleased tae confirm and sensing her grin he smiled then she said take care john well talk soon but dont you call me call you look after yourwound make sure it heals oh it will but it was only mah duty ye ken and after he heard the click as she put the phone down auld john sat and listened to the purring receiver in his hand and stared at his bandaged wrist where a thin red line was showing through even now his duty aye but it hadnae gone unappreciated and then he remembered what else radu had told him which he hadnt dared repeat to bonnie jean you are second in line john after the wee mistress ah but she is only a lassie after all and weak as all women are i fear that when my time comes she may bend or even break so mark these words which are for you alone keep my secrets and serve me well john as your ancestors before you and who can sayone day you could be first in line the doglords promise it ran through auld johns veins like wine and sang to him it gave a new meaning to existence and was well worth every extra drop of lifes blood that hed let flow down the funnel to the great houndlike thing in the vat worth too the lie hed been obliged to tell b j but that had been on the orders of radu himself and who was auld john to defy him in his high place aye for radu was quickening and he had needed that extra drop brian lutnley necroscope the lost years vol ii or two up in a sixmonth ah notry four but radu had told john that he couldnt tell bonnie jean indeed that he must lie to her for john was to be his confidant now that the wee mistress had shown herself to bewell just a wee lassie after all it wasnt her fault though john was sure more likely it was all down to that harry keogh aye ah but the doglord had plans for him too up in just four more months and then wed see about this harry and heres bj worrying about john contacting her well he wouldnt but radu would be sure three moons from now just thirteen weeks that was all and then shed hear his call that silent howling in her head that drew her like a magnet shed get her instructions then aye and a month later the one whod caused her to stray from the pathhe would get his comeuppance his wound harry had overheard one or two things after all hmm b j looked at him you told him to take care of his wound he cut himself on the rock face she lied oh is this the real talk you wanted she began unbuttoning her blouse for there are other ways to beguile a man and better ways to ease his pain too and hers you tell me he said very well you can think and speak normally and at once he was himself those warm eyes disguising a cold and calculating brain bj did something happen that time when we were up in the highlands we went up to auld johns place in inverdruie to climb and hunt but you cried off and this last weekend again you cried off going well ok for after all its the middle of winter now but what about the last time have you been reading the newspapers harry no why was there something i should have read bj shook her head shed cancelled the episode from his mind and didnt want to let it surface now which obviously it was trying to do have you been having bad dreams harry you said on the phone that youd been dreaming dreams halfmemoriesanxieties and feelings i dont understand you name it he shrugged despairingly she thought and then out of the blue bj why dont you level with me level with you her blouse was off now and her breasts proud and stifftipped where they begged for harrys attention almost automatically she wriggled out of her skirt ask your questions if i can answer them i will i dont know all of it do i no why not i can only tell you what hell let me tell you radu the doglord yes but hes a liar harry snapped his voice suddenly harsh and full of hate hes wamphyri and theyre all liars again b j was taken aback butdid i tell you that that hes wamphyri had she well of course she had that time when shed explained her purpose and harrys eventual role in things shed been thrown that was all by the vehemence in his voice the knowledge in his eyes but damned if she remembered telling him that the wamphyri were all liars b j couldnt know it but harry too had been thrown into a state of confusion hed almost trapped himself tripped over his own tongue for the necroscope wasnt the only one who didnt know it all there were quite a few things that he hadnt or couldnt tell b j too yes he said you told me radu is wamphyri a great vampire and he has enemies opposed to his return the ferenczys and the drakuls and that they are full of lies she nodded and thought hes sweating why does he sweat like that whats on his mind that ohsodeep mind of his harry didnt know either not what was on his mind only that something swirled there beneath the surface secret information hidden in its own mental limbo b j had the power to unlock it buthe didnt want it unlocked if she knew he had been to those places she would want to know when he was there and why and what route hed taken she would want to know about the mobius continuum how he had discovered it and how hed used it to go to those places but what fucking places then it happened for several seconds it was what his ma and b j had both feared if not exactly as they had imagined it when suddenly harrys two levels of consciousness and knowledge interfaced he stood in the open in bright daylight and craned his neck to look up and up at dramatically stark yellow and white cliffs and at the squat whitewalled castle mansion or chateau that was perched there on the edge of oblivion the scene was mediterranean and he knew it well knew the castle too le manse madonie sicily necroscope the lost yean vol ii brian lumley the ferenczys wamphyri jesus god his mind whirledand harry whirled too he was whirled away from there whirled elsewhere to a frozen monochrome landscape the roof of the world and a gaunt range of mountains marching against grey skies that went on forever it was biting cold and the snow slanting down like a million white spears forming an everthickening freezing crust on him where he leaned into the blast and seen like a flickering old film on or through the dotdash screen of hissing snow the long snaking wall of a city like a small version of the great wall of china while in the other direction hewn out of a sheer cliff at the foot of the mountains a great carved face as grim and as cold as its location at the head of carved steps the yawning mouth in the face was the entrance towhat a temple of sorts a monastery yes but dedicated to what ancient and evil religion there came a distant tinkle of tiny golden bells growing louder even as the hiss of lancing snow faded the scene faded with it but the bells were louder still sounding sinister now as the necroscope was once again transported moved by his mind to yet another forbidden memory he seemed to be in a glade where the light was dappled as it fell through the trees bj was with him and they were standing beside a car looking back along a track like a leafy tunnel at a stationwagon standing some fifty feet away leaning on the vehicles open front doors a pair of redrobed asiatics looked back at them one of these priests had a gun in his hand and both had grins on their faces but there are grins and there are grins in the dappling of the trees their eyes were feral full of yellow shifting light and their grins were vacuous like those of crocodiles or hyenas and full of malice drakuls bj had a crossbow and knew how to use it her eyes were feral too as she aimed and squeezed the trigger there came a thok sound and a feeling entirely physical with it then b js worried voice harry harry as he was jarred out of it back into reality however confused his head had smacked against the beds headboard when hed jerked out of her arms and toppled over and its ok she told him its ok time and time again as she lay his head back on the pillows held his frantically if aimlessly waving arms and riveted his pinprick eyes with her own hypnotic ones until finally he began to believe her that it was ok then she was turning the lights down low her voice too as she began to reverse the process that had started within him to once more separate his two levels of being in a little while it was as if harry had been asleep indeed he had been in a deep sleep induced by b j in a nightdark place where there had been absolutely nothing except her voice insisting that it was ok and as he came out of it it was ok her cool fingers were on his brow soothing away the last traces of fever her body scent masked or mingling with some subtle hint of perfume was in his nostrils her breasts were within easy reach where she kneeled over him what e said she gave a little snort and said some talker you talker harry was baffled but he was him again or the him she wanted him to be at least as if to prove it he instinctively lifted his hands and gentled the marble hardtipped globes of her freehanging breasts she threw back her head stretched to the sensation of his hands on her and sighed we were to have a real talk but you fell asleep some talker you and some lover knackered he said i must have been but im ok now except he paused and frowned she had left him in switchedon mode he knew about her radu everything she wanted him to remember but everything else was safely back in limbo it had to be that way at least until she could check that her hypnotic adjustments had taken except she prompted him just one thing he said just one real talk yes he nodded stood up and quickly stripped out of his pants and shirt real talk about radu oh b j tried to remain calm despite the fact that his actions as he prepared for love had cushioned the impact of his query still his words had seemed cold and calculating hes in his vat deep in a resin bath yes in a sleep of centuries she nodded but hell be up soon again her nod has to be if i we are to survive we cant fight his enemies on our own afterwards idont want to know about radu only about us that last was straight from the heart if only it could be so he shook his head this isnt only about radu bj its also about you about me hes in his vat deep in the resin he hasnttouched you it brian lumley was as if those soulful eyes of his were looking right into her soulful but bottomless and sometimes as cold as some unfathomed ocean floor bj thought she knew what harry meant and believed she understood his concern he was asking if radu was more than merely her master wondering if perhaps hed been her lover too and maybe in one sense b j was right to interpret his question thus but in fact it was deeper than that and there were parallels here that only the necroscope recognized which he could never explain to bj because hed been forbidden to do so for example the necromancer boris dragosani had also been the guardian of a vampires tomb in his time and at first he too had been an innocent in his fashion dragosanis fate however was something harry must steer clear of as best he possibly could he darent think too deeply about it despite that it had prompted his question for the idea simply wasnt acceptable it wasnt tenable not in tandem with bjs situation touched me she contrived to look puzzled but radu was down in the resin centuries before i was born like a great fly trapped in amber how could he possibly touch me except in his capacity to speak to me through his mentalism it was the truth and it was a lie a white lie and what difference did it make anyway for it was the cure harry expelled air in a great sigh as if hed been holding it in his lungs forever a single word came bursting like a bubble from his lips innocent and b j knew he meant her innocence the only facet of her posthypnotic facade that shed forgotten to reinstate so harry had done it for her it had been that important to him now he was satisfied and so was she she switched him off with four simple words harry mah wee man then switched him on again with her body afterwards they slept but the necroscopes dreams were uneasy and from time to time lurched into grotesque nightmares twice in the night he started awake fancying that bjs breasts were too many and that they felt like flaccid hairy dugs in his hands the watcher unmasked it was a late night for inspector george lanson and an early morning a late night because he contacted police central and requested a vehicle registration check on the silvergrey car then waited up until he had the answer which had taken all of an hour because they were busy and an early morning because he didnt sleep too well and wanted to do an occupancy check first thing on number the riverside what was on his mind was bj the fact that it was her car old angus had followed but why surely the old fool knew better than to go carrying out his own investigations on bj and her wine bar he had his own kind of investigations to do for gods sake and then there was that look on his face when hed driven away from the place on the river if there was an explanation for that well for the life of him the inspector couldnt think what it might be at am he phoned bj at the wine bar he couldnt be sure she would be home yet or even if she planned on returning home today but he had to try anyway he got her first go and without ado asked bj didnt you fancy someone might be following you last night he heard her suck in her breath and then something that he really hadnt wanted to hear last night when last night so did she have something to hide come come bj when you left the wine bar and went to see mr keogh oh but in any case bj had realized her mistake the moment she made it stupid to play dumb with lanson he was no fool this one a big secret is it he asked her softly and heard her sigh of resignation but on the other end of the line she was doing some fast thinking necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley harryis a married man she finally said but separated he doesnt even know where his wife is she walked out on him that was some time ago years even but i see lanson said toure still being careful inspector i thought it might be possible that the man who has been watching my place was a private detective employed by harrys wife but believe me i wasnt trying to throw you a red herring thats why i didnt tell you about him immediately the watcher i mean but when you came to my place and mentioned a big dog and what with margaret being attacked and allsuddenly it all seemed to connect up i understand lanson said but now tell me does harry keogh have a dog no nor even a budgie but what are you thinking please believe me that im trying to believe you bj but no more red herrings accidental or otherwise ok no of course not but about last nightwas i really followed by you bysomeone he told her but it just happened that i was following him it was quite accidental i assure you no one is investigating you well not the police anyway who then she said i mean if you were following himdoes that mean you know him no he lied but you might be able to help me i have a picture of our suspect if you can identify him as your watcher im sure i can trace him again maybe even tie him to the murder at sma auchterbecky then too it would be up to mcgowan to explain what he was doing watching bj her place and her girls and doing it since a time before the attack on margaret macdowell on her end of the line b j saw it as another chance to throw a spanner in this ferenczy scums works get him off her back a picture she said a photograph any time you like inspector ill be only too pleased to identify him if i can good lanson told her lef s do it now then i can be there in half an hour very well be expecting you and bj yes dont worry you can be pretty sure that this isnt someone acting on behalf of your harrys wife no indeed three of b js girls were there along with bonnie jean herself they corroborated what lanson had hoped not to discover that mcgowan or someone who looked just like him was the watcher who had been plaguing their lives and hed been doing it for a very long time yes now lanson must hope it was simply a case of mistaken identity that the old vet had a double but quite apart from that there was this other thing that was weird beyond explanation old anguss book the photograph on the dustjacket but once again until all the facts are known nothing is known the publisher was a oneman edinburghbased outfit small potatoes in the vast world of books that specialized in safaris and travel in remote regions zoological and ecological topics in general its offices were in a quiet treelined culdesac just outside the city proper towards linlithgow it had turned out to be one of those rare bright and invigorating winter mornings when lanson parked his car outside greentree publishing limited and was seen into the main office indeed the only office by the head of the firm himself jeoffrey greentree the inspector had thought that perhaps the firm had been named for its subjects and had opened by saying as much and in fact oh it has it has mr greentree told him beaming it was sheer good fortune that my name fits the subjects too conservation inspector the creatures of the wilds and the woods and the trees themselves of course green trees mother earth gaia we only use recycled papers you know the pages may tend to brown but the forests stay green that should be our motto what can i do for you sir beanpole meets bean lanson thought but not unkindly the odd couple jeoffrey greentree was small and in his sixties slightly hunched and roundshouldered softvoiced and twinkleeyed his chin sat forward almost on his chest a bean of a man yes but for all that hed worked with fine print all his life his eyes were still alert if a little watery his hair was very thin on top but his mobile bushy eyebrows somehow made up for it and greentrees office wassomething else lanson had been in solicitors offices that were far less cluttered one entire wall looked like a vertical maze of allegedly alphabetically arranged pigeonhole shelving spilling out of the various compartments were dusty packages of letters old manuscripts contracts proofsand photographs lanson was prompted to refer immediately to the reason for his visit you can perhaps help me with this he said placing mcgowans brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii book on a typically cluttered and dusty desk and opening it to the back flap that showed old anguss picture or if not you yourself then whoever edited this book for the author or anyone else who might know something about it its quite an old book i know and its been in print and probably out of print for years but sit down inspector please sit greentree waved him to a chair took up mcgowans book and sat down behind his desk and what have we here ah yes its been some time since i happened upon a first edition other than my own copy that is definitely a first edition the whole thing wrapper and all hmm greentree blinked at him questioningly oh very definitely yes and rare too but as i said i do have my own copy i keep at least one copy of everything i do it should be on the shelves there er somewhere he waved a hand and returned to studying the book the shelves he referred to covered the wall opposite the maze of documents lanson stood up went to them and tried in vain to locate angus mcgowans name on the spine of any one of nine hundred to a thousand tides but you might have a little difficulty greentree told him people refer to a book and eventually return it to the shelvesbut rarely in the right place i gave up long ago ah but that doesnt mean i dont know where they are he joined lanson at the bookshelves but you havent yet told me inspector just what is it that interests you in wild dogs big cats anyway and with a marksmans aim almost casually he reached up a surprisingly long arm and took a duplicate copy from one of the higher shelves blowing dust off it he offered it to lanson oh the authors a friend of mine the inspector answered absentmindedly angus mcgowan i mean he returned to the desk and compared this pristine copy with strachans condition apart they were identical indeed well ive only met the man twice myself though i did speak to him on the phone more frequently but that was a long time ago an odd sort of man i do remember thinking of him er that he held his years very well just why that last statement should hit lanson the way it did wasnt hard to say it was the very reason he was here at the same time however mr greentree might well have produced the answer the very ordinary commonplace answer that the inspector had been seeking to what had become an extraordinary question if only in his own mind no mystery here at all but simply the feet that mcgowan held his years very well oh really then why were alarm bells clamouring even now in the back of lansons mind when did you last see him why it must be twenty years ago greentree replied we were reprinting his book this book yes which was ten years out of date and mr mcgowan came in with a new chapter and a handful of revisions and a request a request greentree nodded he wanted us to replace his picture on the back flap of the jacket with some extra copy hed prepared that picture yes he pointed to the photographs that the inspector was comparing it seems he wasnt very enamoured of his features thats when i noticed that in ten years his looks had scarcely changed at all so i suppose hes a lucky fellow or maybe not i mean it probably isnt for me to say but mr mcgowan isnt a particularly handsome man but at least he seemed to recognize that fact old anguss looks hadnt changed in ten years lanson felt a shudder run up his spine well try the next twenty my friend try the next twenty and that would make thirty in all but greentree was right for a fact and now that fact came back to the inspector more forcefully than ever hed known mcgowan for three decades and never seen a change in him what am i blind or something or had he too been telling himself all along that mcgowan seemed to hold his years very well familiarity was that it the fact that scarcely a week passed that they didnt meet for a game of chess or a drink or whatever but i have changed lanson thought i have grown old and plenty of my colleagues with me yet oldangus was old when first we met jesus god in heaven whats going on here something wrong mr greentree was looking concerned yes said lanson numbly noi dont know but you can be sure im going to find out grimly determined now he sat down with greentree at his desk and took up one of the books and for the sake of clarity and probably for sanitys sake too he said now i want to be one hundred per cent sure about this youre certain that this is a first edition but of course greentree looked mystified i mean i am the publisher after all the date is clearly shown on the data page seven years since the war but i was still using the same lowgrade paper to satisfy government restrictions and as i told you ive been using it ever since and you published a new edition some ten years later exactly ten years later would you like to see if brian lumley please lanson sat and waited while greentree went back to the bookshelves and returned with much the same book but in the more recent edition that the inspector remembered seeing at mcgowans place that time and this is the edition that doesnt carry his picture right just as i told you the other nodded but why not open it and see for yourself lanson did so and checked there was more copy on the back flap but no picture because he wanted more space for copy on the jacket and because hed decided that the picture wasnt entirely flattering as i told you yes or maybe because he didnt look any older and he didnt want the the what anomaly mistake repeated down the years in case someone should eventually notice this was crazy oh and one other thing greentree frowned all of this was some time ago as youll appreciate but now it comes back to me what does well the fact that mr mcgowan is something of a perfectionist go on i do believe that he so disliked the earlier book that he bought up a good many copies and destroyed them though not for the photograph im sure no it could only be that he was dissatisfied with earlier work that he considered incomplete its no rare thing ive heard of several authors doing it professional pride or some such that would explain why you havent seen a copy for such a long time mean apart from the one on your shelves exactly greentree saw the inspector to die door mr greentree lanson shook his hand it was very good of you to give of your time like diis not at all but now id like another favour well fire away dont mention this to anyone if things work out i promise ffl get back to you but in the meantimenot a word well its all very mysterious but very well after all you are a custodian of die law indeed said lanson smiling but his smile was forced and in die back of his mind he was thinking a custodian of the law yes and far the last thirty years of god only knows what else or it had to be a mistake there had to be an explanation but with this case this murder case lanson must keep reminding necroscope the lost yean vol ii himself absolutely nothing seemed to be making any sort of sense but tonight it would or it would start to at least and it would start with angus mcgowan the inspector had work to do at police hq nothing connected with this thing but work nonetheless it kept him busy until midafternoon when he drove home then he called mcgowan and waited while the telephone rang and rang it had always been the same the little man invariably took his time answering the phone but eventually aye came his rasping voice angus its george lanson told him trying to keep his voice as casual as possible weve a game of chess to finish as youll recall its halfplayed out on the board just waiting for us to pick it up where we left off your move i think so i was wondering how are you fixed for tonight oh and of course youll want to bring me up to date on your zooquest that business at sma auchterbecky for a few seconds there was silence then and ah expec yell be wantin tae fill me in on yere own progress am ah no right the inspector tried to imagine himself talking to mcgowan face to face and thus keep the conversation natural but there was a certain something in the others voice a very wary something that told him it wouldnt be that easy perhaps honesty would be the best policy after all well its true there have been one or two interesting developments he began but when he heard old anguss dry rasping chuckle in response why he could almost see the little vet grinning like a cheshire cat and that familiar chuckle of his it was so reassuring that lanson found himself wondering where all his doubts had sprung from developments is it the little vet queried aye and much the same at mah end too in fact ah fancy ahtn ahead o the game george that stopped lanson dead damn the man he had been investigating on his own against all the rules and obviously knew a lot more than he was saying with which all of the inspectors remaining doubts flew right out the window for this was sly old angus as usual playing his wordgames and hugging his knowledge tight to his chest like a miser with his hoard this ohsoclever irritating little man this friend of george lansons for so long that the accumulated years couldnt possibly be brushed aside on a mere whim or set of weird circumstances but aggravating absolutely so ahead of the game are you he said well you were last night anyway or behind it certainly and i was right behind you it was the inspectors way a shock statement like that right out of the blue but if he had hoped to surprise the other no such luck brian lumley aye so ye were old angus chuckled again ah suspected it was yeresel even in that nonedescrip heap o old junk ye call a car but are ye no ashamed o yereselgeorge hidin in the bushes an a as if yere old pal was up tae no good then for good measure he made tsk tsk noises so that lanson could picture him shaking his head disapprovingly he had to smile and it was good to smile for hed been down in the dumps for some time but now almost audibly sighing his relief he said well just what were you up to angus if i hadnt recognized your beetle i might even have suspected i was following the murderer there came another longer pause then mcgowans rasping voice again its tone more serious than lanson could ever remember hearing it before ah but ye were followin just such a murderer george ye were what not me and ami never forgive ye if thats what yeve been thinkin even though ye may have had cause but the no so wee bonnie lassie hersel aye bonnie jean mirlu and her pack lansons brain whirled angus what in the big dogs george dye no remember well of course i remember but and what about big bitches eh lanson shook his head for all the world as if he thought mcgowan could see him bitches im not with you but at the same time he recognized a not so vague connection with exconstable strachans story and more he remembered one of mcgowans comments at sma auchterbecky at the murder scene about a dog or a bitch of a different colour not wi me george old angus repeated are ye no but yed be a damn clever policeman if ye were or maybe a madman eh theres weird here mah friend and thats puttin it mildly ahve been gatherin it for years and now ah have it a but theres a hell o a lot o it and its no the sort o stuff a man shid talk about on the telephone a lot of what for gods sake evidence man hard evidence angus now listen but he wasnt listening will ye come to your place now aye the nicht the sooner the better the noo the inspector made up his mind old angus was eager whatever he had he seemed ready to spill it all and delight in his cleverness which would be his right if he really had stumbled onto something and if it was as big as he appeared to think it was but bonnie jean necroscope the lost years vol ii mirlu mcgowans accusation had finally sunk in are you telling me that ahve said a ahm sayin on the phone george so ill come as soon as ive eaten lanson told him as ye will but dont keep me waitin george ah mean the games afoot and its big game this time with which the inspector was finally convinced at least that there was a lot he was yet to be convinced about and so be there in about an hour he said guid said the other but drive careful george they roads are awfy treacherous wi the slush freezin on em aye and a man can never tell whos followin behind him ye ken and in the moment before the phone went down lanson was annoyed yet again to hear the little vets irritating chuckle it was barely five but already dark when lanson reached old anguss place and parked his car behind the vef s volkswagen he had been here before well on occasion and so wasnt at a complete loss but as he left the street through a complaining wroughtiron gate climbed a short flight of steps to the archedover entrance and went to ring the bell so the stout oak door gaped wide and angus was there waiting on the threshold at that precise moment some vehicle must have gone by in the road and sent a glancing headlight beam to strike the vets eyes which for a second burned yellow with reflected light it wasnt the first time that the inspector had noted this effect perhaps it was the contrast for behind mcgowan the hall lights were out in fact the entire house seemed to be in darkness the little vet was dressed for outdoors a raincoat over his streetclothes and his customary widebrimmed hat he took lansons arm and greeted him with a whispered no george it willnae do tae park just there ahm probably bein watched so come on well put yere car in mah garage by the sea he led the way back to lansons car and directed him to a row of garages set back from the dark waterfront a quartermile away his garage was spacious but damp built of rotting bricks on waterlogged foundations ahm told theyre comin down in a year or so he said a lot o they crumblin old houses too a new promenade or some such fancy scheme for the tourists an a and then they walked back in silence to his place but as they reached the house and mcgowan turned a key in the door to let them in angus the inspector took his elbow man but youre mysterious tonight i mean i really dont know what to make of all this youre being watched you say aye if s more than likely the other nodded glancing back out brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii into the street so wed best no be standin around out here eh but as lanson made to enter mcgowan blocked his path and george he said staring hard at his guest what ahm about tae tell ye and maybe show ye isnae for common men why it can change ye forever and its no mah desire tae be the one yell be blamin lanson shook his head in bewilderment angus if i didnt know you better he said td have to take this as being some kind of joke i cant imagine what youre into but ye do want tae know of course i want to know i have to know irritated now and with his patience quite exhausted the inspector brushed by him and mcgowan let him pass of yere own free will then he whispered as he locked the door behind them the passageway leading past the gloomily climbing staircase to the livingroom was nightdark ahead lanson knew the way however vaguely in any case it was mcgowans turn to take his elbow as he ushered him deeper into the house but at last some welcome illumination even if it caused the inspector to stagger a little and blink in the sudden glare as his host switched on the lights lanson had never much cared for mcgowans house nor even for the district in which it stood the area was too old cold and too close to the sea only a few of the houses were habitable and as angus himself had pointed out they were being demolished street by street but it was possible thered be a government subsidy in it if and when he had to move out so maybe thats what had kept him here all these years the houses were tall narrow terraced victorian affairs with gabled attic windows they must have been handsome enough in their day but the area had long since fallen out of favour with estate agents much of the waterfront just here was dilapidated to the point of ramshackle lanson was fairly sure that was why old angus never asked him round much because he was a little ashamed of the district but in any case the inspectors bright and spacious flat had seemed more suitable for their occasional gettogethers and come to think of it it would have been just as suitable for this meeting tonight why here it was a trait of lansons the hallmark of years of policework to ask leading questions and sometimes it could be an error too t mean why couldnt you have come to my place and since you fancied i had been tailing you why didnt you call me to put both of our minds at rest ah was waitin for ye tae admit defeat mcgowan grinned ah was wantin tae see how yed get on with yere man and big dog theory oh but never fear ahd a called ye for sure if yed taken much longer tae call me the livingroom was lshaped and highceilinged draughty yet dampsmelling too mcgowan lit a gas fire in a converted hearth fetched a whisky bottle and glasses saw lanson comfortable on an ancient leather couch and seated himself opposite and george its time ah confessed he said ah didnae do mah job ahve no checked up on local zoos and what a and ah dinnae intend tae but desertion o duty never and why not because ah ken only too well where our murderin beastie comes frae where she lives and its no a zoo or a wildlife park am ah goin too fast for ye lanson took his glass stood up and moved to a bookshelf no he answered because so far youve told me exactly nothing you said or hinted that you had evidence of something farreaching but all we have so far is meaningless words youre obviously talking about b j mirlu and its also obvious you think shes guilty of something murder you said well maybe she is he shrugged i wont know until i know it all mcgowan had followed him so yere ready tae hear me out are ye george guid but are ye openminded enough ah told ye it was weird the inspector had found what he was looking for the book hed seen once before on these very shelves the second edition of wild dogs big cats by angus mcgowan he took it back to the couch and laid it on an occasional table close to hand mcgowan again followed him looked at him in a curious fashion and at the book and said well ill hear you out aye the inspector nodded verra well but no interruptin mind mah tales a long yin and once ahm started ahll want tae finish its how tae start thats the problem try the beginning lanson advised and after old angus had topped up their glasses he did heres a word for ye tae conjure wi lycanthropy say nothin george just listen now ye ken ahve been interested in wild creatures a mah life why they books on mah bookshelves there tell it a that the diseases and hurts o wild things have been mah life ah mean literally but mah interest hasnae confined itsel tae broken bones and ailments its the nature of the animals theysels that fascinates me zoology aye and ahve awiz had a verra special interest in predators big dogs or cats but especially dogs for ysee theres this tradition in mah family that certain ancestors o mine kith at least if not kin were killed by wolves that was here in scotland of all places but more than three hundred years ago brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii yell no doubt recad mah passion for myths and legends how ah cannae resist a guid story in the papers about beasties killin sheep on bodmin moor or dartmoor or in the highlands or just about anywhere else aye and even the really bigyins though often the nosoreal yins indeed ye might even call em bogus beasties if ye take mah meanin in the lochs and such how ah pack mah bag and go off tae check such things out and sometimes how they even pay me tae do it well when ah was younger ah was very welltravelled ah got about in this big wide world and learned a lot o strange stuff yeve no doubt heard o beastchildren george brought up frae bairns by creatures o the wild wolfchildren in india and nepal and russia dingo or hyenapeople in the australian outback or the african veldt whenever ah heard o that sort o thing ahd be off again tae see what it was a about most o these marvels are faked o course tourist attractions for want o a better description much like auld nessie hersel ah fancy but in hungary and romania ah did come across the odd case or two that simply defied explanation and in sicilyoh a sorts o rumours in sicily and the mediterranean in general but in fact it was in sicily that ah met up wi folks o similar persuasions people who were interested in trackin down the same kind o legends as mahsel where was ah oh aye romania why its only thirty years ago in a place called dumitresti in romania that they had a spate o wolfkillings murders mah friend by the light o the full moon the local folks knew what it was they waited a month til the moon was full again then sent out hunters intae the mountains wi rifles and silver bullets tae kill the beast they knew where tae find him too near a gypsy encampment because theyd made a connection dye see that whenever the romany folk came this way the bleddy werewolf came wi them romany szgany george thats what they call gypsies in they parts and these were the szgany mirlu eh and did ye no think tae ask that bonnie bonnie jean where she hails frae or if not the lassie hersel her people before her oddly enough lanson had asked bj that selfsame question though in a different connection and because of her accent not her name but as he opened his mouth and stumblingly went to make some comment that he hadnt quite thought out ah no dinnae gawp and wave yere arms mcgowan seemed excited now dinnae start yappin on about coincidence and such but hear me out dye think ahm stupid george ah mean dye think ah dinnae ken how a this must sound well ah ken well enough but first let me tell it a and then make up yere own mind for ahm no the luny here ye can take bets on that aye and theres another good word for ye lunacy moon madness the madness o a creature who howls to his or her mistress moon and whose foamin mouth contains a bite thats contagious and carries a fever a fever o change aye what impossible dye think so and what about rabies spread bite by bite thatll change a creature even a man tae a ravin monster and doesnae cancer change the cells o a mans body and malaria change the colour o his skin and acromegaly his verra shape so tell me whos tae say lycanthropy cannae do the same by now the inspector was more than a little concerned for mcgowan in fact he was downright worried despite the logic of certain of the contents of the mans what his dialogue or harangue they seemed to have no connection with lansons view of reality indeed the little vet appeared to be outlining some peculiar obsession something that he had kept hidden bottled up inside him for a long long time but as yet there was no sense of danger here in fact if anything lanson was starting to feel drowsy lethargic lulled by the vets whisky this despite the fact that old angus himself waxed ever more excited more animated as for the myth o the silver bullet he went on now but isnae lead a metallic poison too or mercury or plutonium or a dozen others different chemicals affect different species george one mans meat as they say so what am ah ravin on about but by now its surely obvious even tae a downtaeearth bawbee such as yersel but hold yere fire a while longer and ahtl say on excep ah see yeve run dry so lets top up yere glass a wee there and a drop for me too as he poured so lanson found strength of will to reach inside his pocket and draw out mcgowans first edition of wild dogs big cats placing it facedown on the table beside the other book there was no hidden threat in this no intention to surprise or startle he merely intended to ask mcgowan about the photograph and didnt want to forget that was all for surely someone mr greentree must be seriously in error here indeed a great many things seemed in error here as in a dream the inspector opened the back flap of the book to old anguss picture which seemed to float up off the paper at him then he let his hand fall into his lap where it lay trembling exhausted apparently from the effort of handling the book mcgowans eyes darted from the book to lansons face and back again he pointed at the photograph and his pinched face gave an involuntary twitch as his thin lips drew back a little from teeth that were sharp and white the inspector had always thought they were brian lumley necroscope tke lost yean vol ii false those teeth and surely they must be but longevity mcgowan had burst out without any recognizable sense of continuity another key word aye and ah can see yeve been worryin about it but o course ye wouldnae have any reason tae check up on that sweet young thing at the wine bar now would ye well well get tae that eventually but for now where was ah aye ah remember now he pulled himself together thirty years ago in a place called dumitresti in romania werewolves george werewolves they hunters ah mentioned they shot theysels a wolf a great grey monster o a beast that had one o they mens left arm off at the shoulder before they killed it then the authorities had them a up for trialfor murder for o course it was the same auld story they hadnae shot a beast but an innocent gypsy lad a youth frae the romany caravan site oh really so why were they acquitted george set free turned loose wi never a stain on their characters a backward land ye say and even today full o monsters in their own right such as its bleddy government well its true enough and thats the noo but romania thirty years ago and so ahm obliged tae agree its no fair o me tae base man argument or shall we say mah dissertation on alleged occurrences taken place in such a barbaric hellhole so lets take a look at a more enlightened society shall we like how about england or even closer to home scotland maybe what about the highlands just thirty years ago aye just about the same time as this incident in dumitresti ah but it would surprise me if by now ye hadnae done yere homework george indeed ahm certain sure ye ken what ahm on about so then what about it eh that incident at the wildlife park on the spey ehem ah see it in yere eyes george how would auld angus ken a about that but have ye no been listenin man this is mah field its a part o me no less than policework is a part o yeresel but thirty years ago well let me tell ye that was some weird time it was a phase o the moon somethin different a time o unrest among a the worlds lycanthropes romania hungary aye and scotland too it was everywhere they couldnae control theysels they ran wild for however brief a spell the moon held a the wolffolk in her power and the bloodlust ran high as the highest tides so now lets get tae bonnie jean but firstwill ye no have another nip what its gone right tae yere head has it just a couple o wee drams ah well it happens like that sometimes when a bodys a mite weary maybe its a this detective work yere doin george aye for some o us are no as young as we used tae be its gettin time for ye tae quit ah fancy but where was ah oh aye bonnie jean mirlu ahve been watchin that yin for some time now for too long lanson gurgled finding his tongue floppy in his mouth from a timea time before the murder at sma auchterbecky the moment after he said it he could have bitten his tongue off but too late and it had probably been too late anyway the doctored whisky and the fact that old angus very old angus had scarcely touched a drop the inspector could not possibly know or even make a guess at what was going on here but he sensed that he was in serious trouble and his fear must have shown in his eyes mcgowan sprang to his feet agile as a youth so ah was right he snarled teve tumbled me oh yeve no proof positive as yet no enough for george bleddy lansons ohsoorthodox downtaeearth mind anyway but good enough tae start investigatin me eh well ahm sorry mah old friend but it cannae be and ahm done the noo wi a this blether but the look on his face lanson had seen it before when mcgowan had driven away from the house on the river that look of sheer bestial loathing was the man insane angus the inspector tried to speak but could only mumble quick as the vet himself he too had tried to spring erect only to go sprawling when his legs failed to obey his brain or maybe his brain wasnt sending or receiving the right information for everything was beginning to swim before his eyes seein me at that bleddy house outside bonnyrig was bad enough mcgowan rasped knowin that ahve been watchin the wine bar and bj mirlu since long before she slaughtered that other damn animal at sma auchterbecky is a lot worse but now yeve found this bleddy book o mine mah one error and me hopin a these years it would never come up again well if s a too much and yeve done for yeresel george he came around the table lanson could see his feet floating towards him coming closer expanding to the size of barges in his poisoned vision then however numbly he felt the vets arms lifting him but picking him up like a child into the firemans lift position the strength of the man in a way its opportune mcgowan was speaking as much to himself as to the inspector theyll know ye were investigatin the murder when ye dont show up theyll probably speak tae the girl again thatll keep her busy but theyll no give me a second thought what but auld angus mcgowan was yere pal and ahll be properly necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley upset when ah learn how yeve up and disappeared but no as upset as yeresel george lanson felt himself carried out into the corridor turned inward into the house borne along in darkness motion ceased momentarily when mcgowan paused to grasp his hair tugging his face round to look him in the eye and old anguss eyes lit up the darkness like yellow lamps like lumps of raw sulphur burning in his face with the fires of hell raging in their cores oh but it has tae be a terrible thing mah friend he said tae stumble on such truths as these and even then not tae be able tae believe them but ye will ye will there was a door with stone steps descending to a cellar that lanson had never known was there but then why should he nitrestreaked walls brushed the inspectors thigh and dangling arm as the stale smell of dampness and of something else came wafting from below then mcgowan must have tripped a light switch for the darkness was driven back a little but not much these auld houses mcgowan commented shaking his head as he put lanson down on a wooden table when the tides are high why sometimes ye can smell the salt sea down here but twentyfive years ago ah dug down two or three feet under the foundations for sanitary reasons as yell see he jerked lansons head on its side and pointed tsee that pipe there thats an auld sewer still runnin out tae sea ah cut intae it and put a cover on it mah verra own disposal unitfor the wee bits o rubbish ahve no more use for yere bits too george when ahm done wi them ah but itll be a guid wee while yet afore ahm completely done wi ye oh well share many a guid square meal taegether first eh george the inspector lay there and gurgled he desperately wanted to cry out but couldnt he made noises like a man nightmaring trying hard to wake up except he was awake and knew itbut that didnt mean that this wasnt a nightmare it was the worst possible nightmare and mcgowan wandering about in this loathsome subterranean den muttering to himself and causing unknown but terrifying things to happen the hiss of pressured gas and crump of sudden ignition the clatter of tools taken up and laid aside and the highpitched yet sinister whirr as some sort of electrical apparatus powered into life and the numbness spreading into every part of lansons body until he could no longer feel his arms and legs and his eyes blurred as if they were filmed over they probably were for he was incapable of blinking to clear their lenses and as for what little he could see maybe hed be better off if he couldnt there was a bench to one side where mcgowan seemed to be selecting certain tools from a rack on the wall and if lanson focussed his vision in the corner therea stove and cooking utensils andand what a blowtorch with its flickering blue tongue of nearinvisible fire beating on some kind of flatflanged branding iron until it was beginning to radiate an orange heat of its own finally the small man was finished with hishis preparations whatever they were returning to lanson he began to undress him and the inspector managing to gurgle whaaa whaaa aye mcgowan told him yere still firmlimbed george no quite the auld dodderer yet eh but thats more a problem than a compliment see that stuff ah gave ye will soon enough wear off and ah cannae be around a the time man yell soon be mobile again and we cannae have that now can we in a while lanson had been stripped naked moving back to the bench and its rack of tools mcgowan called out to him they knockout drops ah put in yere drink guid are they no mah bosses in sicily swear by them and so should ye george so should ye why yell no feel a thing later perhaps but no just the noo he brought the sinister whirring thing back to the table and showed it to lanson the blurred silvergleaming disc of a surgeons circular saw but as mcgowan held the terrible thing close and grinned at his victims frozen expression so lanson found himself far more fascinated and horrified by the little vef s face mirrored in the fan of bright motion oh it was mcgowan all right old angus himself but it wasnt human not all human anyway perhaps other than human or more than human or a lot less that gaping mouth convolute snout and redribbed throat that matched the cores of mcgowans feral yellow eyes and his teeth no longer perfect in their shape but like shards of white glass sprouting from the crimson of his gums and behind those teeth his tongue deeply cleft and hideously mobile and lashing like a crippled lizard in his mouth now then see if ye can guess this wee riddle george mcgowan rasped as he passed from view and the whirring of the saw became a rubbery vibration sensed rather than heard which seemed to physically move lanson and blurred his vision more yet where might a man expec tae find a limbless police inspector eh the vibration stopped and mcgowans face swam back into viewexcept it was spattered red and the saw was whirring again as it sprayed a fine pink mist all around what dinnae tell me yeve given in aready mcgowan grinned but indeed lanson had given in fainting in the moment he recognized the reddripping thing that mcgowan held aloft so that he never heard the little mans answer to his own riddle as he went brian lumley to fetch the whitehot iron to cauterize the first of the inspectors stumps why where ye itft him o course part two the other players dahamdrakesh it was something after six in that nightmarish cellar in edinburgh scotland but some seven thousand miles away on tibets tingri plateau it was well past midnight and the stars frozen in their orbits seemed so close you could pluck them right out of the firmament so thought daham drakesh wamphyri the last drakul where he stood tall and skeletally thin on die roof of the socalled drakesh monastery in fact his aerie he stood on the highdomed skull of a monolithic head and face carved into the rock in the lee of the gaunt mountainside and with his red robe fluttering behind him in a breeze off the plateau contemplated or more likely adored the night but while the yawning or perhaps shrieking face in the rock was huge it was merely a facade and the gape of its great jaws only the entrance to the cavern complex proper as for the warren within it was a manylayered labyrinth of tunnels storerooms accommodations andother darker and yet more secretive halls and chambers these latter places situated mainly in the lower levels were forbidden to the majority of the aeries inhabitants where only daham drakesh himself the high priest as it were might venture with impunity even the most longlived most trusted and experienced lieutenants were loath to tread there and then they trod lightly the project the building of the aerie by slave labour by vampire thralls recruited from a nearby walled city had taken fifteen to twenty years in all almost seventy years ago it had been finished the entire complex excavated by hand from the ancient volcanic rock or drakesh had taken advantage of and expanded upon the many natural cysts cavelets and fissures in the riddled strata the last of his line the last drakul and by his lights deserving of an aerie of his own he had personally supervised the work from beginning to brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii end by which time the onceprosperous walled city from which hed taken his workforce had been as dead and forbidding as the greater expanse of the plateau itself the last drakul aye the last true drakul certainly now that his chief lieutenant and bloodson mahag was dead in scotland by lykan hands but daham had a vampire leech and his parasite would doubtless have its egg there could be anotiier drakul and another and another well given time that time was not yet however nor would it ever be until the lykans and ferenczys were eradicated entirely from the world for unlike his forebears daham was a firm believer in an immemorial wamphyri maxim that anonymity is synonymous with longevity his ancestors however had forgotten or chosen to ignore this simple rule they had made blood and eggsons indiscriminately so spreading their plague abroadbut where were his ancestors now and where his eggsire egon lastbutone survivor of an alien parallel world and brave defender of wallachia since a time when the horseshoe mountains were known as dacia gone the way of all and even vampire flesh aye but not daham and not the ferenczy brothers anthony and francesco now the francezcis grown rich and strong in their sicilian fortress nor the doglord radu lykan the last true survivor out of olden starside who six hundred years ago had gone to earth gone to sleep hypnotized himself into a state of suspended animation in some far hyperborean lair which was why drakesh had sent mahag and a party of disciples into europe in the first place to seek out the lair of the sleeping doglord and destroy him before his planned awakening it had been part of an even grander scheme drakesh had seen his opportunity to play agent provocateur to set radus people and the ferenczys against one another in an allout bloodwar then when all was finished he would step in and pick off any survivors all as a prelude to his final solution the total conquest the vampirization of planet earth this had been drakeshs burning ambition ever since learning of the death of his eggsire the socalled count drakul all of ninety years ago to make himself the undead bloodred emperor of a vampire worldbut not while his ancestors enemies were still alive in it and so for half a century he had used his emissaries the thralls he sent out into the world ostensibly as ambassadors of his sect as spies to seek out other pockets of wamphyri infestation that was how he had discovered the ferenczy brothers in their sicilian manse and the approximate location of radu lykan in his cairngorms lair and so his greater plans had been stalled for a time as to the detail of those plans the drakesh monastery stood close to a junction of many lands in a place which one hundred years ago had been mainly inaccessible but distance and cold and inaccessibility what are these for obstacles nothing to the wamphyri territorialism on the other hand is everything when finally daham decided to expand it would be the very simplest thing to send out a handful of chosen lieutenants north into the heart of mysterious tibet china and mongolia south into nepal india burma and bhutan and when they were establishedthe rest of the world would be waiting by now the first of these outposts all masquerading under drakeshs religious banner of course should be in place but some twentyfour years ago even as the last drakul was making ready his expeditionary forces the chinese army had intervened and drakesh had seen at first hand how the wamphyri are not alone in their lust for territory even for a land as desolate as this tibetan cities were swept under monkish orders were brutally suppressed and temples fell the dalai lama himself fled to safety in the west but the shunned monastery on the windswept tingri plateau survived for drakesh had long been aware of the red armys feasibility studies in parapsychology and of its experimental espunit the sinoequivalent of the soviet unions and englands ebranches and had deliberately courted the attention of its controller colonel tsihong at his headquarters on kwijiang avenue chungking he had been called to chungking been studied for over a year had allowed them to learn what he desired them to know about him his alleged philosophy his longevity immunity to disease tenacity for life but no more than that and colonel tsihong had even visited him here at the monastery to see for himself the extent of drakeshs weird abilities in his own environment drakesh had let himself be frozen into a block of ice and had melted it from within he had demonstrated his nightvision sharper than tsihongs even when the colonel was using his british nitelite binoculars and scarcely needed to point out the benefits of a possible military application he had fasted and after a month was fit and well enough to walk out ten miles into the snows to meditate tsihong had brought scientists geneticists and mutationists with him they had taken away samples of drakeshs sperm frozen for future experimentation and ten years ago finally they had experimented with it to produce as it later turned out monsters all of which was precisely as drakesh had warned the colonel it would be that tsihong could not hope to grow orchids in a paddy field without they come up pale and twisted but if they were tended by brian lutnley necroscope the lost years vol ii caring gardeners watered by familiar rains and reared in their natural their native soil the colonel hadnt listened not then for how might this man even with all his weird talents father the nucleus of an invincible mutant army in such an inhospitable and unyielding wilderness but drakesh was more than a man he was a lord of the wamphyri by sheer force of mil and the laws of alien genetics he had passed on his instructions to the very sperm that tsihongs scientists had taken from him and in chungking his children had been born fifteen of them had been deformed destroyed at birth but fifteen out of fifty it scarcely surprised drakesh according to egon drakul freak births and grotesque malformations had been common among the wamphyri of starside but as for the others they had survived for the time being and left to his own devices in his aerie daham had waited for his prenatal genetic triggers to trip two years ago they had major chang lun military commander of the army garrison at xigaze some ninety minutes away by snowcat depending on the weather had brought him the news now he remembered chang luns words and how the major had relished them the last halfdozen escaped only eight years old apparently perfect except for their accelerated growthrate but they murdered their keepers and instructors they not only bit the hands that fed thembut fed on them drinkers of blood cannibals homicidal maniacs in only eight years theyd grown to men and sexually voracious women finally they were hunted down to the last one and eradicated but it wasnt easy drakesh had known no pain no parental anguish for he had known what the outcome would be indeed hed arranged it colonel tsihongs people had tried to teach his bloodbrood to be human albeit human machines soldiers warriors but the next brood would be under their vampire fathers instruction and he would not fail nor would his warriors belong to china nor were human beings men the only kind of warriors earlier before coming up by internal causeways and claustrophobic fluelike chimneys onto the dome of the skull where it sloped back under the overhanging cliff drakesh had paid a visit to the other kind of warrior three of which were waxing as theyd waxed for five years now in the vast stone vats of a lower level for the moment he controlled their growth delayed their emergence waited for the right time but when finally he allowed them to be born brought up out of their stone wombs they would be mindless killing machines such as once were bred by the wamphyri of starside and despite that these were other still they were kin to those anomalies born of his frozen seed in chungking for these too were his children the produce of his undying vampire flesh he thought back to his visit down there in the dark of a reeking cavern drakesh kept metamorphic protoplasm the living or undead material of his warrior creatures grown of his own flesh spittle sperm and sweat in a cell apart human flesh fluids teeth and bone when they are shed from the human body die but vampire flesh lives on until it is destroyed or ossifies the last drakuls flesh was especially tenacious itsextniviae lived on the offal tripes skin and bone left over from the aeries provisioning but despite that it was mindless it knew its father and master some residual instinct in the alien dna played the part of a primitive brain drakesh himself fed the creature he must it would be too dangerous for a lieutenant to even attempt it entering its cavern cell with a pan of offal hed sat down on a flattopped rocky outcrop in the centre of the dark place and waited dark or light it was all the same to the vampire drakesh his feral eyes turned to blood in the darkness and lit like lamps in his face the cave appeared to be empty but the thing was here he knew at his sandalled feet the earth was loose churned up the other was a creature of darkness as drakesh himself it burrowed in the earth as if hiding there or as if lying in wait and feeling the first tentative tremor beneath his feet drakesh smiled grimly to himself and kept his thoughts guarded his identity shielded it was a grand amusement a game he liked to play to tempt the thing and then to deny it and with the pan of vile stinking offal in his lap in the utter darkness he sat there smiling and feeling his creatures presence then a soft sound as soil crumbling behind him the thing would sneak up on him oh so slowly drakesh turned his head on its scrawny neck and looked back and down a mound of dirt was forming pushing up from the loose lumpy floor and in a moment a small eruption as a leprous greygreen tentacle or pseudopod pulsed up into view it thickened rising like some weird beanstalk and formed a watery rudimentary eye what the thing saw if it saw or recognized or remembered anything at all in the accepted sense of those words drakesh could not say but what it sensed was food the food in his lap or perhaps drakesh himself the tentacle thickened more yet and drakesh felt a shuddering in the earth all around the eye dissolved reformed into faceless gaping jaws and twin rows of teeth that elongated into fangs even as he watched and as the dry soil at his feet erupted in a dozen places necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley and put up writhing pseudopod extensions of the thing caging him in as it were so the main body or limblike tentacle swayed towards him its gaping jaws drooling a yellow seminal bile at which the master vampire opened his mind revealing his identity and enough he said thus far and no further it was as if the thing had been electrocuted the writhing tentacles were withdrawn snatched back down into the earth so rapidly indeed that one of them snapped spurted bile and left its tip like some weird blindworm snaking on the floor drakesh kicked at it and it quickly wriggled down out of sight to join up with the greater mass behind him the principal thighthick pseudopod slumped melted down poured back into its hole and disappeared with a squelching sound like squashed ripe fruit or a thirsty drain in a matter of seconds all that remained was a puff of exhaust stench from the trembling collapsing mounds and two or three snaking runs like panicked mole tracks in the floor then all was still again and drakesh still smiling for he sensed the things fear which was only right then upending the pan to slop its vile contents onto the dry earth he said know me for i am the drakul your master and i am kind you have no sense knowledge or intelligence i am all the intelligence you will ever need you have no direction but i give you purpose you may not live without the sustenance i bring you or die without my approval but you may yet be more than you are now your brothers grown out of you as you were grown out of me are stirring even now in my vats ofmetamorphism i have elevated them and may yet elevate youor destroy you if you remember little else you would do well to remember these things he moved to the exit paused and looked back now feed and be grateful so be it but as that mindless octopus that living or undead cancer of metamorphic tissue oozed up out of the floor and fell like a mantle on its food now hold drakesh sent a whiplash thought and the thing froze at once as if turned to stone and remember this place is yours but beyond this place belongs to me thus far and no further and then he visited his vats of metamorphism great baths excavated from the solid bedrock of a nearby cavern as dark and even darker than the place of the protoplasm they prospered in darkness his creatures especially these creatures which were or would be the true warriors hybrid monsters waxing in their vats these were to be the first of drakeshs many guardians of the curfew securing the dark shattered city bottoms and dustbowl valleys hi the long worldwide winter of nuclear aftermath so that survivors of the wars and the vampire plague both could not scathe among his network of rearing aeries in the dangerous hours of daylight but in any case thered be little enough of daylight in that world that too was part of his plan it would be the first part when finally drakesh was ready to be lord of all for what good to set out to conquer a world of light when the light iteemust conquer in the end but in a world where the light is weak filtering through swirling clouds of radiation and groping blindly in the rubble of mans greatest works drakesh was mad of course and knew it but perverse as every great vampire before him he revelled in it for if the emperor has the last say and if his word is law then who is to say that the rest arent mad and the emperor sane and one day he would be that emperor the vats of metamorphismdrakesh stood at the rim of one such and looked down into it the gelatinous surface of a liquid womb surging with long slow ripples they waxed his warriors they could be brought on quickly if need be or lie here another hundred years just waiting to be born and as he gazed the ripples quickened to wavelets as if the inchoate inhabitant of the vat sensed him there and something churned just beneath the surface then the outline of a grotesque head appeared languidly turning plated with what was as yet a softly translucent greygleaming chitin and for one brief moment a great vacant eye rolled in the gluey liquid strong drakesh murmured to himself nodding his skull head and faithful to the death it was true bred from his own metamorphic flesh from the burrowing thing in the other cave these creatures would have no mind but his no thoughts but those he gave them then he looked at the troughlike conduits that serviced the vats rustcoloured runnels carved in the rock umbilical sluices to feed the freelygiven blood of the brethren to the foetal abnormalities being bred here bloodbeasts and that fool of a colonel in chungking tsihong would have him breed human warriors well so he would so he was as witness the pregnant chinese and tibetan women who worked the stony fields and tended the farm in the walled city but as for the monasterys priests its brotherhood the colonel knew nothing of them that they were drakeshs children too and what of these other warriors waxing in their vats why tsihong would suffer a stroke and die if he knew of them he would die ayewould have to even if drakesh must attend to it himself for to know of them would be to know that the high priest of this place was not a man another reason why he had built his aerie here in the first place because of its seeming austerity its isolation brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii because it was less than welcoming and because in the main drakesh was left much to his own devices here so that even when the colonel and his socalled scientists came to visit which they must eventually they would only visit the city for the monastery was a holy place where drakesh might grant them audience however briefly but where they could never expect to lodge but then who would want to the place had not been designed for the comfort of strangers turning these and other things over in his pitdeep mind drakesh had followed a tortuous route up onto its roof now he stood here face to face with the night under a canopy of brilliant stars and felt the fluttering of his red robe blown back against his spindly body one night soon perhaps he must test his talents to the full shape his body to an airfoil and fly out from here for in their time the drakuls had been grand flyers and his father egon a pastmaster to have seen that one circling like a great black bat over the high battlements of his transylvanian castleit had been aweinspiring yours in time the count had told him all yours only be my true son and keep my place in my absence and you too can be wamphyri and sealing the pact before leaving for england he had passed on his egg in a fond fatherly kiss then a brief moment of unbearable agonyand when daham had regained consciousness his eggsire had been gone and in the space often days daham too fled out of romania en route for this place with a handful of szgany thralls a pouch of gold and a parasite leech the very seed of greatness growing within him then for a while he had feared his fathers revenge what would the great drakul do when he returned to romania to discover his eggson flown from his castle and his trust betrayed and it had been a relief not to mention a delight later to learn of egons demise his true death at the hands of a vengeful doctor a student of such legends as vampirism again the wind blew against him he instinctively lifted up his arms and leaned into it was tempted to launch himself and denied the temptation all in good time but for now the plaintive cry of a yak thin in the gnawing bite of the plateaus night was blown to him on the blustery breeze some three miles from the old walled city this was what drakesh had been waiting for for thoughtful master as he was he tended the needs of all his creatures and familiars and up now you true flyers he sent come and from various cracks and crannies in the carved dome of the aerie up from their colony in the darker recesses of the labyrinth of caves the true flyers they came with regard to drakesh major chang lun had his instructions his orders such as they were make periodic visits to the walled city stupid orders ridiculous orders yet that was what he had been told to do all he had been told to do make periodic visits but how periodic frequently infrequently or what and what to do or to look for when he went there what should he fondle the rounded bellies of drakeshs enforced whores compliment them on their successful couplings with that creature but no nothing about these things just that he should visit hah oh chang lun knew the problem well enough lack of selfdiscipline and organization in a largely civilian selfmanaging covert and experimental branch of the military it was that thisthis socalled colonel tsihong in chungking this dreary dreaming metaphysician did not himself know what to do with or about drakesh and his alleged sect but on the other hand it might also mean that tsihong didnt trust him or was himself suspicious in which case chang lun might read his orders very differently such as spy on the walled city see what you can find out about it but whatever you do do it carefully for weve spent time and money here and we dont wish to alienate this foreign charlatan in case he really does have something we can use chang lun would know exactly how to interpret such orders as these much as he was interpreting them now he and his driver had come out from xigaze a little after pm the weather forecast had been good bitterly cold of course but clear with little or no wind and no snow forecast chang luns official visits took place once every six weeks this was not one of those the driver he used was his usual man a corporal whose name didnt matter but he knew every crevasse and boulder en route and that was important over terrain as rugged as this and at night it would be only too easy to make a fatal mistake some of the cracks in the earth around here seemed to go down forever but the snowcat had given them no trouble and they had got here safely a few minutes after midnight here was a spot in the lee of outcropping rocks on the southfacing slope of a hillside to the west of the old walled city as an observation point the place was ideal a climb of two hundred feet from where theyd secured and camouflaged the cat and snug behind a wall of rocks theyd built during previous visits chang lun and his driver could even brew up armyrations tea on a disposable stove necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley slice canned meat or cheese onto bread and make a meal of sorts and from here a man with a good pair of nitesites could keep watch not only on the ancient city its gates and wall but even the leering facade of the drakesh monastery three miles away across the valley the one drawback was the awesome cold even the best winter warfare clothing couldnt keep it out it would find a way into your bones and chew on them like a bad cramp the strong tea helped but not much so that time and again chang lun had told himself to hell with this this would be the last time he came out here no matter his hatred for the unnatural perverted bastard who ran the monastery hatred a strong word and one that chang lun didnt use lightly but he had hated daham drakesh from the first time he saw him and all the time since and being tsihongs messenger as it were hed had more than enough contact with the man but to call him a manwell as far as chang lun was concerned even that was a matter for conjecture and he remembered drakesh as he had seen him on some four or five previous occasions the physical appearance the very presence of drakesh had never failed to impress chang lun but never favourably it wasnt just his height but an overall sense of something alien about him complemented by grotesque distortions of human shape and proportion thin to the point of emaciation he nevertheless managed to convey the impression that his pipestem body contained an awesome strength his hands and feet were freakishly long and tapering their sharply pointed digits tipped with thick yellow nails hooked into claws his shaven skull was thin at the front and lanternjawed long at the back and bulbous as the head of an insect on his scrawny neck but his eyesah his eyes they were the worst or perhaps strangest of drakeshs features in daylight what little ever filtered through into the monastery they looked glassy even transparent as if all natural colour had been leeched out of them but in the dark or semidark of the monasterys corridors and caverns they were as luminous and yellow as molten sulphur their gaze was literally penetrating turned upon a man they seemed to stare right through him as if their target were more ephemeral than drakesh himself and when they smiled chang lun shuddered where he leaned on the low wall of piled stones and gazed through his nightvision binoculars he was cold outside from the subzero temperature but colder in his soul from letting himself dwell too long on daham drakesh even the simple mechanical act of focusing his glasses on the monasterys leeringface facade to bring it closer seemed in a way to draw drakesh closer too and chang lun knew this sensation this feeling of dread that in keeping watch on drakesh he had given the man power to keep watch on him almost as if his binoculars worked in both directions so that while he looked out some unseen other looked in that yak said chang luns driver causing the major to start hes noisy all of a sudden the corporals binoculars were trained on the city chang lun thought to reprimand the man but let it pass and in any case it was too cold for all that customary bowing and scraping back in the barracks they were major and noncommissioned officer sir and you get your arse over here but out here they were just two men in the cold waste the cold chang lun replied tethered out there in the place of bones full in the face of the wind blowing round the base of the townships wall you would cry out too why have they put him there the corporal wondered out loud simply to die in the cold the major shrugged kept his glasses focused on the monastery was that some kind of motion on the roof of the place white smoke or steam going up and was that a twiglike figure up there obscured in a swirl of well whatever it was for all the cold still chang luns skin crawled absentmindedly he answered his drivers question maybe the animal was diseased infectious theyve separated it from the herd thats all obviously its what they do with all suspect beasts tether them in the boneyard to die well its true there has been some disease in the local animals the corporal agreed but i was one of the drivers on several of the details when those animals were driven out here they all seemed healthy enough to me not that im an expert but they were the best for many miles around they always are only the best for the drakesh township sir the major snapped suddenly irritated call me sir when you speak to me yes sir but what he had said was true and it had been an inordinately large number of animals at that all for the fifty women in the ancient city well possibly since half of them were pregnant and well on their way to spawning when chang lun thought of drakesh siring children especially out of criminals such as those women hed been given spawning was the only word that came readily to mind as for the boneyard the name that the majors driver had given necroscopt the lost yean vol ii brian lumley that place outside the city wall when theyd first discovered it on a previous visit it was simply that a pile of bones littered around a tethering post there had been one occasion when some of the women were out gathering the grisly remains to grind them down for fertilizer chang lun suspected the thin soil of their farm could use the sustenance but he mean the yak is very noisy now the corporal uneasily unnecessarily stated for chang lun could hear it well enough for himself the neighing bleat of an animal in distress hes kicking jumping trying to free himself silently cursing his gloved hands chang lun focused his own binoculars just a fraction more not on the city but the monastery and suddenly his view of the domed roof the carved skull sprang up in much clearer definition and there was a figure up there yes antlike at this distance but very definitely there but doing what the stickfigures arms seemed raised insupplication or invocation then chang lun felt his mouth go dry at the thought that he knew that figure that he had recognized the skeletal frame of drakesh himself and as for the cloud of smoke its spiral around the distant figure on the roof of the monastery was rising widening behaving far more sentientiy as its members headed in a certain direction straight for the ancient city its walls possibly this very vantage point the yaks nerverending shrieks had now risen to an almost human pitch and the corporal gasped that creature must soon strangle itself see how it leaps kicks hauls on its tether surely you were right sir the thing is mad or diseased or something is tormenting it driving it out of its mind but chang lun only thought or the yak knows senses is somehow aware of something that we cant possibly understand or maybe the major did understand and trying to hold his binoculars more firmly in suddenly trembling hands he followed the line of flight of the weirdly purposeful cloud not heading his way at all or only roughly so but very definitely heading for the boneyard kill the stove he husked at once as he felt the short hairs stiffening at the back of his neck eh the corporal didnt move fascinated by the frantic activity of the yak he couldnt look away i said kill the fucking stove the major elbowed him in the ribs put the fire out and do it quietly do everything very quietly his last few words were a hiss as he fixed his line of sight on the leading flyers and without knowing why or not exactly why chang lun found himself terrified not of the flyers so much as theferf of them that they were here at all and the fact that daham drakesh hadwhat called them up up from the depths of his blasphemous monastery flyers yes great bats the way they swooped and flitted they could only be but white bats albinos and by the majors lights far larger than any bat has a right to be with or without binoculars these things were just too damn big chang lun knew something about zoology was fairly sure that these monsters were way out of place here they were like the giant desmodus bats of middle and south america and and desmodus was a bloodsucker wasnt he a damned vampire yes meanwhile the corporal had killed the stoves chemical fire a final wisp of smoke real smoke went up which he dispersed by flapping his arms then he returned to his place at die wao of stones took up his glasses and quickly focused them on the tethered yak but in a hoarse uneven whisper chang lun warned him it seems to me youre a sensitive man that being so dont watch dont watch sir what could the major mean chang lun himself didnt know just what he meant but he had this idea in his head and it wouldnt go away he would do anything if it would but it wouldnt and now the corporal was training his binoculars in the other direction to see if he could spot whatever it was that chang lun was concerned about the major felt him give a jerk as he too saw the bats what the devil and chang lun nodded and answered the devil indeed both men shrank down huddling low behind their wall of stones staring a moment at each other wideeyed and fearful and as their eyes went back to the yak each felt his own private pang of relief to note that the poor animal had given up the ghost or if it wasnt dead that it had collapsed in exhaustion and as the stream of great albinos flew overhead not too far away for a moment they heard the leathery flutter of membrane wings while in the ancient city lights were coming on dim lanterns were being lit in windows in the walls and towers and pale faces were flitting as eerily as the bats themselves from window to window drakeshs women had come toto what theyre watching the corporal whispered as if in answer to the majors unspoken question those women are going to watch he was omitting his sirs again but his superior officer no longer cared chang lun knew that no less than himself his driver had guessed what was about to happen anywhere else it would beunthinkable to even think such dungs but not in this place here in necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley this place which both men had come to loathe it seemed the only thing to think and those women the way they ghosted about the city smiling their sick smiles but what could they have to smile about in a place like this oh they were under their masters spell no doubt about it but what sort of spell criminals convicts they might well be but what could have happened to them to their spirit their humanity that they could watch something like this the column of great bats spiralled down plummeted out of the night sky to their unprotesting target fell as forcefully as stones and clamped like leeches to the head neck body and limbs of the yak where it lay shuddering on its bony deathbed they clustered to it turned the grey mass of it whiteand then red red in a moment from the blood that escaped their ravenous mouths or spurted from arteries bitten through sir the corporal choked turning his glasses away didnt i tell you so chang lun growled that bastard in his bloody nightmarish monastery he breeds things even as hes breeding things now in those hellish women i suspect he even bred these bats and for no good purpose you can stake your life on it with which it suddenly dawned on him that in being here they may already have staked their lives on it but no that hideous travesty of a man on the roof of the monastery didnt know they were here didnt know what they had seen viciously the major swung his glasses back to their original angle and quickly realigned them on the dome of the carved skull the stickfigure was still there and chang lun supposed hed be looking in this direction and you cant see me chang lun thought to himself but i can see you and i promise you this daham drakesh that if the day ever dawns when i can bring you down then iii do it and with pleasure thenthe air was suddenly electric in the next moment chang lun remembered that earlier feeling that weird sensation of some other peering back at him through his own glasses utterly impossible of course and yet it was as if the figure on the dome of the monastery grew large in a splitsecond as if drakesh expanded in chang luns binoculars and in his mind to a giant they stood face to face and drakeshs eyes were blood red fuelled in their pupils by the moltensulphur fires of hell aha said a voice in the majors mind and there could be no denying that he recognized it immediately and knew its owner and so you spy on me a mistake chang lun for i too have my spies my watchdogs but greedy dogs such as they are and ever hungry eh what you think i am threatening you ah no for my dogs are obedient and would never harm you not without my permission indeed i shall have them see you home back to xigaze and when you report the result of this your latest mission to tsihong in chungking be sure to give him my best regardswith which drakeshs sinister sibilant telepathic voice rapidly devolved to a peal of fading laughter and was gone likewise the spindly redrobed figure on the dome of the carved skull sirsir chang lun snapped out of it and knew his driver had been yelling in his ear for several long seconds he closed his gaping mouth blinked his eyes and said eh what sir a wind is coming up blowing stronger now it might bring a little snow and those bats are on the move the major scarcely needed his binoculars to know that the corporal was right he could feel the wind and see the albinos rising up in a spiral from their feast also the dim lanterns in the windows of the ancient city had been smothered put out so that now the place resembled nothing so much as some vast sprawling necropolis in which instinctive or automatic analogy chang lun was very nearly correct except a necropolis is a city of the truly dead quickly now the major husked its time we were gone from here the corporal needed no urging he was on his feet making to collect up the stove and any other evidence of their having been here but leave it be chang lun told him it doesnt make any difference theyll know weve been here anyway and the moment hed said it he knew it was so that he hadnt just been dreaming it when hed heard drakesh speaking in his mind what was more he knew that drakeshs threat to have him escorted back to xigaze hadnt been an idle one those bats the majors driver muttered he was directly ahead of chang lun where they went sliding and bumping down the frozen slope of the hillside they seemed to be heading this way the major cut him short i know and then they both knew for certain as the air overhead thrummed with the whup whup whup of leathery wings oh mother dear father fearfully the corporal looked skywards tripped went tumbling head over heels to the bottom but by the time chang lun was down he was up on his feet again stripping the camouflaged canopy from the snowcat easy easyf chang lun told him with a lot more bravado than he felt as his driver yanked again and again on the starter dont flood the fucking thing but soon the cat was ticking over then purring into life and the two men were clambering aboard as if the vehicle were a liferaft and brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii their ship was going down behind them the bats the bats the corporal moaned and slewed the cat dangerously tiltingry as he turned her about for the last time take it easyf the major yelled do as i say or shoot you and drive the fucking thing myself the bats wont attack us theyll justfollow us along the way at least that is i meanif that bastard drakesh is good as his word great white bats two or three dozen of them and two and a half feet across wingtip to wingtip flitted swooped and sideslipped directly overhead their excited staccato chittering was clearly audible they communicated with each other and perhaps with someone else for certainly that someone had communicated with them but what in all thatswhat the hell are they doing the corporal shrilled when a pair of flapping pinkeyed nightmares danced for a moment or so in front of his windshield and caused him to swerve what do they want nothing the major shouted back and prayed that he was right theyre just seeing us away from here thats all theytheyre our escort which sounded like something a madman might say but chang lun believed it anyway he couldnt rationalize it but he had to believe it for his sanitys sake and apparently he was right for even after it started snowing still he and the corporal knew that the bats were with them they could feel sense occasionally sight them through the slanting stinging softly hissing snow and when the wind was right they could even hear the whup of membranous wings in the whirling air all around something less than two hours later when the snow stopped at last and the wind eased oft and the dully flickering lights of xigaze and the garrison blazed on the horizon their escort fell back seemed eaten up in distance and darkness then finally major chang lun felt he could begin breathing again hed been breathing of course but it scarcely felt like it likewise his corporal driver he too eased up a little and relaxed his tense nervous grip on the controls which was entirely the wrong thing to do they came up from nowhere as if out of the very earth a white shrilling sentient cloud of them the bats the vampire bats pinkeyed and needletoothed with their convoluted noses wrinkled back flat to their wetgleaming leathery faces three of them whirled hurled themselves in a suicide attack directly at the windshield the screen was of clear plastic which cracked on the first impact splintered on the second flew apart as the third great bat came right through it in a welter of gorespattered fur and torn leather straight into the drivers face two more hit the corporal from the side while behind him another pair attacked the major their massed impact was such that the cat rocked on its skis and teetered so that the driver must yank on his handlebars in an attempt to straighten up but at the same time he was fighting for his life as the great bats clung to him wrapped membrane wings about himand bit one of them was biting at his face his lips nose eyes he screamed and let go the controls heard crack crack crack like explosions in his ear as the major sobbed cursed and pumped shot after shot into the things that were battening on him then rammed the snout of his gun into the whitethrobbing creatures clustered to his drivers head and upper body and blew them away too but the snowcat had slewed aside and now its riders saw where the bats had come from that indeed they had come up out of the earth up from the chasm that yawned directly ahead the corporal cried out and yanked on the handlebars the cat slewed again then toppled sideways in a seeming slowmotion and over and over the wildly revving machine went and down and down with chang lun and his man hanging on for dear life and for death all the way to the bottom but in the seconds before they hit farewell chang lun said that faint mocking voice in the majors mind youll go no more aspyingfor tsihong i fear oh hahaha liar liar the major sobbed still twirling and coldly always chang lun the voice agreed always with which the majors world went out in a single tearing shattering roar that lasted the blink of an eye necroscope the lost yean vol ii the francezcis the ritual at le manse madonie had been simple and solemn the funereal weather a damp blustery breeze off the tyrrhenian that snatched the womens veils this way and that first obscuring or masking their pale sad faces in black net then framing them in stark monochrome relief had seemed entirely in keeping frequently disturbed but never quite disrupted by julio sclafanis agony his pitiful but entirely forgivable bouts of wailing and wringing of sweaty hands so far the interment of his daughter had gone smoothly entirely as planned its organization had been immaculate in every detail but then in the company of such esteemed fellow mourners in such a place and since the francezci brothers were themselves responsible for the arrangements perhaps this was only to be expected it had been out of necessity of course in order to avoid untoward complications that the brothers had settled for stark simplicity and thus far no complications had arisen only at the end when gaunt francezci bearers in blackbanded top hats and tails took up the young beautiful and now tragically deceased julietta in her box to carry her from the courtyard into the darkly shadowed manse only then did her father julio lose control completely i must see her he cried staggering forward squeezing his way into the house proper through the varnished mediterranean pine doors and putting himself in the path of the bearers i must he implored tve seen her but once in a whole year but now this one last time i must oh god her sweet mother in heaven would never forgive me if i let her go to her grave without seeing her one last time julio the francezcis were on him at once each holding fast to an arm the rest of the mourners had been left outside and the doors were now closed on them julio julio anthony francezci said again shaking his head and sighing please try to believe me we know how it is for you how it must be julietta in these what four years but the time has flown she has become a little sister to us why just look at francesco how gaunt how sad no one was more fond of her but julio turned to him clung to him fat weak and trembling against tonys lean implacable strength butthis is le manse madonie francesco francezcis voice was harder and julio glanced at him through redrimmed tearsblurred eyes it is what it is and what it has been for generations francesco went on but in a gentler tone now a private place julio and your julietta had become like one of us you could even say she wasfamily which in turn makes you family that being so please dont make things any harder for us than they already are but to see her only to see her this last time why not i beg of you before she goes down to the vaults the brothers looked at him then at each other and came to a mutual unspoken agreement then letting sclafani disengage they nodded silent instructions to the six bearers where they stood patiently waiting and on the long table there tony told them but be gentle be careful dontdisturb her the great hall was suitably still and shadowy the walls with their archedover recesses or entranceways into secondary rooms the stairways fixtures furniture and hangings were barely visible in the gloom if julio sclafani noticed this at all it was only to find it well in keeping he scarcely remembered that on the two or three occasions when hed been invited to visit julietta le manse madonie had always been gloomy he couldnt know that it always was or why it was that no chink of sunlight was ever allowed to filter in here where even the sullen light of sicilian winters was held at bay behind thick dusty curtains as the draped box was lowered to the polished table julio gave a strangled cry and stumbled forward the brothers at once got in his way and again took his arms wewe supposed you would want to see her tony explained that is why the coffin has a window of glass but julio you know the circumstances of her death a wasting disease yes the fat man moaned awhat did you call it a pernicious anaemia pernicious indeed a dreadful terrible murdering anaemia more like your private doctor the very best could do nothing all true tony nodded which means thatwell that she isnt the julietta you knew this thing was like a cancer it ate at her it had its own peculiar odour that cant bemasked and julietta may not necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley be touched or kissed hence the glass buti mil know her of course our only wish was that you should remember her as she was still i must see her so be it said the brothers together and released him sclafani wobbled to the head of the coffin slid back the grey silk cover looked down on the face beneath the glass it was dim the glass was touched with a trace of dust its sheen obscured the features of the pallid face within the frame sobbing sclafani clung to the edge of the table for support and blinked his puffy eyes to improve their focus and as the francezcis silently took up flanking positions beside him his juliettas beloved features seemed to swim up at him being short his face was quite close to hers on the other hand the francezci brothers were like trees shading him and julietta both still julio could see her fairly clearly now and though her eyes were of course closed she was smiling the word trembled from his lips the painkillers francesco murmured at the end there wasoh a deal of pain mercifully we were able to relieve some of it but at the very end your julietta spoke of youand smiled ah yes she died with a gentle smile on her face julio just thinking thoughts of you sclafanis eyes had made the adjustment now they saw more clearly but in all honesty he couldnt say he liked what they saw thinking of me butthis smile is like a grimace the pain francesco said again despite the medication she and he paused but she hid it well sclafani kissed the glass over her lips his tears fell on the dusty surface acting like tiny magnifying glasses to blur and diminish the detail just four short years ago she looked like a girl he groaned she was she is a girl yet now she looks like some strange pale woman four years tony repeated him she grew up julio your julietta grew up and was changed changed yes so waxy and sunken in sclafani hugged the top of the box depleted said tony the anaemia like a cancer and yet her lips are full and red and all wasted francesco put an arm around the grieving sclafanis shoulders our efforts i mean still you have the comfort of knowing she never shamed you never knew a man a comfort it scarcely comforts me francesco where are my grandchildren and would it have been so shameful what in this day and age her mother loved to love even a man unworthy as myself but julietta she is untried denied such knowledge wasted you are right to be beautiful and never have a chance to give of your beauty there there said francesco clasping his shoulders and turning him away while tony slid the silk back into position sclafani struggled for a moment then finally surrendered to the inevitable but i will be able to visit this place where she spent her last years well we shall see to walk where she walked in the grounds of le manse perhaps but the vaults alas no not even now the francezcis are there julio private in life and death both we were ever proud and proud to have julietta too we had hoped that you would be proud knowing she is here perhaps in this we have elevated ourselves but no no the other protested i didnt mean to but if so then we elevate julietta too not to mention your good self you have beentoo kind to me and mine throughout francesco saw him to the door and outside into the courtyard hugged him shook his hand and gave him over into mario their chauffeurs care he watched him driven slowly away in the stretch limo by then the other mourners mainly francezci people had already dispersed then francesco returned to where his brother was speaking to the bearers quickly now tony told them take her down to the pit and wait there for us but dont go in until were there and as they left he turned to francesco that all went very well hmmm do you think so francesco seemed distant absentminded his thoughts were elsewhere what tony frowned at him but whaf s this dont tell me youre actually missing her the other stood straighten perhaps perhaps not i dont know but one thing is for sure shes sleeping the last sleep the sleep of change my fault i know but whether i miss her or not isnt relevant what is relevant is that we cant afford another ferenczy in the house and certainly not a lady good tony nodded and his eyes were feral in the gloom and glowed red in their cores for a moment therewhy i thought youd gone soft on me francesco smiled however grimly soft ah no julietta was justso accessible having her here made it all so very easy i suppose im basically lazy thats all but miss her i shall miss fucking her be sure she was so very good at it brian lumtey necroscope the lost years vol ii but then you taught her tony chuckled well yes theres that of course francesco laughed with which they followed the bearers down to the pit in the lowest levels of le manse madonie in the very bowels of the place mainly a natural cavern but in part carved from the bedrock the mouth of the pit was like a well with walls of old hewn masonry three feet high indeed it had been a well in the early days of le manse many hundreds of years ago when it had drawn water from an old cyst in the volcanic rock all of eighty feet deeper still now the francezcis stood at the rim of the pit and paused to consider what they were about and quietly a little uncertainly tony said our julietta or rather your julietta is hardly pure pure francesco shrugged who is these days show me a goodlooking virgin in palermo over sixteen years old and fd show you a liar well true his brother mused but still you know how he likes them and shes not even clean not scrupulously as he is used to them what francesco was shorttempered at the best of times and this wasnt the best of times what are you suggesting we should have purged her perhaps put her through the usual ritual and chanced waking her up prematurely i mean in case you hadnt noticed brother our julietta or mine if you will is wamphyri she could do severe damage im not worried about us you and i but the men our lieutenants the last thing we want is to lose someone at this stage of the game what stage of the game is that tony was suddenly pessimistic unusual for he was normally the optimist has there been some subtle yet remarkable change in the last two or three years did i miss somethingpessimistic and sarcastic yesssf his brother hissed rounding on tony glaring at him from eyes as red as hell the time has changed narrowing down to his fucking time radu lykans time and the grotesque thing in this bloody pit has changed angelo our dear father more unreliable and more demanding than ever and our fortune has been depleted which we still havent done anything about and worldwide the families aretheyre laughing behind our backs i dont know about you but i can feel it and since we started asking questions about this british ebranch and this harry keogh and this fucking alec kyle questions about dead men for fucks sake the cia and the kgb and everyone else we used to use dont want to know us then theres this drakul sect in england and scotland and our mans report more than three months old now and we still havent done anything about that either what and does it amuse you to ask has something fucking changed calm down calm down tony sighed all right so things have changed but thats not what i meant or maybe it is its just that im sick of the inactivityof that and everything else all the things you mentioned yes thats right im just as sick and frustrated as you and as if that werent enough i now have to talk to him try to get some sense out of him huh francesco grunted at least partmollified well i have to admit i dont envy you that but thats the way it is he wont even acknowledge me which is why i wondered if giving him julietta will do us any good then stop wondering francesco answered instead just ask yourself this what good will she do us undead for thaf s what shell be if we let her wake up and wamphyri so then its settled shes angelos and all that remains is the bargaining tony nodded yes i know and anyway its probably best this way in a rare show of camaraderie a show at least francesco actually put his arm across his brothers shoulder which tony at once shrugged off whats best he asked suspiciously that youre the one angelo talks to i mean he was ever difficult our father but never more so than now lef s face it my temper is too short i havent the patience towell play with him but you were always good at his word games and anyway he likes you huhr tony grunted thats a compliment is it plainly he was nervous the way he licked his lips kept glancing into the deeps of the well or more properly the pit thaf s supposed to make me feel better about it eh francesco narrowed his eyes and said what is it youre afraid but what of i mean this is hardly the first time that youve you just dont understand do you tony glanced at him cutting him short no this isnt the first time or even the tenth or twentieth that ive had to talk to him like this but recentlyevery time is worse that the last time dont you realize that when i go into angelo ferenczys mind or let him into mine the kind of jeopardy i place myself in and before francesco could answer if he would yes youre right i was always closer to him i was able to get on with him and he seemed to be genuinely fond of me but do you think i dont worry about that too well i do francesco i do eh how worried francesco frowned that he could harm you in some way but if theres one of us he might want to harm it would have to be me i honestly believe he hates me and anyway he cant hurt either one of us from this pit well at least youre consistent tony sighed patiently shaking his brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii head at what he obviously saw as the others naivety for more than three hundred years youve never thought of him as anything other than a monster in a pit wrong francesco answered ive also thought of him as our father and ive loathed the idea that we were spawned of that thing but what happened to him was bound to happen why even his twin was a monster smothered at birth and burned as a freak and do you know what has preyed on my mind these centuries brother it shouldnt be too hard to guess that we are of the same flesh and is it waiting for us too given time will our metamorphism also run rampant reducing us to so much lapping filthy protoplasm now tony gripped his arm almost he snapped for a moment there you almost had it but you left out one very important word so much lapping filthy sentient protoplasm and one other thing francesco the fact that hes wamphyri eh again francescos eyes were wide puzzled staring and what are the traits of the wamphyri the others expression changed at once a word game he sneered this has to be a word game why youre as bad as he is we cant even hold a simple conversation without indulge me tony insisted the traits of the wamphyri francesco shook himself loose very well if its the only way we can go on from here according to that thing in his pit the wamphyri were known for their greed lust lies and territorialism and eh and their tenacity tony snarled now do you see its what i meant when i said you almost had it for you pointed out that he had spawned us without mentioning that we were only his bloodsons francesco shook his head i still dont underst he still has his leech tony cut him short his leech but by nowsurely that too has devolved to so much o for if that were so he simply wouldnt want to go on his leech is his tenacity the only thing that keeps him going and his leech still has its egg is that what concerns you but you are already wamphyri angelos leech or egg cant couldnt possibly get into you i know i know tony was pale now paler than ever tfet just recently whenever im obliged to talk to him like now get this feeling that heswaiting waiting waiting planning watching dont ask me what for ill tell you something though i think we were damned lucky to get him down into this place in the first place huhf francesco snorted he was the lucky one a hundred and more times we could have done away with him during the final years of his devolution and for that matter we could do it even now send down a fiftygallon drum of kerosene a stick of dynamiteno more angelo ferenczy to get concerned about and no more oracle tony answered him no more powerbase thats the logic of the defeatist brother ten minutes ago you started raving when i asked you what had changed all right i was being flippant but you pointed out that the families were starting to laugh at us behind our backs also that various intelligence agencies are backing off from us but how much more rapidly would they desert us without angelo except for one small detail francesco answered your logic is impeccable that small detail being that were already without him when was the last time our father uttered a single useful word or one that made any kind of sense hes gone tony slipped beyond the pale hes no longer of any use to us well except on this one occasion as a means of disposal and possibly as our mindspy on whatever it is that s happening out there yes one last chance to pinpoint radu lykans lair and learn the hour of his resurgence one last opportunity to scry on this damned drakuls tibetan aerie and maybe learn something of his plans and if were lucky if angelo feels like cooperating assuming hes capable of it one final glimpse into our own futures the first two maybe tony was thoughtful now but not the last how can we hope to learn that from him if he isnt a part of that future he wont advise us to bring about his own demise francescos jaws cracked open and his eyes lit in a monstrous grin and at last i see what a fool i was to have doubted you he said oh tony looked at him cooly you have considered putting an end to him out of pity if nothing else what but a moment ago you feared him and are the two so incompatible fear and pity he is our father hes a monster and are we any less you are playing word games francesco flapped his arms we go round in circles tonys tone was sharper he was done with this now weve talked too much said too much and weve done it in the wrong place what do you think he might have been eavesdropping and if so that he would have understood and then that hed care nothing matters to him anymore well except that he raves and babbles to his victims the minds that share his hell brian lumley tonys answer was to put a finger to his lips glance once into the pit and whisper well he isnt babbling now it was true the psychic aether seemed breathlessly still but the pits miasma the breath or effluvium of the thing it contained went up as ever a stinking mist that vaporized on contact with the electrified ironmesh of the hinged cover that sealed the throat of the old well for long seconds the brothers looked at each other until francesco said i dont envy you as i said but it has to be done i know tony finished it for him and yes i have thought of doing away with him for after all hes the only thing that ties us to this place and i fancy le manse madonie has had its day we could be elsewhere as other people doing other than we do now you have suggested a fiftygallon drum of kerosene and a stick of dynamite but what if i were to suggest sufficient highexplosives to blow this entire place off the face of the mountain i would in every instance agree with you francesco answered and to the world let it seem that we went with it except even if we were to leave this place in ruins that wouldnt solve our problem the fact that we are known to the doglords people and probably to this tibetan drakul and that sooner or later we must run into them for you can be sure that they would not believe we were dead besides which francesco snarled i dont like the idea of backing off while this secret intruder this harry keogh or alec kyle or whatever his bloody name is goes unpunished and we actually know where he is thats the most galling thing we know something of what he can do too tony was quick to remind his brother which is also galling this man goes up against vampires he and the mirlu woman they took out a drakul lieutenant and thrall and our man in scotland seems of the opinion that bonnie jean mirlu is now wamphyri indeed he would swear to it for hes seen at least one of her kills our men are in position francesco was growing ever more heated and impatient we should go ahead and do it order our lieutenants to kidnap interrogate this ebranch hypnotist and our sleeper in scotland to take out the mirlu woman along with any clever help she may have enlisted none of which will help us find radu lykan tonys pessimism persisted the woman must be taken alive and if she really is wamphyri it would mean that we mustwell do it ourselves and if all went in our favour francesco seemed eager to get something anything going then blow this place to hell tony answered but without his necroscope the lost years vol ii brothers fervour and the old creature in his pit with it after that set up again somewhere else and eventually find a way to run this cringing drakul to earth no more francezcis francesco nodded ferenczys maybe and why not ifs a common enough name in romania that would do it tony was in agreement romanian dissidents old aristocracy even fleeing from the madman ceausescus tyranny but where to america perhaps why not francesco laughed out loud and the echoes came bouncing back from the caverns walls new york is nothing so dreary as this place and there are plenty of penthouse aeries on th avenue believe me so good they named it twice tony chuckled however drily the big apple just waiting to be bitten into and of an evening we could stand on our balcony and watch those electrical rivers of light and life flooding through the canyons of the city poetic said tony you know brother why ive always suspected there was a poet in you but rivers of life are you sure you dont mean rivers of blood but the blood is the life dear brother said the other and as he finished speaking as if invoked by all their talk of blood and life a low moan sounded from close at hand the brothers smiles fell away their heads turned as one to stare at julietta scalafani in her coffin whose glasspanelled lid now lay to one side julietta whose head had turned a little as if to look at them her toopale face no longer smiling but frowning one of her hands had slipped from her bosom where they had lain crossed but her eyes were still closed and there was no breathing as yet perhaps the bearers had jolted her when bringing her down here and perhaps not no more talk now said francesco his tone serious in a moment well not to each other instead i suggest you talk to him he inclined his head to indicate the pit try to start a conversation while i see to this switching off the current to the hinged grid covering the pit he commenced cranking it open but tonys expression was more serious yet even drawn as he caught at his brothers arm and said one more chance we give our father one more chance im pleading for him yes oh i know youre right hes no use to us the way he is but lets make this our success or failure on this allimportant occasion the deciding factor if angelo comes through for us if he can prove his value now when were most in need of him then we carry on as before we stay here tend his needs and use him as our oracle as long as he continues to function francesco freed the cradle from its mooring lowered it to the brian lumley natural rock floor help me with julietta he said and a moment later i thought it was too good to be true your suddenly seeing the light your urge for flight to throw off the shackles of this place no not you youre much too much of a home bird and as they took julietta from her box placed her unprotesting body on the platform and slid her loose cerements from her claycold undead figure well tony demanded how is it to be swinging the arm of the hoist out over the pit they waited until it found its equilibrium and stopped gyrating now all was in place it only remained for tony to speak to or bargain with the thing in the pit and finally francesco said i say that one way or the other im out of here theres a big wide world out there brother and for far too long ive felt confined to one little corner of it so ill take whats mine to take and go you can come with me or stay here as you will for lef s face it we may be brothers but were also wamphyri and the wamphyri are loners weve had a good run as the francezcis and managed to keep from each others throats too but all good things must come to an end eventually do you mean it every word my cards are on the table and you if our father comes through for us tony answered however slowly if we come through whatevers coming then stay here in le manse madonie and care for him im used to this place i like the idea that it is or will bemine mine alone wamphyri territorialism francesco told him stronger in you than in me do you see what comes of being a home bird brother youve grown kennelproud like a dog kept too long in a cage only let someone step over your thresholdwhy youd even bite the hand of your keeper but i was always the one who was out and about in the world and i will be again in answer to which tony could only shrug and say perhaps youre right if so then so be it anthony francezci was no great telepath several centuries ago his father angelo had told him that in the ferenczys the talent was sporadic it skipped entire generations but given sufficient time it would generally resurface even in the most insensitive family member which would appear to imply that tony and his twin were entirely insensitive this could be because they were more nearly a part of the modern world and in large part especially in their thinking divorced from their origins in this world they had not required the art to combat alien enemy vampire influences thus it had failed to develop in them now that they did need it it was too late unused the metaphysical muscle had simply atrophied necroscope the lost years vol ii between each other however some vestigial telepathic awareness remained and between them and their father whose esp was incredibly powerful there was or could be a very strong link even as strong as common speechif and when angelo allowed it he knew his powers however knew that they alone were the reason he had lasted so long and so guarded them jealously recently it had been more than ever difficult to establish contact with him he required bribing the only bribes he would accept were of the human variety the thing in the pit had little or no use for any other sort he was what he was a mass of ungovernable metamorphic vampire flesh a monster of many parts in control of none of them not even his mindnot entirely a madman then or a mad mutant thing certainly crazy tony muttered to himself where he leaned over the wall of the deactivated shaft his mind goes in circles there is such knowledge in it but all confused jumbled filled with the static of his multiminds which spills over into his consciousness yet he wont abandon them extrude them and let them die they are his incorporeal thralls all he has left of connection with the material world all that remains of power and even in that respect his power is limited he cant control the multiminds except to close them out how can he threaten what he may not hurt terrible to have such awesome talents and yet be trapped down there in his pit he can spy on a world but is confined here he can discover almost anything he wants to knows but cannot use such knowledge except to pass it on to us frustrationhungerand madness oh our father is crazy but then who wouldnt be crazy francescos nervous grunt sounded from close at hand where he stood with his arms folded on his chest trying to appear relaxed hes that all right crazy like a fox shhhr tony cautioned him his mind is stirring attempting to concentrate hehe feels me reaching for him opening my thoughts to him look down there francesco took a single pace forward and looked down into the reeking well whose fumes were rising thicker now and from deep in the darkness of the lower regions of the shaft where it expanded into the old volcanic cavity his fathers eyes stared back at him a great many eyes unblinking red and hateful in the smoky reek of the pit tony had to concentrate without so much as a glance at his brother he felt him step falteringly back again for all francescos bravado he feared the old ferenczy not without cause for treacherousss came that single whispered or hissed accusation as if their father had breathed the word out in a stream of cold air over the shrinking contours of their brains and in the next moment brian lumley strengthening you my son yesss you francesssco treacherous as ever and infectious why your poisons have even infected your brother but not yet father tony told him speaking out loud trying to keep his voice even and in any case is it treachery to consider an act of mercy your misery has been long and long there was a moment of stunned silence until oh and you knout that for a fact do you that i am miserable so that you would deem it a mercy toconsider releasing me from my burden but how kind of you how thoughtful you murderous bastards your mother died giving you birth but if shed known the scum she gave birth to it would have killed her anyway listening francesco grated and didnt i tell you so crazy like a fox now hear me tony dont play his word games but put it to him straight our beloved father has a choice to make so let him make it now be quiet tony rounded on him at once but immediately anxiously turned back to the pit and over his shoulder hes not only listening but speaking too hes making sense at last so let him ah anthony my little anthony but is this the same small boy i bounced on my knee in the cool shade of le manse madonie so guileless well within limits and full of questions the son who was so near and dear to me so eager for knowledge who would leant from his fathers lips and witness in his deeds the ways of the wamphyri why in those days it was as if my every word was a revelation to you to be soaked up as a sponge soaks water and i knew you for a true bloodson aye nothing has changed father tony answered for here we are as always you and i and still i come to you with my questions ready to drink up your answers except you rarely answer any more oh yes know was listening it must be admitted listening to you and francescowhich might well have been a dream for all i knew or a nightmare praying for some word of comfort seeking some act of solace however small or hoping perhaps for some sweet tidbit with which to relieve the unrelenting boredom of this hellhole but what i heardwas none of these things you heard the words of angry despairing even desperate men father tony answered for we are at a loss and do you say that nothing has changed ah yes and i recall you said it to francesco too and that he also denied it but i am changed to this creature who is less than a creature and you are changed into necroscope the lost years vol ii ruthless men and the times are changed until they are charged with great dangers eagerly now tony leaned out more yet he gripped the wall of the pits coping with one hand and leaned his weight on juliettas swaying platform with the other so securing himself at the rim and do you know of these dangers he aimed his query directly into the shaft can you speak of them are we threatened for always remember father what threatens us threatens you aye and you are full of threats you and your brother now hold francesco could no longer contain himself he stepped forward and glared down into smouldering darkness if you were listening you must know that tony championed you oh i can be bitter i can worry about what is happening out there in the world of which we would have knowledge if you would only apply yourself yes and i can make dire threats if only out of frustration and despite that there can be no substance in them but when it conies down to it as always tony champions you if you were eavesdropping surely you heard him elect to remain here and care for you for two or three seconds there was total silence a stillness both physical and metaphysical but in the next moment the atmosphere in the cavern took on the weight of a thunderstorm the spotlights illuminating the mouth of the pit seemed to dim angelo ferenczys effluvium his breath streamed faster and colder from the mouth of the shaft and the darkness in the pit itself appeared to seethe then he doesnt want to talk to you it was some others voice not their fathers the voice of one of his longabsorbed victims his multiminds who were as mad and more so than angelo himself to spite francesco to ignore and refute his presence angelo had deliberately relaxed all constraint upon them and now the rest joined ina lunatic babble of denial all different but all directed into francescos buffeted mind he wont talk to you muuurderer kinkiller do not invite conversation do not force it upon him he can turn your dreams turn your mind you visit him now to torment him but if he were to visit you run oh run would you be a vessel to him as he is now a vessel to us he turns his back on you go now before he turns his face towards you you are all cursed you ferenczys but francesco above all others oh ha ha ha you have your metamorphism now but how long before it has you the sins of the father francesco your father is glad that you are cursed he wont talk to you brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii not to you francessscothe voices tailed off a little and get away tony halfturned from the pit hissed at francesco where he backed off his face pale his hands held up and forwards as if to ward off the unseen mental presences get back from the pit away from him that temper of yoursyou place yourself place both of us in danger i know hell talk to me i can feel it but youre right hell have nothing to do with you and damn you i dont blame him and what are you his fucking keeper but still francesco backed away his features writhing well you can have him burn the useless frothing old bastard thats what i say im finished with him fuck him and fuck you too he turned and flowed with the eerie motion of the wamphyri to the exit shaft turned and looked back still dressed in funereal clothes the change that had taken place in francesco was even more apparent and to any normal person appalling for his blood was up and his vampire leech fuelled his metamorphism his eyes like scarlet lamps his nostrils gaping wide in a convoluted batlike flange of a snout his mouth a fanged gash in a leadengrey mask of a face and damn you both to hell he snarled for youre two of a kind you and my dear father both and the parting shot from his dear father was a sinister mental hiss but we are already damned to hell francesssco and son if i were you which i thank my stars i am not would keep a tight rein on my metamorphism for we are of one blood francesco and wamphyri blood runs true whose pit will you occupy i wonder and whose oracle will you be in one or two or three hundred years time oh ha ha ha ha haaaaa but francesco had already left and only the fading echoes of his footfalls on the stone stairs came back to the cavern of the pit where eventually breathlessly tony asked can we talk now and will you answer truthfully to the best of your knowledge his fathers thoughts at once came groping like fat cold graveworms in his head and paused startled what but what have we here have i discoveredsome other tony was still leaning on the wall of the shaft with one arm outstretched steadying the suspended platform he frowned pondering his fathers querywhich a moment later he understood only too well eh juliettas first gasping breath her waking query was like a sharp stab in tonys awareness julietta awake wamphyri he snatched his hand away and felt her fingers scrape the skin from his knuckles where she had almost caught hold of him then she jerked erect bending at the waist sitting up like a corpse waking in its coffin an accurate simile to return to consciousness to life to undeath on a swaying platform over a nightmare pit but julietta had never been down here in her life before and for a moment she was disorientated then she saw tony his expression and her eyes widened as with a vampires understanding she knew knew that this was to have been and might still be her end the tenacity of the wamphyri juliettas slender arms marblegrey with fine blue veins reached for him their inchlong painted nails crooking like claws to hook into his flesh but they never reached him tilting with her sudden movements the suspended platform tipped her into the abyss bulgeeyed she slipped from view her hair floated over her head as she plunged her shriek of outrage more than terror echoed in the throat of the shaft and mine came that guttural grunt of sheerest lust from the depths of the well a tidbit after all from my anthony to his everloving father tremblingly tony cranked the wiremesh grid into place over the mouth of the pit only then as he activated the current and heard the hum and buzz of the field reestablishing itself did he begin to breathe more normally and to angelo you knew that she was here of course francesco and i we spoke of her when you were listening but angelo was no longer listening now it was his sons turn to listen to the obscene disbelieving shrieking of julietta her panted tortured ignored denials as the thing that was angelo ferenczy explored her then to the splitting sounds the sounds of suction rending finally of flesh exploding outwards as juliettas screams echoed into silence and tony reeling at the rim as he realized how close he too had come to being dragged shrieking into the pit and if he had been would it have been any different for him probably not almost an hour later when tony climbed up from the bowels of le manse madonie to its saner levels he found francesco waiting for him tony was exhausted and made no effort to hide it without comment francesco drove them in the land rover across the brutal terrain of their scrubby plateau to a rocky promontory looking out over the tyrrenhian parking on the far side of an outcrop that shielded them from le manse finally francesco lit two cigarettes passed one to his brother and said well how did it go necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley very well tony nodded good cop bad cop a good idea it worked very well indeed hah his brother laughed good and now who watches too much american television eh it went well tony said again but without emotion as if he were drained of emotion and showing never a sign of his brothers elation which in turn presents its own problems eh francesco stopped chuckling come again what problems problems aplenty tony answered if we can believe him and i think we can tell me about it tonys face was grey in the gloomy light a breeze off the sea blew a lock of his black hair across his sunken cheeks to start with it will be soon he said so little time radus resurgence only three months until all hell breaks loose our father has foreseen it francesco gripped his brothers arm and you have faith in his predictions how can he be sure how can we be sure angelo is a madman after all but mad like a fox the last time we spoke tony reminded him and when did you ever know him to be wrong also he isnt predicting anything not this time he overheard it he what for the last two or three years weve taken his silence his moods his increasingly complex nature and general unwillingness to cooperate in short his apparent lack of mental equilibrium as symptoms of a swift degeneration into madness but as ive so frequently asked before who wouldnt go mad in our fathers circumstances put yourself in his position when he is lucid in control of his talents he can scry or spy on the world he can or could scan something of future times he can locate a single man out of a million ten thousand miles away and report on his circumstances he was our oracle from whom we profited for more than three centuries and he was amazingly successful it was as if when his metamorphism ran out of control confining his body to that place it gave his mind far greater freedom francesco gave an impatient nod now tell me something i dont know tell me about our intruder who he really is and how hes linked to b j mirlu and radu lykan tell me about the doglord his location the names of his thralls and the extent of his power then tell me about this lone drakul in his tibetan monastery what he is all about and why hes chosen to show his hand now if you can tell me some of these things might begin to have a little faith in our father too some of these things tony answered narrowing his eyes i can tell you some of them for that is precisely what angelo has been working on all this time since the intruder whoever or whatever he is broke into the vault and robbed us what did i really hear you say whoever he is francescos voice was full of a biting furious sarcasm are you telling me we dont already know who he is has angelo changed his mind and did you also say working has our dear father been working then he paused as he noticed tonys expression the reddening of his eyes and angry flaring of his dark nostrils sighed and changed his tack as usual im short on patience he gruffly excused himself very well tell it your way and between deep drags on his cigarette tony told it he has located b j mirlus mind and gained limited access she is definitely wamphyri and he darent go too deep she would know it if he was less than discreet but one thing seems sure she has a thrall or an assistant help of sorts in a place called inverdruie in the cairngorms it fits its where she and her ebranch friend our intruder took out the drakul lieutenant and a thrall as to what the drakuls were interested in the doglords den obviously they came too close to finding him inverdruie is a hamlet a country crossroads a scattered handful of houses we can have our men check the place out house by house if necessary if bj mirlus main man is there well find him there are other thralls too a few perhaps in scotland like bj herself theyre descendants of old szgany clans who came through from starside in the old times none of them are changelings but they are of the blood moonchildren angelo calls them they are sleepers and the woman can call on them for help as and when she needs it and of course we also have it from our sleeper and lieutenant angus mcgowan that all of the girls working at bjs wine bar in edinburgh are in thrall to her as was the one we gave to angelo that time but angus cant be sure of their status simple thralls at a guess as for this ebranch type hes definitely our intruder goes under the name of harry keogh who we know to be a dead man convenient eh but in fact hes alec kyle who by all accounts should likewise be dead and yet herewell it has to be said that angelo is confused undecided and understandably so theres something about this ones mind angelo cant get into it or doesnt want to this man is different in more ways than one hes exebranch yesallegedly or perhaps hes still with them a double agent working for radu lykans downfall if so he has bj mirlu fooled theyre lovers but as i said mr keogh is a tricky one our father simply doesnt know what to make of him he talks of him coming and going whatever that means and still insists that he talks to dead men which is something of a coincidence in itself brian lumley for if you remember the kgb told us that the real mr keogh was some sort of necromancer myself i dont know what to think i give up on it but angelo maintains that harry keogh is the very worst of our enemies and i tend to agree with him assuming he was our intruder anyone who can get in here sight unseen and get out again with millions and go unpunished for as long as he has has to be special so much for the doglord and the people around him but these are strong leads youll agree which we must follow up and soon and personally then theres this drakul angelo has been into his mind too touched upon it at least enough to learn that daham drakesh as he calls himself or the last true drakul knows more than enough about us which makes us a future target obviously but talk about madness francesco compared with this drakul our father is the sanest of men drakesh plans to engineer a nuclear war just how is uncertain and in the aftermath will set up a network of aeries in the rubble of the cities under cover of the last long winter indeed the apparatus the triggers for this devastation are already in place and our father is still trying to discover what the catalyst will be so troubles enough youll agree and a vastly tangled skein for us to work our way through but work we must if we want to survive and we have to start without delay francesco had listened to all of it in a sullen silence but despite his volatile nature he was wise enough to realize that tony was deadly serious in everything he said and sensitive enough to feel the winds of change blowing over the mountains of le madonie yes and they blew far more ominously than the winds off the grey tyrrhenian and finally now that tony was done so whats next he asked his tone sombre ts it time we got involved do you think i mean in person havent i said as much tony looked at him one of us at least with a handful of our men in scotland yes one of us francesco raised an eyebrow meaning me unless youd prefer to stay here and care for angelo and look after our other interests no his brother shook his head flicked away the stub of his cigarette you were ever the home bird while im far more at ease out in the wider world and as for that loathsome thing in his pit i would probably let him rot so im the one wholl have to go he started the land rovers engine reversed into the open and headed for le manse then about juuetta he began but his brother cut him short she wasgratefully accepted he said really despite that shed been mine francesco made no attempt necroxope the lost yean vol ii to hide his surprise perhaps even his chagrin because she had been yours tony told him and shook his head in silent reproof you never heard a single thing he ever told us did you for if you had you would know its one of the traits of the wamphyn where blood and sex are concerned weve always preferred our own and when it was finished angelo told me he could smell you on her and your essence in her huh francesco grunted oh yes tony grinned however mirthlessly and theres one more thing you should know our father also told me his one regret was that it wasnt you yourself necroscope the lost years vol ii hi the opposition ebranch and other agencies in moscow turkur tzonov a young man destined for a measure of greatness and one with the capacity for an even greater measure of evil made report to yuri andropovs office in a coldly austere government building on kurtsuzov prospekt his footsteps were sure on the marble flags of the echoing highceilinged unwelcoming corridor whose offices were the nervecentre of andropovs organization which in itself said a lot for tzonovs selfassurance few men when they were summoned here would arrive with their heads held high and their consciences clear but in fact tzonov had been expecting andropovs call and it scarcely disturbed him on the other hand what he would report might well disturb the head of the komissia gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti the kgb at the end of the corridor tzonov came to a halt at the closed doubledoors of the last office flanking this terminal room two lesser rooms stood with their doors open these were secretarial offices momentarily unoccupied tzonov could hazard a guess why the clerks had been sent away there are some secrets that even secretaries shouldnt share he knocked twice on the doors and a thin cold voice from within said come tzonov narrowed his eyes and immediately composed himself as he was well aware that voice was a perfect match for the mind and soul that issued it he entered the room and his eyes were at once drawn to the figure of one of the most powerful some would say the most powerful men in russia where he was seated at his desk comrade or more properly direktor andropov andropov didnt look up but studied paperwork on the desk before him grey light from the frosted glass of large bulletproof bay windows framed him in a misty silhouette turning the lenses of his spectacles the larger dome of his polished head and the lesser gleam of his chin to an ankhlike design of silvery ovals but as tzonov approached his desk he offered him a cursory glance and said good morning comrade please sit slightly inclined to the angle of the great desk a large leather chair waited for tzonov answering good morning comrade direktor andropov he sat down put his briefcase on the floor made himself as comfortable as possibleand waited for much like andropov himself and despite the natural enthusiasm of youth tzonov wasnt an impatient man eventually andropov was done with his papers he shuffled them aside put his elbows on the desk and steepled his fingers before his face in that face only the ovals of his spectacles were visible against the haze from the windows and well he said eventually his voice cold measured and emotionless and twice more well well but such a young man which was my opinion when first we met yet so persistent and full of such large ambitions the reorganization of a branch of soviet security which on at least two occasions has proved itself an absolute liability to the system furthermore a branch which in the past stood in direct opposition to my own rather more orthodox er institution and methods not only that turkur tzonov spoke up not only to reorganize espbranch but to run it er with your guidance naturally that was my proposal when first we met five months ago and it still is as you required at that time i have now procured evidence of my credentials for the job direktor andropov i was only eighteen years old when the esp facility at the chateau bronnitsy fell and the branch more or less ceased to be perhaps fortunately i had been too young to be of service as a field agent and instead had been ordered to attend a fouryear course of studies to prepare me for my duties tzonov paused and waited and when andropov nodded continued even after bronnitsy fell i continued with my studies and six months ago passed all necessary examinations with honours since when i and a handful of other bronnitsy survivors have stood idly by waiting for a decision fromwell lets say from a higher authority that decision has not been forthcoming and we dont know if were coming or going but we do know that our talents are going to waste or have been while tzonov spoke the head of the kgb was not only attentive to everything he said but he also took the opportunity to scrutinize his visitor minutely and what he saw didnt entirely displease him for in just a few months this precocious youth seemed to have become more properly the man turkur tzonov was part turk part mongol all male there could brian lurnley necroscope the lost years vol ii be no question but that he was an alpha male a future leader an outstanding mind in an athletes body his penetrating grey eyes were the sort that could look at or into a man and indeed that was his alleged talent he read minds through eyecontact with his subjects which was also the reason that yuri andropov had arranged his office this way he wanted the light in tzonovs eyes for the moment at least for andropov must first let his visitor commit himself before he would show his own hand if this man was as good as the reports andropov had read on him he certainly didnt want him in his mind not just yet and probably not ever but you came to see me five months ago andropov deliberately leaned back in his chair diffusing the silhouette and contours of his face more yet in the light from the bay windows curving around him somewhat preemptive of you wasnt it the higher authority you refer to can only be premier leonid brezhnev himself the man who instigated this mindspy organization in the first place and by seeing me did you hope to jump the gun on brezhnev did you think it likely i would be willing to risk going over his head and what made you believe i might be prepared to reinstate espbranch in the first place for after all the branch was a thorn in my side what is more its first direktor that old warhorse gregor borowitz was an actual pain in my arse and while tzonov thought about that andropov continued to study him the youths eyebrows were slim as lines pencilled on paper upward slanting they were silverblond against the tanned ridges of his upper orbits from the eyebrows up he was completely hairless but this was so in keeping with his other features as to make it seem that in his case hair was never intended certainly this premature baldness wasnt a sign of ill health the bronze dome of tzonovs head glowed with a vitality matched by the flesh of his face where the single anomaly lay in the hollows of his eyes deepsunken and dark they seemed bruised as if from long hours of study or implacable concentration a symptom of his telepathy apparently turkur tzonovs nose was long and straight his mouth was well fleshed if a little wide over a chin that was strong and aggressively square his cheeks were very slightly hollow and his small pointed ears lay flat to his head the overall picture was of a tooperfect symmetry where the opposing halves of his face seemed mirror images in a majority of people it would be a disadvantage andropov thought the physical attraction of a face its good looks are normally defined by imperfections of balance tzonov was the exception to the rule for paradoxically he was a very attractive young man talented remained to be seen but definitely outspoken meanwhile tzonov had thought over what andropov had said to him now in an even voice he answered comrade direktor it wasnt a case of my hoping you would go over the party leaders head indeed i cant see how anyone could be accused of that for to my knowledge there isnt anyone or anything inside that head let me try to explain as soon as my studies were at an end i went to see brezhnev on behalf of that handful of bronnitsy survivors i spoke to his secretary who knew of the premiers interest in the branch i was granted an appointment two weeks later i was driven to a dacha at zhukovka where he was supposed to be resting but something had happened to him between times for while leonid brezhnev was there wrapped in a blanket and hunched on a couch he was not reallythere it was an aide who did all of his talking for him andropov held up a cautionary hand what are you saying his voice was quite emotionless it is also an aide who signs his daily round of papers for him tzonov went on articles of state that is and an aide who props him up when he appears on television and probably another who imitates his voicefairly difficult that last for to me it always seemed like the party leader was eating cabbage and there must definitely be another aide to wipe his backside when he has been to the toilet so what i am saying is that hes a zombie comrade direktor andropov sat up straighter and his face became more visible but still his eyes were silver ovals treason then he said if what you say is true it is treason you understand that dont you youre undermining the security of the state and if it is not true still its treason your youth is no excuse do you agree no the other shook his head i dont think so oh it would be treason if i said it to anyone elseespecially to a foreign power but not if i report it to the head of the komissia gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti to gather intelligence to be aware of everything is your job after all and surely this is important intelligence do you presume to tell me my job andropovs tone hadnt changed in the slightest degree anyway it wasnt your job to gather such intelligence tzonov shrugged i made no effort to gather it i merely observed it and how accurate were theseobservations sufficient to provide proof that leonid brezhnev the russian premier is on deaths doorstep kept alive well more or less until someone else can be elected in his stead to my satisfaction yes and by virtue of yourtalent yes andropov leaned back again his face dissolving into misty white brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii light this is the proof you would offer me that you are fit to head a revamped espbranch of soviet security right not all of it but some of it some of it yes then why didnt you tell me these things on the first occasion of our meeting because i would not presume to tell you what you already knew you are the head of the kgb of course you knew you are probably responsible for this continuing and very necessary subterfuge twentytwo years old andropov mused and already deep as a well i believe i may have work for you in what capacity i cant yet say a revitalized espbranch well perhaps but i really do not think so to date its direktors have beenshall we say less than cooperative they seemed to develop a lust for power all of them it is a power thing after all the gathering and control of information and as for esoteric information i want no secrets kept from me you would know everything that i learned the very moment i learned it tzonov assured him i would put one of my own in charge andropov continued to muse so as to have my finger on the pulse and if and when your loyalty was proven then you might one day replace him only give me the opportunity and is that it andropovs face came back into focus but his eyes remained invisible are we done here is this what it boils down to you could not get what you wanted from a failing brezhnev and so turned to me but why me after all im only a special policeman very special tzonov answered according to my colleagues at least your colleagues the other survivors futurologists hunchmen locators psychics andropov snorted finally displaying something of emotion borowitz was convinced and he convinced brezhnev but where is brezhnev now what good did it do him similarly felix krakovitch and ivan gerenko were true disciples of thesethese metaphysical mysteries and theyre dead too and the chateau bronnitsy which was home to all such spirit mediums is a gutted shell you have no faith in us tzonov smiledand andropov didnt like it he leaned closer across his desk and his spectacles lost something of their opaqueness his eyes were now partvisible but not enough t have faith in proven systems he answered show me some respect and show me the benefits real respect real benefits real proof and give you what you want im not lacking in respect tzonov told him in an even voice i would never have dared to come here without it nor without real proof as for the latter and the benefits you must be the judge what benefits are you talking in riddles moscow is still standing still secure isnt that benefit enough moscow is still andropov was obviously mystified explain and quickly for the last four years in my spare time ive kept my group together tzonov answered not difficult they were at a loss what to do with themselves the state had lost all interest in them some of them even took mundane jobs andi have continued their training ive kept them up to scratch you have been operating a mindspy cell ive been gathering proof of their effectiveness isnt that what you asked for the first time we met we only met five months ago at which time i didnt have the proof not the kind of proof that would sway you not quite what has all of this to do with the fact that moscow is what still standing still secure i am growing impatient now you had better let me see the whole picture its a complicated picture show me anyway do you remember the parapsychological convention held in moscow two years ago i fancy it was a brainchild of brezhnevs though at the time he pretended to stand aloof from it it was his last attempt to reinvent espbranch and he wanted to know what we were up against in the rest of the world i do remember yes andropov replied psychic detente ostensibly spoonbenders from israel and waterdiviners from egypt mentalists from mongolia and scryers from syria even a couple of futurologists from england probably from their own ebranch and other metaphysicians from places as diverse as chicago and china and tibet tzonov remained cool eh tibetans part of the chinese delegation wouldbe saboteurs as it has since turned out saboteurs andropov growled and what were they trying to sabotage pray moscow tzonov told him without further ado or emphasis that for a start anyway moscow and world peace and but for my team they would have succeeded necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley explain andropov moved out of focus again myself and several of my people attended the convention naturally brezhnev required it i remember something of that yes well we were there to spy on possible mindspies to see how good they were i was the groups telepath of course but there was also my precog and a hunchman your precog andropovs frown wasnt quite visible in the haze of light but tzonov felt it all the same and what did you say a hunchman its difficult to explain in layman terms tzonov said a hunchman is a special kind of esper who makes clever guesses except its not just guesswork but his talent hes aware of oh all sorts of things about whats going on in general if he can pinpoint a british nuclear submarine in the barents sea then we call him a locator if he dreams or nightmares about someones death in a weeks time and seven days from now that someone dies then hes a futurologist or precog at the convention i had a precog and a hunchman with me go on the chinese attendees were paramilitaries from the espcentre on kwijiang avenue in chungking weve known about them for a long time they were doing what we were doing seeing if they could find out what the opposition was up to and how good we were at it nothing strange about that apart from all the er spoonbending and zener card reading its what we were all there for but these tibetans were something else there were six of them sect members of an obscure monastery somewhere they had shaven heads and wore red robes usually with the hoods up they moved together always almost as one man one of them their leader i supposed had tiny bells sewn into his sleeves my hunchman told me he thought they were up to something when he concentrated on them all he got was a kind of smog a mental smokescreen the same sort of thing incidentally that we occasionally experience with british espers my precog was similarly confused and very nervous in their presence he preferred to be nowhere near them precogs are generally peculiar in that respect they fear to see too much and are never or very rarely interested in their own futures they say that the past and future are immutable since they cant change the future they prefer not to know it at least not with respect to themselves it must be an awful thing to know you are going to die when and how and not be able to do anything about iti was curious and tried to read the minds of these tibetans i pride myself on my skill that its almost undetectable except to other skilled telepaths but somehow the redrobes knew it they accepted far more readily than anyone else at the convention that i was the genuine thing and avoided me like the plague but what little i did seewas very worrying they were definitely hiding something if you recall comrade direktor the convention accommodation was the central committee hotel in the sivtsev vrazhek district of the city and the convention rooms were right here on kurtsuzov prospekt which i imagine made it easy for your men to watch the comings and goings of foreign attendees easy to collect their fingerprints and other details too andropov nodded i believe we got them all yes a few dozens to go with the many thousands already on file indeed and if you didnt my people did again andropovs face was drawn back into view and his frown of disapproval was plainly visible but before he could say anything tzonov continued the convention was inconclusive there were too many fakers the cause of parapsychological research was not furthered but we did learn that there are many budding talents in china that the british are probably leaders in the field and that the tibetans whom we supposed to be working hand in hand with the chinese were up tosomething so the convention ended and i made report to brezhnev by which time he was far more interested in russian successes and infuriated by our failures in the olympics the american boycott seemed to have upset him greatly i think it was about then that his slow decline first became noticeable but in any case he commended me for my efforts before sending me back to my studies as tzonov paused andropov put in i sincerely hope all of this is going somewhere i have other things to do with my time young tzonov it is going somewhere the other assured him and went on i have a locator a man whose speciality is the detection of fissionable material in his time under general borowitz he tracked the flight paths of american bombers also the movements of their mobile missiles kept watch on natos nuclear capability in west germany and great britains atomic submarines in waters around the world his talent was largely dependent upon the critical mass or amount of fissionable material with which he wassympathetic for example the many trident missiles in the belly of a nuclear sub made it easy to find while a single test bomb was far more difficult in general borowitzs time however he had noted an ammunition dump of bombs in chungking and had recorded its size likewise he had records of many other such dumps worldwide brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii but in the eighteen months following the convention my locator was a puzzled even a worried man he had not attended the convention because his talent would have had no application there yet now he felt himself drawn to or repelled by a certain district of the city this city moscow this time when tzonov paused andropov immediately nodded and said yes go on you have my attention finally tzonov continued three months or so after we met you and i for the first time my locator came to me with his problem by which time his inexplicable repulsion with regard to a certain district had become a morbid obsession tell me the district andropov cut in the sivtsev vrazhek district comrade go on i went with him to the central committee hotel and we stood outside together looking at the place for the locator simply being there was a terrible ordeal he wanted to be anywhere but there the implications were obvious but proving our suspicions without causing a panic a gigantic panic would not be easy fortunately an uncle of mine in krasnoyarsk was scheduled to pay me a visit he had good connections was able to book himself in at the hotel cut it short yuri andropovs hands were pressing down on his desk now he had thrust his face forward and his staring eyes were more than ever visible once inside the hotel access to the cellars and from there to the substructure was easy we went down there when the hotel was sleeping in the middle of the night and after my locator had pinpointed the spot you dug there andropov said indeed i had to for my locator was now useless i saw what was in his mind a glaring ball of light a nuclear furnace burning bright sudden death by atomization but my futurologists had foreseen no such disaster so i am no atomic physicist comrade direktor but i think it is safe to say the device is a crude one the most surprising factor lies in its compact construction those six tibetan monks could easily have brought its components in as part of their luggage like all the other attendees they had been met at the airport by officials and seen through customs you will recall that at that time we were being helpful to foreigners and trying to improve their opinion of us it needed improving for it was the same bad attitude that had impacted so badly on our olympics we were trying to mend our bridges as it were andropov was stiff as a rod now bolt upright behind his desk tzonov do you know what you are telling me that there was an atomic bomb under the central committee hotel for over two years was said the other that there was one yes youmoved it my god not a problem he said the device was equipped with a radio receiver a trigger it would have to be detonated remotely by a prearranged series of signals remove the receiver and the bomb would be made safe i removed it myself my god andropov breathed again then slumped down into his chair he waved a loose hand howhow long ago five weeks youve waited five weeks to bring this to my attention to anyones attention to know that this thing was done was one thing but to prove who did ittook longer but it would have been totally impossible in the confusion that would follow an actual detonationwith moscow reduced to so much rubble and every nuclear power in the world blaming everyone else a beautiful piece of sabotage especially if this wasnt the only bomb what ah no direktor tzonov read his mind the hard way by guessing what he was thinking not here in russia but in some other part of the world explain andropov was sitting up straight again leaning forward and his eyes were like windows to tzonov so that he could look right into his soul except right now there was nothing in there but shock confusion tzonov reached down and picked up his briefcase placing it on the edge of the desk he opened it and andropov immediately leaned away from it but tzonov only grinned with that too perfect face of his and took out a small piece of electronic apparatus a black box with a coiled wire antenna attached to some kind of meter with a dial and flickering needle behind a small glass window at one end of the scale the dial was painted red the trigger he explained as he placed it in front of andropov and watched until the needle jerked to a standstill i had the meter wired to it in order to know when the signal had been sent and received when that happens the needle will swing to red and freeze there and the time will be recorded the time when you and i and moscow were supposed to die and world war hi begin chinese bastards andropovs usually pale face was now chalk white knowing that wed be mainly interested in them they used the tibetans to do their dirty work for them but no tzonov shook his head the chinese knew nothing about it the tibetans were the ones who brought the bomb in and f brian lumley planted it their fingerprints are all over the weapon parts and that receiver there butthere are fingerprints and fingerprints explain my locator sniffs out the type of nuclear fuel every batch has its own distinct smell the dump in chungking was the source of the device yes but why would the chinese want to sabotage themselves and quickly let me go on the dump in chungking has been depleted by three times the amount of fissionable material in that bomb three bombs worth then wait andropov picked up his telephone dialled and in a moment said sergei yuri are we on scramble good i remember our listening station intercepted a report concerning the theft of three nuclear deviceschinese yes it was im not sure two to three years ago but i do remember that heads rolled among the higher echelon in the chinese army dig out a copy of that report for me will you good he put the phone down and looked at tzonov im sorry go on so tzonov said the final piece in the puzzle china overran tibet destroyed many of the monasteries and created all kinds of havoc now the tibetans would have their revenge and safe on the roof of the world watch the rest of us destroy each other it makes sense tell me now where are the other bombs andropovs face was grim now i take it your locator has found them for you by their psychic fingerprints yes but comrade direktor cant i tell it my way call meoh yuri but yes go on go on locating the bomb in moscow was easy because we dont get much nuclear stuff in here even the missiles in our annual parade are dummies they have no live warheads of course not no sensible government wants this stuff in their highlypopulated cities especially centres of commerce and control thats where your man looked for them in the cities yes there is one hotspot in londonhyde park we believe or jekyll and hyde park as we refer to it now and the other lets the chinese off the hook very definitely for it didnt move too far its still in chungking not far from a certain address on kwijiang avenue their espcentre yes the same signature and now we see it all really then be so good as to see it for me at some time in the near future maybe a time of high tension between east and west or problems on the sinosoviet border one necroscope the lost years vol ii of the bombs would be detonated the world would go into shock briefly before the accusations started to fly then say thirtysix hours after the first bomb the second retaliation obviously confused messages of peace dtiente conunonsense pleading and threats of course are flashing all around the world but those rubblestrewn centres of commerce were also the centres of communication now those communications are down and in any case no one is listening bomb number three follows in short order and numbers four five six seven china throws in all shes got and her bombs are crude dirty one british sub wrecks russia france strikes at our satellites the americans decide to make it final and finish what they started at hiroshima and nagasaki and we whats left of us reply in kind and the tibetans count beads bang gongs and begin rebuilding their monasteries if s gods will after all for he said hed destroy us by fire next time we must tell the british of course andropov was sweating now oh but of course they would certainly blame us as would the americans and its as you said afterwards thered be no proving who did it not so there would be an atomic signature too pointing at china and a war with china on our doorstep and china our next satellite once she runs out of steam no it cant be allowed weve come too close to nuclear war in the past the purpose of these things is to stop us killing each other of course therefore we must tell londonand china as for the british theyll owe us a big favour and it will give us a massive bargaining chip with china tzonov er turkur youve done extremely well the head of the kgb was on his feet now coining out from behind his desk holding out his hand tzonov took it shook it said im glad youre pleased and he looked andropov directly in the eyes not only am pleased but the politburo and brezhnev who has been giving me a hard time will also be pleased he may even stop blocking my right he stopped freed his hand and began to turn away but too late to succession oh i assure you he will er yuri he must and soon i think again tzonov looked deep into the others eyes andropov went back behind his desk sat down again faded to a brian lumley dark blot against the haze of light your precog did i not tell you my people consider you a very special man tzonov answered im sure i did there was a long pause then but as tzonov took the electrical apparatus and replaced it in his briefcase so andropov said if and i mean if it comes to pass that i am elected to the presidency you have my word that i shall reinstate espbranch and you turkur tzonov shall be the head of that branch responsible only to myself i shall be forever in your debt tzonov answered but a debt that repay many times over be sure oh i am andropov smiled thinly and now i have much to do likewise tzonov answered he brought his feet together bowed slightly from the waist walked to the doors and turkurnot a word of course not be in touch tes yuri except andropov leaned on his desk looked at tzonov across the room where he had paused at the doors tes when exactly will it be i mean i read it in your mind you understand and i agree it has to be done for we must have a strong leader after all especially in times like these and brezhnev is little more than a vegetable its almost like doing him a favour so when exactly in november will it be andropov thought about it for a long time before slowly answering you realize of course that while i now accept your weird talent and those of your group parapsychology is not generally accepted and certainly not in evidence oh yes im aware of that andropov nodded then you ted me when exactly in november brezhnev will die for after all you read it in my mind the tenth tzonov answered at once hell be given the final dose on the morning of the tenth veryclever said the slightly shaken voice of the figure in the haze and on the eleventh i shall be head of espbranch but andropovs silhouette only nodded and said good day young turkur tzonov outside andropovs office tzonov narrowed his eyes gripped his briefcase and commenced walking the marble flags to the stairs and on his way he thought youd better keep your word you arrogant bastard having delivered terrific power into andropovs cold hands he wanted something of it back and soon it would have to be very soon yes for as tzonov was only too well aware russias necnscope the lost yean vol premierelect wasnt destined to last all that long himself three days later at ebranch hq in the centre of london ben trask had just spoken to or rather confronted darcy clarice in his office just how did this come up darcy asked him when he was through i had a little time to spare trask told him id finished with the police case i was working on and thought i might catch up on some old files i never had read everything in connection with that case up in scotland those tibetan monks and id never been too happy with the result of that telephone conversation you talked me into having with harry keogh to see if hed had anything to do with it you said it had to be done but i didnt like it anyway hell were all on the same side you know were darcy told him we were on the same side except harry left us remember oh i know the argument we dont spy on fellow mindspies etcetera our own that is but i had my reasons believe me stuff you couldnt talk about it was all on a need to know basis said darcy i needed to know and you didnt and even now theres still something youre not telling me trask accused security the head of branch answered and look ben i like the necroscope as much as you do as much as we all do but when he left the branch he became a security problem could have become onewhich is as much as im going to say darcy knew trasks talent for getting at the truth of a subject the fact that he was a human lie detector and so tried to change the subject or at least divert it so what did you find in the files something that the police had covered up from the general public anyway trask answered probably because theyd been asked to do so and probably by us looking at clarkes face his changing expression he knew that he was right he read the truth of it in the others frown the way he blinked his eyes the crossbow bolts clarice said right trask answered silvered boltheads one buried in the door of that burnedout stationwagon and another in the heart of a sunday roast that used to be a man the same kind of boltheads that were used in the garage that time the same ones that harry used or so we believe but we never did find the actual crossbow youve a good memory clarke told him but didnt you ever stop to think i might be covering up for harry r brian lumley does he need covering up for the way i see it he did a good job that time he always did a good job thats howyo see it said darcy but the police see it differently to them murder is murder unless its a state execution and we stopped doing that a long time ago what are you saying that because harry had quit ebranch because he no longer had our cover the police could have dragged him in for the scottish job maybe clarke shrugged if hed left clues to tie him to it and did he no just those boltheads which tied the job to us instead because the police knew it was one of our agents whod put the whammy on that autotheft gang trask cocked his head a little and pursed his lips darcy clarke was telling the truth he knew but he stifl wasnt telling all of it and that galled so trask mused since you already knew that the necroscope was involved with these tibetans in fact that hed taken them out why did you require me to check him out what else were you worried about darcy and what are you still worried about clarke slumped a little behind his desk is it that obvious to me yes has been for more than three years now ever since harry walked or went out of here but especially in the last three months or so since this incident with these hari krishna types i mean why cant you talk about it is it the old department of dirty tricks again and even before clarke could answer his expression said it all said yes it was that department again trask nodded now tell me about it he said because i really do need to know i need to be reassured that im working for the right side or at least the best side clarke sat up straighten and sighed all right ben tell you but since you expect straight answers from me first let me ask you something do you really think that if you or i or any one of us should decide to leave the branch it would be as easy as that i mean like snapping your fingers what you should be allowed to walk out of here knowing all weve done something of what we still might do and everything were capable of doing with all the weird stuff you have seen and still got stuck in your head and no questions asked trask saw it at once we fixed him he said and his jaw jutted a very little how was it done ben darcy said think it over will you without getting too excited were not just talking about an ordinary man or talent here there are no ordinary talents not in ebranch but we are talking about the most extraordinary talent of all the necroscope harry keogh he can goanywhere instantly he talks toto dead necroscope the lost years vol ii people for gods sake of which there are a great majority wholl do just about anything for him and we could just let him walk well maybe we could but there are others higher up the ladder who couldnt how was it done ben darcy was reaching the end of his tether tm the one whos had to live with it why cant you leave it at that put it this way this was the soft option for a long moment there was silence until trask exploded i dont believe it but the trouble was he did because he of all men knew it was the truth we recruited him remember keenan gormley recruited him and if he could do it nicely then someone else might try to do it nasty and anyway its no big deal darcy felt like he was lying but had no choice harrys lost nothing except he just cant talk about it anymore he can still do his thing but no one else is ever going to get to know about it and now trask understood hypnotism he said and darcy nodded the soft option but still and as you yourself pointed out ive worried about it ever since and trask saw the truth of that too if s been on your shoulders like a tangible weight an extra weight darcy answered a few extra ounces on top of the ton or so thats already there you knew it was wrong or that it wasnt right and i sensed it in you you felt that youd lied to harry no darcy said but that i hadnt told him the whole truth yes the reason i felt it was because it wasnt you the moment harrys name entered a conversation you didnt read quite right all right so im guilty darcy snapped and what about you if or when its your turn to run the show do you think it will be any easier for you with your talent well it wont be ifll be hell ben the other thought about it and said and theres nothing we can do about it we cant put it right noyes not for harry no but for me youve already done it ben a load shared is a burden halved now youll have to carry it too but youll get used to it and at least well be able to tell ourselves that harrys still alive for a moment they glared at each other then gradually relaxedand darcys intercom came cracklingly alive sir darcy thumbed the duty officers button tes minister responsible urgent do you want it on screen yes thanks a moment later his desk screen came alive flickered for a second r brian lumley or two got angry with itself in a crackle of static then snapped into sharp focus it displayed this legend origination minres destination director intesr duty officer intese for your eyes only message follows trask had come round to darcys side of the desk i better not look right the way he said it darcy felt the edge of sarcasm in his voice and oh dont be fucking silly he snapped the message followed for public consumption a treasureseeker with a metaldetector has found a world war ii bomb in hyde park the area has been secured and all buildings in the immediate vicinity are being vacated mr clarke this isnt as its made out to be a man from my office has been fully briefed he and other experts are on the scene right now take some of your best men and get down to hyde park i shall need your first impressions and best opinions good luck minres necroscope the lost yean vol ii as a ps good luck trask murmured and what the hell printed itself under the message mr clarke in the event that i or any other minister should be required the usual whitehall telephone numbers will not suffice you may contact me on followed by a number but there was something about the number that darcy clarke didnt like or if not him his talent he waited until the screen cleared punched in the number and queried it the computer asked him for his security clearance the first time that had ever happened he punched that in too and finally got his answer an allegedly decommissioned nuclear bunker in uxbridge fifteen miles out of the city christ darcy gasped as he felt the short hairs rising on the back of his neck its clean underpants time again that bad trasks query his tone of voice said it all the other stuff was over and done with and he was darcys strong right arm again i iv radu he dreams on radu dreamed his olden recurrent but frequently fading dreams of blood as ever he strove to restructure and reinstate them in the eye of a memory occasionally filmed over by six centuries of sleep his undead hibernation he dreamed of ages past and the life hed known then and of the many lives hed consumed since then crimson dreams of his beginnings in a vampire world of his conversion to something other than a man of his eventual banishment into a new entirely different world and his everlasting and soon to be ongoing bloodwar against those who had dared to rape and ruin what little he had loved less than vivid his dreams unless they were recounted reinforced revisited over and over to bring them into nightmare definition in radus yet more nightmarish mind for these were things that he desired to remember forever they were his one recourse his only means of keeping his hatred alive while he waited out his time in a resin tomb sleeping but not dead he recalled names from the swirling mists of a fardistant past giorga ion and lexandru zirescu and the ferenczys lagula and rakhi in another time and world the zirescus had been his direst enemies and the ferenczys were olden lords of starside now they were all long dead and radu relished fond memories of how he had dealt with themand thoughts of how he would next deal with any survivor or descendant when once more he was up and abroad in a changed and everchanging world for the doglord knew that there were such descendants definitely abroad in the world aye and indeed upon a time he and his various packs his pups had been abroad sufficient to start or certainly to reinforce legends as old as mankind itself of the werewolf and the vampire or of both for radu lykan was both wamphyri necroscope the lost years vol ii his dreaming mind went back back backto how it had been in those earliest days of his coming here in starside he had been found guilty of treason as punishment shaitan the unborn selfstyled high magistrate of all the wamphyri had had radu and a handful of his retainers a lieutenant or two and a few thralls thrown into the socalled helllands gate from which no one ever returned it had been like a long slow fall into some weird white hell and for a time radu and the others had thought that this was all there was to it to drift downward forever or until starvation put paid to them and they shrivelled to husks but that wasnt to be die way of it the real hell began where the gate opened into this world in a subterranean cavern carved by an underground river lit by the glare of the gate the caverns narrow ledges were cold and damp the river was in flood and rushed through its borehole in a frenzy of black water along the course of the river where it left the cave the walls bottlenecked and there was scarcely a gap between the water and the ceiling black rushing water the wamphyri feared it not for any superstitious reason but deprived of air and light buffetted against stone walls and crushed by unfathomed depths how long may a man or even a vampire survive flesh softens fails and is sloughed away and when body and brains fall apart all that remains is naked bone to be broken up and rounded to pebbles perhaps this was the nature of these helllands radu had a choice but not much of one brave the rushing waters or stay safe on a ledge or crammed in some crevice till he had no strength to move but got cemented in place by layers of dripstone and do as you see fit he had told the others with him this river may run downhill foreverin which case its goodbye radu but somewhere out there is moonlight which i would feel silvering my neck again or my ruff if the moon is full and with that he had jumped from the ledge and been borne under the other lords and their men had followed suit likewise radus lieutenants and a few thralls some of whom survived to surface in dacia near a roman barter camp on the danuvius the year was ad and the moon was indeed full from which time forward the place would always be known as radujevac that had been a time nightskirmishes with legionnaires along the danube and in brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii the dacian hamlets piracy on the merchant shipping bloodfeasts by the light of the full moon and as for the men of that era theyd been naive as children when first radu and the others came among them their sciences were young superstitions many and their blood sweet as any in sunside in the far vampire world of radus origin but as compared with the szgany of sunside their numbers were vast thenraces diverse their courage unbelievable and their skills in battle phenomenal still in the first hundred to two hundred years the werewolf had flourishedand the true vampire for the doglord radu was not the only lord of the wamphyri banished by shaitan indeed several great rivals had come through the gate with him at or about the same time such as nonari the gross ferenczy and the drakul brothers karl and egon in starside the drakuls had been radus allies against shaitan here they were simply rivals and as for nonari nonari had made a bloodoath to wipe out the doglord and every last trace of him for the alleged murders of his father lagula and his uncle rakhi but in radu lykans eyes these were never murders but the putting right of a great wrong for rakhi and lagula had been members of a foul szgany gang who had raped his sister magda of innocence and life hah the ferenczys were survivors no more except in lagulas son nonari but savage as that ones blood vow had been it was equalled and even surpassed by radus for him thered be neither peace nor respite until the very name ferenczy was forgotten as if it never existed their bloodfeud came with them into earth it might have been settled there and then in dacia on the banks of the danube but this was a new world and strange and survival was ever the first rule of the wamphyri so the drakuls went up into the stony mountains to find or build their aeries nonari fled east from radus wrath and took a new name the doglord crossed the river with his small pack spread out into the lands around and eventually became an adventurer and mercenary in a wartorn world but while that classical world was vast beyond the dreams of any vampire lord who had ever been still it could never be big enough radus life passed in pageant over the buffed and slippery boards of his memory the history of a world of wars and of men the romans but the empire was on the wane at least where the doglord and the others came forth aye for the goths were coming who were the merest harbingers of what else was coming such wars such battles such blood buthelllands ah no it had been more like some wamphyri heavenfor a time but already radu had noted how men reacted to the presence of the wamphyri fearfully at first in a world rife with superstition but then they fought back for while men may suffer their lands to be stolen their wives seduced away and their children eaten when finally there is nothing left then theres nothing to lose unlike sunsides szgany not all of these men of earth were farmers or huntergatherers great armies of warrior tribesmen were sweeping the world and sweeping all before them and as for fear of the wamphyri frequently these eastern invaders had not even known they went up against vampires they were merely murdering rich dacian landowners in tiieir gloomy castles or hairy halfling creatures in foothill keeps caverns and lairs also these warrior hordes knew how to destroy their enemies how a lance or arrow through the heart would kill a man and how his head on a lance would guarantee that he was dead then how to reduce his castle and its contents to ashes until nothing remained such was the way of the barbarian warrior by no means reserved for the wamphyri but did these methods work against the wamphyri be sure they did indeed they were the only ones that could the stake the sword the fire and because of the times times of change tumult and crisis the legend and fact of the wamphyri of the bloodcrazed vampire and werewolf was almost eradicated what need for monstrous myths in a world that was in reality a bloodbath forty years after radus advent the visigoths had sacked rome itself and fortyfive years later it had fallen again to the vandals except then radu had been with the vandals for like every vampire lord before him he was unable to resist blood certainly not in such copious amounts war to which radu was drawn like a moth to the flame and which singed him much the same or if not the wars the commanders he fought under who were treacherous to a fault but suck wars to be warred as nothing conceived by even the mightiest of the old starside lords and down all the decades and centuries the doglord was a bloody mercenary washed hither and to by the red tides of conquest gifted to some degree in oneiromancy radu used his dreams to scry on future battles by this means he would often know in advance which side to join likewise he stayed alert for portents and signs of those olden enemies who came through the helllands gate with him and time and again he cursed himself that hed not dealt with them then when they were at their weakest but then he had been at his weakest too and naive aye hed been that to have sold his services to warlords and think he would actually get paid and accepted as their equal brian lumley gaeseric of the vandals had been the first to use and misuse him after the sack of rome radu had made his camp in the colli albani twelve miles out of the fallen city of course it was necessary to keep his men from the common soldiery they were not only mercenaries and guerrillas but moonchildren he knew that fraternization could only lead to discovery and one of the prime tenets of the vampire was that longevity was synonymous with anonymity if men should guess what radu was they would do away with him and his at once and because of the doglords preference for nightfighting by the light of the moon gaeseric had already dubbed him radu hound of night and so it were best that the full extent of his wolfishness remained a secret be that as it may still gaeseric had tricked him turned on him for what was he after all but a scurvy hairy mercenary with a handful of howling berserks like wolves of war but the city had fallen now and radu and his lot had been paid off and having paid him in gold having let him take women wine and other booty out of the city by now hed be drunk up in the hills and all that gold gone to waste or perhaps not by means of a lie an alleged counterattack by a fleet of the eastern empire the doglords forces were split into two contingents and dispatched to defensive positions where vandal ambushes reduced his men to ten out of a hundred and fifty his women were ravished and slain his gold stolen his den in the colli albani destroyed but radu and his handful had survived to head north for the appenino heights that stretched the full length of italia in a land awash in vandals the rugged mountains would be the safest route out as for the treacherous gaeseric the doglord must add a second bloodoath to his list and where the vandals as a race were concernedfrom that time forward radu would always be on the lookout for a way to take his revenge fleeing italy radu took his time took his muchreduced band back to the danube then east through the woods and mountains and eventually down into familiar dacian territories this was barbarian country now but south of the river the people were mainly christian radu had only one religion blood the various faiths and superstitions of locals and invaders alike made little or no difference to him except it was safer to journey among the christians finally he headed north again into the mountains of what would much later become wallachia for as in italy he believed that in taking the high ground hed be secure from the tides of war washing necroscope the lost yean vol ii all around he needed some time to think and formulate his plans on his way from rome to dacia he had accumulated monies from roman citizens fleeing the vandalism and from small parties of the vandals themselves still scathing in the land around and on the danube thered been a last handful of roman travellers and traders now since for the time being the doglord had had enough of war he decided to put his gold to use thus in the year ad he and the pack wintered down in what would be their lair for the next sixty years a great cave in the mountains of western moldavia he employed refugees from the moldavian plains which were still suffering under sporadic attacks from asiatic warriors on horseback to make his crag or aerie habitable and he recruited the strongest of these workers for his lieutenants and because day by day year by year fresh refugees were fleeing the warfare climbing the mountains reduced to scavenging in the heights there was a steady turnover of workers and no lack ofprovisions also there was never any trickling away of radus gold which he would steal back from anyone foolish enough to attempt desertion and while work was in progress to make the cavern liveable he was not remiss in seeing to its defences he disguised its appearance externally until it was simply a part of the crags all around it took time even years before wolfscrag was finished to radus satisfaction following which he had no more use for his workers from the moldavian steppe or at best or worst only one more use during all of this time the doglord and his men had gone without their comforts good wine and womanflesh which even as mercenaries under entirely human commanders they had come to expect as their right no one ever grumbled however for radu was known to deal with complaints in short order he did understand the problems though for he shared them equally with his lieutenants and thralls there were now trappers in the mountains radu killed or recruited them and took their women for his own and from now on any who entered that region of the moldavian heights would suffer the same fate and now wolfscrag was more truly a home or an aerie for him and his earlier aware that the huns had had the run of the steppe for decades and wondering if their supremacy was still holding radu had sent scouts east to discover the state of things others had been sent west along the twin spurs of the carpathians and spies into various makeshift hamlets clinging to the flanks of the mountains not far removed from wolfscrag brian lumley eventually these scouts returned the doglord learned how the ramshackle hamlets of moldavian refugees and the more distant carpathian villages were ripe for conquest the people were pacifists isolationists who had cut themselves off completely from dacias wartorn regions and the great battlefields under the mountains radu couldnt say he blamed them but in any case his intentions didnt run to conquest not yet anyway or at best a very subtle conquest instead he would offer these people his services as a mercenary warrior a voevod against who or whatever might brave these mountains to attack them and in fifty more years he did just that but as well as hard information his spies and scouts had brought back rumours too one of them had heard it that a ferenczy was in league with the vandals good luck to him whoever he was be it nonari the gross if he yet lived or an alleged eggson one belos pheropzis for if that bastard gaeseric dealt as badly with all of his mercenaries as he had dealt with raduwell that was at least one ferenczy that the doglord neednt bother to hunt down meanwhile in the twin spurs of the western carpathians the drakuls had gained apparently impregnable footholds throwing caution to the wind ignoring their own tenet that longevity is synonymous with anonymity they ruled openly and by terror people knew of them and their works true vampires they flew and slew and converted by night radu had sent spies to seek them out and learn the locations of their aeries his men never returned that should have been warning enough of drakul superiority butradu was safe in wolfscrag or so he reckoned but eventually drakul incursions into territory that radu considered his own became too much and he determined to strike back they had many advantages masters of metamorphism they could shape their bodies for flying longestablished in their places their aeries were allegedly impregnable but they had some disadvantages too children of the night they could not go out in daylight every morning must find them safe in their beds of soil out of starside and they were very well aware of the doglords ruthlessness and savagery that if he did come upon them there would be no bargaining no quarter no mercy then on the eve of radus strike westward a fresh rumour but one that he couldnt possibly ignore he went down into the steppe to bacau where this whisper had origin and the truth was learned there how the emperor justinian had commissioned a fleet under belisarius to strike at the vandals even across the mediterranean in necroscope the lost yean vol ii north africa and other parts in short to take back the western empire the vandals and radus old vow unfulfilled and a ferenczy among the treacherous scum at that old gaeseric had gone the way of all or most flesh sixty or more years ago but the vandal kingdom remained and at least one ferenczy well even after all this time any surviving member of the ferenczy dynasty was far and away radus direst enemy spawn of the original destroyers of his dearest love in another world another time but all of it like yesterday to radu torn two ways between attacking the drakuls and joining belisarius as a mercenary and an expert in vandal tactics he returned to wolfscrag in the heights only to find that the drakuls had paid a visit in his absence the place had been destroyed utterly and most of his men and women thralls and lieutenants with it no choice now but war on the vandals for to go against the drakuls with his remaining handful were madness but later there would always be a later and radu who was ever the opportunist saw at least one distinct possibility join with belisarius distinguish himself in the field of battle eventually return to these desolate heights as voevod of all daciaall with the emperors approval then see to these damned drakuls with an entire legion perhaps to back him up it was a good even a grand scheme and irresistible radus expert knowledge of the vandals at war served him well in plika on the black sea he broached that very subject to a squat yellow scarfaced and slanteyed hun condottiere the son of the son of an asian invader who had settled the steppe sixty years ago commander of a force of two hundred now tok heng had had enough of farming and was returning to his grandfathers trade but in fact and as he admitted to radu where they swilled wine in a tavern he had never left it his land had been stolen for him by warrior ancestors the romans had stolen it backrom his father and given it to peasants tok had stolen it a third time with the result that the romans had put a price on his head since he couldnt beat them hed decided to join them there was a pardon in it for him and his men and a promise of citizenship and of land if he would join belisariuss force and fight the vandals in the mediterranean and africa now he was waiting on ocean transport to take them to constantinople but tok was fifty men short of the contingent hed promised to belisariuss recruiters perhaps radu and his lot would care to join forces with him and make up his numbers certainly the fact that brian lumtey radu had knowledge of vandal battle tactics would be an advantage the doglord laughed at that he fought under no mans colours but his own maybe tok would care to join him or perhaps they could agree on a form of shared leadership no tok heng wouldnt have it but it was the time of the full moon that night radu converted the hun and thus became leader of his mercenary band as for mixing in with the romans in constantinople it was observed how belisariuss army of fifteen thousand ten thousand foot soldiers and five thousand cavalry was composed mainly of mercenaries under condottiere commanders of actual romansthere were a few this was the best that justinians general could muster and so there was no trouble at all mixing with true romans only in finding them radu was allotted ten vessels with crews out of a fleet of five hundred and was obliged to take horses on board too but since horses didnt care for him or his he made sure that his command vessel was kept free of them and that they went with tok hengs people who understood them thus a majority of the doglords original party survivors of the massacre at wolfscrag travelled with him and radu looked forward to killing vandals nor was there long to wait the best of the vandal fleet and soldiers were in sardinia putting down a revolt thus belisariuss army was able to disembark without trouble near sousse gelimer the vandal king mustered what remained of his forces and met belisarius headon at a place called decimumwellnamed for there gelimers forces were decimated the survivors fled into numidia and belisarius marched into carthage midseptember ad gelimer had not fallen at decimum he recalled his troops out of sardinia mustered what remained of the vandals locally bought the services of moors and finally in middecember offered battle on the approach route to carthage but weakened by recent losses and in any case enervated by a century of civilization the vandals were no match for belisarius the byzantine cavalry chargedand swept them away the weather was warm even for middecember the doglords moonchildren played the same part in the final battle as they had played at decimum leaving toks huns in support of belisariuss cavalry they went forward as advance scouts on the eve of battle and in the following night ranged far and wide to seek out any survivors who might try to form pockets of resistance necroscope the lost years vol ii while radu himself sought someone or something else a ferenczy was here he could smell him disguised as a vandal or a moor or whatever a ferenczy was or had been here who why how radu couldnt say he could have been here for fifty years or a hundred he might even have stood off and witnessed the conquest of these parts by the vandals but hearing of the battle at decimum and perhaps fearing a roman reconquest he had come down from his high place to join in the fighting or simply to observe and so know the result at first hand but which high place for radu knew that a ferenczy no less than a drakul and far more than any doglord must have his aerie radu had checked charts of the land around sure enough there was a peak mightier than any starside stack near zaghounan why from up there at night looking east through his vampires eyes and employing wamphyri intelligence senses more than the usual five this ferenczy would have known or even seen the approach and landing of belisariuss fleet be sure he would have known that radu was part of that fleet and cowled against the last rays of sunlight in the evening after the battle while his men ranged abroad so radu had scoured the smoking field of combat like some strange carrion dog he found some that might have been the ferenczys some that seemed dead but yet moaned or were full of weird creeping motion and showed the men he had taken with him how to deal with them hun scavengers were also in the field perhaps they thought it odd that radus escort were beheading and burning dead men but they said nothing later radu went up with a lieutenant and some thralls into the peak near zaghounan this rearing knoll was or had been on the very border of vandal territory with berber lands to the west in short it was neutral territory nomansland near the top they found earthworks and ancient fortifications and within the mounds and ramps an aerie the place was only recently deserted there was evidence of an urgent departure the aerie itselftook the doglord back more than four hundred years to starside in a now alien world it was unmistakable that ultimate spire of the mountain like a great fang thrusting for the sky no windows faced east just sunbleached rock all hollow within and tunnelled beneath with roots going down into darkness radu and his men descended spiralling stone steps there were vast echoing chambers down there and mighty stone vats all unfinished this ferenczy would have bred monsters here which gave the doglord pause the time might come when he must breed them too a thrall lookout called down a cloud of dust was approaching out brian lumley of the west it was a par ty of camelriders berbers heading this way radu let them come and as dusk fell emerged from a jumble of rocks behind them where they climbed a frequently used track the berbers had three beautiful black girls trussed like chickens doubtless for trading with this unknown fled ferenczy radu traded death for them but not until he had tortured the berbers to find out more about the ferenczy waldemar ferrenzig was his name a german well and so were the vandals but they had been here ten or more years before waldemar this the berbers knew from their fathers before them so it seemed that radus earlier information was only partly right sixtyfive years ago perhaps only a few years before radu himself had arrived in the moldavian heights hun invaders had driven this waldemar this son of belos fheropzis out of his moldavian keep under the assumed germanic name of ferrenzig he had been accepted by the vandals and allowed to settle here presumably he was rich for hed been able to trade with the berbers and buy their friendship but now that the romans were back he had fled again hah but it pleased the doglord to believe that the ferenczy had fled from him and perhaps on both occasions and so he was a cowardly scummy ferenczy like his ancestors in starside before him and more recent forebears in this world well it wasnt over yet their tracks might cross again except the next time radu would have better luck he questioned the terrified girls they were princesses they said daughters of a nomad sheik they had been stolen by the berbers for ransom or trading that last at least was as radu had suspected he kissed all three gave them the berber camels and sent them on their way waldemar ferrenzig would have dealt ill with them wherefore contrary to his nature radu dealt well with them any other time he would have used them and fed them to his pups the doglord would have gone back with belisarius to constantinople to witness the generals triumph but already rumours were circulating as to his nature it was ad and the mediterranean was broad and deep radu determined to be a pirate for a while but in carthage where the roman fleet mustered and provisioned prior to setting sail for byzantium he learned more of this waldemar ferrenzig a fisherman told him how a ship had sailed by night from tunis only weeks after the destruction of the vandal army and how a great dark lord the commander of this numidian vessel had tried to necroscope the lost years vol ii recruit him as a crewmember the fisherman had seen charts he knew his sea lanes the ship would be heading north for sardinia past corsica and so to the mainland so by now a ferenczy was back on the mediterraneans northern seaboard perhaps heading for those same moldavian mountains beloved of his father belos and his grandfather nonari the gross before him or maybe waldemar had determined to become a pirate too in which case radu might yet come across him during his own voyaging and maybe not the first night out from carthage radu called a mist up out of the sea a vampire mist like slime against the skins of belisariuss crews by the time his mist dispersed the doglord had sailed away and now he commanded a fleet of ten ships in radus memory the past speeded up as if a wind were turning the pages of history sequences of events became blurred they began to overlap he was like a dying man recounting his life in the moments before true death that was a thought that disturbed him even in his sleep for indeed he might well be dying if the seeds of the plague were still alive in him and working on his vampire flesh but the pages of history were still turning and he couldnt ignore them the vandals were no more their kingdom destroyed forever thus one of the doglords bloodoaths had been fulfilled at least but again he had had enough of human commanders and it was time he moved on to other things for a hundred and twenty years radu was a corsair a seawolf his standard was a wolfs head against a full moon time and time again he replaced his aging ships with the vessels of traders and their escorts or vanquished ships of war sent out to hunt him down but he lost ships too till finally his ten were down to three then in ad near the island of rhodes he was engaged by a fleet of arab warships out of alexandria two of his vessels went up in smoke and flames they sank just before nightfall radu was left to limp off to crete to make repairs and finally on to sicily by which time he had known that the mediterranean was no longer a safe hunting ground islam was now a power and the doglord would do well to look to his future but in any case he had had enough of sea battles on land it was one thing to engage in handtohand combat when with a shield and sword or tooth and claw hed be the equal of any ten normal adversaries but on the sea it was an entirely different thing to have your enemy stand off and use his hurlingengines to lob sizzling balls of fire at youto stand on a burning brian lumley deck in the heat and the reek and feel your ship sinking under youwhat was that for a fair fight not that he had ever cared much for fairness for a hundred and sixty years radu was a bandit chief in the mountains of corsica from which he raided on the coastal towns and villages a wolf he was impossible to track over the rugged terrain and who would want to track him none who set out after him ever returned and so he was first in a long line of corsican outlaws but the saracens were still coming muslim pirates out of sicily quickly became a far greater scourge than the doglord eventually he must move on radu and his small band stole a ship and sailed north for the land of the lombards landed and loped east for bulgar territories and down to the danube which he knew so well and at once up into the carpathians when he discovered how fierce were the bulgars ah but the drakuls had discovered it too as the myths and legends of bulgar grandams at their hearthfires were wont to confirm how two hundred years ago brave ancestors had sought out the obours the wampyrs in their mountain castles and hounded them from the land the obours were bloodsucking creatures who lived on bairns and virgins and could shape themselves as bats to flee into the night though some of them had escaped in this fashion their thralls and odalisques had been discovered in hiding hissing like snakes they had been crucified and burned to ashes and the castles of the obours had been razed to ruins well good but in his heart of hearts radu knew that the drakuls themselves were still alive their power may have been destroyed for the moment at least but they had survived for there was a pain in him which would not go away until they had suffered the true death preferably at his hand when times were quiet he sent out spies to learn the way of things and as always he stayed alert for word of the worst of his olden enemies the ferenczys for he assumed that waldemar would produce offspring huh it would be a further fourteen decades before he heard of him and his again and meanwhile as ever the world was in flux it seemed no time at all before magyars occupied the fertile western plains since they were horsemen the doglord felt safe in the mountains safe and bored but while the magyars were on the plains radu would stay in the heights until sixty years later when in a dream he saw the next great battle in which these savage horsemen would suffer their most decisive defeat if it should come to pass the plains and horseshoe mountains and the danube itself would be up for the necroscope ttu lost years vol ii taking and still radu considered these lands his own as he had from the beginning it was sufficient to send him and his pups north to skirt the plains then west into germany where they joined otto the firsts forces at lechfeld in the year then radus oneiromantic dreams were seen to be accurate in every detail loaded down with loot their mounts exhausted the magyars were swatted like flies offering little or no resistance their blood mingled with their spilled gold on a steaming field of battle and when the fighting was over their leaders were executed to a man radu and his band were mercenary foot soldiers paid off but remembering other payments not to mention harshly enforced repayments he retreated at once back into the east back to the mountains where a few years later he learned of a great boyar with a castle in the khorvaty north of moldavia a man called valdemar fuhrenzig now surely this must be that same waldemar who had fled from the romans or from radu in africa that son of belos pheropzis and grandson of nonari the gross ferenczy aye and radus immemorial enemy and a bloodoath still outstanding butin the khorvaty east of the mountains a friend of kievan russia then this valdemar with an aerie within its borders a boyar he would have land and men and probably the protection of the russian prince and what was radu but a bandit in the hills and if the doglord had knowledge of this valdemar presumably valdemar had knowledge of him damnation there was no putting it off it was time radu was on his way again piracy it had had its good points and could have again anyway the saracens were in radus debt a debt of blood and it was high time he collected when he learned from travellers how men of western christendom were fighting saracens on what the arabs now considered their own great lake in ligurian and tyrrenhian waters the doglord was finally decided and knew what he must do a further hundred years of sea battles radu was with the byzantines when they took back crete and cyprus from the saracens he was a pirate out of pisa when corsica sardinia and the balearics fell he was rich on arab gold beyond dreams of avarice and a legendary seawolfwhen in fortune went against him and his boat was attacked by the saracens off syracuse fished from the sea burned gouged and halfdrowned taken hostage by the brian lumky saracens who had learned to respect him he was held for ransom in ascalon for five of his longest years but who was there to pay for his freedom no one knew or would accept him eventually his jailers must weary of feeding him and simply dispose of him also his prison was thought to be inescapable and in any case he was in no fit state to even try for an escape thus he spent the time healing himself until the venetian naval victory of when in the panic and hysteria of the time he finally broke jail having learned the muslim tongue and indeed looking like a long loping arab radu a man alone now took to the deserts and the high ground and made his way north for years he fished the sea of galilee he became a holy man a seer who read the future in dreams in the monastery on the great peak at talat musa eventually the real holy men were no more radu had a new lair and by night was leader of a fine pack while in the daylight thick monkish robes kept him from the sun for long and long his leech continued to heal him he had suffered that time off syracuse and his convalescence had its ups and downs time sped by as ever the whole world was at war the fourth crusade came and went and became part of the past however recent territorial as every lord of the wamphyri before him radu had adopted arabia and adapted as best possible to its arid climate with the coming of the mongols however it was time for him to shuck off his illfitting monkish robes again the doglord went to war this time for two reasons one the mongols were a threat certainly if they succeeded in their expansion he would be uprooted again and two with the extermination of the assassins and the fall of baghdad in rumour and evil dreams had forewarned of at least one wamphyri mercenary among the asiatics fighting for hulegu his name was fereng the black fereng ferenczy more likely but who waldemar it seemed unlikely for by radus lights he was a coward if he was still alive some blood or eggson then but what matter he was a ferenczy and that was all that mattered yet radus dreams had hinted of more than one lord and in more than one dream he had seen a batlike figure falling out of the sky towards the field of battle what a drakul a ferenczy and a drakul together on the side of the mongols well why not it had happened before more than a thousand years ago in necroscope the lost years vol ii starside and then as now the pact had been sealed in order to face down an even greater foe shaitan the unborn orperhaps this time it was to gang up on a weaker one radu tried to work it out what if this ferenczy and this drakul had both been established in the wallachian mountains as they were known now news of mongol attacks and overwhelming victories in the east would have reached them even as it had reached radu and the brilliance the sheer ruthlessness of the mongol cavalry armies would have seemed to make them invincible surely the best way to ensure survival must be to join with them at least until the tides of war had once more swept by thus fereng the black and this unknown drakul had themselves reasoned but he knew they had got it wrong radus oneiromancy had forecast a turning point in mongol fortunes which would be realized at ain jalut in cairo the mameluke sultan was massing his welltrained army radu joined them near jerusalem and in the last days of august marched north with them on ain jalut radutherestof his historyhis awakening the battle at ain jalut but there are fights and fights and there are massacres the sultan qutuz was totally committed earlier receiving a mongol envoy who demanded his submission qutuz had flown into a rage and had the envoy executed now he must win else disembowelling were the least of his torments the mongol forces were split between several fronts many hundreds of miles apart their cavalry army riding south on ain jalut numbered only ten thousand led by kitbuga a christian turk it was outnumbered more than ten to one by the mamelukes moreover the mamelukes had knowledge of the mongol advance and of the territory they set up an ambush in foothills flanking a fertile plain the plain was an historic invasion route not far from nazareth to ensure that the mongols would come this way a party of berbers was deployed on camels to attract their attention and so lure them into the mameluke trap ain jalut the egyptian commander of radus group told them where they hid in the eveningshadowed hills looking down on the plain the spring of goliath goliath was a giant of a man a warrior who was brought down by a stripling boy this time we reverse the process this time we are the mighty and the stripling in the shape of these mongols is the pagan enemy of the faith but this time he shall not prevail the trap worked where the valley narrowed between steep hillsides the berbers dismounted behind ditches and old earthworks turned and defended themselves with bows and long spears meanwhile the mamelukes came swarming down out of the foothills and engaged the mongols from the flanks and a reserve group of cavalry and infantry as strong as the entire mongol force came sweeping from behind the hills to cut off any retreat radu and his monks despite that they were on foot in the lower necroscope the lost years vol ii foothills were among the first to engage the milling mongol army which was work they might have been born for to hack and hew among that melee of reeling astonished flesh the raging the shouting and screaming the blood of hamstrung horses and skewered men the scarlet deluge erupting into the green valley to turn it red the last rays of the sun were striking the western mountains as the mongol army fell before the mameluke onslaught in the twilight before the night when the sunlight had faded entirely kitbugas screams were his last when he was captured and quartered after that no birds sang over that field of blood only a cloud of kites on high biding their time and wolves in the hills waiting which was when radu and his party went among the fallen it was the same as in africa that time radu knew what he was looking for and wasted no time his men found life in bodies where there should be no life and stilled it with fire and steel and aye there were a good many thralls even a lieutenant or two among the dead then a strange thing though not so strange to the doglord in a gulley between steepsided spurs of the hills on the northern flank a pocket of mistwhere no mist should be he sent out a vampire probe his mentalism into the mist and felt its texture the way it clung and knew it for what it was the sun was down now radu took two lieutenants two pups with him into the gulley into the heart of the mist and found it already thinning but sensing a fierce presence he climbed a rock above the level of the vampire mist and looked up there on the sheer wall of the cliff moving like a lizard towards the high rim a manlike figure except adhering to the naked rock in that weird fashion this was no ordinary man wamphyri but who not a drakul surely for since the sun was down a drakul would have transformed himself for flight a ferenczy then fereng the black fleeing the consequences of a lost cause cowardly treacherous spawn of nonari the gross treacherous aye like all of them before him then in the next moment radu a lieutenant called to him cautiously out of the thinning mist the doglord had been on the point of hurling a question after the climber who a question the ferenczy would not have been able to resist it would have surprised him and radu would have read the answer writ large in the confusion of his mind doubtless confirming his suspicion cursing because that time was past and the stranger had vanished over the rim radu got down from the rock and loped to his men gathered near the foot of the cliff what is it he barked then stood in stark amaze for it was brian lurnley necroscope the lost years vol ii obvious what it was treacherous hed called the fleeing ferenczy and now the full extent of that treachery could be seen a body a man all bloodied and broken but not dead lay in a cluster of rocks where tomorrows sun must doubtless find himif radu had not found him first and the doglord knew him remembered him at a glance of course karl drakul an original starside lord no less than radu himself but less than radu now certainly he lay in an ungainly tangle sprawled on his back like a spider struck by a stone and even as radu watched so the unconscious drakuls naked body commenced a complex metamorphosis thick webs of rubbery grey flesh like the hairy membranous airfoils of a bat which joined his arms to his trunk down to his thighs and also formed an elastic v between his legs shrank back into him and as his pipestem limbs thickened so his body firmed out and put on a little extra weight and oh this was karl all right the fleshy lips and bald dome of a head the purple orbits of his deepsunken eyes the squat nose showing only too clearly its convolutions and in the lolling cave of karls mouth the split tongue of a lying lord of the wamphyri and those teeth and those hands like a beasts claws radus lieutenants had seen something like this before in their master at that but never to this extent one thing to instantly develop the aspect and mannerisms of a great wolf but another entirely to emulate a great bat they drew back a pace muttered and glanced at each other but radu stepped forward and snarling said he was preparing for flight when the other bastard struck and cut him down so much for pacts and with an oath and a kick he turned karl drakul facedown in the bloodied dust then the worst of it was seen the sword slash along this undead creatures spine and the ragged flaps of flesh wrenched aside to expose the knuckles of the spine itself they were ribbed warped notched those bones with grooves and small drilled holes where something had clung like an alien organ karls vampire leech radu knew which fereng the black had torn out and probably eaten one has escaped radu told his men then i saw him on the cliff face climbing like a lizard the pair of them drakul and ferenczy they came together to side with the mongols and join the bloody butchery for the hell of it possibly to befriend this marauding asiatic scum and save their own miserable skins probably because they knew i was at liberty in the socalled holy landah very likely but when the battle went against them they tried to make their escape the ferenczymaybe he was injured and unable to transform but he could not bear the idea of being left behind while the drakul made a clean getaway or perhaps they had argued whichever while the drakul was preparing for flight fereng the black cut him down and tore out his leech good for it saves me the trouble karl drakuls shirt breeches and cloak were nearby radu brought them together and piled them on the shuddering shape of an exvampire lord but when he would have struck fire karls no longer scarlet eyes snapped open turning his head this way and that he saw his predicament and so he gurgled his forked tongue flopping in his mouth it is you radu well better you than that other dog the one who brought me to this time is short radu told him doubtless therell be an uproar when you burn the sultans troops could find us at any time and i would not want them to see the drakul managed a ghastly sharptoothed grin anonymity is synonymous with longevity radu nodded but mine i fear not yours wid you make it ah ahhh quick karl squirmed a very little then lay still panting if youll answer me truly ask away but quickly im a husk drainedi have no leechi hold my pain at bay but not for long it is quiteunbearable my screams such as they would be would doubtless attract attention radu nodded in his grim fashion but if you do scream it will be quicker still very well lets get to it who is he now fereng the black karl answered before that his name was faethor greatgrandson of nonari the gross ferenczy andhes a one to watch out for that seems obvious radu said how many of you remain wamphyri drakuls first drakuls myself only liar what of egon radu looked deep into karls eyes and when he would turn them away grabbed his large fleshy ears to hold his head still karl could not resist him radus eyes penetrated into his very mind even his soul if hed had one and ah he lives radu let go karls ears sat back on his haunches but no eggsons nor bloodsons not yet at least perhaps when he learns of this he will in tile moment of my passing you willcommunicate he will know we drakuls are special that ah ahhh that way now the ferenczys radu growled how many karls eyes were starting out and grey sweat oozed on his face and bald head i think i want to die now he said i am in total agreement radu answered but i want to know how brian lumley many ferenczys do you not want me to know for after all it was a ferenczy did this to you he could have finished it but left you to fry in tomorrows noon sun and even these rocks would not have sheltered you then three that i know of karl coughed out the words waldemar faethors father had two sons the one is gone and only this bastard faethor remains but he too has two sons called thibor and janos ask me no more my time is come what do you know about them faethors sons you are cruel hah ridiculous of course you are as am i we are wamphyri but still in these circumstances you are cruel no radu denied it they were cruel the ferenczys to me and mine and now to you now tell me what i would know and all of this is at an end you ahhhhh you must know that you are damned yes but you first and your brother and most of all the ferenczys now tell me thibor is faethors eggson a fierce wallach even before faethor took him hes now a voevod for the wallachian and russian princes janos is faethors szgany bloodson he has been a corsair ever since the great crusade as for oh aahohhh faethor himself he is in thick with the mongols look for him there there wherever they are it is all i know but whatever you do ah ar aakillhimforme no radu shook his wolfish head for myself he stood up now hold still he stepped astride karl and stood on his hands then signalled to his lieutenants one of which carried a curved saracen sword his other man lay on karls lower body to hold it in place while the one with the sword raised it on high it was all very quick and ooohhhaaarrrr karls great cry commenced but got no further his head flew free then his lower trunk burst open and the man who lay on him was tossed aside the doglord jumped nimbly clear of the confusion and the lieutenant with the bloodied sword backed off but before matters could further deteriorate radu got down on one knee and struck sparks to silk all went up in flames his men piled dead branches but from a distance because karls uproar was monstrous mindless leprous tentacles lashed the night as at first his metamorphic flesh refused to succumb for despite that his leech was no more karls flesh had been wamphyri for long and long he willingly gave way to his agony and passed beyond it but his body would not until the heat became too much for it and the great twining anemone of alien flesh began to melt then in a little while necroscope the lost years vol ii all that remained was the smoke stench crackling and popping and the doglords smile was grim and terrible as the commotion died down and he approached and warmed his hands by the fire of karl drakuls passing for by his reckoning karl should be happy hed lasted sixteen hundred years after all no mean feat not even for a lord of the wamphyri that was the way of it at ain jalut radu slept on but now he was like a man between dream and waking caught in the limbo that precedes reality except for him his dreams were reality memories out of a past that continued to direct his future and the pages of history were still turning large contingents of qutuzs army commenced a withdrawal into egypt and radu and his party went with them for his part in the defeat of the mongols he was offered citizenship mameluke protection land if he desired to stay he told qutuz that he would make his home in tunisia in an ancient redoubt which he knew to exist high in the mountains the sultan warned him that tunisia was now hafsid territory and in the hinterland taureg the tauregs were notorious dogs of the desert who could not be trusted by any man if radu wished it however qutuz would arrange an escort to see him to his chosen destination for there were bandits on the land and pirates in the sea and this was no fit time for an honest man to be journeying abroad indicating his pups radu told qutuz he had dogs of his own but he would appreciate an escort nonetheless as for radus plan since he could not return to wallachia or to pirating or anywhere north of the mediterranean where the mongols were still a power despite that they were on the wane instead he would try his luck in africa the african routes were opening up and radu had heard of fortunes in gold and ivory and slaves and where theres great wealth theres also the need to protect it also he felt limited in his wanderings the world was a big place and this was his chance to explore a large part of it given fine arab horses by qutuz radu and his men spent a sixmonth taming them getting them used to their new masters no easy task the horses sensed the wolf in radu and were reluctant to accept him but finally they succumbed then it was time to head west his seaescort disembarked radu his men and horses on the african coast south of tunis the doglord had been here before of course with belisarius he knew where he was going and how to get necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley there radus pack was made up of just three lieutenants and fifteen thralls they looked very grand in the ornate saddles of their white arab horses protected from the sun beneath silktasselled canopies in their black pantaloons and flowing goldfringed robes of black silk with their curved swords in jewelled scabbards and their fingers dripping gold they must surely be the emissaries of some rich eastern sultan or turkic king so thought a large scouting party of black brown and yellowclad nomads who had seen them land from camouflaged observation points what the nomads had not seen was how fierce were the eyes of these rich strangers burning above their heavilyveiled lower faces evening was turning to night as radus escort saluted him and set sail shadows were already shifting on the landand some of them moved most oddly radu smiled in his grim fashion now we have a second escort he passed the message on to his men be at the ready but make no sudden move lets see what this is about and who these people are zaghounan was twentyfive miles inland to the west after twelve miles when it was night and a halfmoon had risen and the ground turned hard and stony radu made his camp though a watch was scarcely necessary he posted a guard he knew that if he did not and if his silent escort took it as a sign of weakness or stupidity and decided to attack then he would have a fight on his hands since these were probably local people it would be a bad start it was important that radu be allowed to set up his base here as waldemar ferrenzig before him in the ruins on the mount then when he was properly established he would strike out into the heart of africa itself but as radu sat with his men around their fires reports began to come in from his watchdogs who were ranging the land around their escort outnumbered them by a handful they had camels and some ponies and were probably tauregs even so they could still be local in any case they were bandits and they were gradually closing ranks encircling the camp radu decided to preempt matters loping out a little way into the rough land around he stood tall threw back his head and howled long and loud to the halfmoon and when the echoes had died away he called out i know you are there you desert wolves but as you see i am a wolf myself and all my men so if you want to die this night why keep us waiting we have nothing against dying but if you are merely curious and if you would talk i have nothing against that either the night is chill and we have warm fires your chief and his guard would be welcome so come forwardunless you are cowards i am one man as you see do not fear for when you walk with radu you are safe a minute passed and another then shadows grew up out of the night three of them veiled cloaked darkonly their eyes shone but never as yellow as the doglords he met them held his arms wide in peaceful greeting escorted them into his camp to a fire they sat threw back their hoods showed their faces blacks with some arab in them not tauregs but a breed apart and who are you radu inquired you know my tongue we know many tongues their leader the tallest of them answered this land has had many visitors a great many conquerors he shrugged they come and go but weare a tribe we were always here and were you here more than seven hundred years ago when the germans the vandals came and when the romans under belisarius destroyed them the other was taken aback you know history stranger i was not here no but my ancestors were numidians berbers and blacks out of the southern forests and savannahs we have something of all of them in us we are nomads but not tauregs he spat into the fire one of my ancestors was here too the doglord told him he had my name radu and he fought for rome killing vandals and where are the vandals now gone forever but you and i are still here i think it would be good if after tonight we were still here perhaps said the other but you are travelling in the wrong direction there is a mountain and we hold it dear you must skirt it keep well away else we may not befriends any longer i know the place radu nodded it is my destination again the other was taken aback you know it does your ancestor speak to you across the centuries then does he guide your feet and did i hear you say that his name wasradu indeed a man like a great wolf i have seen representations of him his characteristics are evident in me his descendant but does he speak to me alas no but i am a scholar and he left a legend and writings i have learned about him in my journeys he was here in this place and upon your mountain i think in the long ago which is why i would visit and perhaps stay wait they argued briefly in a tongue he didnt know but obviously about him and then their leader reached out and tore away the strip of black silk from his mouth radu had kept it there because of his wolfishness which was pronounced especially at night and under the moon and brian lumley ahkkr said the three as one man as the doglords men stepped up close and felt for their swords but he waved them away and said now say what is this stand up said the leader himself standing radu did so and the other saw his height as if for the first time now smile said the visitor and radu showed him that wolfs smile in a grin that made him look even more the monstrous dog at which his visitors shrank a little and their leader said will you come with us where will you trust me well would he or wouldnt he butso far he read no harm in them only astonishment and more than a little awe so finally he shrugged and said so be it mounted on his horse alone of his party and side by side with the leader of the nomads and flanked by his men radu rode out into the night they rode west direct for the mount zaghounan as the peak rose up to blanket the sky they skirted its southern flank to the winding ramp of access and all along the way no word was uttered then they were there and the ruins stood stark against the moon just as i read of it said radu this is the place it is as if i remember it indeed it is the place said his guide get down from your horse and see here the party dismounted and the nomad leader showed radu a great rock part of the mountains fang outcropping from the desiccated earth he struck fire to a torch jammed it in the loose soil and by its flaring light they gazed upon the face carved in the rock radus face grinning even the doglord was startled but in a moment he knew what this was now let me guess he said your people are rare among the men of this land you are tribal nomads aye but probably a matriarchy you revere your queens your princesses and seven centuries ago in this place three sisters princesses mothers of your race were set free from bondage by the man on the rock yes yesr the leader of the nomads whispered his name was radu and then he tortured and killed the men who held the three princesses captive then he gave them camels to ride back to their people and sent them on their way but first the other breathlessly pressed him eh radu cocked his head first there was something else he did this radu ah he kissed all threelike a blessing is that what you mean necroscope the lost yean vol ii indeed said the nomad and took radus hand and kissed it a blessing no less than this he stepped back and said that radu that grandfather of your grandfathers was the saviour of our race the three princesses were the mothers of our mothers this is our legend that they returned with a man who worked stone and described to him their saviour whose likeness was then chiselled into the rock since when this is like a holy place or perhaps a place that has been waiting it need wait no longer radu said i shall live here if it please you it would please my mother said the other oh she can trace her line back to one of those sisters that your ancestor saved without him she would not have life nor any of us then all is well said radu i would bring my mother to see you the nomad was eagerness itself now when we have made this place worthy radu told him but meanwhile give her this tell her it was made for me by a sultan of the egypts which was true enough and he took a golden ring from his smallest finger its crest when the nomad turned it into the torchlight was the head of a howling wolf radu never did scathe among the people of the rock who claimed all the land and watering holes for twenty miles around rather he befriended them and from time to time protected them from other nomadic tribes and tauregs alike and in their turn they showed him the routes south into niger and chad and southwest into the rich kingdoms of mali and the hausa traders he took slaves for trading hired himself out to protect caravans along the trade routes was rarely to house on the rock of zaghounan the sun was ever a curse of course but the doglord took precautions whenever possible he travelled by night sleeping out the days in the inner heart of his great black tent whose walls were thickly draped mercifully he had never been as susceptible to sunlight as the great majority of wamphyri lords in his various ventures radu covered many thousands of miles by horse and camel mainly the latter and learned all the saharan routes from wargla to taghaza ghana gao timbuktu and beyond it took years even decades but it was an adventure and earned him a fortune in gold in he organized an endless relay of escorts for king mansa musa on his pilgrimage to mecca and was in control of eleven hundred men to fight off tauregs and other bandits along the twothousandmiles route from kumbi saleh to augila where he handed over to the mamelukes paid off in such gold that he couldnt necroscope the lost yean vol ii brian lumley carry it all still he knew it was a pittance to mansa musa later in cairo the spendingpower of the kings retinue in solid gold was so great as to depress the local currency but this was one of the doglords last great ventures he had lived too long in one place hed become too prominent the people of the rock had grown wary of him and during one of his long absences they even went so far as to deface his portrait on zaghounan the doglords dreams had been bad for long and long his oneiromancy frequently a gift of great benefit now seemed a curse he couldnt go to his bed without recurrent nightmares plaguing him nightmares about plague famine blood and death his death or at least his suspension from life once waking with a cry he tore the amber bauble that he wore about his neck loose and hurled it away he had dreamed of the bauble but in place of the fly trapped in its golden core he had seen himself himself but the merest husk of the man he was now sleeping but not dead in a resin grave radu paid off half of his pups there were a great many of them moonchildren all if not actual werewolves but they would get by if notwell too bad some of them dispersed into egypt others the mediterranean the ones he kept however had a special mission to buy large quantities of resin from the greeks and the peoples of the northern mediterranean shores and bring it to their master wherever he determined to settle he gave them money to buy ships and sent them about their business then the doglord and his coterie went down into sousse where he purchased a fine vessel his plan was a simple one as always to buy himself back into those old territories which he had always considered his own for the horseshoe mountains were hungarian now and radu believed that with his wealth he could sway the authorities and become a boyar and a power there in sousse however the atmosphere was strange he sensed unease and panicky stirrings the first real intimations that his oneiromantic nightmares were about to come true it was the late autumn of the year ad and the black death was visiting itself upon the mediterranean ships out of sicily sardinia corsica were being refused entry into the ports but plague ships had already run aground the rats that infested them had swarmed to dry land local people were falling ill developing hideous black pustules dying radu was immune to human diseases by virtue of his vampire leechso he thought likewise his men should be immune through his blood yet even before setting sail for the adriatic and hungary some of his men fell sick and radu expelled them from his company it had been the same in sunsidestarside some fifteen hundred years ago even before radu was wamphyri if a man contracted leprosy the szgany expelled him this new disease this hideous black death seemed so much like leprosy inasmuch as vampires were not immune to it maybe even radu himself wamphyri was not immune to it radus dreams returned to plague him but now they were more than mere dreams in them he saw a great rock rising from a canopy of trees but the climate was cold northern in the true sense of the word he dreamed of a den in that high place and of a massive stone coffin within the den which he knew was his and meanwhile news was finding its way ashore from clean ships the ottoman turk was dying in his thousands the mediterranean islands and even marseilles on the northern mainland were pestholes the plague was spreading into bulgaria serbia wallachia and hungary it advanced day by day and ate up entire towns and villages it raged out of control like a monstrous brushfire blown by a relentless wind out of the east suddenly hungary was out of the question and the sooner radu sailed for whichever destination the better at least thered be no plague aboard his ship the plague came from the east radu sailed west for barcelona in aragon at the entrance to the harbour plague inspectors came aboard the doglord paid a heavy bribe was cleared for landing and sold his vessel at a great loss he purchased horses carts caravans everything at a premium for plaguefear was at its height and set out northwest for the bay of biscay and english bordeaux but his arrival in aragon had not gone unnoticed nor had he failed to observe a ship out of sicily whose veiled secretive closelyescorted master was given an especially difficult time by the dedicated port officials and doubtless paid a crippling bribe for the privilege of being allowed ashore indeed just seeing that ship sensing a definite aura about it that had nothing to do with any plague or at least not the black death radu was keenly interested so much so that he sent a lieutenant to follow this sicilian party with instructions to join up with him later and report on his findings except his man never did join up with him later nor ever returned the journey between ports was three hundred miles it took thirteen days and exhausted radus animals also en route the doglord was given a rude reminder that he wasnt the only one determined to prolong the centuried bloodfeud with other wamphyri factions he had halfexpected it ever since seeing that ominousseeming ship in barcelona but still under the circumstances it came as a surprise it was january and in toulouse they were beginning to bring out their dead carts loaded with the bodies of plague victims came trundling out of the central district to block the approach roads necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley which determined radu to skirt the town but in the confusion as he turned his small caravan off the main highway into a forested region suddenly he was under attack what they were was obvious vampires as for their leader wamphyri how it happened radu was seated in the one small boxcoach hed been able to purchase the sky was grey overcast a drizzly rain fell a ground mist swirled up from the forest floor and there wasthis feeling the forest way was narrow and radus coach was at the head of his column a plaguecart had sunk to its axles in the mud and as radus driver manoeuvred his vehicle around it ho great do these words totally unexpected seemed to burst in radus brain we almost met in ainjalutsome ninety years ago you were fortunate that time for i had suffered a trivial hurt alas this time you are unfortunate for im fit and well but your injury mil not be so small the identity of the sender rang clear as a bell in radus mind that ferenczy last seen lizarding up the sheer wall of a gorge in the socalled holy land but so close at hand closer than you think someone was right outside radus coach he heard the neighing of a horse yanked open the curtains and tried to get his sword from its scabbard but trapped in the close confines of his box he knew that his life was in jeopardy he was the perfect target to the right the plague cart blocked his exit and to the left a great black horse pranced in the trees its rider cowled tall in the saddle and dressed in black head to toe leaned forward drove his slender sword through the doglords driver and kicking the howling thrall out of his way he clambered from his horse up onto the drivers platform radus door was halfopen but the bole of a tree blocked the way he yelped for his men the ferenczy looked inside through the view slit and saw him and laughed from a mouth like a mantrap and what use to cut you he shouted you would only heal why i might as well stab dead men eh with which he leaned down and speared the bloated belly of a corpse in the plague cart and drew out his sword all slimed then radu shrank down as he saw what was in the others mind and oh ha ha ha cried that one his eyes ablazeas he drove his wet blade through the view slit at an awkward angle yet still managed to stab radu in his side the doglord stifled his pain drew a knife thrust it again and again through the view slit but the ferenczy was gone only his sword thrummed there where hed left it jammed in the slit radus men came swarming too late the ferenczy was up onto his horse others joined him out of the mist they wheeled about and were gone and only faethors mocking mindvoice came back to taunt may you rot slowly and your death cause you awesome agonies radu lykan then at the last when even your wamphyri flesh crumbles remember who did this to you the ghazi warrior faethor my ferenczy forebears are finally appeased radu commanded his leech heal meand immediately collapsed shuddering to the floor of his coach which served to drag the sword from his side but his shudders werent from the pain which he had already stilled rather they sprang from the sure knowledge that indeed the plague lived in him now and the torment of knowing who had put it there without his being able to return that favour but mostly it was the uncertainty of his vampire parasites ability to drive it out nevertheless ferenczy he sent a snarl but no hint of hurt from his telepathic mind if it were at all possible even if it meant trying a little harder you should have made sure i was dead this time around too late for that now though so run as far and as fast as you can and hide where you will it will make no difference the next time you lay eyes on this great doghell sink his teeth in your throat and rip it out be sure then he let go and lolled and shuddered the rest of the way to bordeaux the rest of radus journey to a dreamedof but as yet unrecognized destination the great rock rising from the trees was a nightmare of several anxieties the wound in his side healed less readily than the norm and he began to experience an unaccustomed malaise a weariness springing from deep within as if a hidden part of him fought an unequal battle and he believed he knew which part several of his men took ill in bordeaux he gave them some money sent them on their way then hired a ship and again fled the plague for england other men fell sick aboard radu had them put out of their misery disposed of them in the sea london in march seemed a quagmire of mud mist and stench if ever a place was ripe for the plague london was it but it certainly wasnt the high northern territory of the doglords prophetic dreams he made arrangements for a brief stay in the best possible accommodations made known his location telepathically so that those parties hed dispatched from north africa in search of greek resin would know where to find him studied maps of the times until at last he found what he believed to be the refuge he sought then disguised as the retinue of a rich political refugee from france his party headed north and in newcastle boarded another ship bound for gascony which of course wasnt radus destination no sooner out necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley of port he took command of the vessel sailed north and eventually wrecked on the wild coast north of edinburgh the healthy crew members became part of radus pack strengthening it and the party in its entirety became ostensibly the retinue of a rich boyar out of hungary at last however briefly radu seemed to have outdistanced the black death but his strength was fast failing and he knew he must soon retire to a lair go down into the resin and give his leech a chance to combat the disease within him without the complications and additional effort of keeping up with his external physical activities his mediterranean pups found him they wrecked their ships in the moray firth joined radu where he camped and recuperated in the wild wooded country under the cairngorm mountains and this was it these mountains were the great stone of his dreams rising from the woodlands of the misty spey valley radus people became gypsies now all their rich robes were put aside for rags their golden rings came off their fingers and out of their ears and through the spring summer and autumn of and all through they guarded the foothills and found routes up into the high places to the massive labyrinth of caves which they had discovered there their labours were enormous on the doglords behalf but there was game in the land local clans not too far afield and loners or people fleeing the cities who were wont to come this way so that provisions were never scarce and by the autumn of radus lair was ready oh it was a rude place be sure but secret and high and his moonchildren and their children would always be here to tend him through his long sleep a long long sleep aye of more than six slow centuries eventually it was the summer of and as the creeping evil of the black death tightened its grip even in the sparsely populated highlands the doglord could no longer deny that his parasite was losing its and his fight for survival and so he went down into the resin but that was men and this was now and as the conscious world called to him so radus dreams of other times receded stirring though it was mainly his mind mat quickened he knew his confinement and felt the oppression of dense glutinous everthickening resin weighing on him thud now what was that the sound had not been threatening at any rate his own heartbeat perhaps maybe that of some other not bonnie jeans for it wasnt her time he hadnt called for her whose thenor whats he drifted a while his thoughts gradually clearing thud radu was awake now or awake as he had ever been in six hundred years at least his mind stirred consciously under his control if not his physical body and he knew that from now on he must stay awake and that because he was out of practice it would have to be a question of mind over matter selfhypnosis to achieve resurgent reliable and continuous mobility activity in a body wasted and atrophied by centuries of slothlike torpor suspended animation but awake really awake radu longed to breathe he gagged and fought down the near irresistible urge he couldnt breathe not yet and didnt need tofor he was wamphyri but in any case his metamorphic body put out hairfine filaments into his resin matrix and the pale sac of softer fluids surrounding him to siphon off minute traces of oxygen directly into his sluggish bloodstream it gave the doglord ease and he thought air it will be so good to feel it on my body again and bloodi could lie in it and soak it up and bloat to bursting in it could and would the blood was the life and it would renew radus life but first he must stay awake concentrate instruct his leech regain his strength if only he didnt feel so weak at which he remembered remembered his dreams which were nothing less than his previous life which was in fact the problem radu was wamphyri he was undead but had never been truly dead even now his mind was alive and well but what of his body he had put himself down into the resin sure that his leech would heal him but hed been so long disconnected as it were that even now he didnt know or perhaps he did he felt so weak thud the dull reverberation in the rocks the resin the otherwise emptiness came from a distance always the same distance it neither approached nor retreated a heartbeat yes and the beat of a great heart at that but static in space and uneven in time a fumbling heartbeat not yet ready to burst into life fullfledged but burgeoning definitely with which radu knew what it was his creature his warrior created here of his own piss sperm plasma and metamorphic flesh and part of the brain but a very small part of one of his lieutenants before the doglord had gone down into the resin his creature lived why of course it did hadnt the treacherous bonnie jean mirlu and later that cretin of a thrall auld john told him as much and hadnt they nurtured it even as theyd nurtured him he knew they had and recalled now how hed heard that great heartbeat before during bonnie jeans and auld brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii johns visits but if his warrior lived and since it was made of his flesh and fluids surely radu himself must be clean surely his parasite had won its centuried fight with the black death that faethor ferenczy had stabbed into his system thuddd but dully this time shuddering uncertain and as quickly as that radus mood changed and he too was uncertain his warrior was notnot perfect after all and since it was built from his flesh and fluids his earlier conclusion must stand reversed but nothing was proven as yet nor would it be until he was up or ready to be up and if he couldnt be up in his current body wellthose arrangements were covered too his thoughts flowed faster and faster also his blood as he strove to connect up the two mind and body he was hungry and thought to call on bonnie jean a mental howl that all of his moonchildren near and far would hear but it wasnt time and he wasnt ready and in any case she was a traitor or at least she contemplated treachery what with harry keogh but it was ridiculous he was only a man and she was radus she belonged to radu ah but he wasnt only a man he was the man radus manwithtwofaces his mysterious one his new body if need be but patience patience time was narrowing down and after so much time what was a week or two or threeor even seven seven weeks it was down to that now and radu had work to do his blood ran faster still his limbs felt the cold lifesustaining liquids around him his heart gave a single solidsounding thud deep in his chest as he sent telepathic probes out into a world that was entirely strange to him apart from what little bonnie jean and auld john had managed to convey his mental probes went out while the demands of his body his parasite sent physical probes in the form of tubeworms of metamorphic flesh up through the resin to find cracks in its crust air it was drawn into his body with or without the involvement of his conscious will its oxygen filtered out and pumped directly into his quickening bloodstream and thud his heart gave another lurch and after several long seconds a third thud two hearts beating now his and his creatures but both of them unsteady as yet radu laughed deep inside bayed like the great hound he was for a moment and paused abruptly as his mindprobes came into sudden collision with others of a like nature vampires if not wamphyri thralls then or lieutenants but drakul or ferenczy radu couldnt say the contact had been that brief before hed snatched back his probes and clamped shut his mind but just touching upon them had been an electric experience so much so that his metamorphic siphons had automatically drawn back down into him through the resin leaving a trail of tiny bubbles to rise to the canopy of crusty resin get trapped there and form into yellow froth but vampires they were there they were here right here in scotland and they were listening for him obviously and when finally he called for bonnie jean theyd hear that too except by then it would be too late for hed be ready and she too would know that they were there which should make her put aside anyplans she may have made in her own right and oh yes radu was sure she would have made plans for bonnie jean was wamphyri and no matter how often she had dwelled upon the fact and he had denied it by now she would be sure wamphyri aye but inexperienced and no match for the masters who were out there searching for the doglords lair even now bonnie jean would have come to that conclusion too that if she would survive to live out her span she needed the instinct the expertise even the merciless guile and savagery of someone who had already lived ten times her fragile lifespan and so she must remain faithful to her doglord even to the end which she would radu knew for survival was everything to the wamphyri everything to him anyway as for bonnie jean she wasnt worthy she was expendable she was blood she was meat part three the darkness gathers visions and visitations this time it was a fortnight since harry had seen bj he had missed her and he hadnt the last time he had been with her was when hed woken up in a sweat thinking he was lying with a hairy dogbitch whose multiple teats had felt like pulpy dugs in his hands perhaps the nightmare was why he hadnt missed bonnie jean as much as he might because he did not want to dream anything like that ever again not about bj but was aware that recurrent nightmares were part and parcel of him now he had wanted to get it out of his system that was all and maybe hed succeeded at that for it hadnt come back not in the last fortnight anyway not while hed been sleeping alone in that same period shed contacted him only three times sounding nervous and jumpy on the phone as if she were taking care not to say too much harry had likewise called bj three times asking her when he would be seeing her again and hoping because of the nightmare that she wouldnt say tonight but the dream had stayed away and so had bj and a fortnight is a long time also certain things she had said to him during their last phone conversation continued to bother him harry it could be that we the girls and i will need to be moving on from here pretty soon now there are people watching my place not just the watcher the little man you saw that time but people people and some who probably arent people asiatic types i mean but no longer dressed in those lying red robes of theirs theyre difficult to spot until theyre right on top of you and theres also a pair of shady types who just might be policemen but i dont think so i did have some dealings with the police but that was before i last saw you since when ive heard nothing im pretty sure that no one suspects me ofwell anything so these strangers could be brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii ferenczy thralls or simply ordinary men in their pay or just my imagination but when im out i find im frequently followed the girls too and we cant stay cooped up forever we feel like were trapped and as time goes by it gets worse so maybe now you understand why i cant be with you as much as i would like because i dont want to put you in jeopardy harry had been switched on at the time capable of holding a normal conversation b js wee man hed known exactly what she was talking about more than bonnie jean herself would have believed hed felt her fear not only for herself but for him indeed mainly for him and that had put everything right and made him want to tell her oh so muchexcept he couldnt possibly because it was forbidden but by whom forbidden by what by something inside him was all harry knew something that restricted his powers until they were all but useless to him he couldnt talk about them darent display them felt less and less inclined towards using them even for his own protection butforbjs why dont you turn me loose he had asked her then what i know about them hed told her then you told me all about them that the time might come when we would have to go up against them ive accepted that and im ready so dont try to fight them alone bj also what good can it do to run from them when you know theyll only catch up with you and you even know where theyll catch up in the lair of the doglord why leave it until the last minute it was as if he had read her mind but bj knew that in fact he was only remembering what little shed let him retain yet still he seemed to know so much and to accept it so readily harry you listen to me she had snarled then in something close to panic youll keep out of it oh youre good i know but not that good we were very lucky that time up there in but there she had paused in sudden confusion for it was something shed erased from his mind the failed attack of the drakuls or at least she thought she had erased it yet when shed mentioned asiatics no longer in their red robes he hadnt queried her it had been a slip of the tongue on her part but he hadnt picked it up it was as if he knew so what the hell was going on here and again it was as though he had read her mind those tibetan priests he said in an oddly neutral tone that defined her hypnotic influence on him i felt there was something strange about them the first time we saw them theyve been on my mind ever since at which bonnie jean had let out an audible sigh of relict so clear that harry heard it over the line and he too sighed his relief albeit iwaudibly for once again hed protected his powers and anyway b j had gone on after a brief pause to get her thoughts in order thats what were up against the tibetans who i believe are drakuls and the watcher and his friends who are probably ferencys lieutenants or simple thralls or a mix we dont know mostly thralls i would guess and their intentions we cant be absolutely certain except that theyre looking for radu but in factsre could be sure for the drakuls had tried to kill them that time harry didnt know that however which was how she preferred it she didnt want his two levels of awareness merging again and certainly not at a time like this you should let me help you hed told her dont switch me off let me come to you protect you two of us together we have to have a better chance than one and b j youre right i amgood at this sort of thing then hurriedly as if to clarify what hed said its what i used to do remember ive seen what you can do shed told him then i have lots of evidence as to what you can do but you dont know what they can do anyway its decided pretty soon well be out of hereout of bjs wine bar i mean and harry it might be a good idea if you got out of there out of your house if they decide youre a threat if they suspect youre more than just my lover am i he had cut in am i your lover and are you mine b j do you love me dont you know it shed sighed again this time a very different sigh as human a sound as shed ever made love you harry i love the sight of you the air you breathe the ground you walk on the touch of you inside and out the very thought of you i dont know why but i do but you wont let me help no i forbid it and when i switch you off youll remember that harry that youre forbidden to get any more involved than you are already and that you wont act except on my word or in order to protect yourself in my absence is that clear yes and his tone had been vacant robotic again perfectly clear but if youre moving out and if i move out too how will i know where to find you necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley one of my girls will be watching following you youll know her but you mustnt try to talk to her and dont go anywhere too far or too fast i mean dont lose her for when it comes to losing people well youre too damn good at that mr harry keogh and if she loses you we may have trouble finding you again but if we do somehow get separated as a last resort you can always try my place i can have someone watch out for you and when he said nothing well bj had queried thats it then he had finally said in a wavery misunderstanding tone of voice that made her heart want to cry out loud a tone that spoke all too eloquently of his tangled emotions damaged personality and bewildered psyche all in one and a tone that he really shouldnt be capable of not while he was under her influence like this not even while conversing normally still and all that was why she loved him because there was no one else like him not who bj had ever met before but whatever else she did she knew she mustnt weaken now thats it yes until were together again but harry i want you to remember this too that we will be together again as for the rest the usual rules apply the usual rules forget about the drakuls the ferenczys the vampires we are up against unless you come under threat forget them but if or when you are threatened then youll remember everything ive told you about them and be able to act against them its for your own good i just cant have you fighting them on your own and getting yourself killed for you see i dont think i could bear that harrymah wee man after a long pause he said tilremember and that was that and he had remembered if only what the usual rules allowed him to and wondered and worried about the rest of it he remembered that bj would soon be moving out of her place in the city but didnt know why also that shed advised him to move out too and he was vaguely aware that certain enemies were closing in even now but that he couldnt go against them until she said so or until he himself was threatened directly he remembered too that she loved him that they would be together again and that despite all the seeming ambiguities she was innocent she was innocentinnocentinnocent the shout of an idiot in an empty church echoing in the necroscopes aching head aching because of all the strange stuff that was in there trying to find its way out and all the natural or unnatural stuff that was the real harry keogh that he no longer dared to let out all of which further served to remind the necroscope that his life was screwed up and being screwed tighter all the time perhaps to a fatal degree and that someone or someones was or were responsible like maybe bonnie jean herself but no for she was an innocent then who and how if only he could get a look take a peek a single glimpse at the picture on the box then he might be able to work it out for himself the whole bloody jigsaw puzzle but all he had was the frame and a twisted frame at that and no picture at all or at best a jumble of pieces that wouldnt interlock because they worked in three dimensions and harry was working in only two of them and then not at the same time the conversation with bj had been yesterday morning in the afternoon the necroscope had got out his bicycle and pedaued it furiously five miles and back his fitness programme and god he was in his body anyway then leaving the bike in the yard out front harry had gone through the house into the back garden no longer an utter wilderness but something of a garden at least and walked the riverbank to the tiny bight that was his mas grave and for a long time he had stood there in silence looking at the ruffled water he would have loved to talk to his ma but couldntor wouldnt she knew all about her sons weird talent naturally and he knew she wasnt about to betray him even if she could but it was this thing again someone might be watching him and someone might guess what he was doing talking to dead people crazy who in hell would ever guess he was doing something like that but nonetheless harry had looked all about up and down and across the river to see if anyone was there and damn it if someone wasnt a parked car gleaming in the pale afternoon sunshine maybe a hundred and eighty yards upriver on the grass verge of the road that ran parallel with the water and a blurred figure at the steering wheel whose breath was steaming the windows then back to the house with his heart beating just a little faster walking briskly but trying not to act or look too concerned about anything and up to his bedroom where he had tried to focus his binoculars through a chink in his curtains only to be frustrated by his own breath on the windowpane and then thered been nothing else for it but a mobius jump to the deserted country road some two necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley hundred yards downwind of the suspect car where the necroscope had stepped out of his metaphysical door behind a shielding clump of bushes there peering through fringing fojre finally hed got his glasses focused on the car zahanines car one of bonnie jeans girls the gorgeous black girl with the legs that went up forever well almost and harry had almost chuckled that in his situation whatever it was he was still capable of thinking along such lines but not quite because the sight of the girl standing there out of the car now training binoculars of her own on his house had served to bring back the rest of his conversation with bonnie jean some of it anyway that she would have one of her girls follow him keep an eye on himprotect him and something else about the girl herself and about all of bjs girls a question he knew he should ask himself without knowing what the question was but ridiculous anyway because they were all as innocent as b j werent they what innocent zahanine too really with a body like that and this time he had chuckled albeit wryly as he conjured a door and returned to the house where the telephone in his study had been ringing ringing but for how long his answering machine wasnt switched on and this could be bj flying across the room and snatching the phone from its cradle he had almost tripped before stumbling to his knees beside his desk and hallo he had panted into the mouthpiece and in a moment when there was no answer this is harry still no reply only silence or at best the merest suggestion of a shallow somehow sinister breathing and harry keogh he had felt obliged to prompt the caller wonderingly before stopping himself and pausing to think it out but in the next moment kneeling there before his desk he had started to think and thought this isnt bji who then and anyway his number was listed not that that meant anything there were ways round that if someone was determined but having called him why the silence for what good or bad reason shit how hed wished that the answerphone was on perhaps the unknown caller had heard his gasp for a moment later the telephone had gone chclick and started to purr at him and staring at the dead plastic thing in his hand the necroscope had felt a weird panic rising in him as he wondered if that was back again his fear and loathing of the telephone but no surely not for it had been a long time now since anything like that had happened which in itself had been like an invocation the ground had seemed to move under his feet harry actually felt his body swaying to compensate clutched at the desk with his free hand tried to throw the telephone away from him for hed known what was coming known at least that something was coming and that when it got here he wasnt going to like it too much it was in the sudden gloom that swept through or over his study in the fading light that turned the garden beyond the patio windows to night as if someone had switched off the sun and in the blurring of reality as the vestigial talent of a dead mentality surfaced like a drowned thing from the swirling deeps of harrys id or the contours of his reinhabited mind it was alec kyles prescience which as applied to the necroscope could only manifest itself as a curse he had tried to hurl the telephone away but the yellow hand that had squeezed itself out through the speaker to grip his wrist and sink its long curved nails into his flesh until they drew blood wouldnt let him and the basin of the speaker was expanding warping out of shape as the fingers of a second hand twin to the first came writhing up onto the rim clawing their way to freedom then both hands elongated out of the telephone and while the one continued to clasp harrys wrist the other went for his throat at first paralysed the necroscopes jaws had fallen open and apart from a spontaneous spasm as he had tried to jerk away from what was happening an instinctive recoil from the horror of it he hadnt moved but an inch or so but then galvanized by terror he had fought back and it was as if hed fought for his life for the strength of this thing was supernatural and even knowing that this couldnt possibly be happening still it had looked felt and even smelted like it was happening smelled like it yes the acrid stench of alien sweat and a poisonous reek that had struck the necroscope an almost physical blow as someone or something breathed directly into his face it had come from the telephone its speaker grown to the size of a great fleshy pipe a hugely convulsing vulva as out from between the spindly rubbery reaching arms a bald domed yellow head dragged itself into view the thing was all froth bubbles sweat and mucus it was as if the mutating telephone had tried to give birth and squeeze this loathsome anomaly out into harrys study half out the thing had squirmed in its own juices as it used harrys straining against it to drag itself from the collapsing tube of the telephone but then in the next moment as if the effort had been too much for it it too had collapsed the hands on harrys wrist and neck had turned to so much mush and bone pulsing yellow eyes had fallen in on themselves sucked brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii back into the madly wobbling head and in that same moment before complete katabolism harry had seen that the yellow face wasnt so much horrifying as horrified and even as a rotting tongue wriggled between crumbling lips he had heard his visitors choked or whispered hhh e meeeeeeer and then the awful gurgling and slopping of the thing as it melted like a black and gold candle under a blowtorch with which dim daylight had flooded harrys room and a bird had chirped sleepily in the garden as his tottering universe warped back into something of focus however unclear there had been no blood on his wrist no slime on his clothing no marks or hurt to harrys throat but still hed slumped there in the coils of the telephones spiral cable leaning on the solid reality of his desk for long long moments satisfied simply to listen to the great pounding hammer that was his heart and it had taken him as long again to get to his feet and find the strength and spit to swallow that had been yesterday afternoonfollowing which hed decided to take bjs advice a lot more seriously and indeed he had determined to do just that but his frustration that he wasnt able to grasp the meaning of such occurrences and his everincreasing irritation or obsession with his own patently flawed faculties his reasoning and recall processes plus his naturally stubborn nature had served to keep him at home for at least one more night perhaps he had been hoping that the telephone would ring again if only to defy the thing or maybe learn something from it now that he knew it wasnt capable of physical harm but despite that he had deliberately left his answerphone disconnected his sleep hadnt been disturbed except by recurrent nightmares the substance or bulk of which as usual he couldnt remember on wakingexcept for one thing one face one fearfilled visage in his minds eye that continued pleading with him even after he was awake hmihelp meeeeeeer the yellow man or youth as harry now seemed to remember him from his what precognitive visitation but was that really what it had been was that all it had been alec kyles talent resurfacing again after all this time some kind of warning presience somehow harry didnt think so not this time yellow mentibetan priests or monksthe monastery on ike frozen plateauand the leader of those redrobes in london that time taking pictures at the scene of the bombing in oxford streetand ike same group or another just like it in the forest ofatholl all of these things yes but what else did harry know about them and his ma she hadnt come to his rescue or interfered this time when the telephone had been a wolf but when the telephone was a wotf his mother had come on like the cavalry so why not this time what if she hadnt been able to on this occasion and why wasnt he able to hear the dead conversing in their graves which was as usual or normal to harry as reallife background conversation in a crowded room to a normal man but when he thought about it at least that was something he could figure out for himself it wasnt his ma wasnt the great majority who had given up on him it was harry who had given up on them it was thisthis somedamnthing inside him that didnt want him talking to them and it was getting worse all the time this need in him to protect his secret talents his powers as a necroscope and his use of the mobius continuum he was like an addict obscuring his addiction learning how not to give himself away a difficult thing when using the msbius continuum for his physical movements on entering into or exiting from the continuum might easily be observed but very much simpler in the case of his commerce with the teeming dead for that was metaphysical mental invisible he had simply erected barriers in his mind shields that had always been there which alone allowed him to lead a normal existence except now they were there permanently for without even realizing that he had done it and even now not sure it was possible that hed left those barriers in place and so cut himself off from the dead after a late breakfast coffee and a bowl of cereal the necroscope had tested the theory opened his mind and instinctively tuned in to that ethereal vaveband to which he alone had access letting it flow through him he had known at once that he was right for they were there as always the whispering dead the great majority talking to each other from their unseen unknown graves across the world but before they could sense him or feel the warmth of his lonely flame flickering in their long night he had reinstated his barriers to shut them out but why why do that to them when the teeming dead were the only real friends harry had ever had the answer was simplicity itself the best way to keep a secret hidden forever is to lock it away where it can never be discovered this secret was locked in the necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley necroscopes head and if he threw away the only keythat was where it would stay then for a while he had known regret remorse even something of surprise at himself that he was so ready willing and able to discard so much of what had been good in his life but he knew that whatever else he did he must not risk anyone else finding out about his talents he couldnt tell anyone about them display them or or use them yes and it might even come down to that eventually and what hope would he have then of finding brenda and his boy none he supposed so maybe he should get on with the search for them involve himself personally in it again while he still could which seemed like another good reason for getting himself out of this old house as for bonnie jeans reasons harry didnt even know what they were exactly something she feared something he should fear at which moment as hed pushed his plate away and stood up the telephone had jangled in his study and that was maybe something he should fear or something he should fight whichever harry had breakfasted in his kitchen at first the sound of the phone had frozen him rigid then he had taken a moment or two to unfreeze decide what to do and get mobile and several seconds more to make his way to his study and all of the time the telephone had kept on ringing after thathed found himself snatching at the thing no longer giving himself time to wonder or worry about it but doing it and even in full daylight or as full as it ever got to be this time of year still harry had felt the short hairs rising at the back of his neck and the creep of his flesh as he anticipated the unknownfeelings which were still with him when hed heard harry is that you darcy clarke his voice made tinny by the two or three inches harry held the phone away from his ear his face at first he had failed to recognize his caller partly because it had been so long and also because hed been expectingwell almost anything else but then darcy he had answered almost gasping his relief as he flopped into his chair itsits good to hear from you and that was something he really hadnt expected to say again not and really mean it darcy was quick on the uptake as usual harry is anything wrong wrong you sound dont know sort of tense i was expecting a call from oh someone else so whats on your mind he had tried to sound as much at ease as possible but at the same time had realized that he wasnt the only one who sounded sort of tense and his heart and his guts had given a lurch as he asked is it brenda brenda as if nothing could have been further from darcs mind which after all this time might well be the case oh brenda no no its not your wife harry its something else and we have to talk i mean face to face and i do mean we have to talk well and harry had wanted to get out of the house hadnt he a talk you want to talk to me but his voice had turned sour in a moment just a talk tor the moment yes not about brenda and my son noand if i may say so its bigger than that dont give me a hard time over this harry i mean considering what ive just said you have to know now that it really is big what if i tell you i dont much care and what if i tell you that youd better care this time its not just the branch harry it could be everything everything was a lot especially if darcy clarke said so and its something you need my help with maybe darcy sounded uncertain but on the other hand it could be that you need ours harry had thought about that briefly before answering theres a train out of waverly station about midday be on it it wasnt that he had simply accepted darcys argument or given in to the veiled threat butwho could say maybe the branch had the answers to some of his many questions a train darcy had seemed surprised and harry knew why but his thing his obsession was really starting to take control now a train yes he had snapped what and did you think i would walk it with which hed put the phone down his train had got into kings cross a little before in the evening but thered been ebranch or special branch men aboard from darlington on down the line harry had seen them and known who they were but said nothing they had sat close but not too close just keeping their eyes on him only a handful of people would have noticed but the necroscope had had plenty of experience of just such people so were they escorting protecting him obviously the first probably the second but from what something big as darcy clarke would have it darcy himself head of branch had met him at kings cross driven him to headquarters in the heart of the city which was where they were now brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii despite all of darcys efforts to the contrary he was nervous as a cat he had problems aplenty all of which were or seemed connected to the necroscope to one extent or another he could have had him watched at home of course but he had long since promised harry that he wouldnt interfere with him or his son if ever they should find him and he wasnt about to break his word so since harry was a friend of the branch this seemed the best way a face to face confrontation in fact there had been no other route or there had been but that was a route darcy would avoid at all costs the other way would have been to tell the minister responsible about harrys possible involvement in certain matters sit back and let him make the decisions but in the past darcys dealings with that specific government body had taught him a number of valuable lessons not least that it could bewell heavyhanded to say the least he was well aware that in the best interests of the country even innocent men were occasionally expendable but the necroscope harry keogh wouldnt be one of them not while darcy was head of ebranch the branch was housed in or on a hotel the elevator at the rear stopped on an extra floor the top floor ebranch hq ben trask was pacing the long corridor when the elevator doors hissed open and harry and darcy stepped out trask fell in with them in a moment his gruff greeting hi darcy harry echoing in a place whose offices were more than halfempty it was after five and most of darcys staff had gone to their homes which was just as well because the business in hand was on a strictly needtoknow basis and ops room darcy said leading the way en route from the station he had said very little when hed spoken at all it was to ask harry how his search was going which the necroscope had answered with a shake of his head darcy had desperately wanted to ask why the train but had held it in that was what they were going to find out thatand hopefully one or two other things or hopefully not the ops room was empty gloomy sterilelooking darcy put on the lights dragged three steel chairs around a table threw his coat on another chair and sat down harry and ben trask followed suit and when they were seated so whats going on harry looked from face to face taking in the little telltale changes not that darcy clarke ever changed a lot not that youd notice he was still the worlds most nondescript man middling in every way except for his weird talent that guardian angel that kept him out of trouble and made him the ideal man for the job as for trask if anything he looked younger a human liedetector the last three or four years had tightened him up a little sharpened him taken away his jaded lugubrious look or perhaps it was the jobor maybe it was whatever this was now you mean you cant tell ks darcy leaned forward looked him straight in the eye see the fact is we dont know whats going on we were hoping you would and that youd want to tell us about it ben reached out and let his hand fall on darcys arm you said you were going to tell him straight he said and harry said so that you could judge my reaction eh ben what is this goodcop badcop or is it just inquisitor and adjudicator he asks the questions and you tell him if im lying or not they said nothing and harry began to stand up but darcy said harry dont please dont if you walk out on us then if s out of my hands the way he said it so cold yet at the same time brokenly as if he had to force the words out made harry sit down again and whose hands will it be in whatever it is harry were covering for you ben took the opportunity to put in for a long time now you havent been straight with us but his voice too was shaky because he knew that for a long time now they hadnt been straight with harry which went against trasks grain it wasnt just that you couldnt lie to him but also that he didnt like telling lies not even white lies or halftruths and to him not telling something hiding something especially from a friend was tantamount to lying about it covering for me harry said uncertainly and again he looked from one to the other then shaking his head well im sorry but youve lost me right from square one and angry now i mean what the hell am i supposed to have done ben trask was staring right at him he blinked and looked at darcy i cant read a thing there isnt one lying hair on harrys head not where were concerned a lot of uncertainty soulsearching but no deliberate mendacity and to harry it could be you kept something back that time four years ago but you certainly arent doing it now then he frowned not that youre aware of anyway then back to darcy again so do it the way you said you would and tell it to him straight and darcy sighed and said very well and to the necroscope harry all sorts of things are going down and we dont have a clue what its all about when weve told you about it then youll understand why we thought you might be involved and then too you might be able to suggest something or maybe we can work it out together before they could begin the duty officer looked in asking if they necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley would like coffee darcy said yes and they sat in silence until he had brought it in then darcy told him to see to it they werent disturbed and after hed left they got down to it leaving everything else out for the moment darcy went straight to the story of the bomb in hyde park and ben trask of course monitored harrys reaction blank astonishment at first then something quite different the necroscopes universe reeled and he knew what was coming he had just commenced saying what a nuclear device in hyde when it happened his face went pale he clutched the rim of the table and groaned oh no darcy and ben flanked him in a moment their hands on his shoulders harry leave it he gasped i know what it is and ifll pass well maybe but not right now for instead the room the operations room passed right out of existence and everything was white so white so blinding white that he gasped with the hurt of it closed his eyes and turned his face away and a moment later felt a slap the hard slap of a cold gritty hand or a handful of ice like a snowball with a rock in it such as the colliery kids had used to make when he was a boyon his face stinging it and then a punch or rather a bodyblow full body as if someone had slammed a giant door on him it picked him up spun him head over heels like a leaf in a gale hurled him down in a deep snowdrift so that he left a manshaped depression where he broke through the thin crust and crunched down deep into the snow and overhead suddenly there was a wind a gale a hurricane as the white light turned red and sound momentarily suspended returned with a vengeance a crackling of electricity a tracery of electrical fires racing across the sky a rumbling bom out of nothing that grew louder and louder until it was deafening and then the debris dirt snow and ice chunks of rock a horizontal avalanche passing over harry where he hugged himself down and tried to disappear into his hole in the snowdrift it went on for long seconds and when it was done and the ground stopped shuddering harry got to his knees looked out of the trench hed compressed into the snowlooked out on an awesome scene neardistant some two or three miles across a dirty grey desolation a low squat mushroom cloud bulged upwards still expanding at its base ground zero was hidden in the boiling flameshot stem where rocks and rubble were still tumbling from the sky and as a backdrop gaunt grey mountains capped with white marched into a familiar distance what he said and what darcy clarke echoed him are you ok harry and the ops room was there all around him for a while he couldnt speak licked his lips was glad to be back not that hed been anywhere not his body anyway another of alec kyles bloody indecipherable precognitions it must have been brought on by all the talk of an atomic bomb in hyde park and he spoke the thought out loud even as it came to him one of alecs glimpses into the future trask knew the truth when he heard it youve retained a part of alec we thought that had left you by now darcy put in how would we know any different were never in touch these days still disoriented harry reeled clutched at the desk he looked at their concerned faces where they flanked him realized that what darcy had said was true that these were friends real friends and hed been too long out of touch and steadying himself he blurted the fact is im a total fuckup alec kyle hes only a small part of it but yes i still have something of him in me which i dont understand any more than he did that was an example of it a bomb blast a nuclear blast was how it seemed to me out of some unknown future future future future and the world reeled again jesus harry gasped as the room started to rotate and darcy and ben grabbed his shoulders holding him still then they were gone and a kindly learned face a long face with grey eyes whose inner orbits curved into the bridge of a straight even nose over drooping moustaches that touched the corners of his small but by no means mean mouth peered into harrys the mans forehead was large and open his cheeks were ruddy his ears protruded slightly with sideburns that flowed down into a full goldenbrown beard but his eyes were his most remarkable feature for at one and the same time they were severe and smiling and as well as discipline a great humanity an inexplicable mysticism seemed to blaze outwards from them then ah son of my visions he said or are you in fact the father but away with you now for i am assured that as yet it is not your time and that was all the ops room swam back into focus again and harry felt like he was about to throw up what the hell ben trasks eyes were staring where were you just then for he had been unable to read the truth of a mind that was elsewhere and darcy wanted to know harry how long has this been going on necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley they stared so hard at him they tried so very hard to pierce the veil of the necroscopes metaphysical mind that he felt their gaze was almost hypnotic hypnotic hypnotic hypnotic he couldnt stop it his every thought conjured new even stranger visions just hang onto me he croaked as yet again the universe stood on its head this time it teas a mere moment a displacement a genuine giimpse suck as the precogalec kyle had used to experience a frozen picture like a single celluloid frame that gets jammed too long under the hot glare of the projectors lamp until it browns crisps and blisters out of existence harry stood at a crossroads on the one hand beyond a low wall the mainly untended plots and leaning headstones of some unknown graveyard were halfobscured by long grasses while on the other a signpost said meersburg along with a distance in kilometres none of which had any relevance to harry not yet at least but then the picture browned crisped distorted all out of shape and vanished and darcy and ben were holding on to him for dear life then it hurt something in the necroscopes head hurt like all hell and just exactly like the single frame under the burning glare of the projectors lamp he felt or sensed the something being burned out of him too those unique connections nearmagical synaptic triggers in what had once been alec kyles brain finally disconnecting themselves realigning conforming to harrys mental patterns for he had overburdened the old system channelled too great a current along its circuits and at last the fuses had blown it went out of him like a sigh with a sigh as he stopped straining and fell back in his chair where for a long time his face gradually tentatively unscrewed itself as the pain ebbed until it too went out of him and done he said and ben trask knew that it was so the last of him gone he said darcy looked from one to the other and back again what was all he could say what and eventually harry was able to tell him tou know ive never been too sure of god that there is one i mean and im still not but if there is well i thank him for this at least that at last alec is out of my system for good which was all he was willing to say by way of explanation but at the same time he knew that thered been much of value in kyles talent in the beginning it had warned of an ira bomb in oxford street and saved lives a great many and at the last or almost at the last it had warned of another greater bomb the meaning of the first was now academic it had worked itself out but as for the last where is it now harry asked out of the blue after ben had replenished their coffees that bomb i mean made safe darcy told him and in a very safe place td like to see it tonight as soon as possible yes til make the arrangements darcy said but its quite a distance just how do you propose to er get there harry looked at him almost in surprise dont you have a duty vehicle of coursedarcy nodded at oncesilly of methen he left ben and harry on their own for a few minutes while he went to make the arrangements darcy made several calls from an office next door to the operations room then turned to the saturnine figure who was seated before a oneway window looking in on ben and their guest and despite that the walls were soundproofed still darcy kept his voice low as he asked well have you formed any opinions doctor james anderson hypnotist turned and looked at him with eyes deep as space several he said in that sepulchral voice of his even some about our mr keogh but tell me this bomb story is it true darcy sighed look were short on time as for anything youve learned i know i dont have to remind that youre still subject to the official secrets act it is true then my god but but thats the kind of thing were up against here in ebranch darcys voice was cold now even harsh now forget it and tell me about harry anderson nodded took a deep breath maybe we should reconsider it could be i wentwhat too deep going on what youve told me and on what ive seen it seems to me hes developed an obsession hes now denying these skills of his as if even he no longer believes in them and thats a kind of schizophrenia and it could get worse manifest itself in a variety of ways at which darcy knew what he must do t want it reversed but will he know i mean will he suspect what we did to him not if we do it the same way in fact you can be certain hell only feel a great relief because thats what teu him hell feel ill convince him to sleep here tonight darcy said and again anderson nodded that will give me time to prepare myself he said brian lumley and youll be here when we get back you can be sure of it anderson answered because he had no way of knowing that hed be somewhere else entirely ii anderson the bomb and rls obi james anderson harry keogh darcy clarke introduced the two men as all four of them including ben trask entered the elevator but he deliberately left andersons doctor prefix unstated the hypnotist and the necroscope shook hands and harry showed never a sign that he recognized or remotely remembered the other james darcy went on feeling as treacherous as a dog who turns on his own master harry was once with ebranch and still helps us out occasionally and to harry james is a specialist who also gives us a hand now and then nothing to do with the current situation were just dropping him off at his home thats all the conversation terminated there and then which was what darcy had intended the least said by both parties the better and twenty minutes later as trask stopped the car at a junction in upperclass knightsbridge where james anderson got out just a short walk from his home no one gave a second thought to the vehicle that pulled up close behind or the two passengers who alighted at the same junction the streets were full of people going home following which trask set out in earnest to drive west to greenham common near newbury berkshire the us air force base that housed natos americanowned cruise missiles and when at last they were on the westbound motorway how long darcy leaned forward to ask ben trask an hour and a half maybe two trask answered depends on the traffic but now that the rush hour is over if s looking good so then darcy turned to harry where they sat together in the back of the car plenty of time to talk and with luck that gaggle of cnd harridans at the common will have quietened down for the night and we wont have to run the gauntlet can you hear us back here ok ben brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii the driver glanced at them in his interior mirror gave a thumbsupsign very well darcy said and to harry so if youve got any questions for me bomb questions yes said harry at once with the white heat of his incendiary vision still burning on the eye of memory like whose bomb is it darcy understood and nodded its design chinese dirty as the rough technology that produced it but miles ahead of anything the west might have suspected of them in other words theyre catching up on us fast and if there was one bomb said or questioned there could be more darcy cocked his head no not anywhere in the uk anyway he looked uncomfortable butwe do know that there was one more bomb at least where would you believerussia moscow harrys jaw fell open what but how do you know even harder to believe darcy grinned however humourlessly yuri andropov told us hes the big chief over there now you know he also told us about the bomb in hyde park i now the necroscope shook his head in astonishment well it beats me he said gregor borowitz established the opposition under brezhnev but borowitz was antikgb from head to toe and the russian outfit before we wrecked it was just as covert esoteric as ebranch itself and hated by the kgb even as much as borowitz hated them and god only knows they have to hate us or you or me even more yet now andropov exhead of the kgb is taking time out to warn you of nuclear sabotage a bomb that the chinese have buried in a london park it doesnt make sense it makes perfect sense darcy told him because while the cold war was one thing world war three would be something else entirely cant you just see it these bombs going off at some time in the near future lets say at a time when eastwest relationships are at a low ebb and the utter chaos that would ensue harry frowned and shook his head it still doesnt work out what china the agent provocateur but surely theyd get dragged in dont nuclear weapons have their own signatures china would get dragged in certainly darcy answered shed be answerable eventually but much too late what with london and moscow in ruins and all the worlds big guns targeting and firing on each other and because the west is still way ahead you can bet wed obliterate china too then how can china profit by planting these bombs who said she did and darcy grinned his mirthless grin again more a grimace really and as the necroscope fell silent told the rest of the story so thats if he said at last tibet the bombs were planted by a bunch of tibetan extremists the crazy devotees of some kind of sect which leads us to your involvement eh harry jerked upright me you think im involved but how in what way and his indignation was a hundred per cent genuine darcy knew else ben would have spoken up about it yet while trask remained silent he was in fact conscious of something strange he had definitely felt the necroscope go on the defensive at first mention of tibetan involvement and again when darcy had spoken of redrobed monks we were hoping you could tell us darcy said and now trask came in with like i said back at hq you havent been straight with us for quite some time harry and youre not being entirely straight even now i havent told you any lies the necroscope snapped maybe not ben said but neither have you told us the whole truth it goes right back to that werewolf job you did in london thats where it started the night you well did your thing in that garage where what started harry demanded but in fact he already had an inkling of what they were talking about and they were right he hadnt told them everything about that night darcy answered his blustered question anyway where you began to deviate from the true facts a bit then after a long thoughtful pause harry sighed sank back into his seat the night brenda and my boy vanished he said his voice subdued his thoughts going off at a different tangent entirely but thats not what were on about darcy told him and at once shut up as he realized that his tone wasnt as sympathetic as it might be tm sorry he said then thats not how i meant to put it harry said ben trask from the drivers seat it isnt fair of us to be grilling you when you cant see the whole picture i mean were not interrogating you were not trying to make you trip over your own tongue so its only right we tell you whats bothering us and let you take it from there ok so tell me harry said and darcy took it up again do you remember when i called you about those tibetan sect members who got killed in a mobile shootout it was in your neck of the woods the spey valley i remember harry said frowning again t wasnt involved so what of it brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii and in the front of the car ben trask likewise wondered was he involved was he what the fuck was wrong with his talent he couldnt make any sense of it for to him things were either black or white but never never grey until now one of those monks in that burnedout wreck was shot with a crossbow darcy said there was another bolt in the door of the car and both of them had the same silvered heads that were found in the bodies of those thugs you dealt with in the garage that night in the east end you told us you shot those two and if so doesnt it follow that you might also have had something to do with the spey killings or that youd know about them at least harrys head reeled in sudden conflict of identity forbidden knowledge and loyalty but he quickly brought it under control it wasnt him they were after but bonnie jean and she was innocent definitely innocent of whatever darcy was talking about because she had been with harry that day the day shed called off their climbing and hunting expedition he remembered it welldidnt he of course he did they had stayed at auld johns place overnight setting off early the next morning to go climbing in the cairngorms except bj had called it off at the last moment maybe shed reckoned he wasnt up to it and then they had driven back to edinburgh that was all there was to it yellow men in red robes a burning car and bj with a crossbow in her hand harry darcy pulled him out of it offering him a target for his frustration and i dont know anything about any shootout harry snapped as for the garage jobno i didnt do it cthere it was out but it was all theyd get he wasnt about to betray b j darcy nodded you never did actually tell us you were responsible that time so you were covering for someone else someone who helped me yes harry said under his breath someone who saved my life stopped that lunatic skippy from splitting my head with a machete or would you rather have me dead look you said youd been covering for me well is it so hard to understand that i might want to cover for someone else surely its a question of loyalty as for my loyalties theyve always been in the right place darcy pulled at his lower lip looked for comment from ben trask trask saw darcys querying look in his mirror and gave a puzzled irritated shrug damn it to hell he wasnt sure so we have to assume darcy said that if you didnt take out those redrobes in scotland whoever youre protecting did no way said harry with conviction for she was with me and in the next moment he saw darcys trap except it really hadnt been intended that way and we didnt hear that darcy said at once so it makes no difference and anyway that makes two favours we owe him or her or whoever one for pulling your fat out of the fire and two for getting rid of a couple of saboteurs but she must be one hell of a girl and something clicked into place in harrys mind incorrectly as it happened but to the necroscope it seemed to fit just exactly right for he had in fact seen those redrobed priests when he and bj had stopped at the teashop in the forest of atholl hed seen and remembered them and since the sighting hadnt been part of the action bj hadnt thought to erase it but now to harry it seemed that if b j had had reason to fear the tibetans it might be why she had called off their trip so suddenly it might also explain why shed suggested he should vacate the old house for a while if the four remaining monks were a threat to her they might also be a threat to him but as to her connection with them or to the bolts that had killed one of them he didnt have the foggiest idea did he and what about the teletibetan that bloody awful visitation in the old house when his phone gave birth to a yellow thing that turned to so much slop but not before it cried for help obviously there was a connection but what was it from the drivers seat trask halflooked back over his shoulder and said so you see harry weve been more than a little concerned about you ever since the werewolf thing and before you ask no i wasnt checking on you at the time and if i had been id have asked you for the truth there and then but your backup on that job was trev jordan a damn fine telepath his report details how he detected someone else in that garage but couldnt get a clear reading the same someone who youre protecting obviously which leaves only one question unanswered darcy said that of the silvered boltheads maybe thats something youll look into some time eh harry i mean surely you can see why were interested when it comes down to people depositing nuclear weapons left right and centre we cant afford to leave any loose ends dangling there is no lead that we or others wouldnt follow up so someone shot those two redrobes fine but why were they shot and where have the other four gone to and who is it that seems to be protecting our interests here illgive it some thought harry told him knowing or hoping that he wouldnt necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley meanwhile the necroscope had other things to think about such as the last three precognitive glimpses bequeathed to him by some revenant of alec kyles talent first the bomb blast a true vision out of future time or simply a connection a glimpse brought about by darcys story of a nuclear device discovered in hyde park harry wasnt sure hed been told enough about that as yet and like it or not he suspected hed have to give it some thought after all or if not thought some conversation at least but turning to darcy he saw that his head was down where he slumped in the corner of the seat looking back trask said hes had a tough day let him sleep did you want something did darcy tell me the whole story about the bomb harry had always felt easy talking to trask you couldnt lie to him no but at the same time he wasnt likely to lie back i mean how did andropov find out about it how can we be sure this was the work of the tibetans or our tibetans these monks trask understood his query and answered the soviets have always been interested in parapsychology as witness the opposition the russian version of ebranch brezhnev was very keen on his mindspy organization so when the chateau bronnitsy fell and the best of the russian espers were taken out he wanted it built up again not the chateau but the organization he fixed it for a convention of espers in moscow perhaps to see what he was up against we sent along a pair of our lesser lights they wouldnt glean a hell of a lot but they wouldnt give too much away either the chinese had a delegation too from their outfit on kwijiang avenue chungking the tibetans got into moscow with them we presume that whats left of the soviet esporganization was in on the convention and that they found out what was going down chinese bombs planted by the members of a tibetan sect harry mused so in fact since the devices are chinese and the tibetans were part of chinas delegation the chinese are responsible after all and the tibetans were only their dupes probably because the chinese knew that theyd be the ones the russians were watching not the monks but darcy said the chinese werent to blame they arent trask answered the bombs were stolen and something darcy didnt tell you theres a third bomb in chungking andropovs using it as a bargaining chip in the sinosoviet border disputes he isnt saying where it is or who planted it just that its thereand that theres this little strip of dirt in yakland that belongs to mother russia and he would very much like the little yellow soldiers out thank you blackmail and of the worst sort political nuclear nasty but our locators have found the bomb or rather they know where it is approximately and now weve given andropov a deadline he has two weeks to tell the chinese what he really must what hes simply got to tell them the location of the bomb which city where or our government will which will take any kudos away from him now harry this is all highly classified obviously on a top secret needtoknow basis which is why darcy didnt mention it on the other hand since you do need to know and when harry tailed to reply is there anything else but the necroscope shook his head sat back again and was soon lost deep in thought he considered his other visions or visitations after the devastation of the imagined nuclear bomb blast he had tried to tell darcy and ben what hed seen a glimpse of some future cataclysm or an oblique warning that such a calamity was likely to occur all of which seemed to find an explanation in what ben had just told him but the word future had been like an invocation or trigger and again he had been whirled away to some unknown placeor rather an unknown face those eyes that were simultaneously severe and smiling blazing with humanity and mysticism both and blazing full on harry ah son of my visions the owner of the face had said or are you in fact the father and then away with you now for i am assured that as yet it is not your time not the necroscopes time so did that mean that his time was coming but what time for a long time harry pondered it and got nowhere except to accept that the mystic had not posed a threat if anything he had seemed to offer shelter against some unknown storm and then there had been the final visitation or perhaps visit was a better word for certainly harry had been transported somewhere a crossroads with a low wall to one side sheltering the untendedplots and leaning headstones of a graveyard while on the other side a signpost pointed to meersburg none of which made any sense had any meaning or seemed in any way menacing to the necroscope for graveyards and lichencovered slabs were familiar motifs in his world by no means frightening yet this glimpse had ushered out the last trace of alec kyles talent had been its last throw it was gone forever now burned out of harrys identity and if only because it was the last throwsurely it must have meant something r brian lumley harry ben trasks voice harry looked up shook his head to clear it wondered have i been sleeping too darcy clarke was stretching yawning and ben was looking in his mirror at both of them well be there in four or five minutes he said then he switched on the cars police radio tuned in and identified himself spoke into the handset and uhoh he said the greenham crones sans knitting are gathering for the execution problems darcy was alert in a moment shouldnt think so a couple of cnd bigwigs along with the usual tribe of retards you have no tolerance darcy tuttutted i know the difference between the truth and a lie ben told him nukes are a bad thing true but without them wed have been into world war three years ago also true the organizers of this sort of thing know it yet still use the terrorism of lies for their own political ends definitely true biased sure i am how can i be otherwise with a talent like mine its the old question are espers blessed or cursed they drove along a country road turned into a lane leading to a huge wirefenced enclosure and a sign told them that this was the us air force base at greenham common darcy held up his id and a uniformed police officer saluted and waved them on on both sides walls of policemen held back a crowd composed mainly of angry women the striped guardroom gate went up and ben drove through but as the car began to cross the threshold a fat redfaced young woman broke free of the cordon and threw a clod of wet earth at the windscreen ben avoided her used his wipers to twitch the muck aside a hairy one he grunted as the clod fell away the mudball darcy said no the silly cow who threw it ben replied what ban the bomb that one could fall on a bloody bomb and smother it then they were into the base and all the ballyhoo left behind harry wanted to know how did they know we were coming darcy shrugged when the police come out in force someone is coming doesnt matter who it is its always the same reception then a huge black american air force officer flagged them down got in the car and took them where they wanted to go trask drove down a ramp into a hangar that wasnt switched off his lights in the floodlit interior their passenger directed him into an elevator that could have taken a tank and ben drove in and stopped when red lights blinked on a warning bell clanged and the cage necroscope the lost years vol ii descended three levels and as the doors opened roll her forward six or so feet the officer said ben did so and applied the brake leave yo vehicle halfin halfout the cage the american a colonel told them as they got out of the car the door works on electric eyes and wont close on the vehicle and the elevator cant move with the door open that traps the elevator down heah and ensures some privacy and incidentiy yoall are trapped down heah too until i see some id he took out an automatic pistol from his belt and cocked it darcy showed him his id and the colonel goggled man yo has more right bein heah than i do he put away his gun took them out of the elevator and down a vast archedover and apparently endless corridor over echoing expanses of empty floodlit concrete and past a dozen steelpanelled doors to one that was hung with a redstencilled sign on a white board no entry unlocking the door shoving it open with a massive muscular shoulder the colonel said i takes it yoall knows what yos doin look all yo want but dont touch the glass cos its alarmed yoll have the whole damn camp down heah and theys every one crazy as me its the job he grinned saluted and left them to it his footsteps moved away from the door but not too far darcy clarke had been here before he led the others to a dais in the centre of the floor climbed steel steps and leaned on the side of a tanklike container to look down on the contents and heres our bomb he said all nice and tidy and safe under glass harry moved to one side of him ben to the other the necroscope was fascinated this is an atomic bomb it looks more like the engine of an experimental mediumsized motorbike just a bit more powerful darcy said with typical british phlegm darcys casual attitude spoke volumes for the safety of the device how much does it weigh harry looked down through plate glass at twin metal cylinders like a pair of elongated dumbbells joined in the middle by an eightinch diameter stainless steel pipe with the entire surface machinerouted into grooves that were packed with wiring and sealed over with plastic laminate the whole thing had been set on a rubberwheeled trolley for ease of movement two large suitcases worth darcy answered about a hundred and ten pounds and they could smuggle this into moscow it seemed unbelievable darcy shrugged and through gatwick dont ask me how but necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley take it from me theres all hell going on right now airport security will never be the same again darcy took three paces along the dais to a second container harry joined him looked down through the glass cover at a small safe with a combination lock and said what the trigger darcy told him the firing mechanism its locked in the safe which is supposed to make the bomb safe or safer he shrugged again uncomfortably this time and so it does but to my mind there are enough of the homegrown and far more deadly variety of nuclear devices in this complex already without they should worry too much about this one thats what all those women at the gates are up in arms about nukes of which this is just one more the trigger harry looked for clarification basically its a radio receiver with an electrical lead that plugs into a socket in the middle section of the bomb the bomb would be armed remotely by radio signal and set off the same way hie people here have rigged a duplicate receiver in an operations room where the only thing it will activate is an alarm theres a twentyfour hour watch so that theyll know if or when the signals come in thatll be the moment that london would have gone sky high but the bomb is totally safe absolutely its leaking a little radiation thats all which is why theyve isolated it down here in a leadlined container but if you take the trigger out of that safe which you cant plug it in and extend the antenna a little bingo its all set up again just waiting for those special signals out of tibet which right now it cant receiveelse i wouldnt be here harry took a pace to the right looked at the bomb again somehow it had changed it was now obscene and the necroscope shivered sudden death he said in a small voice tor millions yes darcy agreed but the bomb itself this bomb would only be the trigger i mean the real trigger the starting pistol for a nuclear holocaust and a nuclear winter to follow not just world war three but probably the beginning of a new dark ages and in a little while trask came in with well and have we interested you harry harry looked at him idont any longer work for the branch he said but on the other hand this is something we all should be interested in any madman who is capable of this could try to do it again darcy said exactly so you will help us out if you can i mean we know most of it except why and who the reason and the mad mind that reasoned it but finding the answers to those things will take a very special kind of investigator he knew he was taking something of a chance here but risked it anyway but when he saw the sick look that the necroscope gave him then he wished he hadnt it was as if harry wanted to say something as if he wanted to help but didnt know how for the fact was that he was no longer willing nor able to admit what he was and what he alone could do and such was his obsession he wouldnt accept that there were others who already knew about him and though darcy had had doubts before now he was happy with the arrangements hed made with dr james anderson for he knew that harry must be put back to rights so taking the necroscopes arm he said anyway if s late and we have to be on our way so dont worry about any of this now you asked to see the bomb and now youve seen it by now too anderson would be waiting for them back at ebranch hq in london except he wasnt and despite that later that night until the small hours darcy called and called he got no answer and after hed sent a car round to find out what was going on still no answer for doctor james anderson wasnt at home by which time harry keogh necroscope was fast asleep and ebranch hq was very still and quiet and yet unquiet too which was always the way of it at ebranch hq james anderson had never made it in through his front door he had made it through the wroughtiron gate and two of the three short paces through the terracottapotted shrubbery of the narrow strip of frontage but at the archedover porch to the door itself he had paused blinked and frowned and wondered why the pair of yellow globe timerlights flanking the entrance on ornate stands were out a blown fuse probably at which hed gasped and taken a pace backwards as a pair of lithe dark figures stepped from the darkness behind the last of the potted plants and reached for him and he had known that whatever this was it wasnt a friendly reception then turning to run hed bumped into two more dark figures right behind him and inside the gate a grin was all the doctor had seen and all he would later remember feral eyes that seemed to glow yellow in the dark and a gaping mouth full of pointed white teeth as the men in front of him pinioned him and one of the pair from the bushes put an arm round his neck to cut off any shouting then he had struggled briefly frantically and started to kick as he began to run out of air at once the pressure on his windpipe had been relieved but as hed inhaled massively something had been clamped brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii over his nose and mouth something that smelted ofrkly quiet voices woke anderson up they came to him faintly at first as his aching mind surfaced through the slowly fading reek of chloroform fumes and his dry mouth cracked open as if his lips had been sealed with sugarsweet crusts of the stuff he might well have vomited then but darent because he didnt know where he was or why or who the sounds of sickness would alert and so he kept it in swallowed hard and painfully and listened to the voices all yours one voice was saying big joe owed your bosses a favour and this was it but now were out of it and the rest of it whatevers going down here is your business just understand this anything goes wrongthats your business too joes legitimate now hes all paidup he owes no money no allegiance to any potbellied pigs in palermo no offence you understand but this is england and sicily is a long way off so you boys are on our turf now just fine as long as you dont go staking any longterm claims in it hey it was a favour youre right a second far more coarse and sinister voice hissed rising and falling in timbre and heavy with unmistakable italian accents a little favour but youve been well paid for it ok well who can say when big joe might need a favour too eh so whats this with all the threats we dont need it and we dont scare any too easy you know just be sure to tell joe we appreciate his help and remember to say thanks from tony and francesco francezci huh the first voice grunted followed by the sounds of footsteps moving away and a door closing and as full consciousness returned to anderson there were other sounds too along with an evenly spaced echoing drip a steady rushing sound or sensation as of vast amounts of water even a river sluicing along directly beneath him but beneath him he was upright seated in a chair underfoot rough wooden boards creaked as he shifted his weight to ease the cramp starting up in his legs and gradually experimentally he tried to force open eyelids that felt gummed down as from sleeping too long or deeply then before he could open them all the way he froze on hearing what could only be a boat or ferry the haunted phoom phoooom of its foghorn somewhere on the river then a cold damp foggy night on the river what a houseboat maybe or a pier and and what the hell someone had to be making a terrible mistake here whatever this was all about theyd got the wrong man finally his eyelids came unstuck and anderson lifted his head from his chest that was painful too sending brilliant jagged flashes of lightning through his skull he hadnt been hit had he hit on the head no it was the chloroform which hed received in what must have been close to an overdose chloroform kidnapped james anderson who didnt have an enemy in the world who would want to do anything like this to him and why he drew a huge draft of air to yell for help and a door opened behind him and a light came on it was dim that light a single unshaded bulb hanging from twisted flex but it came so abruptly and unexpectedly that he jerked back in his chair gave an involuntary yelp of terror and tried to turn his head which only caused him more pain no no came that same hoarse sandpapered voice the one with the italian accent just save your strength and sit still and the owner of the voice stepped into view from somewhere behind anderson and continued you can save your breath too because no one is going to hear you and even if you were able to shout that loudwell were not about to let you in fact there were two of them but not the sort of heavies anderson might have expected from the texture and tone of the voice tall slender dark in their long overcoats their hats set to shade their eyes they seemed more clinically sinister than the thugs his aching mind would have pictured and he knew that these were the ones who had followed him through his gate and that one of them at least had feral eyes and a sick toothy grin they pulled up ricketty chairs sat down facing him with the light behind them so that only the glimmer of their eyes told him there were faces there at all in the shadows cast by the pulleddown brims of their fedoras their eyes and maybe the white glint of grinning teeth too for long seconds nothing was said until anderson could stand it no longer then what is this he gasped what the fucks it all about and he strained against the industrial tape binding his wrists ankles and head to the highbacked chair the pair looked at each other then back at anderson and as he continued to curse and babble one of them reached out a slender almost female hand to grab his throat but the incredible strength in that hand the almost casual way the pressure was oh so slowly increased the deliberate and effortless constriction of the fingers so that anderson knew knew with an absolute certainty that this brute could crush his windpipe to a pulp but even as the knowledge dawned so the steel claw of a hand released him and withdrew he gulped air desperately wanted to massage his throat swallow but couldnt and could no longer hold back the vomit boiling up from his stomach his captors quickly stood up got well out of the way as necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley he gagged managed to turn his head an inch or two to the right and threw up on the floor they let him get it out of his system and as he sat there rigid coughing spitting out the last of the unutterable debris came forward again and the one with the voice said now see what you did it must have been all that abuse all of the unnecessary vitriol eh but the next time you want to be sick just tell me ok i can make you sick faster than youd ever believe whatwhat is it you want anderson tried to turn his face away from the smell of his own vomit but could only manage a few inches swathes of tape across his forehead held his head firmly in place we want to know about ebranch in fact everything about ebranch the second of the two whose voice was soft and sibilant as a hiss leaned closer and this was also the one with hands like steel claws ebranch anderson blinked his watering eyes and darcy clarkes words came back to himsome stupid fucking warning about the official secrets act wellyfac the official secrets act and in any case anderson didnt know anything about bloody ebranch except that it was partpart of the security services he said as much and the one with the gravelly voice said oh but you do you know a great deal about it today we saw you with a mr clarke darcy and a mr trask ben also with a mr kyle alec and we find him mr kyle especially interesting i mean we find all of them interesting but especially him so we can start there tell us about mr kyle but i dont know anyone with that name anderson gulped t wasnt with anyone of that name darcy clarke yes and ben trask too but nowhat kyle no alec kyle no he tried to shake his head moved it to and fro barely sufficiently to emphasize his point you dont know anyone called kyle the hissing one said but we saw you in the car with him anderson tried to nod trask clarke and keogh the one youre talking about is called harry keogh so you see youre making a big mistake here as the two looked at each other anderson saw their faces in silhouette gaunt angular outlines expressionless now and somehow lifeless or if not lifeless then a different kind of life they turned back to him and harry keogh said the one with the snakes hiss tell us about him and as if anticipating the doctors answer he reached into his pocket and took something out a knife a stanley knife with a knob on the handle that he slid forward anderson tried not to see the blade but couldnt take his eyes off it ii dont know anything about him he said and as the hissing one shuffled his chair closer oh god meani dont know very much about him and the one with the knife turned his head to look back a little at the one with the gravelly voice as if he were waiting for him to make a decision which a moment later he did you know he growled but if we let you you could waste an awful lot of time so maybe we can afford the time and maybe not but our patience has its limits so lets simply takea shortcut a short cut yes that sounds right now listen when my friend here has finished with you well go away and let you think it over then when we come back therell be no more questions and answers you will simply tell us all that you know in one long stream one long gush until everything is out because youll know that if you dontwell there are nine or even nineteen more shortcuts the whisperer stood up stepped forwardand anderson tried to cringe down into himself the knife went down down to his left side sliced through the tape binding his hand to the leg of the chair then the whisperer took that hand and gave it a sudden jerk dragging it upright so that anderson yelped his agony as his cramped elbow joint was forced through an angle of one hundred and eighty degrees finally the whisperer used more tape to bind his wrist again this time to the chairs backrest alongside his shoulder with the palm facing forward and no heckling please his tormentor grinned as he shoved a gag in andersons mouth and taped it in place and showed him the knife again the blade was one of those special things it was curved almost hooked shiny and sharp as a surgical tool using it a skilled man would be able to cut the most intricate shapes out of the toughest timber a woodcarvers tool yes or maybe a surgeons aaabout kkeogh anderson somehow managed to mumble around the rag and the tape where it had come unstuck from his bottom lip but ah no the gravelly ones voice was deep now and dark as a dungeon later save it for later you see we have to be sure we get it all and this way we know well get it all for its a small example of whats in store if we dont with which the whispering one trapped andersons wriggling hand and smallest finger applied the blade of his knife to it and commenced to work on the smallest knuckle he made his incision just half an inch back from the quick of the pink fingernail at the permanent crease where the finger bends and with appalling speed and dexterity worked through the thin layer of flesh and cartilage to the bone and around it and between the interface of the balland brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii socket junction so that as the fingertip came loose the stump had only just commenced to spurt it was so quick that anderson barely felt the pain not at first rather he sensed it through goggling eyes that barely believed what they were seeing and as the whisperer or butcher took his spurting finger into his mouth and began sucking on it like a baby on a finger of chocolate the one with the gravel voice said so there you go nineteen shortcuts left or maybe even a few more it all depends on your appetite for pain at which the actual pain not to mention the true horror finally came then as anderson fainted the same man or monster took a thimble from his pocket lined it with cotton wool and taped it over the mutilated finger and his sibilant companion sucked a dribble of andersons blood from his lower lip and whispered waste not want not then popped the severed section fingernail and all into his mouth a tidbit the other nodded but after hes told us all he knows the main course is still to come the necroscope the reluctant necroscope stayed in london for a further week it seemed to him the ideal time and opportunity to work a few things out bonnie jean had said he should get out of the house in bonnyrig for a while so that was ok but she had also said he shouldnt wander too far afield well what was far afield to him he could come and go as he wished provided no one knew how he did it couldnt he coming to london hed taken the train because darcy clarke had known he was coming he hadnt wanted to arrive too quickly or weirdly despite that darcy knew him for what he was and what he could do oh yes he could still do it certainly but reluctantly harry just didnt want to use the mobius continuum that was all not if he could avoid it as for his other thing he wouldnt even let himself think about that for the great majority knew all of them knew what he was and what he could do it made no difference that they couldnt possibly tell anyone that the necroscopes secrets were absolutely safe with them for the danger whatever it was lay in the fact that his talents werent secret from them so he stayed in london a while seven days and tried to work a few things out darcy clarke was happy to have him stay at ebranch hq less than happy with the fact that james anderson had disappeared and the branchs locators couldnt find him in itself their failure wasnt that odd the hypnotist wasnt an operative wasnt an esper as such just someone theyd used from time to time therefore he wasnt much known to the rank and file and his habits were very much unknown he had left very little of an aura with the locators which meant they didnt have much to go on it was that hed vanished now that worried darcy most and that he was probably the only one in the world who could switch harry back onto the right track but having harry here was a good thing even if he wasnt seen too much in and around the hq itself and darcy even dared hope that one day his presence might be permanent for the necroscope was still the most powerful tool for good that ebranch had ever known and used which was of course the problem that theyd used him and then discarded him but not without first making sure hed be of no further use to anyone else not even to himself apparently so the necroscope wandered the streets of london but in fact got very little sorted out and semidetached as it were from his own world of strange metaphysical powers the more he looked out on the real world the less he felt a part of it or of any world london which had never seemed familiar was totally alien to him now utterly strange he was a stranger here adrift in a strange world but he suspected hed feel the same almost anywhere except perhaps in his own place in edinburgh or in the arms of bj mirlu he was adrift yes because his anchor had come loose which was why he called the wine bar at least three times a day every day only to get the same message from bjs answering machine ahm sorry but due tae circumstances beyond mah control the bar has been closed indefinitely bonnie jeans voice her phony edinburghian burr but sounding ohsodistant and seeming more dispassionate every time as if she too were slipping away from him that would be the real breaking point he knew that would be when the world really fell apart if he were about to let it happen but he wasnt harrys last night at ebranch was a restless one he did sleep but derived little benefit from it he was accommodated in his old room which opened directly into the main corridor and about three in the morning his foggy but somehow desperate dreams finally crystalized into something that was more than a dream awake the necroscope no longer had contact with the dead he had all but shut them out of his life asleephe was far more receptive and as for rl stevenson jamieson well he was very determined and no way he was going to be ignored harry necroscope man you is hard to reach whats with you necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley harry i mean you gots to know i wouldnt bother you if it wasnt real important rl is it you harry mumbled and muttered tossing in his bed god cant a man get any sleep around here at first irritated which showed in his attitude and apparent disinterest still there had been that in the black mans dead voice which went several degrees beyond urgency so that despite the barriers that the necroscope was tempted to erect he nevertheless felt inclined to pay attention sensing this rl said necroscope me and my obi has been lookin out for you for a long time now and js tellinyou man you has enemies you has enemies in london and you has em in scotland too theys been watchinyou harryjust bidintheir time watchin and waitin yellow men harry answered because in sleep the borders between the various levels of knowledge and being are far less clearly defined also because yellow men were on his mind in connection with the bomb dont know what colour or creed they is only that theys there rl answered and sighed his relief that the necroscope was listening then quickly continuing also that maybe what they was waitinfor has come come what are you talking about rl maybe youd better come again but harrys attention was fully centered now not what but who rl told him him necroscope the one they was waitinfor and hes just bout the worst not just a watcher but aa doer a boss and hes here close andgettin closer all the time he came quick tonight right out o the blue and i can feel him like a fog over a swamp reachin out for you harry felt the alien cold in rls dead voice and said out of the blue he clung to that he came by airplane is that what i said rl thought about it i suppose it be anyway hes here and the others is clustered to him but like i said they was watchers kinda small fry you know and this ones a doer whats morehe knows where you is necroscope so theres danger everywhere harry answered in edinburgh and here too but the real nature of the threat continued to elude him and rl dared not enlighten him in all three places the dead man said stepping a little outside the parameters of his mission what harry hadnt failed to notice a certain emphasis did you say three places where else then buried harry buried deep buriedrealdeep what is the necroscope was definitely interested now but he was anxious too for he could sense the dead man slipping away from him perhaps deliberately whats buried deep rl cant say no more harry believe me id really like to but it gots to break in its own sweet time or might could be you d end up broken too rightalongwithit with which he was gone necroscope the lost years vol ii ill victims a few hours earlier some three hundred and fifty miles away in scotland zahanine had been watching harry keoghs place for a week which had to be the most frustrating unrewarding job that bonnie jean had ever given her and in this cold wet weather the dreariest keep an eye on harry follow him oh really that time a week ago he had been in the house she knew that for sure then no longer in the house gone and she hadnt seen him go since when never a sign of him no smoke from the chimney or lights of an evening no answer when finally shed lost patience and gone knocking at the door the man was some kind of ghost a very attractive mysterious ghost but just as spooky as the rest of them which from someone like zahanine was a compliment but to be here in the third week in february at midnight on a night like thisshe supposed she should consider herself lucky it wasnt snowing anyway she would stick it out for another hour and then shed be out of here but she knew she would have to be back again at seven in the morning that was the routine bonnie jean had set until he was back for harry keogh was very important to her and to them and to everything and b j had spared no effort in making her point he is everything shed told the girls before they quit the winebar and went into hiding without him theres no me no you no tomorrow i mean that quite literally let anything happen to him if s all over done finished hes the one and only one in whatever shape or form harry keogh is the future mine and yours that was why she had told him to go missing for a while because of all the trouble that was brewing well fine except he was still missing a week had gone by and zahanine was sick to death of these seemingly interminable sixhour shifts spent watching his place but it was one of only two places bj had known to look the second was her winebar in town where even now one of the other girls would be keeping watch for him distracted by her own thought processes bored by tedium and no longer concentrating on the job zahanine almost failed to notice the flickering headlight beams sweeping briefly over the nights faintly glowing horizon and painting the stonework of the old bridge across the river yellow the bridge was half a mile down the road and by the time shed used her sleeve to clear a patch in the lightly misted windscreen there was only a telltale splash of yellow on the far side of the water rapidly fading to darkness so that even now she wasnt one hundred per cent sure that a vehicle had crossed the bridge but at least it had served to waken her up a little zahanine got out of her car and trained her glasses on the black silhouette of the old house was that a yellow glow over the rooftops suddenly switched off leaving the ridge and chimney even darker against the velvet sheen of the night and now she felt a certain elation that perhaps her vigil wasnt in vain after all seconds then minutes ticked by and a light came on downstairs then another upstairs in the bedroom harry was back zahanine started up the car drove a mile into bonnyrig a public telephone box and calling bj told her what shed seen then she suggested t could put a note in his letterbox let him know where you are no nothing like that bj cautioned no notes or letters nothing that might tell someone else where we are first let me speak to him call me again in five minutes and five minutes later zahanine did just that but on the other end of the line bj was furious his phone is off the hook she said either hes using it or hes still afraid of the damn thing but time is wasting so dont ask me about that and after a moments thoughtful silence maybe he just doesnt want to be disturbed doesnt want to have to identify himself she said its possible he went back to pick up a few things i dont know but you can find out zahanine he knows you go to the house and tell him where i am no written messages but a spoken one after that he can make his own way here or come with you whichever but if hes going to be in the house any length of time tell him to be on his guard and tell him to put the phone on the hook so i can speak to him and you can give him my phone number but make him remember it dont write it down now tell me did you get all that yes zahanine answered breathlessly tin to go to him tell him where you are give him your number but in his head im to tell him to be careful if hes going to be in the house for a while if hes not brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii then he can come with me or make his own way to you thats it good go now two or three minutes to get back to harrys place there was a car parked on the rutted track behind the house zahanine parked a hundred yards away approached as quietly as she could on foot this was simply so as not to alarm harry then she was up the path and knocking on the door from inside no response utter silence but the upstairs lights went out zahanine waited a minute or so then knocked again calling softly harry its me zahanine one of bjs girls and as the door ohsoswiftly opened an oddlyaccented voice behind her said why so it is but it wasnt harrys voice zahanine was feraleyed in the dark nightsighted as all bjs moonchildren the man in the doorway was medium height had slightly tilted eyes and was yellow asiatic as for the one behind her hed be cut of much the same cloth drakuls twisting her supple body zahanine let fly with a foot to the groin of the one before her at the same time striking with the edge of her hand at the one behind her foot found its soft target but the one behind leaned backwards out of range and fired his silenced handgun from no more than four feet away it made a sound like a big cat spitting the bullet hit her on the inside of her left breast went deep lodged beside her heart and it was a silver bullet the assassin had slowhealing sores on his fingers cracked flesh from filling his weapons magazine with silver bullets zahanine was lifted from her feet and tossed back into the crouched moaning form of the man in the doorway where he cradled his aching testicles her sudden weight knocked him off his feet bowling him over in the narrow corridor the pair of them went sprawling the one outside looked back into the darkness glanced this way and that furtively and sniffed the air with a flattened nose then pointed his gun straight ahead and moved inside closing the door he dropped the catch on the security lock zahanine was on her feet her hands pressed to her chest wild wolfish she bared sharp white teeth turned and kicked again at the one crumpled on the floor as she stepped over him then she fled stumbled went bouncing from wall to wall along the corridor and finally lurched headlong into harrys study but the one with the gun was right behind her and as she made for the patio doors he fired again the first bullet was a whitehot agony as if someone had slid a poker into her chest and it was a pain that would kill her zahanine knew even without the second shot but at least that one put an end to the pain caught up again in the same massive fist her spine shattered she was driven through the patio doors in a tearing of glass and a splintering of narrow mullions face down in the garden she lay bloodied and dying and her killer put his gun away caught up her ankles and yanked her backwards through broken glass into the room barely conscious she didnt even feel it when the killers companion was able to come from the corridor he found him between her legs tearing her flimsy underclothes away and eh he groaned in their own tongue what are you doing is the bitch dead he continued to gentle his sore testicles shes dying the other grunted and much too soon but lets face it she wasnt going to be taken alive you should take care the other cautioned she could be a lieutenant no the one on the floor gasped as he entered the girl at the same time sucking at the scarlet hole in her breast but he paused to explain if she wasright now thered be hell to pay wed have to burn the house down it would attract attention and perhaps alert mr kyle or his werewolf bitch that is something we cant uh afford but what youre doingwould drakesh approve the killer looked back over his shoulder said i dont know and i cant ask him but compared to those docile flatchested cows in the walled city this one is just ripe for it and shes a member of the pack the last drakul told us to get the job done not how to do it myself ive gone without long enough and you youre putting me off so go and search her car find her handbag anything but let me get done uh fucking her his partner turned away and over his shoulder said in that case you can fuck her for me too and he went achingly back down the corridor grinding away in the girl the vampire on the floor felt her body begin to shudder vibrate looking directly into her face he saw her eyes open and blaze up yellow he sensed her enormous effort he felt the contraction of exhausted muscles and gaped his disbelief as zahanines arms bent at the elbows and her hands came off the floor her nails were longand they were bleeding bleeding as they elongated from the quick and thickened into hooked claws he felt their trembling those shivering shuddering claws jerked back his face as they ohsogently touched him a mere touch that left five scarlet tracks down each side from the orbits of his eyes to his quivering chin as he wrenched himself free zahanines first and final attempt at metamorphism the true lycanthropy necroscope the lost yean vol ii brian lumley but it was over her claws shrank back into fingers her arms flopped to the floor her eyes glazed and slowly closed as she breathed a wolfs last breath breathed it out and outuntil it was gone her killer cursed adjusted his clothing headed for the kitchen to see if he could find a meat cleaver and on harry keoghs desk the telephone went purrrrrrrr where it had been lifted from its cradle francesco francezci had flown in from sicily around midnight three of his own people a youngish goodlooking lieutenant called vincent ragusa a senior thrall guy tanziano and the francezci pilot luigi manoza had accompanied him staying at the airport hotel overnight the four men had tidied up before meeting in francescos suite this is how it is he told the others tomorrow first light vincent flies up to edinburgh and joins up with a longtime friend of ours angus mcgowan mcgowan has been in scotland oh just about forever he knows his way around knows the country the people and their customs and he knows where radu is close enough anyway radus actual location his den or lair that wont be known until the last minute unless we get lucky but somewhere in a little village in the spey valley theres a thrall a moonchild a man or maybe a woman with too much fucking wolf in him and this thrall of the doglord does know where radu is definitely so thats where you and angus mcgowan are going vincent looking for radus friend or friends in the cairngorms in the event you find them mcgowan knows what to do youll take your orders from him remember mcgowan has been one of ours a lieutenant for a very long time longer than youve lived hell know you and hell pick you up at edinburgh airport so those are the arrangements any questions the others around the table were at ease vincent ragusa less so waiting for him to speak up if he intended to tanziano and manoza looked at him then at francesco or the francezci as they thought of him wamphyri francesco was adaptable in high sicilian society he would be and was eminently acceptable on a rainy day at ascot in the royal enclosure he would seem and had seemed perfectly at home but when in rome or in london in the company of lieutenants and common thralls he could just as easily do and say as they did and think that way too ragusa was maybe fivenine slender and handsome with an italian vampires good looks of old mafiosi stock he dressed expensively but tastelessly shrugging and managing to look a little disappointed he said you know i was hoping to join up with jimmy and frank theyre my boys i mean you and anthony put me in charge of them back at le manse madonie your boys yes francesco nodded understandingly or perhaps not and after a moments thought said the thing is youre all our boys and this isnt le manse madonie its england and later scotland and we didnt plan ahead for the fun of it and we arent here for the fun of it you and mcgowan up in scotland two strong lieutenants looking out for each other eh and a little later luigi too three of you that gives you real strength and myself dancer jimmy and frank down here in london that makes us a strong team too then finally we all join up and were unbeatablenow have you got that ragusa nodded his understanding but said if s like dont know a lot of guys to waste just one lousy dog francesco sighed and narrowed his eyes his jetblack nostrils gaped a little but then he grinned which would be fine except that his grin widened and widened until finally vincent he husked tour grandfather was a don he is dead your father was a don hes dead too so who knows maybe its something that runs in the family all that power and they still wind up dead and now you more power coming your way than your ancestors would ever believe more to live for a lot more and longer much longer to live and enjoy it yet now and then the way you talk he shook his now terrible head a bad sign hey francesco im sorry ragusa saw his error like no offence right i mean i know this radu is something big but francesco stopped grinning stuck his face forward across the small table where they sat snarled vincent let me tell you something this radu could drive a hand through your navel grab your liver and pick you up by it and before you had time to start screaming bite your fucking face off his jaws gaped wide and his eyes were the colour of blood yes and for that matter he said his voice dying to a hoarse whisper so could i ii didnt mean ragusas face always pale was now white as chalk you dont mean fuck francesco said so thats it its dealt with he slapped his hands together in a slicing dismissive motion youtl do exactly as i tell you but just to be absolutely sure are there any more questions nothing ragusa shook his head held up his hands placatingly palms facing outwards no questions no nothing uhuh francesco scowled sat back and as if vincent ragusa no longer existed said luigi you know what your job is whats this problem with the thewhat are they called the caa manoza answered civil aviation authority i have to necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley register with them thats all theyll issue a temporary licence anyway we have a contact on their exec i can buy him if were pushed for time no problem sort it out francesco told him were going to need a chopper and soon and it has to be able to carry more than our machine back in sicily now listen everyone i want you to remember our reason for being here were scouting a location for a movie a climbing movie probably in the scottish highlands the british will stand to make lots of money from it and the british authorities are worse than americans when it comes to money likewise the scots and not only by reputation so if you want cooperation try flashing some highdenomination dollars itll work here like anywhere else grinning a normal grin this time he turned again to manoza when youve got a plane and if im still in london well fly up to scotland the rest of us that is but first i have a little business here its possible we have a real line on the intruder we may finally find out who he is and why and how he hit our vault at le manse madonie and then make sure he cant do it cant do anything ever again and lastly to guy tanziano dancer you stay with me tanziano bulletheaded six foot tall and sixteen stone yet light as a dancer on his feet a common thrall with an uncommon appetite and reputation for brutality merely nodded the meeting was over darcy clarke took harry to kings cross in the greyest ghostliest hours of morning when the ragged ones are out discarded pages from yesterdays newsprint drifting aloft on the draughts from canyon streetjunctions those ragged ones and the other sort the stumbling kind with their bottles of nameless stuff in paper bags both sorts were thinning out however and disappearing wherever they disappear to london was coming awake however slowly and the station already noisy thronging with people the necroscope caught the first train north he had seemed irritable and darcy himself wasnt entirely awake yet or he might have simply dropped harry at the station and returned to ebranch hq finally on his way back suddenly he realized what the problem had been and felt like kicking himself the necroscope would have preferred to go home by his own route maybe but he hadnt been able to because darcy was in the way oh well too late now but in fact it wasnt the train was barely fifteen minutes out of the station before harry bought himself a paper cup of vile coffee in the buffet car then swaying right on through the cramped buffet area into the firstclass coach he checked the passengers there were only a handful of them reading newspapers and magazines all facing forward and away from him and no one in the buffet car behind him perfect without thinking about it he conjured a mobius door and stepped through it and out again into his study in edinburgh where he dropped his coffee from nerveless fingers and before he was capable of rational thought he thought this has to be my punishment for using the continuum his coffee had splashed the naked thigh of the black girl the black and red girl where he had stumbled over her zahanineone of bjs girlsdeadhere still without thinking what he was doing numb he went to the kitchen and came back with paper towels got down and wiped the cold coffee from her thigh then slowly balled the towels tossed them aside and jerked spastically to his feet coffee jesus god in heaven coffee a black bullet hole gaped in the girls left breast her skirt was bunched up round her waist and her blouse was stuck to the throw rug with dried blood indeed the rug was drenched in blood worse zahanines head lay under harrys desk where it had been kicked three or four feet from her body a bloody meat cleaver lay there too and this charnel house was his study the necroscope stumbled back from the girls body from everything and fell into his chair and sprang out of it at once as he heard a car pull up out front in the corridor still not knowing what he was doing but trying desperately hard to pull it all together harry went to the door and found it shut but unlocked as he reached to engage the security catch he heard footsteps that paused beyond the door a double knock and a breathless harry bj he yanked open the door fell back against the wall of the corridor she stepped inside took one look at himand his expression must have said it all then bj he sighed and wrapped his arms around her but as he hugged her so she felt him tense up again felt the relief the tenderness the welcome turning to something else harry what is it her eyes were as wide and staring as his had been just a moment earlier but now as he pushed her away held her at arms length and looked at her as if he were trying to look right through her those ohsodeep eyes of his had narrowed to become part of a frown or even an accusation what is it he repeated her maybe you can tell me and b j this necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lutnley time i do mean tell me catching her wrist he half dragged her along the corridor past the front room stairwell and kitchen to his study where she saw what it was zahaninef it came out of her as a wail a very small cry a gasp oh zahanine then she was down on her knees fluttering her hands inches over the body wanting to touch it here there everywhere and touching it nowhere i got in fifteen minutes ago the necroscope lied this is what i found he got down beside bj and at last was able to look at the body and see more than blood she was shot and dont know tortured raped before she was beheaded but why bj why and i know you know oh im sure youre an innocent wrongheaded but innocent but you do know whats going on here and you have to tell me harry i this is why you wanted me out of the way right because something like this could have happened to me harry yellow men he stood up pulled b j up with him what about the asiatics tell me about them but why this aching sensation deep inside this burgeoning feeling of something waiting to cut loose like a word on the tip of his tongue that try as he might he couldnt remember was it simply the need for action revenge justiceor something else harry b j snapped trying to pull him out of it but no he snapped back tell me now bj he was angry angry and impatient his lips were tight showing a narrow bar of gritted teeth b j saw the warning signals reading them like a threat in his eyes his voice and attitude tilting her head a little perhaps warningly in her own right maybe even threateningly haaarrry she began to growl and he gasped reached to cover her mouth with a hand but too late as bj finished in something of panic mah wee man the moonthe wolfs headthe howling and at last the calm descending like a blanket over his troubled mind harry blinked and the anger the questions and the fear went out of him for bj was here to put things back in order again and she did by telling him its ok harry and by hugging him to stop him reeling and maybe falling sit down he blinked again shook his head waited for her to go on as he obeyed her and sat in his chair by the desk it will beok she said again trying to believe it herself but oh whereve you been and before he could answer no never mind that now just let me think she had come within an inch of learning the truth his truth at least and by her own command had thrown it away b j looked at the body on the floor its head beneath the desk at harrys feet and grimaced and almost or wholly to herself they were making sure she said he wondered of what but inside knew of what except that couldnt be because bj and her girls were innocent how could they bewhat she was suggesting they were when she herself wasnt he reeled again swaying in his chair and bj saw her mistake making sure she was dead she told him that she wasnt going to be able to talk to anyone aboutabout this oh really well the necroscope knew someone who zahanine could talk to about it but he couldnt or wouldnt and certainly not while bj was here and still he said nothing b j looked at him and it was as if she were here on her own or at best with a zombie but that was all her own doing too you can talk she said talk normally tell me what i should do a new twist he should tell her what to do but it was a genuine appeal to harry and not to what shed made him turn me loose he said with that certain something in his voice she looked at him and he was no longer the zombie he had that look like the first time she had seen him or in the spey valley when they had killed those drakuls the mysterious one radus manwithtwofaces mysterious because hed been trained to be that way by these people hed worked for this ebranch a man with two faces yes the one face a mask to obscure the true nature of the one underneath the face of a killer in the name of justice and now harry was asking to be turned loose in the name of bonnie jean or more properly in the name of radu and why not for she had told him it might come to this hadnt she but no she would not dare not put him in that kind of danger not her harry and not when there were so many greater dangers ahead for both of them you dont know what youre saying she told him b j saw the sweat break out on harrys face and actually heard his teeth grating it was something shed noticed before in times of stress and she thought his mind is stuck in neutral where ive brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii jammed the gears he knows we must do something but can only act on my command zahanine she said we cant let her be found here like this the drakuls did this they could be on a phone somewhere speaking to the police even now they could be trying to corner me or you or us and startle us to flight cut down on our options then when we run theyll be right on our heels knowing where were running to do you understand to radu he nodded we have to get rid of zahanine b js hand flew to her mouth i mean we have to get her out of here but i cant damn it cant think zahanine thought it was you last night but it was them and i sent her here she came here of her own free will she was rambling for one of only a very few times in her toolong life bj knew she was actually panicking harry i dont know what to do with zahanine and her car is parked down the service road near the bridge what can we do with her and the car do you know of anywhere we candump them i mean do you know any fucking thing she grabbed hold of his collar shook his head to and fro do you have a single fucking suggestion these were direct questions and he could answer them normally and yes he did know somewhere and he did have some suggestions you get out of here he said right now and leave this to me but first tell me where to find you then when im done join you just like that delivered like a right to the jaw so that she jerked back from him her eyes wide wild and disbelieving there were depths here she still hadnt explored still didnt understand harry got to his feet where are you staying she told him the place where he and she had breakfasted the first time they had gone climbing together a roadside pub this side of falkirk they have rooms the girls and i were supposed to be doing a local survey a census of people living in the area but most of the time theyve been out looking for you youre a hard man to find harry keogh and a hard one to follow a hard act to follow too yes he was and hed said he could handle this which was just as well because right now bj didnt feel she could handle much of anything will you need help she could at least make the effort for him for them he shook his head you go ill follow as soon as i can tm going to turn you off now harry she said but you will remember what you have to do the things you do so well and where to find me when theyre done bj he said and held her tightly while she whispered in his ear harry mah wee man it was like waking up from a bad dream to a worse one but bj had gone and the necroscope knew what he had to do he placed zahanines head and the cleaver on the throw rug with her body rolled the rug up and tied its ends with string finally rolled the whole bundle again in a sheet of clear plastic packaging from the new carpeting in his bedroom there was a place he knew where zahanine would never be found or if she was it wouldnt much matter then he brought a carpet from the front room to cover the dark spot on the floor and made a final check of the house to see if there was anything hed missed but no the place would seem absolutely normal to anyone who didnt know better but harry did know better and there was a certain smell that the draught from the broken patio windows was having difficulty dispersing or maybe it was only in his mind in any case he used a deodorant spray which seemed to help a little then he called a handyman he knew in bonnyrig and told him about the damage to the window i wont be here he said so ill leave the front door locked youll have to go to the back of the house on the rivers side and get in through the garden gate when youre done leave the patio doors secured as simple as that and then the difficult bit harry went to zahanines car the keys were in the ignition and he was able to drive it back to the house back indoors he put a penknife in his pocket hoisted the rolledup rug and its contents to his shoulder took it out to the car and placed it as gently as possible in the boot all done he checked that no one was about which wasnt likely for in this place no one ever was about and the highway which was in fact a country road and the only vantage point was on the other side of the river on the far side of the house finally satisfied that he was alone unobserved he got back in the car and drove it very slowly forward in first gear and as he drove he set familiar mobius equations rolling down the screen of his metaphysical mind to conjure a broad squat door directly in front of the car and drove through it moments later he vacated the continuum on the roof of the world the tingri plateau tibetin a snowstorm the car stalled at once sank through a frozen crust into a deep drift gradually settled on compacting snow harry wound down his window slid out backwards onto the crust of snow and flailed through the drift and the blizzard to the boot already feeling the intense cold he dragged the bundle out and cut it open men propped brian lumley zahanine against the back of the car it was cold so terribly cold but the necroscope knew she couldnt feel it and he hadnt wanted to leave her locked away like that in the stifling dark the darkness of death when at last she had accepted it would be bad enough but just looking at her he knew it wasnt right zahanine wasnt complete and shuddering also from the cold he took her head and placed it on the neck in another minute it would be frozen there and he would be frozen here if he didnt get moving but first there was something he must do and somehow the sheer desolation the utter isolation of the place helped him to do it not a conversation with zahanine no but he did know what would be on her mind and here in this place this icy windswept nowhere place he dropped his mental barriers to let a different kind of cold come creeping in she would feel his warmth and know it for life she would huddle to it a frightened mouse and in that moment the darkness would recede a little and zahanine would remember cruel perhaps but not as cruel as what had happened to her for the necroscope didnt know what she had been only what she was now a lonely frightened dead thing foresaken of life and he was right her whimper came to him and the feel of her wraiths arms around him like the little match girl crushing to the tiny bonfire of her own worthless matches to draw a last ounce of warmth from it but he wasnt afraid not of the girl this was what he was after all and what he had used to do and with the exception of his lost son he was the only one who could do it he was life and she knew it which caused her to remember her own life and how it had ended and the necroscope was witness to it the slanteyed lustful yellow face leering down on her and the feel of his cold member in her then his eyes widening and the look on his face changing as she reached up trembling hands to it the feel of his skin caught up under her scraping fingernails and torn away in ten red stripes and then this the endless darkness that harry had woken her up to so that now zahanine knew for sure that beyond any shadow of a doubt she was but no the necroscope didnt want to hear it what he had heard so often before that sudden tortured shriek of denial and he brought the barriers crashing down on his mind so fast that it unbalanced him sent him staggering back from the halfburied car stumbling on frozen legs but he had seen what hed needed to see confirmation of her necroscope the lost years vol ii murderer and now all he wanted was to be out of here it was still only am in london in the disused dockside warehouse with its loading bay that jutted out over the river where dr james anderson had spent the last terrified agonized week of his life and slow death but his torment was over now and his vampire torturers were still baffled you should have left it to me the francezci told his thralls jimmy nicosia and frank potenza what did you think you were still under orders from vincent did you think you were the mob youre mine mine and anthonys youre francezcis and thisisnt us shaking his head he gloomed over the mess that had been a man its simple butchery and worse it served no purpose you got nothing out of him er something we got something francesco jimmy nicosia tried hard not to grovel and we didnt have much choice we couldnt be here twentyfour hours a day not and keep an eye on these ebranch types and that in itself is a problem you follow those guys you look at some of them for too long sooner or later they turn and look right back at you these people are something else francesco not the kind youd want to mess with there isnt any kind i cant mess with the francesci snarled buti take your point ive heard the same sort of thing before and from people who are supposed to know what theyre doing thats why we chose this anderson he glanced again at the remains of a man he isnt wasnt part of their organization just someone they used but not any more frank potenza whispered smiling his widemouthed emotionless yet oddly girlish smile all of the francezcis displeasure had been wasted on him francesco scowled at him but knew it was useless to do more than that despite potenzas androgynous nature he was muscle with very little of mind he was simply weird he knew how to whittle flesh but nothing of terrors true subtleties therefore pointless to punish him you might as well kick a pet cat he wouldnt understand but would simply lash out at you claw you and then youd have to kill him it was best to ignore him which francesco did by turning again to nicosia ok i accept that this was an accident you sought to slow anderson down to stop him trying to escape and weaken his mental resistance by weakening him physically but you went too far still as you say you did get something so go over it again everything he told you four years ago nicosia began ebranch called him in to hypnotize this harry keogh character or the one they call harry necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley keogh he was to restrict keoghs talents dont ask me what talents so that when keogh left the branch he couldnt be put to use by any other organization all anderson knew was that keogh was hot stuff darcy clarke head of branch and all the other weird fucks thought very highly of him but they didnt want him doing whatever it was he did for anyone else he gave a shrug fell silent and thats it francesco was baffled or maybe not until a week ago then clarke contacted anderson again told him to come on in take a look at keogh it was then that we saw them all together for the first time anderson clarke trask and keogh and when they split up we took our chance and got a hold of anderson it seemed the right thing to donot just because wed been told to do it but because plainly anderson and keogh knew each other or why would they be in company with each other the francezci nodded tou were told to pick him up not to kill him anyway what about anderson taking a look at this keogh what was that all about what was he looking for nicosia shrugged clarke was worried that andersons hypnosis what hed done to keogh the first time four years ago had gone too deep he wanted andersons opinion and also to know if it was reversible anderson told him it was and that he would go back that night and fix it give him back these special talents yeah i suppose but he didnt because we had him but still no mention of what these skills were francesco we tried nicosia threw up his hands hell you can see how we tried but anderson didnt know i swear it hed never known in the first place and francesco growled thats the bit that kills it he didnt fucking know well maybe he did know but it was so big he would go through all of this to hide it and again he glanced at the debris of a man but in fact he suspected that nicosia was right no man would be capable of suffering a fraction of this without talking his head offif he had anything to talk about as for kyles or keoghs talents maybe francesco already knew what theyd been and what they still might be the man had to be some kind of living ghost he came and went and left no tracks steel doors labyrinthine tunnel systems and combination locks couldnt stop him and his obvious contempt for all such wasdestructive and expensive naturally ebranch would want him intact especially if they were going to try that stuff again or if they knew about radu and planned to use him against the doglord francesco what more can i tell you nicosia was downcast thats it everything he looked this way and that as if wishing there were more to say but knowing that the francezci wouldnt buy any pretty packaging he was only interested in facts and francesco thought yes hed make a good loyal lieutenant but frank potenza spoiled the moment by grinning in a gauntly girlish whatthehell fashion and whispering anyways it wasnt all waste and francesco knew what he meant that not too much blood had been spilled here not spilled anyway but potenzawas an irritation a big itch and sooner or later francesco knew he would have to scratch but not while there was a job to be done later when all of this was over time enough then to take care of that as for potenzas immediate superior in the francezci chain of command vincent ragusait might also be time to rethink his position in the grand scheme of things jimmy nicosia would make a better lieutenant for sure and without complaint without trying to be an original thinker but for now the francezci relaxed smiled and said very well let it go later i have to call anthony tell him whats gone down and find out whats next hes our contact with the old man who we hope will give us his best cooperation the pair of thralls knew who he was referring to angelo francezci in his pit at le manse madonie they blanched a little even potenza and instinctively backed off a pace but francesco merely smiled changed the subject and said i dont think well be in london too long luigi is sorting out a helicopter vincent is on his way to edinburgh and dancers at the dorchester getting rooms you twodo nothing just wait for me to get in touch with you but as he made to leave he glanced back at them and said oh yes and before you get out of here make sure that that he looked for the last time on andersons remains goes into the river after he had left they did just that opened a trapdoor in the floor and disposed of the evidence there were several splashes in the morning mist on the thames some loud others faint the last thing to go was an arm blanched to alabaster its hand had a thumb and index finger and three stumps the other arm already bobbing its way to the sea nibbled on by small fishes and freshwater shrimp had no fingers at all necroscope the lost years vol ii iv anthony and angelo afraid radu awake bonnie jean innocent two hours earlier and more than a thousand miles away it was the first hour of a dim grey dawn under a lowering ceiling of cloud slowly churning the sky released banks of spumelike moisture not quite rain to sprawl on the high plateau pile up against the outer walls of le manse madonie and roll over them in queasy waves into the courtyard anthony francezci had been about his business most of the night with francesco out of the way indeed from the moment anthonys brother had left sicily for england their grotesque father angelo had been more voluble more forthcoming he had more in common with anthony and found him easier to talk to than francesco who had always been something of a thorn in his side as to what they had spent time in the early hours of the morning talking aboutjust such subjects and one especially had served to prompt the nightmares which would later plague anthonys dreams called by his loathsome father within an hour or so of francescos departure anthony had been unable to attend him immediately but as evening turned to night he had sensed an increase in the mental babble the telepathic confusion emanating from below and in the small hours of the morning he had visited the pit then from an awkward beginning their talk had finally evolved into an hour or so of conversation broken only by the occasional interruptions of angelos multiminds after that not long before dawn anthony had gone to a female thrall for sex blood comfort then to his own bed intending to sleep until late evening when he was due a call from francesco with a little luck his brother would have good or at least promising news from london and certainly anthony had news for him namely the substance of his conversation with the thing in the pit or some of it now with the dawn he nightmared by no means an uncommon thing among vampires for the dawn is not their time indeed it is the one time when the otherwise mainly invulnerable are most vulnerable when the worst fears in the subconscious minds of such monsters take on the shapes of reality and their memories conjure once more the terrors of their youths tony francezci was no exception though in his case memories out of time were not especially horrificnot to him he was what he was by birth and as such had developed free of any lingering impressions of wamphyri conversion therefore he didnt dream any common thralls or lieutenants nightmares of what he had been and what he was now but of what he might yet become which was a horror without peer unless it lay in the hideous shape and substance of his father angelo the devolved and everdevolving thing in the pit under le manse madonie first before the actual horror he relived his conversation with the old ferenczy more or less as it had taken place except he was vaguely aware that somewhere behind the spoken words something darker was building as in the atmosphere of a welllit room that gradually glooms over with the slow but irresistible approach of a storm father he whispered into the mouth of the echoing pit francesco has gone to england he has men with him they will seek out radus thralls and follow them to the doglord in the hour of his resurgence and we have heeded your words already our advance party isinterrogating a man believed to be in league with the one who raided our vault this harry of whom you spoke also well soon have men in scotland who will seek out radus thralls there discover their weaknesses and eventually destroy them but now we need your help too for only you can see afar and know whafs in the minds of men anthony paused and in a while continued and father i know that you have been spending more and more time looking outwards for i have felt it even francesco has felt it and he iswell far less sensitive than i am so anything you have learned could be of great benefit the mouth of the pit was open its electrified grille was switched off and anthony had raised one flap of the cover the spotlights in the cavern walls blazed down lighting the pits surroundings in overlapping circles of stark white light outside that central glare was blackness and anthonys shadow an elongated inkblot poured on the cold stone floor behind him the reason the power was off and the shaft halfopen was simple it was a precaution the francezci brothers used to insure against necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lutnley inadvertent selfelectrocution the old well was after all a deep one and angelo no longer capable of attempting an escape his disorder the rampant metamorphism that had altered him to a protoplasmic thing was such that he no longer had any control over his bulk it controlled itself albeit mindlessly and therefore was mainly without menace the current procedures existed from a time when angelo had retained a small measure of control that they were still in usewas simply another precaution it was never a good idea to secondguess the old ferenczy anthony leaned on the low stone wall to look down into the silent sentient throat of hell within the shaft light penetrated maybe nine or ten feet below that the darkness increased commensurate with the depth until it seemed absolute and this was a darkness that seethed but while anthony could feel angelos hidden intelligence and while he knew that he had his fathers attention still the telepathic aether carried no message but merely conveyed an awareness of angelos vast mental presence this in addition to that almost physical foreboding on the rim of anthonys subconscious perceptions warning him that something was coming then losing patience unwilling to remain in this place any longer conversing with himself he tried a threat however subtle father always remember it is still true that whatever endangers me endangers you should the francezcis come to harm and le manse madonie fall then we all fall with it including the old ferenczy for who would suffer such as you to live except myself and my brother perhaps during the actual conversation he had not been so forthright but these were the words he would have liked to use and so he used them in his dream the pit seemed to cling to one word and threw it back at him as an echo suffer suffer suffer but it was in fact anthonys father goaded into speech at last and suffer angelos telepathic voice but a definite voice now gurgling in anthonys head took over where the echo had left off and you know all about suffering do you and you can tell me something about suffering eh hah the worst thing you have ever suffered was being born but what i have sufferedis worse than death argumentative but it was better than nothing and anthony was skilled at wordgames in his own right if he could involve his father inveigle or even challenge him then with luck he might also be able to lead him in a more cooperative direction wherefore what he said but if your fate is so disenchanting if what you are suffering really is worse than death the true death am i to understand you would prefer death if so then speak up for as you are probably aware your other son my brother francesco has been counselling just such a solution to your problem for many a long year again the words were harder than those he had actually used but in any case suddenly the psychic aether was ripped apart in a demented telepathic storm do it like a great roar of joy subsiding at once to a hoarse crazed gurgle of anticipation do it kill the ferenczy kill the old bastard kill all of us kill us yesss a womans voice this time and one that anthony recognized immediately it was julietta sclafani vampirized by francesco before the brothers had sent her to hell bubbling now with an evil that could never know release except in the death of the thing in the pit kill angelo and kill us with him kill all of us now and put an end to our hell and oh hohoho oh hahahaaarrr a mad voice almost entirely insane yet knowing and willing enough to shriek at the end of its burst of crazed laughter kill kill kill him kill angelo ferenczy and a host of others all of the brothers and angelos victims who had gone to feed him in his pit all joining in the blast from the gross mad brain that was the nucleus of the mutant thing all of these identities imprinted upon or absorbed within his mind much as his protoplasm had absorbed their flesh and just exactly like that metamorphic flesh they were no longer under angelos control anthony knew it at once his father had lost control of the imprisoned multiminds but how he wanted to know as the babble subsided to a background rumble because of this harry as you see fit to call him the tning in the pit answered at once this englishman this harry whose second name is keogh and whose dead friends and they are legion call the necroscope do you know what a necroscope is anthony my dear anthony anthony was not an ignorant man no one with the weight of years the guile of the wamphyri could be entirely ignorant aa viewer on the dead he answered wonderingly indeed his father answered and more a speaker with the dead but didnt i say so right from the beginning the man who broke into your treasure vault your intruder this harry is no an angry voice shouted him down dont let him talk through his vampire sons he puts harry in danger and the rest of them joined in a tidal wave of mental emanations from the pit brian lumley but angelo whose psychic maelstrom had sucked them in in the first place could not be shouted down aiming his sending directly into anthonys reeling mind he said me they feared which was my only hold on them they didn tknow what i could what i mightdo to them or what i was capable of doing they feared me because they were my prisoners trapped in me as i am trapped in this pit and no hope of rescue but him this harry they love because he would set them freeby destroying me and anthony ah my anthony despite everything youve learned and think you know about the passions of the world human love is stronger far than fear father anthony said then trying to aim his thoughts as angelo had done to break through the telepathic tumult thrown up against him this harry is as good as dead if hes really the man who broke into our vault then he has always been dead and it was just a matter of time but tomorrow im speaking to francesco and we shall make keoghs death a priority you say hes a necroscope what the necroscope and talks to dead people well take it from me soon hell be in the best possible place to practice his skills you dont understand do you his father said then do you even believe me doubtful but powers such as this one possessesyou have no idea what youre up against until he came along radu lykan was the greatest possible threat the greatest threat imaginable but this man anthony could picture him shaking his head as if in disbelief but doesnt that say it all father he asked i mean havent you said it all this man you said well thats all he is a man while we are wamphyri he talks to dead peopletalks to dead peopledead people angelo started to babble to echo himself and immediately reined back it was the multiminds interfering with his thought processes he talks to people in their graves he began again and all the worlds knowledge is down there with them but even if what you say were possible anthony argued in an attempt to steer his father in a useful direction what good is dead knowledge how may anyone harness such knowledge to make it work for him angelo gave a snort of derision frustration huh and i had thought only one of my sons was a fool then before anthony could protest or make any further comment now listen the dead converse in their graves with each other the first time took a victim absorbed into myself i suspected it was so dont you understand the mind went on in me and what of those buried in the earth or gone up into the air in smoke it is the same their thoughts spirits if you will live on and now through the necroscope harry keogh theyve learned to converse in their perpetual darkness love necroscope the lost yean vol ii igl him of course they love him and theyll do anything for him even against his better judgement anthony was beginning to believe his father was making more sense than hed ever known him to make his words and ideas however wild grotesque seemed based in some sort of logic turning the concept over in his mind he said butbut a necroscope the necroscope his father snapped startling him there is only one which is why they cant let him come to harm they the dead fool the teeming dead the great majority at which anthony believed he had him and only one necroscope who talks to the dead eh he smiled into the mouth of the pit but mirthlessly and all of this a waste of time eh father of my valuable time for if it was true how vtoudyou know how do you know father or are you perhaps the second necroscope is that it that you too talk to the dead in the long silence that followed the dark something at the back of anthonys mind crept closer and the light seemed to dim a little in the cavern of the pit but then no his father told him i cant talk to the dead but lean hear some of them my dead talking through me they converse with each other anthony my faithful or faithless anthony and since the necroscope harry keogh was here they also converse with others outside of me as to what they say i hear the outgoing because it goes out from me from all the minds that are my mind but the incoming is secret and known only to my multiminds except they are no longer mine but i do know that they accept harry keoghs talents and also that you and your brother that we the ferenczys are not safe from him not even here how can you doubt it didnt he come here commit an impossible crime and leave without leaving a trace like a ghost yes anthony whispered thinking back on it but he did leave a trace we have him on film he talks to them and all the worlds mysteries lie buried in the earth or aimlessly drifting in the sky who can say what he has learned from the dead like a ghostyou say but you dont know the half of it this man moves through solid rock through steel doors and through doors of his own making what do you believe in telepathy anthony my dear sweet tony qt was as if he had changed the subject entirely telepathy of course among the old wamphyri it was the prized skill of the thoughtthief so youve always instructed me and your own mentalism proves it as for francesco and myself we were born into this world where such skills were not required told you no lie my tony many of the old wamphyri were gifted in brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii strange arts but not all of them i too was bom in this world it took me seven hundred years to develop my art as for yourself and your brotherwell who can say perhaps it skipped a generation entirely or maybe theres still time i would like to think so but on the other hand time has been known to bring about changes which are far less desirable and sometimes the bloodlines hold true passing things down to the next in line thatthat should never be passed down to anyone with which another layer of gloom settled like a shroud on anthonys dream in an attempt to dispel it or perhaps delay whatever it was he sensed coming he made an effort to return to the previous subject what point are you trying to make father why this sudden leap from harry keogh to telepathy the old one seemed to grasp upon that a sudden leap ah good so that anthony feared it might signal the start of some new wordgame but no for his father quickly went on telepathy then it exists we are agreed but in that case what of sudden leaps what ofteleportation anthony shook his head no i cant accept that even the old wamphyri had nothing of that order at best it is theoretical telepaths shapechangers we know they exist evidence is immediately to hand but teleports and after a long moment theoretical said his father very quietly oh really well i would have thought so too upon a time but what about harry keogh and even the multiminds were hushed expectantly silent now anthony too caught his breath it was ridiculous but it would explain the otherwise inexplicable keoghs entry into le manse madonie his escape and the fact that but for an automatic camera no one would ever have sighted him so that he felt prompted to ask you learned this thing from the multiminds when they made inquiry about this harry keogh outside in the dead void yes even if it were true anthony said then what of it i mean hes still a man can he avoid highvelocity bullets is he impervious to steel poison a garrotte right now father francesco is in england and he will kill our mr keogh trust me and if he fails and if keogh strikes back tony you said you would soon be speaking to francesco good then tell him to leave harry keogh well alone but keogh has already robbed us once and if what you say is true why he can do it again any time he likes which is why you must not try to kill him annoy irritate him by all means so that when this thing with radu is over if it is over he might want to come here and seek you out but do not try to kill him not yet and if or when he does decide to return surely we should get rid of him now so that he cant return ever but where oh where has it gone angelo gave a mock groan his sarcasm dripping like acid the muchvaunted guileof the wamphyri hah then with a snarl set a trap for him fool a trap but how where where did he hit you the last time the treasure vault exactly he bombed your treasure vault but this time you bomb him tripwires pressure points electric eyes only let him materialize there and he materializes there forever of course but pursue him never rather than that francesco would be well advised to avoid him and all who run with him and if he runs with radu and the pack what then thenit would seem unavoidable indeed then you must kill him for if they are in leaguetogether they would be unbeatable except it is hard to believe that radu lykan would be in league with anyone which is why i suggest you deal with the doglord first then keogh both in the manner prescribed but what of the treasure our money our power base for such a plan to work wed first have to move it yes or what remains of it would be destroyed along with keogh move it but where to where would it be safest here said anthony nodding right here in this cave where you can watch over it and where therell be less temptation for francesco to destroy me too indeed said angelo and temptation is sometimes contagious eh so be it anthony could sense his awful knowing smile and again before he could deny the others unspoken accusation so then speak to francesco and tell him what i have advised for the present that seems as much as you can do and in the next moment changing the subject again now then tell me abouttell me about your dreams my tony my little anthony this was a dream as anthony was vaguely aware albeit a repeat performance of a conversation that had actually taken place some hours earlier but now feeling that ominous something creeping closer still beginning to understand or remember what it was he shivered as he answered my dreams what of my dreams but his father only tuttutted and said ah anthony my dear sweet boybut i have listened to them to yours and to your brothers dreams brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii for years i have listened even decades not merely to eavesdrop though that was part of it but because that was howhow it started in me in dreamsyes and now the something no longer unknown but definitely unspeakable reared up large as monstrous life to come knocking on the doors of reality thump thump thump a timid triple knock at first but anthony was ignoring it gazing into the mouth of the pit even as he had gazed in real life and he was asking the same question too father that was how what started in you i had thoughtperhaps francesco his father answered as if he mused to himself no no lets be honest i had even hoped it would be your brother but alas i hoped in vain for i have seen it in your dreams my tony my poor dear boy even as it was in mine so it is in yours his dreams those terrible dreams that he had hidden from everyone even himself the nightmare that he was or that he was like or that he would be like the thing in the pit but now anthony knew and horror reared up in the heart of him in his mind in his flesh and bones and creeping up from the pit climbing the walls in sickening seething rags tendrils and groping limbs staring up at him even as he stared bulgeeyed down upon it anthony saw his own mad future then the clang of metal on stone as he lowered the grille and the hum and crackle of electricity as he turned on the current and his hammering heart and echoing flying footsteps as he vacated that place to renew himself with his female thrall but even blood and the comforts of the flesh are sometimes not enough now it was dawn and another female thrall but a very different one made her patrol through le manse madonie it was the crone katerin who had been with the francezcis since she was a girl for at least seventy of her eightyfive years not a vampire as such for she had never developed katerin was simply of the blood and no longer aspired but despite that she was the lowest of the low in the francezci household she was trusted above all others and because of her years of experience there was no secret however small to which katerin wasnt privy but as she reached anthonys door what was that some sort of wormthing a snake or similar injurious creature for a moment it lay still on the marble floor of the high landing and she saw that it seemed to be emerging from beneath her masters door from his roomor entering it she stepped closer and the vibration of her footfall galvanized the thing it wriggled whipped to and fro and she saw throbbing purple veins in the vibrating length of its leprous flesh then lightningfast it drew itself out of sight under anthonys door and because she feared for him and for herself if she did nothing she knocked thump thump thump timidly at first the knock that anthony had ignored in his dream but when there was no answer she knocked again louder then turned the doorknob and went in for all that this side of the manse faced northwest away from the sun the drapes at anthonys windows were heavy thick with folds the entire room was shadowed gloomy where barely a chink of daylight found its way in katerins eyes were feral however they saw in the dark as well as any cats eyes and what they saw anthonys bed was of massive oak an antique fourposter with gauzy curtains tied back to the uprights on the side facing katerin he lay on his back naked under the single black sheet that reached to his ribcage and was his only covering as yet he was still asleep barely close to waking he tossed and turned and moaned to himself cold sweat gleamed on anthonys forehead and limbs forming sprays of fine grey pearls as he jerked his head this way and that katerin started at some sudden movement on the floor by the bed started again when the sheet over anthonys agitated figure billowed with a weird flowing motion her yellow eyes swivelled to and fro unable or unwilling to accept what they were witnessing for the snakethingwasnt a snake the harridan knew what the brothers kept in the pit deep under le manse madonie she knew that it was their father and she knew that this was something like their father except he himself was completely out of control and vaster far and like father like son katerin breathed stepping backwards very quietly towards the door but not quietly enough there were a good many extrusions as they whipped and writhed drew back under the black sheet and returned to their source and origin anthony came awake and saw and perhapseft the last of them that rope of glistening matter a chameleons tongue of protoplasm vanishing under his weirdly mobile covering and yanking the sheet aside eyes bugging he saw it soak into him he wanted to scream but couldnt there was no moisture in his throat he had dreamed this before all too frequently and always worse than the dream before but this was the first time that hed actually seen it now he knew it for a fact except he wasnt the only one who knew it anthonys panic passed was replaced by his natural cold calculating calm the chilling logic of the wamphyri brian lumley necroscope the last years vol ii katerin was standing there a bundle of dry sticks that he might ohsoeasily snap and the door he husked sitting up in his bed close the door and come here she obeyed what else could she do and stood beside his bed shivering anthony nodded and his eyes were flame as he said you saw aa mouse the crone gasped gagged croaked something very small i think that crept under your door but he shook his head and smiled a ghastly smile no you saw more than that didnt you yes master yes he sighed and reached out a hand on a long an incredibly long arm and grasped her throat even as she made to step back from him katerin i have fond memories of you when you were a girl of fifteen i fucked you we both did my brother and i perhaps fortunately you were barren your flesh had little of quality and nothing seeded itself nothing at all since when youve known our protection the safety of these strong walls the sanctuary of le manse madonie it would beoh a great shame if you were to turn traitor now his fingers tightened on her scrawny neck and old katerin knew their terrible strength i would never betray you master she wheezed his eyes were blood his lips curled back from teeth that were long and salivating his tongue was forked and scarlet in a redribbed throat and as he drew her closer still you are less than refuse he said and if i should hear so much as a whisper then i would throw you like refuse or you would be seen to fall like refuse from the great cliff do you understand but katerin could only gag and hang on to his wrist and stick out her wriggling tongue at him finally he released her thrust her away sent her stumbling across the marble floor now go and never come into my room again clutching at her throat she went then knowing there would be no more sleep for him this morning shuddering and trembling in every limb anthony got dressed but as he finished he paused lifted his head listened intently as a voice came to him from far below i fought it for two hundred years my son my dear sweet tony before it won and you put me down here but with help with my help my knowledge why your fight might last even longer and as long as i remain safe so do you but ahonly see how our roles are reversed eh my dear dear boy and then there was only silence three days later in his lair in the high cairngorms the doglord radu was awake and aware as never before in six hundred long years by now bonnie jean mirlu had contacted the surviving sons of the sons of his thralls throughout the land calling them to scotland to prepare for his coming and to protect him in the hour of his resurgence indeed he knew that it was so at the full of the moon he had put out probes of his own to seek them out and reinforce bjs instructions and moonchildren that they were they had answered him radu had sensed their response the howling going up over the moors over the dartmoor tors and in bodmin and the whimpering of auld john in inverdruie but only three only three descendants of his children of the moon well four if he included b j herself and a handful more with her small pack but as for her girls they were more dedicated to bonnie jean herself than to radu which was only understandable the doglord supposed for bj was wamphyri in her own right and becoming more so with every full moon right now the lunar orb was in the centre of its cycle a crescent but in a fortnight it would be full again radus original schedule had been set to ensure harry keoghs audience with him at the full of the moon in may and the doglords rebirth had been scheduled for the moon after that auld john however whom radu had taken into his confidence believed that he had brought these dates forward by two full monthsand so he had upon a time but now the old wolf in his resin tomb had had second thoughts auld john was a fool for his wee mistress he had been in thrall to her for long and long perhaps even too long who could say what she might or might not have winkled out of him which was one of the reasons why radu had yet again rearranged his rebirth to the end of february just a few weeks away another reason was that he could no longer wait to come face to face with bjs mysterious mr keogh who might well prove to be radus manwithtwofaces so frequently glimpsed in prescient dreams the one who would be there to greet and perhaps even succour him in his most needful hour now in just two weeks time the doglord would see this harry for himself in the flesh and know the truth of it and then one way or the other he would use him and use him up but however it went in whichever eventuality the meeting was now set to coincide with radus rising the final and perhaps most important reason for advancing the date of his return lay in radus constant state of nervous apprehension his anxiety the awareness of his own vulnerability while he lay here in state the knowledge that should his enemies find him here like this they could do with him as they wished and brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii as to what they would do the doglord had no delusions about that for they were searching for him even now and by now but for b js vigilance her diligence they might even have found him this wouldnt save her however for radu knew why she was so diligent because she could not hope to stand against them on her own what the filthy drakuls and the loathsome ferenczys and both camps determined to destroy him and his not only were they vampire lords in command of unknown numbers of lieutenants and thralls but they were wamphyri experienced in the arts and wiles of the great vampire by comparison bonnie jean was indeed innocent even as innocent as shed fooled her harry into believing and so she must have radu up to be her protection and to learn what she could from himbefore turning on him in earnest in the right place and at the right time the doglord knew this was her plan as indeed it would be his if he were in her place ah the wamphyri no two alike not even twin brothers yet in certain ways alike as peas in a pod thus being wamphyri and a beguiler bj had made a great fool of her thrall and lover harry keogh because he too was a part of her plan but radu had plans of his own he was no females fool like this harry to fall under the treacherous spell of any scheming witch or bitch however clever or buxom no he wasnt this mysterious harry keogh not in any shape or form well not yet anyway it was midday and the moon was a pale sickle hanging low in the wintry grey sky the doglord radu couldnt see it but he felt it there its influence on him tugging at the fluids of his brain it wasnt strong indeed it was at its weakest much as he was at his for this was ever an inauspicious time for him midway between his mistress moons cycle but with just a fortnight of waiting left there were still things he must do precautions to take he couldnt allow himself simply to lie here like this in a gluey semitorpor with the resin weighing on him like lead and only his mind free but since it was sovery well he would use his mind radu knew the danger in using his mentalism his telepathy but he had been taking risks with it for six hundred years now every time hed reached out to some thrall or other to call him or her to his side when he needed sustenance recently however since his first true awakening hed used it that much more frequently to call his few remaining thralls or to see if the psychic aether was clear and if not to discover who else was probing it and therefore the danger was that much greater for if anyone had sensed his sendings or intercepted them they too would know that his time was imminent and if a really clever mentalist were in the vicinity then radu might easily reveal his location these were the risks he took but vampires are vampires children of the night and this was midday it wasnt the doglords time no but neither was it theirs and so it was worth the risk he scanned far wide and faint fanning his probe over the far horizon the curve of the world remembered from a time six hundred years in the past but never lingering too long in any one spot all those years ago the world had been a vast place in which a man might easily lose himself nowit seemed so much smaller but while the world had grown smaller at least to the people in it and while the doglords body must have lost something of its substance through the long lonely centuries still his mentalism was sharp as ever perhaps even enhanced by his physical isolation what radu had denied himself of human sensation hed got back in psychic sensitivity and in his telepathy and from due south over a distance of more than six hundred miles at the other end of the land mass the moor districts of devon and cornwall he sensed a faint response from his presentday thralls just two of them yes moonchildren like auld john their longawaited destiny was now clear pausing in whatever they were doing in their everyday pursuits as men they lifted their heads looked north blinked suddenly feral eyes and held their breath they were preparing to join him yes and two weeks be sure to come to me thenand despite that there were no alien emanations no covert or inimical thoughts that he could detect in the psychic aether still without waiting for confirmation radu moved on to bonnie jean and the pack they were much closer and the risk that much greater but even if some vampire mentalist were searching for radu at this very moment and even if there were more than one and they had worked out a system of triangulation still theyd have to find a way to conquer the mountain heights these cairngorms to get to him and anyway radu had to know what was happening if only to deaden the feelings of desertion and isolation building up in him bonnie jeans mind her mental scent was so familiar to the doglord that he could find and converse with her or at least make himself and his wishes known to her anywhere in the world she was no telepath bj or at best a mere beginner so that while she couldnt read radus mind without that he sent directly into hers he could be into hers in a moment even when she tried to keep him out necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley and shed certainly done enough of that since discovering her harry right now at this very moment radus manwithtwofaces was with her good also at this momentthe doglord radu was the last thing on b js mind not good ah but what they were doing that was very much on her mind leaving room for little else sex was on her mind and the rest of her thoughts were clouded by a swirl of i confused and contradictory emotions the gigantic emotions of the wamphyri she had definitely ascended and was a lady bj hated what she was doing to harry not the love for she loved that but the lies she feared for him for herself for the future and the doglord didnt come into it or if he did it was only at the back of her mind where she had pushed him and this the act of love was her way of keeping radu there for she did not want to think of him not while she was with harry she sat astride him sucking him into her core she wanted his seed wanted to feel it spray her hot innards she desired to see his face tighten up in that ohsosweet agony the momentary little death reflecting the release of life its genesis when swarming minuscule hordes leap to seek out the egg except they would not find it for bj s system was geared to their destruction oh she would bear him children if she could if she dared but what would be their future and how would she care for him for them for herself once she had littered perhaps one daywho could say and perhaps by then he would have an egg of his own a vampire egg spawned of her leech and vented in the passion the burning lust of a moment such as this radu saw through her eyes she looked down on him on harry keogh where his shoulders were propped on pillows and his hands gripped the fancy scrolling of the headboard his feverish eyes were on her breasts and taut nipples where bj lowered them to his face his lips and as she rose and fell on him ever faster so he panted gritting his teeth and meeting thrust with thrust he was near his time bj too and as their bucking grew more frantic yet he released a hand that fluttered like a crippled bird finding its way behind and beneath her to stroke her slippery anus she crushed to him in a frenzy her breasts flattening to his chest her mouth kissing sucking at his neck and her teeth pausing then poising there they came together their souls dislocating bodies shuddering and still bj s teeth were brushing harrys neck and she thought if i do it now the doglord will not want him it was only a thought surely she would not carry it out but still no radu sent in a sudden panic donteven think it his mental howl directiy into bjs mind lost to the moment spent and giving in to her conscience and commonsense she collapsed rolled onto her side and drew harry with her locked into her but then as the ringing went out of her ears and the singing from her sex she wondered what her conscience was it possible to have anything of conscience in moments as hot and fierce as those had been but of course it was else harry were a vampire from the first yet still and still as a stone she listened but all she could hear was her lovers thudding heart his panting and finally her own as she teo began to breathe again radu had got out just in time but still his probe lingered in the psychic aether ready to stab down again linkup with her and act as a carrier as he berated her for her treachery upon a time he would have done it in a moment but to threaten bj nowwould be to threaten himself his very existence she was wamphyri in thrall to him now yes but for how much longer if he were to let her know hed found her out what then she would leave him to rot here that was what then leave him and run off with her harry except the bastard was not hers but his and she was his too or would be and so she loves him does she she ruts with him eh but i shall rut the bitch to death the doglord swore if only to himself and then because suddenly he realized what his rage was about damaged pride and jealousy and because his need to strike out was so great radu opened his mind to the full and sent forth a howl of frustration into the psychic aether and knew at once that he had made a serious mistake bonnie jean couldnt hear him no for his rage had been about her not directed at her bj herselfhadrit heard himbut at least one other had it was like a taint to his metaphysical sixth sense the touch of something slimy or the smell of something rotten a gurgle of sewage or a bitter poisonous taste worse he recognized it at once and knew its name ferenczy francesco was aloft over the cairngorms it was late february and would soon be march but the snow was holding off perhaps finished for the season the streams running off the mountains were black and swollen foaming grey with slush where they fell sheer and the scarred domes of snowcapped summits and jumbles of craggy plateaux were rounded as outlines on christmas cards modelled by the slow melt from up here it all looked very serene and very treacherous too necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley not the madonie is it luigi manoza francescos pilot looked sidelong at mm in the cockpit of their helicopter they were alone a reconnaissance flight sixty miles to the west from their base at a decommissioned north sea gas facility in aberdeen the first of several such flights planned to survey the mountains for a likely location not a film location however but the location of a lair finally in answer to his pilots wry question francesco gave a grunt and said no its not the madonie but wolf territoryyes i think so as it was six hundred years ago so it is now pretty much he glanced at a map in his lap and as manoza brought them swooping about in a low turn from the north said that place down there with the skiers that is aviemore famous so they say they seem to be making the best of whats left of the snow across the river that handful of cottages there you just flew over it is inverdruie where this bastard doglord has a thrall or thralls manoza was climbing now skimming the mountains that were rising ahead well he said there shouldnt be any problem sniffing them out not in a place as small as that correct francesco nodded our people are on it right now and through radus thralls we get to him but the thing is we dont want to take him out too soon if we can discover his approximate location well know when hes set to make his comeback the moment his thralls and the drakuls all start heading in that direction then we go after them and get him his people and the drakuls too and hes here you think my father thinks so francesco frowned and my brother but be quiet now and take it slowly slowly over the mountains i want to concentrate its not so much what i can see as what i may feel angelo that damned thing in his pit says that we should know without seeing without touching or smelling says the ferenczys and doglords have been enemies for so long that its bred in them that the knowing is in our blood and while ive always been suspicious of anything my father says i have to admit that in this placei do sense something hah and im the one who is supposed to be insensitive so maybe angelo is right and at short range like this i might even be able toah ahk ahkh wha the squat manoza hunched over his controls instinctively leaned away from him francesco what the fuck the ferenczys eyes were suddenly red bulging staring out and down this way and that through the curved clear plastic panel of his door he clasped his ears he seemed crushed down into himself as by shock or astonishment as if hed seen the starburst of flak and heard the howl of shrapnel but it was a different kind of howling hed heard while luigi had seen and heard nothing at all and again francesco husked turn her around now fly over that same spot again do it manoza complied and again and again but whatever it had been it was gone now later on their way back to aberdeen finally the bulky toadlike manozas curiosity got the better of him he had to know well he queried i mean do you want to talk about it was it him francesco had been silent lost in his own thoughts ever since ordering their return but now its time we moved into aviemore he grunted mainly to himself all of us for the skiing you know then as if he had only just heard manozas question yes it was him somewhere back there in those mountains the doglord hides in his lair but not for much longer luigi because hes awake radu is awake and making ready necroscope the lost years vol ii rival factions the darkness closes in harry wasnt switched on not any longer after dealing with the situation at his place he had gone to bj full of anxious doubts urgent questions and demands disturbed simply didnt convey his condition so that she had immediately downloaded him of the cause shed struck the most recent most horrific events from memory and what the necroscope had been left with was a series of facts that were so disjointed disconnected it felt as if half of his life had gone missing he remembered in some detail however blurred and unreal his all but abandoned search for his wife and infant son even places hed never visited except in his mind at bjs hypnotic command but he did know that he had been there definitely for if not then he was simply insane he knew too all of his early life his time at ebranch the powers he had once mastered and how he had once used them and since quitting the branch his time with bonnie jean but that lastwas a huge jumble a monster jigsaw puzzle with no borders and most of the pieces missing or refusing to come together and thus his memory was as bj wanted itmore or less but there were things in there that she didnt know about that shed forgotten or hadnt had time or inclination to ask about which were harrys alone and because he was restricted by previous instructions the posthypnotic commands of someone who had been there before bj that he must not divulge his powers to anyone he wasnt able to tell her about them for example he couldnt tell her what he had discovered about le manse madonie about the thing in the pit because in fact he didnt know or knew on a lower level of consciousness for right at the beginning of their relationship she had ordered him to forget anything she told him or that he might learn about the wamphyri because it was for her ears alone harry couldnt refamiliarize himself with this stored information until she or the doglord actually switched him on all the way and sent him out against their enemies the drakuls and ferenczys thus this was a level that was hidden even from the necroscope himself but on another level he couldnt even tell her that le manse madonie existed for then bj would want to know why and far more importantly how hed gone there and how he had got out again unscathed yet even now if only she would say the right words and turn him on all the way she could have instant access to much of this hidden information but she wouldnt because she didnt know he had it which was why he had gone to her begging her to switch him on and tell him everything which in turn was why she had switched him off said taken most everything away and the only thing about the current status quo that he had been allowed to retain was the fact that they were in hiding from their enemies while waiting for some kind of call that and the entirely indisputable fact of bonnie jeans innocence so that harry no longer even bothered to ask himself innocent of what it scarcely mattered at all that reality was a blurred and indistinct place somewhere outside himself or that he was in a constant daze little better than a zombie confused in all his mental processes what mattered most was that he was with b j and come what may well really that was all that mattered the first night theyd spent together at the inn bj had made a mistake easily corrected still it was the sort of thing she would have to watch in future in their room she had started to ask him harry tell me about zahanine what did you until she remembered that he couldnt tell her anything because she had cancelled it from his mind by which time harry had been frowning asking zahanine your black girl i didnt notice her with the other girls is she ok was shewas she at my place he gave his head a small worried shake and youre quite right bj had quickly nodded my mind was wandering thats all so dont worry about it but maybe it had continued to make connections somewhere in harrys head because hed still been frowning as he asked her why cant we hide out at my place i know the area like the back of my hand and its easily defended oh really from the wamphyri bj had smiled to herself however bitterly oh yes easily defended but isolated too and hey you despite her gloom and the fact that she felt chilly within shed forced a real smile and sat on the bed hugging her knees lighten up ok harry well be just fine right here why dont you come over here and love me necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley and he had smiled sort of lopsidedty and gone to her but even as theyd been making love harry had been frowning inside something about zahanine and his housesomething about a dark spot on the floor in his studysomething about that frozen plateau on the roof of the world it came and went disappearing into limbo for on his current level of consciousness he wasnt given to remember these things theyd been erased or should have been and his reality reduced to a misty swirl far less coherent than a dream in fact he might as well be asleep and dreaming and for all that bj had been real hot and vibrant in harrys arms still he had wondered if maybe it was so that this was all a strange jumbled dream in which case it was way past the time when he should have woken up excepthe was afraid of what he might wake up to that had been three days ago since when among the rival vampire factions there had been a deal of toing and froing a new arrival meetings much searching and surveillance and a long overdue death in london a certain political refugee had arrived on a flight from india ostensibly a wealthy exguru whose estate in patna had suffered from an everincreasing incidence of sectarian violence he was in the uk to find a suitable home with a longterm view to leaving his religious career behind and starting a business in oriental carpets since his credentials were impeccable and he appeared to have all of the necessary qualifications two hundred thousand of which hed already transferred to a branch of lloyds in london he had been granted a business visa and made welcome in fact he was one of daham drakeshs lieutenants a longtime sleeper and longdistance telepath who several years ago had established a bolthole and base for drakesh in lucknow but as the doglords time loomed ever closer the last drakul was more in need of a lieutenant in the british isles or more specifically scotland to contact and take control of his thralls there dahams bloodson and chief lieutenant mahag along with a common thrall had been killed by radus people since when hed had no contact with his four surviving disciples drakesh was hopeful that since the death of his bloodson the four had realized that their mission had now changed with their cover blown they were no longer incognito they could no longer play agents provocateurs but must abandon all such plans and let the doglord and the ferenczys get on with it but for all that his thralls were expendable the last drakul couldnt simply leave it at that his people were vampires after all and many miles outside of any reasonable means of communication and control moreover he knew that the british authorities were looking for them and he had problems enough with officialdom as it was that fool in his office on kwijiang avenue chungking for instance colonel tsihong a regular red army officer seconded to chinas paramilitary department of parapsychological studies in the weeks since drakesh had been obliged to murder the overly curious major chang lun the officer in command of the small garrison atxigaze he had found himself under increasing pressure from tsihong not that there was any way he could be connected with chang luns accident indeed with the land all about deep in the grip of winter and the terrain a mass of drifted snow under crusty ice they hadnt even discovered the majors body as yet and when they did what then thered been a blizzard the night chang luns driver nosedived their snowcat into a crevasse only a mile or so from the xigaze garrison and despite that tsihong acknowledged drakesh as a man of rare talents surely he wouldnt consider him capable of calling up a storm oh really yet from his seat in the foreboding drakesh monastery the last drakul high priest of his sect had done just that as chang lun had fled for xigaze after a spying mission on the monastery and walled city then calling up a blizzard and with the aid of his familiar albino bats drakesh had driven him to his doom following which a few days of silenceand then the messages relayed from chungking to the garrison and delivered by hand to daham drakesh he had known of course that chang lun was his enemy and that the major must have conveyed his concerns about him to tsihong but he had believed that the colonels commitment to his experiment to develop an army of supermen for the red chinese army would be sufficient to keep him secure from all but a minimum of supervision and interference so he had reasoned anyway but apparently hed been wrong colonel tsihong knew about drakeshs people in england having taken drakesh at his word he had even sanctioned their visit but now that the chinese military intelligence services had picked up british press reports about their expulsion and the colonel himself was having to answer questions from his superiors he wanted to know what the hell drakesh was playing at what sectarian feuding firefights murders expulsions and what if the british authorities took drakeshs people into custody and made a connection between the sect and red china also there was now this unfortunate thing with chang lun his disappearance that brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii such a capable and reliable officer should simply vanish off the face of the earth even in a region as treacherous as the tingri plateau was a curious and perhaps even suspicious thing in its own right without that the major had made several damning eyewitness reports on certain activities at the drakesh monastery and in the neighbouring walled city wherefore drakesh should take note that a new very much more rigid officer commanding would be arriving shortly in xigaze garrison and soon after that the high priest could expect the first thorough inspections both of the monastery and the facilities at the walled city at first daham drakesh had read such messages with some concern which in a while had turned to resolution his course was set and no turning back so a new officer commanding was coming to xigaze and then across the frozen waste to the monastery very well but his first visit would be his last what was in the monastery couldnt be hidden not from a persistent inspection team it was here to stay until drakesh was ready to send it or them out into the world therefore the inspection team could not be allowed to leave and as for what was breeding in the old walled citythat was indeed the stuff of a new army but in no way a red chinese army so then drakeshs course was set and as for any sort of heavyhanded military threat from china in two three or four weeks time or whenever such a threat might have materialized would china really have time to worry about some obscure sect in the cold waste of tibet drakesh doubted it not with chungking london and moscow in ruins and the whole world toppling over the brink into nuclear war then when the earth lay under the grey windswept gloom of an unending winter and drakesh and his brood were the only kind who could profit from itthen his creatures and children the spawn of his vats and loins would go out from tibet into the world and the new order come into being on the roof of the monastery where the vast skull facade sloped back into the face of the cliff a radio antenna reared even now and in a room near the dome of the rock a crude but powerful radio transmitter wanted only drakeshs finger on the button as for his lieutenant recently sent into england he could rally the four surviving vampire thralls to him assess the situation locally and in telepathic consultation with drakesh make his own decision as to the best course of action after that if the group continued to survive the cataclysm soon to follow then it would form the tiny nucleus of a european cell and while the great nations of earth devolved into a final chaos and all their armies and their power came to nothing in the end the master of their destiny the last drakul would be secure here on the roof of the world for of all the places in the world surely this was the safest of all what country would think to target tibet what was there here that was even worth destroying nothing nothing but the very seat of evil but to daham drakeshs knowledge of all living men he himself and his redrobed vampire priests were the only ones who knew about it to his knowledge yes and of all living men meanwhile two very disparate ferenczy lieutenants vincent ragusa and angus mcgowan had teamed up journeyed north and taken a suite of rooms at a hotel in carrbridge north of aviemore and a few cautious miles from inverdruie but right from square one things hadnt been much to the young sicilians liking ragusa wasnt happy with the situation that this little man the tiny wizened mcgowan was his superior from whom he was supposed to take orders he had typecast mcgowan as a runt from the moment he laid eyes on him an assessment hed since revised and radically but at firstthings had got off to a less than auspicious start and now as the ugly little man drove his ugly little vw beetle south along blackly glittering roads between threefoot banks of snowploughheaped slush and dirty ice from carrbridge to aviemore and on across the spey where the road was signposted for inverdruie and coylumbridge ragusas dark thoughts went back to their first meeting and to events since to start with mcgowan had failed to turn up to meet him at the airport in edinburgh that was the first letdown when he had had to take a taxi into the city and book himself into a hotel ragusa could speak english a smattering anyway but what the locals were speaking was scarcely english and people said the italians talked too fast then in his room hed got a call from mcgowan saw ye come in the gravelly voice told him on the wire but circumstances bein what they are well ah couldnae meet ye yere room at the hotel was that an advance bookin no spur of the moment i was out on a limb and what the fucks all this cloak and dagger shit about anyway ragusas tone of voice had said a lot for his feelings so no one knows yere there fthe other might not even have heard him no of course not what kind of dumb shit is this for long moments there had been silence then oh upset are ye well ahm sorry about that laddie necnxope the lost yean vol u brian lumley but as ah said it couldnae be helped so meet me in thirty minutes where the road leads off princes street for waverly station eh laddie ragusa had snarled his outrage and whats that princes street waverly station what the but aye just so yeve got it that phlegmy voice had chuckled fore the phone went dead and half an hour later that was the first time ragusa had seen mcgowan or his car and he had instantly disliked both of them at the junction of roads the beetle had pulled over and mcgowan had leaned across the front passenger seat to yank the catch and push the door open get in will ye no then pulling out into a sluggish stream of traffic mcgowan he had said reaching across his small body to extend his right hand while giving his passenger a cursory glance and when that one deliberately ignored the proffered handshake no the best o weather is it followed by that phlegmy chuckle of his which is all to the good for if s our kind o weather eh ragusa had looked at him then and scowled vincent hed said vincent ragusa you were supposed to meet me at the airport those were francescos instructions and the francezcis like their instructions carried out to the letter aye so they do and always have mcgowan had immediately agreed fifty years ago they were much the sameand thirty before that when ah was first recruited when ah was about yere age since when ahve been wherever they had a mind tae send me but mainly in the british isles ahve been ye ken snif fin out big dogs as it were and other creatures aye while yeve beenwhat learnin the business in sicily at le manse madonie aye ah imagine so but its no the same out here if s a whole other world laddie call me vincent ragusa had snapped then or if thats too hard for you then its ragusa lieutenant ragusa but mcgowan had at once made clucking noises yere rank doesnae come into it hed said then but very quietly it will give ye away in a minute be sure but ah ken ye didnae mean it it was simply yere way o expressin yere what yere disappointment or displeasure ahm no what ye expected nor the cityation eh the what did you say cityation the way things stand mcgowan had explained ah wellitll a work out ahm sure anyway ah couldnae meet ye at the airport things are no perfec ye ken ah had a small to do wi a polis friend but yell be meeting that yin soon enough we can even have lunch wi him if yed like but see ah had tae be sure no one else knew ye were arrivin that no one was watchin tae see if yed be picked up but it happens that no one was so it seems were a in the clear so whats this about thethe polis the police oh a spot o bother wi an old friend but dinnae fret if s a sorted out the noo er vincent and so it had gone they had talked about the job in hand tomorrow theyd be travelling north to the spey valley sniffin out big dogs and so on but as they talked it had become clear to ragusa that francesco must have spoken in depth with mcgowan the ugly little man had a clear picture of the task in hand that left no room for argument or rearrangement so that on the two or three occasions when ragusa might have thought to question something mcgowan had always had the answer or hed got in first with a timely reminder but thats how francesco wants it done er vincent and as yere aware the francezcis like their instructions carried out tae the letter and finally they had arrived at mcgowans address in that most dreary district of the city on their way the young sicilian vampire had caught a glimpse of frothing wavecrests on a grey ocean mirroring desolate skies and in the darkly wintry distance a bleak skyline of derelictlike monoliths that reminded him of palermo only the gelid slush was new to him the way it ate like acid into his patent leather italian shoes ragusa had stepped from an icy pavement into the shadow of the dilapidated victorian terraced property that was mcgowans home and had followed the shabby little man through a wroughtiron gate up wet stone steps to the drier cover of the archedover entranceway before even thinking to ask er angus why are we here anyway are ye no hungry the other had cocked his head raising a bushy inquiring eyebrow as he unlocked the stout oak door ragusa had shrugged stepped inside and smelled a familiar taint that he always associated with old buildings sicily was full of such we could have eaten at my hotel or anywhere aye true enough mcgowan had grinned but ah fancy mah fare will be more to yere taste anyway yeve entered of yere own free will at which the sicilian had paused halfway out of his coat to look curiously at his little host the eyes of both men had been feral yellow in the gloom and ragusa had said you fancy yourself as quite the little comedian dont you but mcgowan had only chuckled as he answered well er vincent if a man cannae have a joke on himsel then what can he laugh at eh and he had switched on dim lights taken his guesf s coat and ushered him along a narrow corridor now where ragusa had queried straightening his expensive tie and stretching his neck a little brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii tae see mah big old polls pal mcgowan had laughed from low in his chest down here and hed led the way to the cellar ragusa hadnt been with it yet so you bribed him converted him or what or what mcgowan had answered by which time they were in the cellar and again the little man had put on dim lights and ahhhhf ragusa had said but by no means an expression of fear or detestation more of surprise even admiration for vincent ragusa had served a long apprenticeship at le manse madonie but even there this would have seemed exceptionalwell if the setting had been a little more in keeping mcgowan had sensed what he was thinking in a voice that was deeper and more guttural than ever hed said dye remember vincent how it used tae bebefore why o course ye do mahsel ah certainly do no that ahd go back tae it ye understand still some o the best meals ahve ever eaten were served up in the nastiest little places aye a nasty little place yes indeed ragusa couldnt remember seeing one that was nastier the brick walls were streaked with nitre the floor was of stone flags laid back in one corner to reveal a smelly hole with rusting chains descending into darkness there was a workbench with assorted tools a large fireblackened stove with a hooded flue ascending and a dining table in the centre of the floor a table set for lunch with a white tablecloth gleaming crockery and highly polished cutlery glasses and a ships decanter of red wine it had been so incongruous that it was fetching for a moment ragusa hadnt been able to take his eyes from the almost hallucinatory scene but with senses more than one and all of them far more finely tuned than a normal human beings he had detected the smell of foodor as mcgowan had put it of fare that was more to his taste behind the stone stairway the brickarched entrance to a recessed passage or annex had been the source of the odour old mcgowan seeing ragusas eyes turn that way his nostrils widening had grinned lit the stump of a candle and tossed the flaring match into the stove and leading the way into the cramped space he had warned avoid brushin against the walls dinnae get yeresel hooked up if ye see what ah mean ragusa had seen every two or three feet along the wall meat hooks had been cemented into the brickwork most of them were stained rusty empty but at the back of the alcove the last one wasnt the figure hanging there was humanit had been a human being the arms were gone to the shoulders a leg the left one was off at the knee the right leg was missing halfway up the thigh and all of the stumps had been cauterized but the neatness of the mutilations was remarkable youre a craftsman the sicilian had grunted beginning to salivate huh mcgowans answering snort had been one of frustration from where he examined his victim damn the manhes gone and done it oh died on me he was alive when ah spoke tae him this morning ah had taken precautions tae preserve him ye see but now again ragusa had been impressed he could still talk oh aye but he wasnae strong enough tae scream hah ah had thought he wouldnae be able tae do this but damn the man he has oh he had a mind o his own did george lanson still hes verra fresh as ye can see and wont go entirely tae waste out o here now and sit yeresel at mah table back in the main cellar room the little man had sprinkled olive oil into a large shallow blackened tray on top of the smoking stove and selecting various tools from the bench hed inquired name yere cut vincent and tell me how yed like it prepared oh chefs choice the other had grunted with his version of an affable shrug but rare of course or maybe even bloody by which time his voice had been no less clotted than mcgowans then as the deceptive little man disappeared again with his saw and knives into the annex behind the stairs but tell me what was it you thought your policeman friend would not be able to do kill himself aye kill himsel the answer had come back still it happens frae time tae time ye can drug em tae stop the pain and numb the shock but if theyve the will for it theres no stoppin em and the whine of his saw had sprung into being at the table ragusa had nodded to himself poured a glass of wine then lifted his voice to answer id forgotten life isnt the fire in them that undeath is in us no it isnae mcgowans voice had come back to him no half the fire nor half the heat and ah suppose that sometimes its just no worth it tae keep it lit but despite the sentiment in the words thered been no remorse compassion or emotion at all then the whine of the saw had changed to a biting tvhirrr and ragusa had sat at the table thinking how despite the fact that he didnt much care for mcgowan still he had to acknowledge the little mans flair and his generosity of course so then in ragusas eyes mcgowan was still a runt but something less of a yokel all those years working on his own had made him independent perhaps when the francezci met him again he would brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii consider him too independent there was this sense of authority selfconfidence in him that would better befit the wamphyri themselves and sitting in mcgowans old beetle the sicilian thought maybe that was it it was what he didnt like about the little man his knowledge and his authority perhaps mcgowan had been the francezcis man in these parts left to his own resources for far too long until hed begun to think of himself as a chief in his own right no simple thrall this mcgowan nor even a simple lieutenant but a wrinkled old man like this wamphyri it seemed absurd did he aspire was it possible he might even ascend this is inverdruie mcgowan grunted turning his rheumy eyes on his passenger oh and what are ye scowlin about this car ragusa answered but that was only par t of it of course how am i to fool anyone im a movie tycoon driving around in this wreck in sicily we consign shit like this to the scrap heap this is a recce run mcgowan answered recce thats reconnaisance its so ah can show ye what ahve learned sos if anything shid happen tae me yell be fully in the know but did ah no tell ye that already or maybe ye didnae understand me eh its a wonder ive understood any fucking thing ragusa scowled again then grinned sarcastically and in what he patently considered a fair imitation of rex harrison said why cant the english learn how to speak mcgowans turn to scowl aye laddie but ahm no english and if wit was shit yed have diarrhoea it was early morning and as yet there was only light traffic fit young fanatics who had struggled out of their holiday beds in neighbouring towns and hamlets strapped their skis to their roofracks and were now making for aviemores slopes this laddie crap ragusas lips drew back from eyeteeth as curved and sharp as fangs it stops right now at which mcgowan seemed to swell up in his seat yanked on the wheel and aimed his beetle straight at an oncoming car it took very little effort the secondclass road was barely wide enough for two vehicles abreast and heaped snow had frozen to solid walls on both sides ragusas jaws flew open he gasped what the fuck and threw up a hand before his face but at the last moment mcgowan yanked on the wheel again swung left and cut through an opening in the banked snow onto a service track as he brought the beetle to a halt the other car went careering by on the far side of the snow wall ragusa caught a momentary glimpse of the driver shaking a furious fist through his open window then leaving a settling cloud of blue exhaust smoke the skiers were gone ragusa found his voice at last and said what in the are you a complete raving maniac but the little man wasnt listening to him or even looking at him instead he used his sleeve to clear the lightly misted windscreen and stared ahead down the track and his eyes were red as finally he glanced at ragusa a mere glance and said dye see the smoke die chimney behind they trees there the wee house uh ragusa looked scowled and nodded his head he was still a little shaken the house yes so what mcgowans eyes were rheumy again as he said the dweller is a man called john guiney or auld john as hes known locally hes a gillie and hes been here forever eh a gillie a tracker gamekeeper woodsmanand hes one o radu lykans thralls ah fancy ragusas attention now centred on the house in the trees he was still angry even furious but this gave his anger a direction a target what makes you think so that time ah saw bonnie jean mirlu and her man talon out they drakuls it was auld johns car she was drivin but later that same day he had it back again so if john guineys no the doglords thrall hes certainly a friend o bjs dont see any car ragusa squinted ahead behind the house ah shid think i want to see it then ih know it too a quick look then the little man answered slipping his car in gear but this is just a recce remember so dont you go forgettin whos givin the orders around here as if he deliberately calculated to irritate ragusa more yet which in fact he did as quietly as possible in a low gear mcgowan drove over a thin layer of crunching glistening snow away from the mam road to aviemore until he picked up a track through the naked trees that skirted the picturepostcard house on the far side mostly obscured by trees he stopped the engine and wound down his window there was only a wintry silence and the sun a desultory grey blob in the sky far down the valley theres auld johns car the little man grunted back o the house as ye see and does this guy know you ragusa rasped and if not why all this creeping around i mean what is hesome kind of threat one old man living alone waiting for this fucking doglord to come down off his mountain he started to get out of the car but mcgowan cautioned him where dye think yere goin havenae ah told ye often enough aready that this is only a recce tuck recce the other snapped opening his jacket he showed necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley mcgowan his underarm holster and gun me i check the old guy out i cant recruit him if hes a what a moon child in which case i ask him a question or two hes just a thrall after all in fact hes less than a thrall not even a vampire this way we save a lot of timefor francesco you understand so if the old guy answers my questions all well and good and we get to know something if he doesnt likewise good except he gets dead sooner well dump his body where it wont be found and hes one less to worry about and vincent ragusa gets all the credit right mcgowan hissed is that whats pissing you ragusa snarled you shrivelled little fuck so why dont you come and help out but no mcgowan scowled go yeresel glory boy man orders are clear enough tae me right ragusa grinned viciously if s why youre still a follower angus and why you always will be but give me ten minutes and i guarantee know more about whaf s going down here than youve learned in ten years he started away through the trees a flowing grey shadow among lesser shadows and mcgowan thought smooth as a badgers arse that yin more than ahve learned in ten years eh well one thing ahve learned in the last few months is the name oa certain silversmith in inverness the one who makes the shot for john guineys cartridges aye ragusa was skirting a hedge of dense holly bushes in a moment hed be at the door of the cottage mcgowan turned the key in the ignition put her in gear and found a space to reverse then turned about and headed for the open road drawing level with the rear of the cottage he stopped again but left the engine running he at least had some experience of radus allies hed seen them in action the results of that action certainly at the door ragusa straightened his tie took his automatic from its holster tucked it in his trouserband where it was covered by the flap of his jacket then he knocked and waited inside at the side of the house and upstairs auld john peered through a tiny window down on mcgowans car an old vw beetle which was fairly rare up here he wouldnt forget what it looked like even if he couldnt read the number plate and as for the driven had he seen him before well perhaps he had at that but from what he could see of him nowbjs watcher he fitted the description anyway and again the knock at the back door but more insistent now ahm comin aye auld john called out in a thin trembly voice gi me a minute can ye no and so down the stairs in an easy lope pausing briefly in his front room then on to the door who is it er you dont know me ragusas voice his foreign accent but having watched him coming through the trees his furtive approach auld john knew exactly what he looked like knew it and didnt like what hed seen man ah wiz on the toilet he called out ah surely hope this is verra important and no just someone wantin directions let me just fix mahsel up sure take your time but you can bet if s important im here to make you an offer big money mr guiney i mean it is john guiney isnt it ragusa grinned viciously and tested his draw thrust his hand under the flap of his jacket gripped the butt of his gun yeah it was fine aye it is that john answered thinking and you know too damn much about me man oh so sharp ookin young friend then he shrank down into himself lowered one shoulder became even more the old man there and now he unlatched and halfopened the door ragusa knew him at once and face to face auld john knew ragusa moonchild that john was forewarned and forearmed he let instinct take over for if this yin wasnae ferenczy then he wasnae here but he was and he was mr guiney werewere ggoing to be shshooting a film ragusa had commenced to stammer the first words that came to mind but now as his intended victim came from his hunchedup rheumaticoldman pose to the full lean height of a sniffing houndeyed hunter and growled oh shooting is it so ragusa drew back a pace and reached for his gun and aye so it is auld john said and brought his right arm and hand out from behind the door twin barrels stared ragusa in the face and his hand still hadnt cleared the loosely flapping material of his jacket but then in the next moment he found his gunan entire moment too late oh dearie me said john and squeezed one trigger the blast tore the cold silence set birds fluttering and flapping in the trees and at pointblank range blew all of the flesh off ragusas face and drove his ruined eyes deep into his skull performing an amazing backwards bound the sicilian formed a midair crucifix before his patent leather heels hit the ground and slammed him onto his back on the frozen earth auld john loped after him still aiming his shotgun at him but glancing left at mcgowan in his car then however briefly their eyes met exchanging looks that were sheer poison but as john swung his shotgun to the left mcgowan released the clutch revved up and rolled the car out of sight towards the front of the house it was gone in a puff of exhaust smoke john loped to the corner of the house saw the car accelerating brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii towards the gap in the wall of snow but the distance was too great the spread of the shot would be too wide john could only watch as the little man in his little car skidded out onto the road and drove away then john went back to ragusas body which was twitching and trying to sit up a lieutenant this one aye well fuck ye auld john said and thrust the barrels of his gun into the gory hole that had been a mouth cuttin yere head off isnae the only way eh ah can just as easily blow it off right and he proceeded to do just that later blue woodsmoke and more than woodsmoke rose up in a nearvertical column from behind johns house he was burning all the dead wood come down from the trees in the autumn stuff that wasnt big enough for firewood as for the shots that he had fired off his nearest neighbour lived a good quartermile away and wouldnt be bothered anyway john was a gillie after allthere were rabbits about and pigeons for his table and auld john himself warmed his hands by the blaze in a corner of the sprawling area he called his garden there hadnt been much of a commotion he thought next to nothin in fact that yin hadnae been much o a one tae send against the likes o radu and his folk well maybe it would warn the rest o the bastards off but as he inhaled heartily on the smoke from the fire john doubted it later still in the house he went through ragusas expensive clothing to see if he could find out just exactly who this ferenczy had been information for bj who was still the wee mistress for the time being anyway that same afternoon mcgowan moved from carrbridge to aviemore and according to instructions received earlier booked rooms at the ski lodge for francesco and his team then in the evening he spoke to the francezci on the telephone in his room and told him of vincent ragusas regrettable demise he told it more or less as it had happened leaving out only the fact that he was mainly responsible for goading the younger man to his death and when he was finished angus listen you can tell me the francezci had told him i mean i warned you that you would have to keep an eye on vincent at least until i could find a fitting solution sodid you perhaps take him out it was the way ah told it francesco mcgowan answered the man was a bleddy hothead if ever ah saw one you know old friend that it would make no difference the francezci could be persuasive but so could mcgowan be obstinate he had lied to a degree and now the lie must stand forever but he could perhaps embellish it a little francesco the man was intent on bein boss he insisted mah boss ah mean and one day maybe everybodys boss orders meant nothin tae that yin ahm sorry tae have tae say it but its mah personal opinion yere well rid o him mine too just as long as nothing comes of it auld john guiney isnae about tae scream polis if thats what ye mean mcgowan said and ah certainly wont be reportin ragusa missint very well then what of our rooms all taken care of ye can move into aviemore just as soon as ye like theyll even mark out a helipad for luigi itll be ready tomorrow mornin oh they quite like the idea that were scoutin locations for a film good i shall look forward to seeing you tomorrow then francesco answered and that was that at about the same time as mcgowan was talking to the francezci bonnie jean mirlu was talking to john guiney some sixth sense or female or wamphyri intuition had warned her that things werent all they might be in auld johns neck of the woods and john had told her about his visitors like francesco francezci she was at first concerned that johns action might precipitate things but he soon assured her that such wasnt the case it wasnae me but the doglord they were after lass he said and as if sensing her surprise the fact that shed been taken aback beggin yere pardon bonnie but if ah hadnae been the winner why we might all have ended up losers the little man yere watcher was in charge if he had got a hold o memaybe he could have made me guide them tae radu himsel in his high place they must know it wont be long now she nodded biting her lip with anxiety and yet dont know they seem to be acting far in advance of anything i had expected and john they also know where you are now they know for sure aye johns voice was stronger than shed ever heard it and they know somethin of what theyre up against maybe they were ah dinnae ken testin the water as it were well if so they wouldnae find it much to their likin a wee bit too hot if ye take mah meanin ferenczys she shivered and we dont know how many of them in fact we dont know a damn thing about them bj sensed panic setting in again auld john was a brave old lad but he was a brave old fool too brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii ah but we do know somethin about them he cut into her thoughts actually seeming to relish this entire mess for ah turned out this bleddy foreigners pockets and there were one or two verra interestin items in them be sure well then go on bj snapped and immediately softened a little john im sure you dont really understand the danger here oh but ah do bonnie jean ah do verra well now listen there were cards in his wallet credit cards and such and even money mainly american dollars but some small change too in lira lira aye and the plastic is italian or rather sicilian also theres a wee personal card wi names an address and a telephone number the cards in italian but even an auld fool like me can read it easy enough it says v ragusa personal assistant to a and e francezci le manse madonie le manse madonie bj gasped out loud as her mind began to whirl a long time ago she had tracked the ancient ferenczy bloodline to sicily where the trail had appeared to peter out and nownow it seemed that theyd been there all the time harry keogh was at the window of their small room looking out disinterestedly into the darkness of evening at the rear of their country inn hideaway at least bj hadnt suspected his interest in fact with every passing moment harry seemed to be sinking deeper and deeper inside himself just what was happening in his head if anything at all was happening in there she wouldnt even hazard a guess but now startling her ferenczys he said and le manse madonie the madonie is a range of mountains in sicily is that auld john on the phone some kind of problemand continuing to stare blankly out of the window margaret macdowelts here a taxi just dropped her off margaret macdowell the police had finished with her now and rightly so for after all she was the victim or she had been the intended victim of a rapist and murderer and shed told the police all she knew weeks ago weeks was that all but time had seemed to slow down it felt like years to bonnie jean since the attack bj had bided her time keeping margaret pretty much out of things in case the police should want to talk to her again but that was then and this was now and b j needed every ounce of help she could get auld john was still on the phone bonnie jean listen john im cutting this short i think if s time you were out of that cottage and i do mean tonight find yourself lodgings but well away from inverdruie and aviemore then give me a call to let me know where you are do you understand youre my mainstay john i cant let anything happen to you get out o here he seemed bemused but if s mah home where would ah go anywhere that youll be safe she snapped at him again and meant it this time so do it now then tell me you understand and in a moment aye ah understand but radu when its time youll hear his call until thengood luck john she sensed his nod you too bonnie jean take care mah bonnie wee lass and the click as his handset went down then bj harrys voice again a little more animated than it had been of late she glanced at him he continued to stare out of the window but he was frowning now blinking rapidly harry she made to go to him that car he said without looking at her its lights have gone out now but its there where the hedgerow finishes at this end of the service lane it drove in after margarets taxi and nowif s just sitting there she stood beside him staring hard through the gauze curtains and reaching to switch the lights out from the corridor muted greetings sounded as the rest of the girls met margaret but bj wasnt interested in that her attention was centred elsewhere a car she whispered peering harder still where the hedgerow finishes the necroscope said again in that notquitethere voice that b j hated but was getting used to and harry could sense could almost feel her concentration as he wondered however vaguely the people in that car are they our enemies but his guard was down his metaphysical thoughts went outand a certain member of the great majority was out there waiting for them as for b j she was no telepath not yet but she was on the verge of true ascensionwamphyri scarcely knowing she was doing it she found and probed the car and the necroscope heard her low rumbling snarl a growl that came and went deep inside her she staggered a little in her passion and grabbed his arm to steady herself and drakulsf the word the name left her lips like a poisonous sigh then with a hiss and a savage grin as her eyes glowed yellow in the dark drakuls aye as if i had wished it and my wish had come true for zahanine for zahanine without another word to harry bj made for the door as she went she called ahead low husky dangerousvoiced to one of the girls keys sandra i want your car keys the girls were in the corridor talking to margaret bonnie jean swept upon themthere was a brief astonished shocked exchange then small fierce ravenhaired sandra mohrag seemed whirled along in b js wake and went almost at a run with her down brian lutnley the stairs to the rear exit from the inn and harry still at the window looking out at the car in the shadows and the dark silhouettes inside it left abruptly to his own devices and not knowing what to do or if he should do anything so that when the voice came in his head it came almost as an electric shock enemies harry said that dead voice urgently you was right first time necroscope dead right it was rl stevenson jamieson and the necroscopes instinctive response was to erect his neglected mental barrierswhich he would do except there was something he must know first how many enemies rl and what kind of enemies what you knows what kind man rl answered same ones you has had all along only theres five ofem now not six drakuls redrobes tibetans but by no means priests not of any clean healthy religion anyway but was something wrong here five of them not four recognize four of em or at least my obi does but number fives a newcomer their new boss maybe anyways there be five ofem for sure yeah and harry thought what do numbers matter anyhow the only thing that mattered was that they were enemies that and maybe something bj had saidsomething about zahanine and something else about a dark spot on the floorboards in his study but bonnie jean had been in such a hurry she hadnt left any instructions for harry bj in one hell of a hurry yes and that look on her face the necroscope knew what that look meant and suddenly he felt himself galvanized to action out there in the wintry evening darkness there were five monstrous enemies and hellbent on revenge bonnie jean mirlu had gone rushing to meet them head on part four friends in low places i b j still innocent realitys ending a grave solution still at the window alone in his room the necroscope felt dizzy nauseous and clung to the windowsill his knees felt like water as if they were trying to liquefy and topple him he wanted to do something anything but he had no orders didnt know what to do but he did and he must and the last thing he wanted was for bj s girls to come into his room not if he was going to have to move he went to the door of the room seeming to drift there scarcely of his own will locked and latched the door then drifted back to the window bonnie jean and sandra mohrag were out there making for sandras car so bj wasnt alone sandra would go with her but go where and the drakuls were out there toothose silhouettes in that sinister car suddenly there was strength in harrys legs in his body even in his mind it was the strength of desperation even if what he was doing was making no sense at least he would be doing something depending on what bj was doing right now she and sandra were walking very nearly running across the cold black surface of the service road to the inns small car park and sandra seemed to be what laughing as she fumbled keys from her purse they were dressed for indoors but the temperature outside was well below zero and harry saw that at all times b j kept her back to the avenue of leafless trees back there where hedgerows cast long shadows the suspect car was some forty or fifty yards away as yet motionless but the furtive barely visible figures inside appeared to be leaning forward intent on what was happening necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley as to what was happening laugh b j told sandra grinding the words out as the smaller girl got her drivers door open keep right on laughing and make it look good i dont want those bastards thinking i know theyre there i want them to follow us laughing doing a twirl and dancing even and while she danced daring to scan the area around but fleetingly sandra said what bastards b j i dont see anyone then she slid into her seat and reached across to release the far catch for b j dont look for them bj growled dont even think about them one of thems a telepath i can feel his slimy fingers groping at the edge of my mind and dont put your seatbelt on we may want to be out of here fast now listen start up and drive slowly and carefully out onto the main road in the direction of edinburgh for the open country theres a lot of open space between here and edinburgh b j yes yourewhat luring them sandra had seen the headlights in her rearview now where a black saloon car turned on to the road less than a hundred yards behind yes bj snarled for zahanine and for me im tired of being a target now tell me that shotgun and the cartridges auld john sent me still in the boot yes your crossbow too and is it loaded and are there spare bolts one spare bolt yes but bj who are they i mean are they drakuls and will they have guns too oh yes but theyll be loath to use them open country but plenty of farms buildings pubs along the way and well have the element of surprise where will they think were going sandras fear was beginning to show but she was a moonchild and when push came to shove thered be no fear she would be like zahanine fearless but she wouldnt be zahanine dead not if b j could help it they wont know where were going because we dont know b j answered but theyre surely interested if weve been under observation at the inn if theyve been following our every move its so they can know everything about us maybe they learned a lesson that time up north or maybe their rules have changed but mine havent i think perhaps they wanted to take zahanine alive and if so they may want us that way too that gives us a double advantage surprise on the one handand i couldnt give a fuck on the other so slow down a little were going too fast and i dont want them to think were running they seem to be keeping an even distance sandras breath was coming more easily now bjs too as she continued to do her thinking out loud but suppose theyve only just found us margaret macdowell was the one who led them to us because she was the one who got left out when we moved when they found margaret they only had to watch her movements until she joined up with us but how did they find her mainly locked away in sma auchterbecky but havent you often said that the watcher has known most of our movements for years sandra wasnt thinking straightor maybe she was the little man the watcher is a ferenczy bj snappedand paused but according to radu the drakuls were always the most furtive of their kind so maybe youre right and they have been watching the watcher so why are they following us now i mean since they now know where were hiding but they dont know for sure that were all there bj answered and to herself and then theres harry do they know about harry about his involvement up in the spey valley when we took out their two colleagues bj where are we going the fear was back in sandras voice the roads are treacherous and its starting to snow we cant just drive forever b j glanced out of her window there was a farm with outbuildings coming up on the left slow down a little more she saidthen sighed her relief as the car behind them likewise slowed down another quartermile and they passed a long openended barnlike structure behind the high hedge that lined the road further yet a fourbarred gate stood open and there b j said drive in there turn left go back to the barn but theyll see us sandra gasped theyre only a hundred yards behind us and were the only ones on the road she slowed the car to a crawl and the snow came down harder yet i know bj snapped i want them to see us do it and sandra did it inside the field a potholed metalled track led to the barn in fact a large animal shelter and feeding station dipping the cars lights sandra drove inside and stopped switched off the motor and lights handed the keys to b j bj was out of the car in a moment her nightvision served her well she had taken the weapons from the boot returned to sandras window handed her the shotgun and the keys before the headlights of the saloon had cut their first swathe across the empty field but as the headlights dimmed and scythed jerkily in bjs direction stay there she told sandra anyone comes to the window dont brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii hesitate but shoot the bastard move your body inside the carpretend youre talking laughing my headrest will fool them into thinking were both still in there and sandra dont worry ill be right here then as the dipped beams from the black saloon reached for the feeding station found it and blinked out b j disappeared into the shadows but she didnt go far the station was simply a large openended timberbuilt shelter on both sides bales of fodder were stacked almost to the low ceiling behind fencing so gapped mat animals would be able to get their heads through there was also a water trough and stout wooden ladders that climbed to a loft so loaded with hay it sagged in the middle then as the sound of the drakul saloons engine died away b j slipped between the bars of the fence into the mustysmelling darkness between aisles of stacked hay the saloon was a spacious fiveseater and the dead man rl stevenson jamieson had been right all five seats were in use within the vehicle as the hot engine cooled and slowly ticked into silence and the wipers scratched a little as they arced to and fro clearing wet snow from the cold curved windscreen four drakul thralls waited for orders the fifth member of the party the new leader of the group sat in the front passenger seat staring forward through his arc of blurred glass one of the three in the back smoked a perfumed cigarette a rare luxury in the drakesh monastery such was not allowed inhuman vices took precedence over the merely human but smoking was only one of this mans vices his face bore testimony to that sterile dressings taped in place over hollow badly scarred cheeks so they are waiting for someone the leader the lieutenant seconded by drakesh from india and recently arrived in scotland turned to the thrall with the scars and said youhave some experience of radus people yes did you recognize these women as his thralls the man answered yes one of them is called sandra mohrag i didnt see the others face but what does it matter what theyre called theyre his thralls certainly and all of them shapely goodlooking women or bitches his grin twisted by the dressings was sallow shallow and ugly their shapes and looks do not concern me the leaders answer was cold emotionless only their knowledge and this time we want at least one of themalive his meaning was obvious but the scarred man protested that was an accident we were waiting for the man this harry keogh it wasnt planned that the black girl but the leader cut him short this time there can be no accidents and better still if there is no gunfire do try to remember that and do not disappoint me for if you do you also disappoint the last true drakul the accident with the black girl was what an opportunity wasted try not to waste this one now go and hurry for if they are waiting for someone we do not want to be here when that someone arrives or if it should be this harry then we will want to be here most certainly but until we may question we may not know the thrall with the scarred face and his companion from the zahanine killing left the car melted into the shadows of the hedge moved silently towards the animal shelter as they went the scarfaced man took out his automatic and screwed its silencer in place on the muzzle no gunfire oh really that was all very well but he had seen how these bitches fought the shelter loomed close a dark blot behind the diagonally slicing snow closer still and there was movement animation in the car at the wheel a female figure moved nodded her head leaned this way and that and laughed not for much longer however scarface took the passenger side the other crouched low crossed behind the car inched his way to the drivers window and as laughter sounded again from within he wrenched at the handle yanked the door open and came to his feet all in one movement in the next moment he was reaching inside with both arms reaching for the girl where she sat at the wheel sandra felt his hands touch her neck shoved the shotgun cradled on her knees into his lower belly pulled on one trigger it was almost a repeat performance of the scene at inverdruie when auld john killed vincent ragusa the drakul didnt know what had hit him with rags of clothing flapping and his lower intestines uncoiling from his blackened flesh he lifted from his feet sailed backwards broke his spine on the fence as he crashed through it the sound of the blast was deadened by walls of fodder all around all but lost in the moaning of the wind and the hissing of the snow while on the other side of the car acting in perfect coordination with his number two the thrall with the facial dressings had first tested then likewise snatched his door open in time to see the flash of the detonation and hear its muffled boom as the figure of his comrade was hurled back out of sight then moving with frenzied speed he got his right arm and gun hand inside the car but his target was already slipping out of the drivers door he instinctively reached after her at the same time wondering but where is her passenger the answer came with the threeinch claws that sank deep necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley through the cloth of his jacket and shirt into his shoulder at the neck yanking him backwards from the car and in the fiery gaze of scarlet luminous triangular eyes that stared unblinking at him from no more than twelve inches away in the splitsecond before his weapon was batted aside sent spinning from nerveless fingers nerveless yes for he was merely a thrall oh a vampire but still only a thrall not even a lieutenant while this this was wamphyri b j mirlu was only partwoman now a very small part but threequarters of her was wolf and not fust wolf but werewolf she had needed no full moon only her rage and the strength of her will the rest had been reflex automatic and monstrously easy as easy as that time a few weeks ago when margaret macdowell had been threatened during daylight hours metamorphosis would have been highly improbable if not impossible at night a time like this when b j was so troubled and so furious she was wamphyri and the puny manthing she held ohsoeasily in one awful talonlike hand while the other rested lightly on his jackets breast pocket feeling the pulse of his fluttering heart knew it he looked at her at that forwardleaning leering white beast looked at the shock of white bristling ruff framing a face that somehow managed to retain something of bjs humanity at her figure taller by inches than his own like a rangy upright bitchdog at slavering jaws that cracked open revealing teeth that made his own vampire fangs seem entirely insignificant looked and shuddered and might have screamed but was held breathless by those eyes for bonnie jean mirlu was a beguiler and the fire in her eyes robbed him of all strength of will those eyesintent upon the dressings on his face and bjs mind remembering the bloody skin she had seen under poor dead zahanines nails white foam dripped from the corner of her terrible mouth as she lifted her free nineinch paw from his chest to strip away the dressings and red fire seemed to drip from her eyes when she saw his scars then those eyes opened wider yet became gateways to hell and freed him of his paralysis as they smiled but there are smiles and there are smiles and bjs entire face her entire being smiledexcept this was a smile that the drakul wouldnt have time to remember not in this world as her needle nails dug deeper yet into his shoulder and neck his scream came bubbling up over a wriggling tongue but found no outlet for b j had closed her mouth on his face a gurgle was all he could manage as the bones of his face crunched under those jaws and lifting him off his feet lifting him by the face she shook him like a terrier shakes a rat and tossed him aside overhead there was sudden movement the hayloft creaked a presence bjs senses more than the usual five now went out and updiscovered nothing but a trickle of dust and a handful of straw spilling through gaps in the lofts floorboards but it gave her an idea all of this action had taken mere moments back in the saloon the three drakuls had heard what might have been a dull explosion but they had seen nothing the wipers were having a hard time keeping the snow off the windscreen and their breath was steaming up the inside of the car when the feeding station suddenly came bursting alive with light however they saw that clearly enough then the leader gasped what the for the light wasnt a cars side or headlights it was fire the shelter was on fire and well on fire fire leapt from bale to tinderdry bale in the fenced area licked up the walls and was carried by the wind end to end of the loft so that in a very few seconds the structure was lit up like day brighter as sandras car lights came on and she revved her engine driving out of the far side of the blazing shelter the drakul lieutenant could scarcely believe his eyes the car swerved uturned came skidding and fishtailing back past the burning outbuilding and onto the farm track it came head on apparently on a collision course but the drakul driver had had the presence of mind to switch on his engine he was reversing along the track blinded by sandras oncoming headlights he jerked his wheel and skidded backwards off the metalled surface and sandras car howled by in a derisive wail of her horn with bonnie jeans face human now laughing like a madwoman from her wounddown window shaken up bounced about inside their vehicle which they were lucky hadnt rolled the drakuls werent able to use their weapons and would be loath to do so anyway but as sandras car left the field for the open road the leader yelled drive to the fire quickly and the driver bumped the saloon back onto the track and did as hed been ordered the shelter was a furnace now where impaled on opposing fence posts twin figures jerked writhed and burned in the merciless heat and the lieutenant knew that this wasnt the work of mere thralls nor even of a creature of his own status that woman he hissed throwing up a hand to shield his eyes from the glare the one who laughed at us brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii b j mirlu his driver gasped but how did she enough the lieutenant snapped cutting him short he believed he knew how but had no desire to demoralize his men more yet and so away from here now he said for theres no helping those twono helping any of this mess and that fire will soon attract attention now we have to put distance between so head for the highlands revenge comes later harry had seen it all dimly through gaps in the lofts plank flooring hed seen itand still couldnt believe his eyes following the cars had been easy a series of mbius jumps from his room along the hedgerow that paralleled the mainly deserted road as for his plan there hadnt been one only to make himself available if b j needed him how he would have explained his presence in the event he had to show himselfharry hadnt given it a thought thered been no time for thinking only for worrying about b j when her car had turned into the field and driven on into the ramshackle shelter of the feeding station hed made a last jump to the musty loft got down on his stomach and waited and with his eyes gradually adjusting to the gloom he had managed to follow most of the action he had seen b j get out of the car and slip through the fence into the narrow spaces between the stacks of baled hay and he had also seen what came out of there much worse there was a name for it then hed seen what she did to the drakuls that hideous strength to be able to lift a man and drive him down onto a fence post with such force as to impale him but he had it wrong surely and now along with his other senses he couldnt trust his eyes either oh and what of his ears for zahanine b j had said before she ran out of the inn with sandra for zahanine the black girl in his study the stain on the floor that hed hidden under a piece of carpet from his front room now he stood wet and miserable in the sleeting snow by the roadside the tail lights of b js car were already disappearing in the direction of the inn and the drakul saloon was turning out of the field onto the road heading the other way the chase or whatever it had been bjs lure her trap was over and she had won shed won this round anyway but what of the rest of it harry wasnt under orders hed been in such a bewildered mentally confused condition that b j hadnt thought it necessary indeed he had been like a child following her around for so long now that she had almost forgotten he was ever anything else and harry had started or wanted to forget it too but he had been something else and he was if onlyif only the world would stand still a fucking minute and let him find his true orientation he had toto stop running fromfrom whatever it was drakuls in their stationwagon nosediving off the road after he had bombed their carthe blazing wreck and a lieutenant melting where hed impaled himself on his steering columnhis body fats slopping out from under the sprung door flowing like candle wax around the shoulders of a dead vampire thralla thrall with one ofbj s silvered crossbow bolts buried in his heart faster and faster the pictures came a kaleidoscope of scenes flashing before his minds eye but all of them dreams and fancies surely the necroscope couldnt control them his computerminds limbo files were spilling over onto the screen of real life it was what his mother and dead friends had most feared and what bj had tried to eliminate from his we it was the limbo interface where harrys various levels of consciousness were colliding and merging into chaos but this time bj wasnt here to call him her wee man and put it right and for the first time in a long time he didnt want it put right he wanted the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help him ggodf he clutched at his head sank to his knees in the slush at the side of the road he had seen b j seen her as she was not as she pretended to be but as she really was oh really no she fucking wasnt the truth and nothing but the truth guilty mlud no she is innocent everything else is fantasy a dream a nightmare and i can prove it a car went by its headlights blazing in passing it sent twin waves of yellow slush over the necroscope where he kneeled in the snow on the dark verge of the road and the narrow rim of sanity the sudden freezing shock brought him upright and sent him stumbling stumbling through a hastily conjured mobius door to the one place in the world where he could finally prove bjs innocence or her guilt his house in bonnyrig now harry slept and slept like a dead man for when for the first time hed seen the work done on his patio windows work he seemed to vaguely remember ordering and after hed rolled back the carpet on the study floor until the dark splotches of recent stains became visible then the fatigue of necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley uttermost confusion and panic had stepped in thenit was his mental exhaustion that had saved him at least for the time being not physical fatigue for the necroscopes body was in remarkably good shape but mental the interface had worked against itself draining harrys teetering mind rather than toppling it over the edge and hed fallen deliriously asleep in his chair where gradually his whirling brain had settled into ordered patterns and as the natural subconscious level of sleep had detached from the conscious so his hypnotically manufactured levels had once again separated but the floors between the levels were fracturing gradually sagging and it was a very temporary reprieve well into the night vulnerable as never before but quite beyond caring harry slept dreamlessly healingly and as the mental fragmentation decreased so his metaphysical mind became more receptive of outside influences his barriers against the dead normally enforced by strength of will were down and the great majority knew it because harrys lone flame flickered in their darkness as before however weakly so that when at last dreams came they were more than just dreams first there was his beloved ma soothing calming careful her voice merely attempted to guide him remind him of his teeming dead friends and the fact that of all men he was not alone harry son have you foresaken us altogether forever it appears so where are you where are your thoughts that you no longer feel safe confiding in us there was some pain in her voice but far more of concern and just hearing her the necroscope knew what he had been missing for so long his contact with the dead but at last he had the opportunity to offer at least something of an explanation ma i cant daren t talk to you he said the talents i have the things i can do including this thing have to remain my secret and only mine always even now i shouldnt be speaking to you but believe me it isnt of my choosing in answer to which she asked the obvious question and one that continued to baffle even harry not of your choosing then whose not the girls not that womans surely because she doesnt know aboutyour but on the other hand how long had he ever kept a secret safe from his ma what when she could step into his dreams as readily as this why he should have guessed that she knew a long time ago maybe he had at that but he made no accusation this was a time of reconciliation and so no not bonnie jean he answered at once because sheshes innocent his turn to pause abruptly as yet again the facts and fictions of his existence gathered for conflict for bjs innocence wasnt proven yet not entirely nor yet her guilt despite last nighf s evidence but in any case his answer had been instinctive an automatic response built into him through repetition and now his ma found herself treading very dangerous ground indeed but at least she had recognized it and the necroscopes uncertainty and no her innocence hasnt been proved yet has it son she said it wasnt a question that required an answer just a statement of fact but then because she knew how close the interface had come to damaging him irreperably she quickly changed the subject your friends down here have really missed you harry me especially but we know how busy youve been busy had he been busy it scarcely felt like it indeed his past and his not so recent past at that felt like years of nothing like lost years your search for brenda and your son his mother immediately explained in perhaps too much of a hurry which has taken up so much of your time harry sensed the subterfuge that she had meant something more but it served to distract him anyway leading him in a new direction youvehad word of them oh no no harry she was quick to reassure him nothing like that if they had come among us we would know by now be sure we just well stay alert for them thats a and the necroscope could breathe againbut still he felt that if this conversation was proving anything at all it was that they shouldnt be having it his weird talents seemed bent on leading him to more anxiety every time he put them to use or allowed their use they took him into yet more tangled territory and ma he said desperately please let it finish now she was his mother after all and it went against the grain to simply erect his barriers and shut her out but harry and again the necroscope was of two minds and yet again his respect for a dead person was such that he couldnt ignore or turn away from him sir keenan knew it of course for harrys thoughts were as good as spoken words to the dead and harry he said whatever this problem of yours is it has to be pretty deeprooted i mean who but the dead can ever know that you are the necroscope and even if it were possible who among the teeming dead would ever betray you all right necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley so you darent display your knowledge and use of the mobius continuum thats perhaps selfexplanatory the living could make use of such knowledge but your ability to converse with the great majority your almost unique ability who among the living would believe it even if you told them it sounds to me like an obsession some kind of aversion maybe a weird allergy but if so it has to have had a beginning why not try backtracking to the start of it youre right harry could see the logic of it it could be im becoming allergic toto being me and to doing what i do but if thats true there are no pills that can help me and no shrink the nature of my problem would make it impossible to describe to him and even if i could describe it cant you just see me going to a psychiatrist and telling him that i dont like talking to my dead people any more that would be a shortcut to the nearest madhouse keenan and maybemaybe thats where im headed anyway dont talk like that harry the other was angry now what you harry keogh a defeatist huh i dont think so but maybe youre right and this is something you should work out for yourself without help in which case youve got to turn it over in you own mind think back and try to find out where it began it has to be worth a try surely for everything else in your life seems tied in to it controlled by it why its alienating you from your own skills and even from the dead and now it was out in the open not only the necroscopes ma but all of the teeming dead seemed aware of his trouble in a way it was reassuring to know that they were there as ever on his side but in another way it was frightening the spread of this forbidden knowledge abroad the thing continued to go in circles and harrys head began to spin with it sir keenan felt his terrible confusion the mental loop he was caught up in and searched desperately for a way out of it and the answer came to him like a bolt out of the blue harry my boy he said in a burst of excitement but why didnt i think of it before thats it and you really can do it you can see a psychiatrist what the necroscope felt as if he had been banging his head against a wall didnt anyone ever listen to him any more but havent i just explained that i you can see someone who already knows your problems sir keenan cut him off someone who believes in them totally and in you and before he could finish but theres no suchno suchliving person harry almost shouted almost but the last two words had come out in something of a whisper exactly said the other no such living person and slowly harrys head stopped whirling because he knew what sir keenan meant that some of the greatest minds who had ever lived already believed in him indeed a great majority of them and as the idea took hold he said trytry to keep that in mind then gave a wry snort at his own unintentioned cleverness the fact that in his position he could still discover humour in any kind of situation or statement was hugely encouraging in itself and as earnestly as ever sir keenan said yes you do that my boy keep it in mind and we shall try to find the very best of help for you but as the dead mans voice faded into the blownleaf whispers and background static of tombs and tumuli the necroscope was suddenly very thoughtful what he was thinking was this that maybe sir keenan wouldnt have to find anyone to help him maybe he had already found them for himself well with a final bit of help from alec kyle anyway in the morning in that transitory period immediately prior to true waking the necroscope found himself pondering the previous nights traumatic experiences and wondering if after all they had only been part of some dreadful nightmare more specifically he wondered about bonnie jean what he had seen in the animal shelter had seemed so very real but it had been dark during the period of b js metamorphosis so that even now he couldnt accept it for a fact for surely hed proved it to himself time and time again that she was innocent of everything in which case why had he needed to prove it or more properly what had he needed to prove currently harry wasnt switched on which meant that his reality was in a state of flux on various conscious and subconscious levels he knew something about everything that was real or that b j had initiated he even remembered things that were unreal but there was no single level on which he knew everything last night mental exhaustion had saved his sanity before the massed knowledge of all of his levels could interface contradict cancel each other out and leave him bereft today his thoughts were ordered again which meant that his reality was incomplete to the point of fragmentary but at least he was thinking about his condition and not only thinking about it but considering a solution to one of its root causes which was the single salient possibility that had fixed itself in his mind since his conversation with sir keenan gormley that there could be a psychological or metaphysical solution to his problems and that it might even be immediately available to him as to why harry had clung to this notion to the point of waking when brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii the rest of his dream was fading into obscurityit was because it was all he had left and as that fact dawned he sprang fully awake or groaned fully awake he felt like hell like that time hed taken one of darcy clarkes sleeping pills at ebranch hq just before he quit the branch and headed north or the morning after hed got drunk on bjs wine but where in all the then as he opened his eyes blinked them ran his tongue over his furry teeth and looked around he remembered and knew where bonnyrig his house his study and a piece of carpet rolled back and that stain on the floor and his patio windows and frame replaced with the new wood still requiring staining enemies and they had been waiting for him but zahanine had been here looking for him on behalf of bj it was part reasoning part memory but all come and gone in a flash and only one word remaining enemies but hadnt rl warned him that he had enemies but what kind of enemies and why what had he ever done that had left him with such bad enemies you ve got to be kidding he told himself what have you done what about le manse madonie what about all the millions that youve taken from drug barons and gang bosses and gunrunners all over the world he went to the kitchen made coffee couldnt take it back to his study because deep inside he knew something terrible had happened the last time he had coffee in there and so he drank it in the kitchen and sat nursing his sore head le manse madonie sicily his raid on the treasure vault that was quite some time ago what else did he know about that place why did he seem to remember hearing its name more recently what was real and unreal here did he remember a conversation with bj when shed mentioned le manse madonie her telephone conversation with auld john yes when shed told him to get out of his cottage in inverdruie and find somewhere safe just like shed told harry to get out of his place shit and here he was back again but he knew he had to be away from her if only for a little while until he had sorted things out and whatever else he did he mustnt let his thoughts stray too far off course because he had some kind of pattern going here and didnt want to lose it what ifwhat ifwhat if what if b j wasnt the central figure here but harry himself what if he was the key with everything revolving around him what if he had tried was trying to transfer his guilt to her he gave a snort and thought now im playing the amateur psychiatrist in his condition ridiculous but what if what if those people at le manse madonie what if they had somehow managed to track him down darcy clarke had warned him how dangerous they were and poor bonnie jean had got herself involved through her involvement with him it worked oh yes it workedbut it had holes a mile wide like his head his memory and his whole fucking life since leaving ebranch sir keenan had promised to find him the best possible help but harry had believed there might be a metaphysical solution available right here and now he realized how close that idea had come to escaping him and slipping into limbo with the rest of his dream and now clung to it anew when hed been with darcy and ben down at ebranch just a few days a week a fortnight ago what a fortnight really even time was completely fucked up he had experienced these weird visitations he could only believe they were alec kyles last shot before whatever was left of his precognitive talents followed him into eternity but precog wasthe key word it was what alec had been and so far every one of harrys visions of a like nature had turned out to be glimpses of the future which might mean that he was yet to meet the bearded mystic of the first vision and yet to visit that graveyard near meersburg in real life huh so far he didnt even know where meersburg was but it might prove interesting to find out for the place had been a cemetery after all and what else would the necroscope harry keogh be doing in a cemetery if not talking to the dead avoiding looking at the floor he went to his study for a world atlas took it back to the kitchen and in a little while for the first time in a long while he collapsed his barriers and deliberately contacted the dead it wasnt easy but he fought his psychosis and did it and shortly harry were you looking for me yes sir i was believe we talked last night you gave me some good advice and offered to help and i promised to think it over now id like to take you up on it you mentioned some of the best psychiatric minds that had ever lived meaning of course that a good many are now dead a bad deal for them no disrespect but useful to me for necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley theyre the only ones i can talk to so do you happen to know of anyone in meersburg lake constance on the germanswiss border meersburg harry can i get back to you i mean will you bereceptive sir keenan was almost embarrassingly eager its not that easy any more harry saw no point in pretending it was i mean i dont like leaving myself open like this but try yes then give me a little time sir keenan told him breathlessly for now ive some enquiries to make ill be quick as i possibly can about it with which he was gone and harry was obliged to leave his barriers down and as he had expected might happen the dead or one of them was quick to take advantage of that fact he had thought it might be his mother trying to reach him in his waking hours as she had invaded him in dreams but in fact the presence he felt was that of rl stevenson jamieson and again the necroscope was loath to turn him away rl had long since proved his worth and loyalty er you reckon you can spare me a little time too necroscope sensing harrys anxiety and vulnerability rl was reticent in his approach rl harry answered do i seem that ungrateful well you aint bin all that easy to reach if thats what you mean rl told him and then hurriedly but thats ok man i mean it aint everybody got your problems right what can i do for you rl only please make it quick for im expecting some stuff that could be very important its more what ill do for you necroscope rl answered like i can maybe relieve you o some of your worries anyhow worries bout your enemies man you dont got a one right now least not in your neck o the woods they has all gone north they what you is in your house right thats right well your enemies is all up north not a one o em left in your vicinity not the real bad serious ones anywaysharry frowned oh and what other kind are there rl but rl had said enough maybe even too much and anyway his obi was as badly confused with regard to b j mirlu and her girls as harry himself they had done the necroscope no real or physical harm so far but they had one hell of a bad aura about them harrys ma had confirmed to rl just what that aura was but he couldnt tell harry about it it was one of those things the necroscope must find out for himself and so oh you knows he hedged theres always the bad folks out there lookin to make a mark but if you aims to stay clear o trouble then just dont go into those mountains and again harrys frown as he asked oh and what do you know about mountains rl only what my obi tells me rl lied which was so out of character for a dead man that harry didnt pick it up or question it but he certainly sensed rls hasty withdrawal or maybe that was only to make way for someone else and harry you were right sir keenans excitement was infectious wont ask you how but you picked the very spot meersburg on lake constance on the germanswiss border do you have any idea who is buried there harry shook his head which was as good as an answer then i suggest you go there and find out sir keenan told him dont wait but do it today the sooner the better the necroscope looked out of his kitchen window at a grey gloomy dawn well not just yet he said edgily im hungry breakfast one or two things to do first but in an hour or so when the worlds had time to wake upmaybe then the other sensed his reticence oh can it be that youre frightened my boy of what you might discover harry shook his head noyesmaybe i dont know but youll do it anyway harry sighed it might help if i knew who i was going to see who do i ask for once im there hey you whats the big mystery keenan look you tell me who were talking about and teu you if ill go and see him but you see the other tried to explain what this man was famous forit wasnt known as psychiatry in his time psychiatry was in its infancy but as to what he actually didwell he was one of the best so much so that his science took his name and after all this time well maybe hes even better at it now sir keenan was talking about the fact that what men have done in life theyll usually continue to do after death but what did he do harry wanted to know and he was becoming impatient now he was one of the greats sir keenan was uncomfortable he really was but they cried him down there was a great deal of ignorance and it took away much of his faith in himself you may have to rebuild it harry see its not just a question of him helping you but of you getting him to help you what but you ve done it before sir keenan reminded him mobius himself brian lumley mesmerism needed convincing before he was able to help you msbius was one of a kind the necroscope replied and so is franz anton said the other franz anton franz anton mesmer sir keenan sighed at last thats who were talking about son and thats where he is in a cemetery in meersburg on the shore of lake constance as he had told sir keenan gormley the necroscope had things to do but mainly he wanted to think crunching his way through a bowl of ancient cornflakes soaked in suspect milk and drinking a second mug of coffee he tried ordering his thoughts in fact now that his mental hangover was dissipating they were as clear as he could remember in a long time of course his memory was shot to hell for as well as the things he was forbidden to remember there were those he didnt want to and there were others that werent his anyway and the giant jigsaw puzzle that his life had become seemed still to be missing at least seventy per cent of its pieces so that he must build it as a real jigsaw starting on one corner first oddly enough he was fairly certain that bj mirlu held the box that the puzzle had come inbut he knew she wasnt going to show it to him she didnt want him to see the entire picture for his own good maybe or maybe not but every time he thought things like that the indisputable fact of her innocence would immediately spring to mind and he suspected hed be in serious trouble if he were ever to prove himself wrong in that respect another paradox he knew she could fix it put everything right but that it would only be temporary for whenever shed fixed things in the past it had only ever led to periods of even greater confusion and so for the moment the necroscope was pleased to stay away from her at least until hed got this corner of the puzzle fitted together but staying away from herwould be a problem in itself there was something about the moon at the moment it wasnt problematic but in a week to ten days it would be full again then he would have to contact her brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii deep inside some inner contradictory voice corrected him he even wanted to contact her now if only to hear her voice because her lure was twofold the one that she had imposed and the one that had grown in him he didnt know about the first but the second was probably love and he suspected hoped that it had grown in her too yet another reason why he didnt want to be proved wrong about her harry closed his eyes and the frame of his kitchen window stayed frozen on his retinas a blob of fuzzy light gradually dissolving at the corners and rounding itself offlike the moon at its foil pale and featureless in a misted sky with a wolfs head in silhouette thrown back in an ululant howl he shook his head and the picture was gone but bj was still there like a magnet in his mind and mazed bewildered he felt drawn to her beguiled by herhypnotized by her hypnotism something about a graveyard in meersburg the connection was made and harry was drawn back to earth back to the present again he shook his head blinked and resolved to go and talk to franz anton mesmer but before that there was still something he must do bj would be worried about him he could at least allay her fears except he knew he mustnt talk to her for then she would want to fix things just a few soothing words and hed be back to square one sowhy not get someone else to speak to her on his behalf he went back to his study to the telephone the light on his answering machine was blinking he instinctively wound the tape back and went to hit the play buttonthen paused and shaking his head no not this time he told himself it could only be one person and the end result would be the same he got out his telephone book looked up the inn where he had been staying with bj and the girls dialled the number the receptionist answered and he said miss my name is harry keogh i was staying at your place until last night oh the answer came back miss mirlus party thats right harry said and now i have a message for her hold on and put you through in fact youre just in time for in a little while shell be booking out no harry said perhaps a little too sharply er no dont put me through just take a message will you whatever you say wehad a little tiff harry lied so i dont want to speak to her but but you do the receptionist gave a low sympathetic laugh i think i understand so whats the message tell her im ok and shes not to worry about me harry said and tell her fll know where to find her when the times right but i want you to warn her too warn her there was a worried note in the receptionists voice now now just hold on a minute im not going to pass on any threatening messages to a no no threats harry cut her off look this is important just tefl her that next time she goes north shes to keep her eyes peeled there are people up there she would do well to avoid ok well i dont know if help a couple of lovers out right oh all right then and the smile was back in her voice again thanks said harry and put the phone down then he went upstairs and got his heavy overcoat it would be cold on lake constance this time of year and it was normally lacking a formal introduction and therefore coordinates the necroscope would have had to find his way by trial and error obliged to proceed in a series of cautious mobius jumps but in fact he did have the coordinates they had been there in his metaphyical mind ever since hed previsioned this visit during his stay at ebranch hq in london therefore in precisely the same way as he had been previously enabled to find le manse madonie and the drakesh monastery he was able to make a single jump to mesmers last resting place or to the graveyard at least all he needed do was recall to mind the vision hed had let the location enter itself into his computer mind and aim himself in that direction via a mobius door then when he vacated the continuumhe was there he stood at the crossroads of his vision on the one hand beyond a low stone wall the mainly untended plots and leaning headstones of the cemetery were halfobscured by long grasses while on the other a faded signpost said meersburg pointing the way to a neardistant town whose silhouette shimmered on a backdrop of shining water but harry wasnt here for the view following the weedgrown wall until he found an iron gate standing half open he went into the graveyard and for a minute or two wandered between the plots letting his feet simply take him where they would it was very peaceful quiet and not too bitterly cold but southwest beyond the town and lake seeming suspended in the clear clean air he could make out blue snowcapped distantlyrising mountains then if only for a moment the peace of the moment seeped into him there was a spell on the place which the necroscope was loath to break but he knew he must and franz anton harry spoke out necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley loud secure in his loneliness sir you dont know me but i was told you were here dont know you the answer came at once oh but i do i can even see you in a fashion i can see your flame and feel its warmth and i havent seen or felt anything in a long time dont know you but most of us know you by now necroscope or weve heard of you anyway and nowits an honour to meet you personally it came as no surprise to harry to find himself standing at the foot of mesmers simple grave his talent or natural instinct had led him here but as usual he didnt quite know how to deal with the praise and the compliments that the great majority were wont to offer him especially hearing them from someone like mesmer but he was mindful of what sir keenan had told him that this great man had lost a lot of faith in himself and how he might have to restore it before he in turn could benefit from his visit and so sir he said i wont beat about the bush im here to ask a favour of you yes i know said mesmer in a littie while very quietly and harry i only wish i could help you but i may not be able to sir youre not the only one with problems harry mesmer told him and i have had mine oh a lot longer than you have had yours do you care to explain the necroscope tucked his overcoats tails under him and sat on the rim of mesmers slab i have the time if you do and he sensed the other adjusting to and appreciating his living presence then did you know harry mesmer began with a sigh that as a youngster i was much taken with paracelsuss theories older i mainly discarded them but i remember when i was thirtyone i passed my medical examinations with honours i may say and my thesis was much influenced by paracelsus horace supplied the heading or motto for that work of mine multa renascentur quae jam cecidere cadentque quae nunc sunt in honore do you know latin necroscope ah no a stupid question for ifs a dead language now of course but in any case the languages of the dead are all one to you and they often convey more than is actually said harry pointed out you thought it in latin but i understood anyway much will rise again that has long been buried and much become submerged which is held in honour today he sensed mesmers nod especially relevant it would now appear or perhaps not the words seem applicable applied to yourself that is your discoveries your friends and mode of life but not in the sense intended and never in connection with myself just another contradiction and my life was full of them i was soundoctorlike so unprofessional this constant searching for this actual belief in a metaphysical medium in which i might work entirely physical cures thus my work remains buried in no wise held in honour to this day plainly my reasoning was awry but as has since been proved my reasons for reasoning thus were very well founded small consolation in any case i see no cause to deny what i was never ashamed of my beliefs and systems were in accord with the age primitive and my conclusions incorrect a great many thousands of people have benefited from your hypnosis the necroscope told him you were the first medical practitioner to recognize or invent it there were others who worked similar veins but inventor scarcely why the first true adepts werent even men but creatures of nature the snake for example and the octopus ive heard how they mesmerize crustacea crabs and such before eating them really so it would seem fascination focused through the eyes or the mind behind them a sort of living magnetism but didnt you call it just that animal magnetism magnetisn yes beguilement or hypnotism mainly its your contribution we recognize mesmerism it might be flattery but it was largely the truth while the sciences of the mind and in harrys case mind over matter had long since eroded and even obliterated mesmers contributions still his work had been a landmark and you tell me it has been beneficial dyou know harry but in life the last quarter century of my life at least especially after i returned to switzerland and semiretirement scarcely bothered to follow all the developments the mutations taking place in my science i knew nothing of what went on outside myself my theories had been so thoroughly and frequently ridiculed that even i had begun to lose faith in wolfart published my life work but much too late it was already out of date likewise in death i have been too slow too lax toodisillusioned and now you tell me my work is beneficial well to tell the truth lam not totally out of touch indeed since you came along the teeming dead have never been more in touch but as i hinted i havent been taking notice as in life ive stuck to my own guns and ignored everyone elses now i am left alone with nothing more than my own theories quack brian lumley theories as im sure youll appreciate my fluidum indeed i see how ridiculous it seems now but i am a man of habit as you see how was harry to read that was franz anton mesmer the odd man out the only one of the teeming dead to refute the old law that in death a man will continue to do what he did in life by continuing to isolate himself at first from his contemporaries and detractors and now from more recent practitioners he may have done just that and so the necroscope was disappointed and frustrated by now mesmer should be one of the greatest or even the greatest hypnotist of all time but not if hed abandoned his art or failed to follow it through so perhaps harry had come to the wrong man the wrong place after all beneficial mesmer mused again well i suppose so in the reduction of pain at least but as the plaything of fakirs and stage magicians what to make men bark like dogs or quack like ducks his thoughts had turned sour he was losing interest what about psychiatry psychoanalysis harry challenged him nothing bogus or theatrical about that and your work is a foundation stone perhaps the foundation stone do you think so its very kind of you to say so and of course i have made advanceswell theoretical advances at least if only in my own mind for down here there has been no one to practice on i havent what magnetized anyone in a long time and being dead incorporeal sightless is hardly conducive to practical experimentation it has been shall we say something of a disadvantage have thought about it certainly but how may i exert my will to influence or hypnotize someone i cant even see im not sure sir harry answered thats why im here in order to find out you came here to consult me in myprofessional capacity in death despite that i was discredited in life obviously flattery wasnt going to suffice the necroscope saw now that indeed mesmer no longer had faith in himself and it was allimportant that he should have for if he was without faith how could he expect his subject to have any harry understood how in large part it is the subjects belief in hypnotism that makes it work but still i need someone to examine me he doggedly persisted to hypnotize me look inside my head and tell me whats gone wrong in there since you have had a hundred and seventy years to perfect your art i supposed you would be my best bet that was my line of reasoning and if s why i came here to see you ah but youre one hundred and seventy years too late for i am dead after all how may someone who is exanimate examine the living and necroscope the lost years vol ii then quickly as if to change the subject but the way you came here this miracle of instantaneous travel what manner of new science is this for the moment despite his frustration the necroscope allowed himself to be sidetracked from the main purpose of his visitor perhaps not for he had learned how to argue with the best of them and was quick to see how mesmers interest in his weird talents might provide a key to the door that the good doctor seemed to have locked on his own hypnotic skills and so he said a science sir but if not magic how else would you describe it mesmer couldnt understand harrys hesitancy the pause of a few seconds in which his mind worked overtime to develop his plan of campaign his word game and a new science he eventually musedand denied it in a moment well scarcely for as far as im aware and excluding my lost son im its sole practitioner it isnt something i can publish for the math is alien metaphysical the equations dont equate and the formulae mutate within themselves and as youll appreciate if a formula isnt constant it isnt a formula mesmer tried to understand him gave up and said myself i was no great mathematician are you sayingyou re so far ahead of your time you would be misunderstood harry nodded i suppose so much like yourself in your time oh i could prove what i do but even so id probably be called a charlatan a fraud a trickster or stage magician as you were we see men on our television screens who fly or make massive monuments disappear or read the minds of their audiences sometimes they converse with the dead too they are fakers of course yet at the same time i am living proof that the physical and metaphysical are definitely linked you were ridiculed worse you now ridicule yourself for having sought or invented a metaphysical medium or fluidum in order to explain your physical cures yet even now we cant be sure that the fluidum doesnt in fact exist but of course we can be sure because it hasnt been discovered mesmer was hookednot only on their philosophical exchange but more probably the necroscope thought on the notion the forlorn hope that perhaps in proposing his theories he hadnt been such a quack after all im not sure i understand you harry answered knowing full well mesmers meaning but feigning ignorance not discovered but neither have we explored the deepest ocean floor yet were sure its there mean that in your modem age of radio waves xrays and gamma necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley rays and what have you in the superscientific world in which you live there has not been discovered the tiniest remotest germ of evidence to support the existence of any kind of fluidum i mean that if it was there your scientists would have found it i am not that much out of touch necroscope harry pounced and yet there is an entirely physical universal force with universal laws that are universally accepted whose influence within metaphysical or nearmetaphysical spheres is extraordinary and entirely inexplicable to give you a clue it was discovered by sir isaac newton who died seven years before you were born gravity well afluidum of sorts granted but metaphysical i have to say pish we see its effects every day and as you say its laws are visible and universally accepted its physical laws harry nodded but can its other side be explained as easily what other side but didnt one of your quack theories consider the motion of planetary bodies contributory to the ailments of human minds and bodies wasnt that what your fluidum theory was all about harry sensed an incorporeal frown and quickly went on the moon sir it lures the tides youll agree yes and the fluid balance of the brain to turn men and creatures into lunatics so werent you right after all gravity my fluidum perhaps harry shrugged who knows and ive only given you one example of the moons influence eh isnt a womans cycle governed by the phases of the moon and what was unknown in your time and probably unknown to you even now a myriad ocean polyps and corals all around the world spawn together and turn the sea to milk all in resonance with the moon but and sunspots what disturbances on the surface of the sun whirlpools in its plasma they interfere with our radio waves television communications in general and the suns rays cause cancers so who can say about the other heavenly bodies was right then as the spheres influence each other the earth its oceans denizens and all inanimate matter so they also influencemen so it would appear but havent the astrologers been telling us that for ages bah mesmer was vastly disappointed you leap from science to fantasy in a breath but no the necroscope denied it i move from the physical to the metaphysical do you know i had an almost identical argument with mobius eh i dont know him well then you two should get together some time august ferdinand would enjoy that im sure but he would have been a young man only twentythree or four when you died he was a mathematician an astronomer and a very brilliant man unlike you he continued to develop his sidereal math in death and so discovered his mobius continuum without which i wouldnt have been able to visit you for just as it applied to mobius an incorporeal metaphysical being so it applied to me or i was able to apply it to myself he and i we imposed the metaphysical upon the physical but more to the point what is the mobius continuum if not another example of your fluidum my fluidumis several even many things is that what youre saying it could be the necroscope gave a shrug i dont know but just because it hasnt been discovered or isolated yet doesnt mean it doesnt exist why its a theory of mine that if men can imagine something then sooner or later theyll discover or make it or prove it have heard something like that before think therefore i am it seems to me that what you propose is simply a new and if i may say so an egocentric slant on an old theme imagine it could be so wherefore i shall make it so something like that yes a manylayered fluidum mesmer mused but a moment later sharply even suspiciously and i think that you are trying to inveigle me well of course i am i need your help but thats not to say ive been talking rubbish all of this to make me attempt what cant be done what i cannot do the necroscope shook his head that runs contrary to our discussion he said not to mention the evidence what evidence my evidence im an entirely physical human being yet i habitually impose myself on the metaphysical mftbius continuum why shouldnt we simply reverse the process but you are unique harry while i am one of a very mundane majority youre of the air above while lam of the earth below indeed i have even passed into the earth mundane aye why i cant even see you not the physical you brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii the great majority harry told him then men like yourself sir but not nearly as learned as you not all of them have helped me in so many ways so many times that without them i would be literally nothing gone from the world forever not even dead not necessarily but very likely dead as for sight i believe you will see me as no other man saw me before youll even be able to see into me if i open my mind to you explain but harry had no more time for arguments or explanations philosophical or otherwise he might have talked about the vampire thibor ferenczy dead for hundreds of years who in his own way had hypnotized and entered the mind of his necromancer proc ge boris dragosani in order to direct his thoughts and actions from a thousand miles away he could have mentioned thibors vampire father faethor who from the grave had lured up liches from their graves to perform an act of vengeance and as he had pointed out he himself was living proof of the many ways in which the dead may have influence over the living but if a picture is worth a thousand words there were pictures in the necroscopes mind that were worth millions and let me show you something he said maybe that will be explanation enough he concentrated and with mesmer maintaining contact let mobius mathematics commence their metaphysical mutation their evolution across the screen of his mind the numbers symbols and formulae that govern the universe he explained and even his voice was hushed now stay with mecome with me and he felt mesmers presence closing with his come with you mesmers dead voice was the merest whisper his attention was riveted mesmerized by the everchanging display before he could withdraw even if he would harry formed a door and drew mesmer across the threshold the mobius continuum the necroscope switched his conversation to pure thought for even thoughts have weight in mobius spacetime from here i can goanywhere and take you with me but i wont take you far because your place is here or if not here then at a parallel point in space and this this place is all space mesmers awe was transmissible harry felt it no less than the good doctor himself yes he answered the inside and outside both a gateway to everywhere containing everything that has been is now or will be has been will be time too let me show you said harry he found a pasttime door and drew mesmer to the threshold a million million miles away or so it seemed but distant in time not space the taint bue haze of human creation mankinds beginning was like some vast longexploded galaxy streaming out from this astonishing starburst seeming to intensify and multiply as they rushed towards the timedoor a myriad neonblue filaments traced the lives of people who had been and many who still were indeed one of the threads crossed the threshold and connected with harry himself appearing to thrust him the door and franz anton mesmer too before itself into the future the effect was dizzying the timedoor was the singularity men call now to maintain the status quo it must flee from the past into the futureas everything in creation does except with the past displayed beyond the immundane frame of the door and harrys bluethread the line of his life his lifeline seeming to thrust him ahead of it he and mesmer were actually witnessing times unwinding and all accompanied by an orchestrated onenote ahhhhhhhhhh like a massed sighing of angels mesmer was stunned but before he could comment or find words to try the necroscope drew back from the door and found its twin but this time a doorway to the future and no need to explain what this was as he and the good doctor gazed away and out into every tomorrow those myriad neon threads sighing away into the everexpanding futureand new lives blazing into being scintillant sapphire threads separating from their parent lifelines to hurtle on alone signifying birth and lifeand others fading to amethyst and gradually expiring along with their weary sources signifying old age and deathand the necroscopes lifeline continually unwinding from him luring him into the future while the angelic chorus went on and on ahhhhhhhhhh those lines of blue light mesmer said after a while but very quietly i know what they are and why i dont have one but you did have one harry told him upon a time and he conjured a door at mesmers coordinates and did i sigh and soar and burn as bright as they do brighter than most the necroscope answered as he and mesmer emerged from the mobius continuum together at the dead mans tomb do you think so harry really mesmer sank down into his place which he would never leave again yes i really do thats why i had to show you that which you yourself might well have imagined and sought after without even knowing what it was myftuidum i honestly dont know but it could be even now scientists all over the world are seeking for a grand unification necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumky but if it is so then its so muck greater than i might ever have imagined an incredible aether a great fluidum connecting the earth the moon planets and stars the sun and suns the universe itself past present and future and every creature in it all in the mindof a man but harry hastily shook his head being nominated as the allimportant factor in something as big as this seemed like a great blasphemy no i simply tap into it if s there without me but i wouldnt be here without it nothing would mesmers morale was boosted uplifted the necroscope felt it in him a sudden soaring of his spirits it isnt the way i imagined it but it does exist he said well maybe harry was cautious i mean i wont lie to you sir i use it and it works for me but i dont pretend to understand what it is much like myself mesmer nodded used my my hypnotism yes without understanding it but it worked and it can work again if just this once isnt that what matters youre so very far ahead of me yet youve come to me for help tou were first in your field but i can perceive no outward sign of imbalance and from what little i have seen insidenecroscope your mind seems very wellordered to me but it isnt someone is fooling with it fooling with me and it could well be a matter of life and death do you say is fooling with it or has fooled with it im sorry who do you know who are you in contact with who might wish you harm or seek to control you are you taking the case harry heard muted voices real living voices there were other people in the cemetery now and he would have to be careful the sooner he could get finished here the better taking the case mesmer answered as if suprised at such a suggestion why so it would appear harry thought about it who was he in regular contact with who might seek to harm or control him his enemies rl stevenson jamieson said he had enemies anyway bj mirlu no for shewas innocent he backed off from the very thought but ah great god in heaven mesmer cried then so suddenly it shook harry to his roots and more quietly in a sort of disbelieving whisper show meshow me that again show you what harry was mystified that girl that woman she flickered over your minds eye and was gone but the picture was vivid and she was the image the living image of someone i knew once who i can never forget bj in the necroscopes mind immediate conflict his denial was instinctive but how could you possibly know bj and a moment later he realized that mesmer had said nothing of the sort he had only said that bj was the image of someone he had known and harry began to sweat because from deep inside from a hidden place something warned him that indeed mesmer might have known her and if the good doctor looked any deeper he would know he had known her but bj was innocent of what of anything everything innocent an innocent with a killers instinct in london i saw her kill one man and try to kill another they were my enemies i owe her my life for that she has become my life and i have becomeher wee man the full moon a wolfhead in silhouette the necroscopes mind was wide open unguarded and mesmer witness to all that passed through it and despite harrys confusion his sudden terror he held it open because this was what hed wanted mesmer to seewasnt it or was there stuff in there that he couldnt let anyone see stuff that belonged to someone else harrys mind began spinning in everdecreasing circles a mental vertigo he couldnt pull out of but through the kaleidoscopic chaos of colliding ideas and conflicting knowledge one thing stayed uppermost the fact of b js innocence oh really but the look on her face as she squeezed the trigger of that crossbow and the thing in the animal shelter wamphyri wamphyri i wasnt able to see her face in that dark garage and in the animal shelter the light was so very poor but what about the other time when the redrobed priests drakuls attacked us in the valley of the spey it was a dream a nightmare like all the others ive been having wamphyri just fucking nightmares all of them raduthe ferenczysthe drakuls and bj but bj is innocent he cried out loud and collapsed there and then crumpling sideways from his seat on the slab to the dirty gravel at the weedy foot of the grave but mesmer was with him in contact with the necroscopes mind witness to his torment and knowing that he was responsible for that he had somehow brought about harrys seizure the good doctor was galvanized to instinctive action he took charge his brian lumley hypnotic presence swelled enormous in the chaos of harrys colliding realities his power flowed back into him as if it had never been absent and sleep mesmer commanded demanded be still harry sleep well sleep deep necroscope hear my voice and only mine and obey ft for my voice is a refuge my voice is peace and truth obey me harry and sleep and when you awaken be well at which a vast and soothing darkness seemed to wash over the necroscopes troubled mind he sighed as his limbs stopped twitching his heart slowed from pounding and his wildly staring eyes blinked and grew calm and finally closed as his head lolled back on the cold gravel chips then there came the sound of running footsteps and anxious voices raised in startled inquiry but for a while these were the last real physical sounds that harry heard and all that remained was mesmers voice telling him to be still be quiet and rest necroscope let me work now and try to find your wound and heal ft harry did as he was told opened his mind felt mesmers powerful mental probe stirring in the wells of his memory but that was all he certainly didnt feel the hands that gentled him onto a stretcher voices approaching and receding coming and going like a difficult radio station that wont hold still and pleading harry recognized his beloved mas voice pleading on his behalf and doctor franz an ton mesmers trying to reassure her but it was all so very fuzzy distant and delirious as if he were in some kind of traumatized sleep or as if as if he were under an hypnotic influence but this was only part of it his ma sounded close to hysteria and now you have to concede that i was right keenan if we had told harry if my son had learned the entire truth as we know it all at one time what then and even now if mesmer wasnt there to see him through this what would become of him and all because of the merest hint the merest suggestion that this bj might be other than she appears then sir keenan gormley mary mary but mesmer is there its why we didnt interfere because we knew that if anything were to go wrong harry would be in the best possible hands and finally mesmer himself leave it to me the good doctor told them and everyone else who was listening in but with such an air of authority that it was plain his faith in himself was restored leave it to me please for since it seems i initiated this attack surely i should necroscope the lost years vol ii be the one to correct it ah but if only you had come to me first but we couldnt know he would come to you we simply advised suggested hinted in our way that harry should see a specialist we never for a moment guessed he would seek out the hypnotist when he did when we knew he was coming to meersburg we had so little time and the last thing we wanted was that he should change his mind well he didnt change his mind mesmer said and he did come as for myself i doubt if it was a coincidence for ive seen inside his mind and what i saw was amazing it seems to me that the past and future are all one to harry and that his visit was preordained orprevisioned its possible harrys ma cut in he seems to have inherited at least a residuum of alec kyles talent exactly said sir keenan perhaps thats why i dont seem to worry over him the way you do because i have real faith in his talents in the talents ofebranch in general i mean in which im surely justified they rarely let me down in my lifetime and harry hasnt let me downsince his words while spoken from the heart might have been a little more diplomatic the necroscopes ma who seemed so much calmer now was rather more so despite your sincerity keenan she said still i wont stop worrying for just as ebranch was your baby harry is mine that is why i worry over him for a moment there was an awkward silence until mesmer said well and now that youve told me something of his problems maybe i can work something out he trusts me his sleeping mind is open to me i have his permission and access but there are things or more properly times memories that are hidden forbidden where there is no access not to me anyway harrys injuries the blockages in his mind must have occurred at these times and are hiding in these forbidden memories and you mustnt interfere with them for thats what caused his collapse butits why he came to me also i may have the answer to his problem that woman i saw in his mind i dont know how but unless im very much mistaken ive seen her before except i know it cant be for that was close to one hundred and seventy years ago oh it can be harrys ma told him believe me it can be and sir keenan corroborated it dont ask us for explanations doctor but just as harry showed you incredible things so could we tell you some such things as have been the necroscopes life and almost his death and youre right they are what were up against and that girl is part of it what is it you know about her when i was in paris mesmer answered a gypsy woman foretold my brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii death myself i was never superstitious but this timethere teas something about this woman she said i would die in and it preyed on my mind then in the summer of back in switzerland i was visited by a girl who told me i had once spoken with her mother a seer of the szgany mirlu the girls name if memory serves was barbara jane mirlu she preferred to be called by her initials an odd preference for the period not necessarily sir keenan told him a person may change her name to hide her true identity but retain the initials as a fad or reminder or as a constant it would be easy for such a person to slip up in the use of a false name but not if she simply used the initials a criminal perhaps as yet mesmer had not entirely accepted or digested what theyd told him but in the next moment ah no i see you mean someone who has lived too long exactly said harrys ma grimly and well over a hundred years too long this bj mirlu is alive today doctor and she has hypnotized my son shes his problem hesin love with her these blockages in his mind she put them there to obscure her true purpose then surely they must be removed but he is like two people two personalities mary keogh cried break down the barriers that this woman has constructed and hell fight himself to the death my sons reality has been so undermined thatthat you wouldnt believe the things he has been through things which he has survived sir keenan pointed out but for how much longer harrys ma rounded on him you do me no credit mesmer murmured directing his words at mary keogh are you forgetting that your son a living man has spoken to me or that he has shown me certain things i might have doubted or disbelieved before i met the necroscope but no longer moreover i no longer doubt myself for which i have him to thank and i tell you that despite all your fears still i may be able to do something for him sir keenan spoke up again seems weve digressed you were telling us about your meeting with bj mirlu in ah yes mesmer answered she reminded me that all those years earlier in paris i had succeeded in putting her mother into a trance now she wanted me to try to do the same to her except bj would allow no apparatus no special setting only the power of the eyes the mind i sensed that in fact she intended to hypnotize me she used the term beguile but i went ahead anyway it was like a challenge but a challenge i lost for she completely defeated me which is to say she put me to sleep quite effortlessly her skill was in every way superior to mine but she did me no harm and before leaving she told me it had i l j j a t i j j and the curse sir keenan pressed him that you would die in well i did of course but as bj explained it wasnt a gypsy curse her mother had simply looked into the future and seen my death telling me had been spiteful however her way of paying me back for what for failing to beat me at her own game hypnotism as you call it now she was a vampire thrall testing out her powers you are to be congratulated doctor even an expert in metaphysical skills would expect to be beaten by someone touched by vampirism and bj s forebearswell theyve been more than merely touched and for a very long time but that was the mother mesmer answered while the daughter this bj was different again indeed a beguiler and this is the woman who has my son so completely in her spell and you are proposing to go into his mind to try and correct or expunge her influence how will you go about it i shall discover what i can of the necroscopes problem after that since i may not reveal to him the actual cause of his what lesions perhaps lean suggest when they occurred surely if he knows when the damage was done hell be able to work it out for himself who is responsible good said harrys ma and keenan gormley put in suggested something of the sort myself while on second thought harrys ma said but a lot better if you could break this creatures spell on harry without his knowing there is one if you could do that then he would be his own man again but you said he loved her mesmer pointed out and as you yourself are proof that is the strongest spell of all mary keogh had no answer to that but sir keenan said do what you can well be grateful for anything of benefit but please be careful with which the voice of harrys ma and all of their voices their dead thoughts faded slowly away drifting as the necroscope drifted in his sleep harry didnt remember anything of his dream only that he had dreamed of dead voices locked in some obscure argument but in any case his sleep must have been beneficial he felt relaxed rested and quite well posthypnotic suggestion mesmers implants of course but the necroscope didnt know that instead he would consider his mission to mesmer a failure and wouldnt know what the dead doctor had achieved until much later time in innbe hnrrvl mpsmprs last words to himv brian lumley began to stir he felt air from an open window and sunlight on his face he smelled crisp clean sheets covering his shiftclad body and idly wondered how much of his life was a dream and then he wondered at a certain antiseptic smell crisp linen a shift and voices speakingin german switzerland and mesmer harrys eyes snapped open he clutched at his bedclothes and swung his legs to one side he sat up and his weakness at once belied any feelings of wellbeing he tried to stand up swayed was at once grasped and gently lowered back to his hospital bed how long he asked then looking at the doctor and two nurses who stood by his bed their concerned expressions immediately turned to smiles and three days the swiss doctor told him in excellent english and four to go before you can be up exposure we think despite that you seem in good condition it has left you quite weak but from now on i think you should recover very nicely except harry looked at him inquiringly yes oh mere are one or two questions you carried no documents we dont know who you are or where you are staying we think people might be worried about you you are a tourist am i right you can perhaps help us with these enquiries no he couldnt but then he didnt have to tired he mumbled letting himself sink into his pillows cant we talk later of course of course the doctor ushered the nurses out of the room and at the door turned and said i will come and talk to you later mr smith harry told him john smith smith said the other smiling yes a good old english name rest now eat later and perhaps then well talk but a moment after he left the necroscope was scrabbling his clothes together from a wardrobe beside the window and when he was sure he was leaving nothing behindthen he too left ffl nostramadness the dead in their graves conversed not with the necroscope but about him with each other across all the miles between as they had learned to do through him how did it turn out harrys ma was fearful still as well and perhaps better than i expected franz anton mesmer told her for one thing possibly the main thing you were worried about the grip that this woman had on him yes her anxiety was obvious well no more said mesmer and then more cautiously at least i think not and sir keenan gormley unable to control his excitement joined in you mean youve broken her spell one of them mesmer answered i dont think im qualified that is i shouldnt have any legitimate professional concern about the other that isnt for physicians or friends nor even for a mother but for harry himself and after all a subjects will is still the most important factor harry wanted someone to kelp him find himself again but as for his love for bj mirlu whether he should love her or not surely thats for him to decide should i have weakened the posthypnotic commands which he has accepted by giving him others that he cant possibly accept i think not and he does love her so what real good have you done i discovered two blockages or lesions in the necroscopes subconscious psyche mesmer answered two areas where through the interference of outside agencies through hypnotism or beguilement his will has been subverted but unlike me whichever persons did this to him were utterly unscrupulous and powerful beyond reason marvellous hypnotists both of them and yes i recognized the work of one at once bj said mary keogh bitterly brian lumley of course the same girl who defeated me all those years ago ah but this time the shoe is on the other foot your son has been taken in and out of trance so frequently that the connection has been weakened to breaking point and yes you were quite right he might well have been driven out of his mind by the truth causing an abrupt interfacing of his several states indeed was witness to just such an interface fortunately i was on hand in mental contact with him and was able to take some of the strain but it is precisely because the balance is so delicate that i was able to do something more than that and sir keenan wanted to know what exactly there aretriggers mesmer explained key words that trip when harry hears them spoken by bj or at least they did but not any longer now when bj tells him things that are not so he will know it and when she orders that which he wouldnt normally do he wont obey or if he does it will be of his own volition hell be his own man mary keoghs dead voice was lighter by several degrees yes and womesmer sounded uncertain and before they could question him said that more than one person had interfered with harrys mind i knew that ive known it all along harrys ma cried but mesmer continued and whoever the other person was his commands are so deeprooted that i simply cant reach them they are locked in theyve never been relaxed theyve fused in position to become almost a part of harry do you know what they are sir keenan sounded suspicious the others sensed a frown despite that his face was long gone into ashes do you have any idea what it is thats so restricting him i dont know i couldnt get in mesmer admitted defeat when i probedwhy the seal locked itself tighter still anyway harrys ma said after a moment you did what you could for which im thankful and one other thing mesmer continued also planted an idea in his mind one that we talked about previously that he look back into his past and try to remember where things started to go wrong that way its possible he might yet discover for himself the identity of whoever is responsible it should at least provide him with a clue or maybe even a suspect but as for now as for now we can only wait and see and as their conversation terminated and their metaphysical thoughts were drawn back to their own places mary keogh wondered why sir keenan gormley exhead of ebranch was suddenly so quiet so thoughtful but no longer willing to share what he was thinking necroscope the lost years voltt www three days it felt more like three weeks to harry his legs were like rubber as if hed fought an enormous battle been knocked down and was just getting back up on them again he remembered his visit to franz anton mesmer their conversation in the graveyard in meersburg up to a certain pointand then nothing or perhaps snatches of a dream in the hospital but that was all maybe his visit had been a failure maybe not his head felt messedup as ever certainly his memory but his concentration seemed a little sharper like someone had taken a wire brush and scrubbed some of the rust off his brain mesmer well possibly in scotland it was midmorning but three days ye gods and harry was hungry to the point of ravenous he dumped the hospital shift also the bundle of stained crumpled clothing hed brought back with him showered and got dressed in fresh things then still shy of using his talents too openly and despite his shakes probably from hunger he rode his bicycle into bonnyrig and bought foodthen visited a hardware store to purchase a gallon of heavyduty woodstain and a new broom he knew what the last items were for but wasnt about to dwell on it back home again still shaking he made a huge breakfast of bacon eggs sausages and fried bread washed down with a mug of sweet coffee he had some ideas that surfaced while he was eating they seemed to stick to his mind the way the varnishlike wood stain stuck to the floor in his study that was what he was doing when the ideas finally crystalized moving the few items of furniture clearing the floor pouring the stain straight from the can and brushing it into position with the broom it worked like a charm stank to high heaven and he wouldnt be striking any matches in here for a while nor living in here finished he closed the door on the smell clambered over piles of furniture and books in the corridor went back to the kitchen for more coffee and sipping it in his front room he concentrated on his ideas or rather on the idea which wasnt his after all but had two sources that he actually remembered sir keenan gormley and franz anton mesmer the former had definitely suggested that harry should backtrack and try to remember where things had started to go wrong for him and as for the latterbut things were only very vague in connection with mesmer had he also suggested something similar the necroscope seemed to remember something of the sort now in his own home harry felt relatively at ease well fed and safe for the time being from whatever enemies he shared with b j free of her presence and influence he decided on one final attempt brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii at going back into his past to see if he could find a clue to his condition but first there was something that was even more important his mission to mesmer had failed well probably but there was still that other visitation experienced at ebranch hq and since it was now part of his past he began by recalling that ohsoenigmatic face to memory that kindly learned face a mans face and long with grey eyes whose inner orbits curved into the bridge of an even nose over drooping moustaches that touched the corners of his small but by no means mean mouth the forehead large and open the ruddy cheeks the slightly protruding ears with sideburns flowing into a full goldenbrown beard and those eyes at one and the same time severe and smiling with discipline humanity and a consuming mysticism blazing outwards from them harry remembered his voice too full of learning and in that moment it struck him that it had been a dead voice from beyond the grave and who better than the necroscope to recognize that fact and know the difference then there had been an abrupt dismissal away with you now for as yet it is not your time well perhaps now it was his time the necroscopes mental barriers were once again in place risking what he still saw as a fraught procedure he lowered them inviting contact and so finally you would seek the source of your troubles in your past what do you hope to find there necroscope whats done is done after all ah but if you would know the future come speak to me in salon but do not wait too long for i have other times to scry upon salon harry repeated the as yet unknown other out loud til come of course well as soon as he knew where salon was but who should i ask for michel de nostredame came the mindboggling answer immediately find me in the church no later than tonight it meant another frantic bike trip into town this time to the small but wellstocked library the bicycle was necessary for unless he could use the mttbius continuum with an absolute guarantee that he wouldnt be seen harry was determined to avoid it and so into the afternoon he read all he could on nostradamus then an early dinner at a bonnyrig cafe following which and conscious of the hour eager to be home again he found a deserted alley and risked riding through a hurriedly fearfully conjured door directly into his back garden and finally a series of equally sweaty jumps to salondeprovence in the south of france the church of st laurent was a landmark and easy to find its doors stood open though he heard muffled voices from somewhere within no one challenged harry as he approached nostradamuss grave in an alcove where his portrait hung on the wall and staring up at that portraitharry saw that indeed this was the man who had visited him at ebranch hq there was no one around only the echoing old church and from somewhere a scurrying of mice harry lowered his barriers and under his breath said sir im here and so you are nostradamus answered at once and youre welcome harry keogh necroscope ive waited long and long for this day you knew we were to meet oh yes nostradamus answered for am i not a what a precogafter all and isnt that why you came to see me thats exactly why harry supposed he shouldnt be surprised really but if you know or if youve seen this much of things sir that i would come to see you perhaps youve seen much more and i do need to know my future but i need to see it clearly defined not in fragments or cloaked in mystery i mean no disrespect but your writings are at best confusing oh youve researched me then and did you find some reference to yourself that you would now clarify to myself now harry really was surprised in your centuries why no i hadnt the time to read them all that were as well perhaps you would be yet more confused i myself am confused and amused by certain interpretations but youve been dead quite a while how can you possibly know of these interpretations the necroscope was fascinated a good many of them that interpreted me are likewise dead and as you of all men are aware we have intercourse of sorts of course and now harry felt stupid nostradamus sensed it and chuckled but not maliciously what you stupid lazy perhaps but never stupid lazy you have access to all the great libraries of the dead all knowledge and yet you stumble the books of the future arent written yet harry retaliated and those that are are sketchy couched in cyphers as to why i wrote in brief it was because i saw in brief a lightning flash upon the mind a picture come and gone revelations or distillations of future things harry do you remember your dreams not all of them i am sure and of those you do remember not in every detail so were so are my visions of tomorrow i must record them quickly lest they are lost why i even thought that way in quatrains obscure even now because i have trained myself to it my words and brian lumley necroscope the last years vol ii even my reasoning seem obscure in my day there were other reasons i had my detractors as well as my champions both were powerful if a tongue spoke wrong in the fantasies of certain sects it could be cut out the inquisition ah so easy to talk of the past for it is done and gone but the future ever a devious discourse mercifully i am strengthened in the knowledge that i may no longer suffer harm yet in my day i suffered witches henrys queen catherine de medici was one such fleeing pain i embraced scandal the catherine is a wheel did you know as is time even as the stars and planets wheel in their celestial orbits so does time and what will be has been harry cut in time is relative indeed a good word relative do you like word games this was such a departure from nostradamuss previous theme that harry was momentarily lost for an answer but in any case and before he could answer i know you do for you have heard them and perhaps even played them in the mouths of experts and will again ah take heed anyway i have some word games for you are you game or am i whats in a game or in a name for that matter harry thought about it for hed been told several things and asked several things all in a few dozen words and as in all of nostradamuss writings and his conversation so far his meaning was obscure hidden word games in the mouths of experts spoken with dire inflection but the emphasis was on in and harry believed he knew why nostradamuss experts could only be the wamphyri to play word games with them as the necroscope had done was an invitation to disaster thus the great prophet was simply indicating that harry had risked his all and would do again with the wamphyri but they were dead and gone surely and yet deep inside he knew that they werent not yet not all of them the idea came and went much like nostradamuss visions or like the dreams to which he had referred harry blinked his eyes continued to divine the great prophets meaning he desired to play a word game or games with the necroscope was he game and was nostradamus game well of course he was else he wouldnt have proposed it or was he stating that he was a different kind of game a game that was in his name in your life you weremichel de nostredame he made an opening stab at it and in your era nostradamus you refer to me in latin a dead language appropriate and thus we are one in more ways than one do you know these ways first try my true name nostredame it has ten letters as does my whole name harry keogh and your assumed name necroscope indeed it strikes mei have been stricken that nostradamus and necroscopus share much of a feel a certain ambience or stimmung a relationship and so we return to that word again relative are werelated do you suppose if so then i am ancestral patently for i am old and dead and gone while you are new but time as stated is relative what came first the chicken or the egg frustrated harry said if your riddle was in numbers i might hope to match you names and numbers they are the same nostradamus replied enigmatically as in the biblical sense harry answered neither agreeing nor questioning but equally mysterious precisely the number of a man is the man and do you know your number a i q j y b k r c g l s d m t e h n z f p because of his interest in and his mastery of sidereal or lateral mathematics harry understood something of the theories of numerology and instinctively referred to the following table u v w x nostradamus saw it in his mind and said the hebrew system i know it i speak it it was the tongue of my grandfather who taught it to me the letters of your name harry keogh why see they total eleven and twentytwo the first is the number of the visionary the martyr and the second of the master magician small wonder you are a deadspeaker and move through secret places a deadspeaker that rang a bell but one that immediately tolled into silence as for the rest the sum total of the numbers of his names harry knew and accepted the coincidence but he had little faith in numerology as yet and youre a seven he said a seer clairvoyant or prophet or all three either way as michel de nostredame or nostradamus you have the same number for both of your surnames total forty would you expect any less so much for numbers but what of names to know a mans name is to know his number the necroscope answered but how may we divine a name from a number or do you mean the meaning of names brian lumley necroscope tke lost years vol we get to it nostradamus was excited now but in the next moment a cry almost of pain ah a vision and a quatrain but quickly before it is gone their minds were linked through harrys talent the necroscope saw what nostradamus saw time unwinding no devolving a figure falling through past time through the neonblue bars or lifethreads of men vampiresand of what else but vampires was this the past or the future whichever it was unmistakably mfibiustime and the tumbling figure a dead man burned and blackened spreadeagled as on a cross spiralling into the past the vision was ghastly enough in itself but there was something yet more horrible about it the necroscope had seen this before surely his skin began to prickle but then a blinding flash a disintegration a bombburst of golden fragments like darts hurtling outwards in all directions from the space where that smoking shell of a body had been the way they moved angling this way and that sentient as they sought exits from their now into other places other times it was over and nostradamus groaned did you see do you have it a quatrain quickly and harry said a man of weird times and places falls in reverse towards some new beginning some multiple fruition seeming like death it is in fact a multiple birth his pieces are enabled by golden transmutation and it was as if nostradamus sighed exactly in the necroscopes mind my thoughts exactly do you have children eh only one ah noa great many i think who knows the future harry answered with a shrug and thoughtlessly ida did dofor in death i continue as in life youll help me then am helping you had you seen it before my vision that one of many visions for a moment there you thought so for i read it in your mind yesnoim not sure maybe it was a dream but you cannot remember cannot be sure and didnt i say it was like that the future guards its secrets well which is one of the reasons why i guarded my secrets note if you will nostradamus is speaking plainly it is difficult after all this time but i am trying for your sake therefore for ours but still a word game to me great prophet i have to ask you this have you played with them too a shudder no but i have seen in your visions theres no record in your quatrains ah but there is but mainly since dying since knowing there are those with whom the great majority will have no commerce their minds have illumined mine they impinge but knowing a little i saw or remembered a lot what will be has been riddles were all very well but the necroscopes frustration was mounting he didnt want this opportunity to be wasted sir tell me my future i know i shouldnt ask understand the dangers but youve seen so very much of the future in the stars in your dreams and in your bowls of water on their tripods he seated himself on the corner of nostradamuss slab in the stars i believe it is written yes for the stars are a million years ago therefore a million years to come and what are our dreams but extensions of the now but my bowls of water like a crystal ball do you mean ah no all in my time had a device and so i must have mine better to be seen to consort with science of a sort than with demons who have gained entry to the mind for the rack has power even over demons it was a trickery the water my safety net but the visions were instinct now tell me do you need a crystal ball and your visions can you remember in detail or explain what you have seen no they are outside my control i inherited my visions from a precog like yourself but a lesser talent of course i have no control over them nor i mine and i too inherited them all in verse in reverse your meanings are hidden they must be forgive me it is my way and your protection what of the golden darts the darts in your vision they seemed sentient ah they knew knew what what indeed whats in a name if i were the master magician you named me not i but numbers and where numbers are concerned you are a magician if i were a master magician i might fathom these riddles they twist and turn like your biomus loop biomus mobius of course you know about that necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley it too goes back to its beginnings start at the end and work forwards what of the golden darts whats in a name harry frowned felt his head beginning to spin with the others riddles this has to dowith your name it was a wild guess but a starting place at least bravo in your quatrains you employ various tongues to further confuse your work you were fond of word games anagrams have i not said so verses and reverses harry reverses start at the end and work forwards michel de nostredame emadertson ed lehcim try the latin as i am named in your time pardon nostradamus sumadartson but i dont see because you are not looking try sum sum an addition the result of an addition or to be the epitome of or exemplify as in the sum of a man or in sum in short ori exist i am as in descartess philosophy cogito ergo sum exist said the other am which leaves us with sum adartson i amadartson the necroscope frowned again but his frown slowly turned to a gape as his jaw or at least his mind fell open nostradamus in reverse sum a dart son i amadartson or a darts son yes a golden dart a shaft of great wisdom which speared me in that fatal year i cured the pustuleriddled sick alas the ones i held most deargods mercy it was quick it was perhaps said harry the bubonic you were a doctor and cured many but it took your wife and children misery i would take my own life but then i viewed this wonder a man like one fallen from a stake or cross of the inquisition all smoking from the fire tumbling through time i was given to know it i knew and in scaligers house in agen where i wept in a room of mourning a brilliant flash of gold lightning on a cloudless day which struck me in my temple as the dart from time struck home i was not dead i lived and i could see harry you eleven you martyr i could see more than other men more than me for sure more than sumfrom that time on six years i wandered wondered what to do with it write it down and offend the powers that be for many of the things i foresaw would not be allowed they went against those who would not be gainsaid was i to burn like the one who empowered me yet i knew this knowledge must be known be shown wherefore in cryptic verse the things i saw were made perverse and after six long years of wandering in the wilderness i began writing my quatrains for other men to fathom in death i continue on the pages of my mind it has become a habit but it doesnt spell out my future the necroscope shook his head oh doesnt it and quickly some son of yours hannat will read the stars and in them read his course but ours are not his stars i have no son of that name is that an anagram too and the stars are unchanging theyre the same for everyone in this world they are the same aye as for hannat was hister the king of the germans whats in a name but it came so brief i almost got it right you could drive a man mad said harry with feeling and with me not far to drive for im halfway there hannat i see no name in that hannah is closest and thats a womans name you shall not name him nor even know his time he dwells beyond the rim in afar and alien clime yet a third son is better or worse take my first six and reform his name himself he is beyond reform perverse his fathers opposite never the same your first six nostre theres a name in that harry shook his head im lost two unknown sons hannat and nostre or derivations of those letters why cant you just tell me my future but im doing it and your futures future except nothing is simple the future is not to be known it resists very well then your future except you may not see it can i trust you not to see it were in contact see what you see necroscope the lost yean vol ii brian lumley hear my voice my quatrains and remember but close your mind to my visions else it cannot be more puzzles for me to work out it is the only way and what difference anyway it never works out exactly as foreseen but i am here for you perhaps i was put here for you to remind you of a course that will bring me into being what came first the chicken or the egg very well i wont see guard your mind and tell me your quatrains or mine but see you begin to think as i think or did i always think like you whichever our maaness is catching i have a feeling this cant last much longer harry felt a terrible urgency if you would enlighten me do it now and i feel you here seated before me for my knowledge i see you see into you and beyond you ahhhh southeast of where you sit a great mind seethes and shudders transmuted but not muted in his pit he is the father of blood brothers they are found six hundred miles in space in time their names are distant indistinct seeking some other in his resting place they have discovered you they think she is her masters kennelmaid his castle is a hollow place and high his bed is yellow glowing where he laid himself to rest who would not die her name is pretty but her thoughts are dark hers is to choose where no choice fits her role in his survival six hundred since the mark of pestilence entered his soulless soul the face looks out across a frozen waste red the thoughts and robes of him who dwells within the labyrinth of that dire place within the fiuence of the golden bells they are of one blood one and all composed of blood inheritors of life which was not theirs to take their fall is possible the stake the fire the knife but there are stakes and stakes fires and fires knives and knives success accepts of no mistakeswouldbe avenger of a thousand lives the means is in the sun as it transpires where such as these are loth and loth to stand for fires that warm mere men are funeral pyres to them to be directed by his mind and hand with numbers and with solar heat and gravecold with mordant acids and his friends in low society and alchemical thunder with all of these behold he may transmute inpurity to peace and piety he knows yet may not know until set free by the kennelmaid he sees yet may not understand until this prettys eyes search out the treachery in the dog that would bite its keepers hand six hundred north and west unto the zero the men of magic are his friends but chained they may not help the one who is their hero or tell him that which may not be explained and all done said nostradamus butcan i remember all of that it seemed impossible to harry and even if i do can i fathom it perhaps youll know it when you see it please understand i dont myself understand it the future is a devious place time i was gone said the necroscope hearing footsteps approaching i cant be discovered doing this could tell you more but may not nostradamus too was anxious frustrated he knew how important was the moment his last opportunity to say anything at all you might attempt to avoid the unavoidable and all of this were for nothing also the great majority have expressly forbidden it i am forbidden to say more for your friends in low places know the dangers it is for me to know and you to discover harry was desperate to hang on to him he knew that if he let him go nostradamus would return to his dreams of the future but the echoing footsteps were ringing closer nostradamus he whispered you hinted that at least one of your quatrains pertains to me necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley in the second of the cs find it under my name for tree read trees pride may be read as shame under your name whats in a name oh youllfind it what by trial and error use your numbers and mine wait harry cried but nostradamus and the necroscopes chance for enlightenment were going going gone sir frustrated beyond measure the necroscope mumbled names and fucking numbers then realized that someone had spoken to him and jerked his head from his chest where it had lolled he saw a tall young man in black clerical garb the priest put a hand on his shoulder placatingly english he smiled uncertainly i did not mean to disturb you sir but there is a service tonight and it is getting late you should find a seat if you intend to stay harry didnt intend to stay the church had smelled musty as churches do but outside it was evening in provence and the air was sweet while it was still light harry found a street lamp and made some quick jottings in a pocket notebook he tried desperately hard to remember everything but knew that a lot would be lost of course for the future is good at covering its tracks the number six hundred was recurrent a distance or a measurement of time or both as for hannat and nostre who were they and one called pretty bonnie jean sum a dart son that was easy a reversal of nostradamus but what did it mean eleven a martyr and twentytwo a master magician simple numerology even the remnants of the conversation were fading now frantic harry searched his mind numbers solar heat and gravecold mordant acids dead friends and alchemical thunder stakes and fires and knives only one possible meaning there or was all of this simply a dream within a dream the echo of a nightmare from the past or were his problems the worst sort of problems a dire place with golden bells did he know such a place a mutant thing in a pit the father of blood brothers or brothers of blood hell and damnation it was all slipping away he ran back to the church songs of praise echoed within nostradamus he called and twice more nostradamus nostradamus but the great prophet wasnt listening perhaps he was singing too or perhaps his mind was already winging far into future times back in the old house near edinburgh harry sweated like a man in a fever trying to remember what hed been told could it be he wasnt supposed to remember so why had he been allowed to retain any of it maybe it would come back to him as it occurred but wouldnt that be too late too late for what shit he exploded and sweated some more for there was something desperately wrong here no just about everything was desperately wrong here somebody and maybe more than just one somebody was still fucking with his mind but how and why or was he simply insane six hundred he knew about that definitelyexcept he still didnt know what he knew the mental rambling of a crazy man or lunatic lunatic someone made mad by the moon and now he really was starting to think like nostradamus in riddles and word games six hundred six fucking hundred a measurement in space or time or both try space they are found six hundred miles in space it came and went but the necroscope clung to it like the proverbial drowning man to his straw distance six hundred miles from salon southeast of where you sit the world atlas was still in the kitchen where hed left it it seemed to leap from the table into his hands he scrambled feverishly for the huge doublepages showing europe a set of compasses his kingdom for a set of compasses fuck the compasses hed make a set of his own he took a strip of paper and marked off six hundred miles on the scale of the map and pinned the strip over france with the pin through salon then he described a circle and saw that the mark hed made crossed through sicily the mountains of le madonie a great mind seethes and shudders the father of blood brothers what did it mean the francezci brothers who hed robbed but what if it was all only a dream what if he was making this up himself six hundred what else about six hundred harrys lips were dry he was so tired those three days hed spent in hospital had only seemed to refresh him but the reason hed been there had been more mental than physical and it was the same now a mental weariness his eyes and mind were hot heavy hurting brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii he remembered some idiot character in monty python whose brain had hurt harrys brain hurt too six hundred three times that number had come up triple sixes the beast in revelations no no they were distances in space and time but one thing for sure all of this was a beast and a bastard sir hundred north and west unto the zero he laughed hysterically and swung his strip of paper into the vertical north then west until the mark hitzero degrees at the greenwich meridian london the men of magic are his friends but chained they may not help the one who is their hero or tell him that which may not be explained men of magic in london ebranch harrys intuitive maths and his knowledge of numerology leaped to the rescue darcy clarke d al r c and yl darcy an eleven a magician damn right he was and clarke c l al r k and e a seven a mystic occultist and dedicated dehrer so ebranch or darcy knew something but couldnt tell him it couldnt be explained or perhaps they darent even try to explain it ebranch the dirty tricks brigade harry heard a growl and it was himself he was growling deep in his throat quit it he told himself quit it note and one six hundred to go six hundredsince the mark of pestilence entered his soulless soul but whose soulless soul and six hundred what days weeks or years surely not years oh really a pestilence six hundred years agothe black death and something stirred at the back of harrys mind or in the secret mind he wasnt given to know it stirred and reached to make connections with the rest of him he felt it like a small flame burning in him waiting to catch hold and become a roaring fire a conflagration the sweat was dripping from him now and his mind felt as if it were in a vise being slowly crushed and yet he felt he knew ichrist i know these fucking things harry cried to no one theres a part of me that knows them he knows yet may not know until set free by the kennelmaid sees yet may not understand until this prettys eyes search out the treachery in the dog that bites its keepers hand this pretty this bonnie this bonnie jean oh god stop it now a voice warned from deep inside the necroscopes voice he knew stop it or youre going to push yourself right over the edge but harry couldnt stop no way he had to know had to know who bonnie jean was had to know what she was she is her masters kennelmaid his castle is a hollow place and high harry his ma called out to him from the river dark now under nonreflective clouds harry come to me now come to the riverbank and talk to me this minute her voice was filled with a tangible terror brimming with the need to distract or divert him but harry wasnt about to be diverted shielding his mind specifically against her he shut her out other channels were still open however and harry what the hell are you trying to do son destroy yourself no he answered im trying to find myself he closed his mind to sir keenan her name is pretty but her thoughts are dark hers is to choose where no choice fits her role in his survival necroscope man you has some bad enemies but right now your worst enemy is you cant you see we is only tryinto help out here ok harry went for it ok so help me out do you know where they are rl my enemies like the madonie mountains of sicily and what about tibet or how about up there in the highlands am i getting warm rl all those places necroscope and they knows you man which means i darent stop because i have to know them and now before theyre all over me but theres bigger dangers in you knowing harry big dangers necroscope cording to your ma at least and theres more in my not knowing youre out of here rl and he shut him out they are of one blood one and all composed of blood inheritors of life which was not theirs to take their fall is possible the stake the fire the knife necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley wamphyri she is her masters kennelmaid his castle is a hollow place and high his bed is yellow glowing where he laid himself to rest who would not die radu radu lykan a wolfs head laid back in a protracted howl against the bloated yellow disc of the full moon harrys barriers were firmly in place his mind closed he had shut out the frantic voices of his teeming dead friends and was alone with his reasoning or unreasoning the two halves of his psyche were merging again nostradamuss quatrains and some which were the necroscopes swept in disarray across the narrowing screen of his crumbling mind until where once his formulae held sway worlds in weird collision were left with his magic numbers blown away the magician wasbereft and he knew it or thought he knew it that he was mad he had no reality what was real was unreal maybe his whole life too many people had fucked with his mind and together theyd fucked it up completely all done said harry in the voice of a little boy with an almost glad sigh now all he wanted was a safe place that he could go to where he might do and thinknothing at all at oakdeene sanatorium a whiteclad orderly with a disbelieving worried expression rapped urgently on the door of the directors office then entering bursting in before dr quant could so much as look up from the paperwork on his desk this previously unflappable orderly blurted sir but that was all he seemed lost for words willis quant squat and balding brushed a few strands of red hair back behind his small ears and stared at the least of his subordinates through thicklensed spectacles i take it theres a reason for this abrupt intrusion intrusion the other nodded his adams apple bobbing an inmatean intruder anway and youre the duty officer on call sir well quant sighed and stood up all five foot three of him and aparentiy a good thing too trouble with an inmate did you say or an intruder an uninvited guest surely not the place was quiet no alarms going off no telephones ringing none of the controlled hustle and bustle of daylight hours no distance or insulationmuted cries of rage frustration or simple madness and everything seemed quite literally sedate and most things were the director was here tonight to kill two birds with one stone it had become neccessary to review some of the asylums administrative procedures its many sops and security regulations oakdeene housed a good many extremely dangerous men and women it made sense to check occasionally on their security and ensure that they really were secure so tonight dr quant had put himself on duty to spend the evening with rules and regulations sufficient to satisfy himself that unless something was radically wrong here this simian orderly or socalled male nurse dave willis was in fact in error oakdeenes physical barriers were sufficient guarantee in themselves that no unauthorized person could ever gain entry and yet in dward willis gulped again at which quanf s interest picked up apace dward what about dward the director queried frowning are you supposed to be on dward tonight and if so why arent you down there but willis wasnt about to be intimidated youd better see for yourself he said i couldnt get you on the phone i took it off the hook busy with the books willis now what is going on an intruder in dward but how could anyone get past youif you were there that is i was there all right and no one got by me was that a sneer on the orderlys face in reaction to quants insinuation three security doors between me and the cells and cameras and alarms on all of them he pointed at the book of sops on quants desk but what am i telling you for and someone was in there you say the director shrugged into his jacket is willis answered still in there hi a locked cell of course he is with all those doors and electronic gear how would he get out the question must surely be quant answered and slammed his office door behind him and the orderly how did he get in and how did you find him who is he anyway they went quickly down the rubbercarpeted corridor took an elevator down through the three storeys to the ground floor from where willis must use a special key to command their descent to dward and as the cage lowered them silently into the realms of madness willis said ive no idea how anyone could get in he must brian lumley have been left in there by the day shift someone playing some kind of crazy joke you tell me sir as to how i found him i was doing the periodic scan of the cells on the monitor i hit the number of an empty cell by mistake and got a picture the list said empty but the camera doesnt lie this man was in there sitting in a corner i checked the computer and it said the door was locked i checked admissions and no one had been booked in the sop says any extraordinary event or any occurrence that may indicate a breach of security is to be reported to the duty officer immediately yes i know quant nodded but a joke an error someone is in trouble for this deep trouble they were down into dward the elevator hissed to a halt and the doors slid silently open at this end of the corridor in the security cell two more orderlies from the less sensitive wards were waiting for them i called them down willis explained i couldnt leave the place without they were here the sops sir all four men looked through an unbreakable window down dwards corridor to the first security door none of the failsafe indicators showed anything wrong but to one side of the window from the monitor screen above the security console and from an allegedly empty cell the face of a stranger stared back at them an utterly vacant face for the moment at least the face of someone who might well warrant being where he was cell number the director snapped well have to go all the way to get to him willis answered three doors three sets of keys hes in csection the very last cell whoever he is one of the other orderlies grinned then saw the look on quants face and dropped it hes er taking no chances i mean er you cant get any more secure than the very last cell in csection right iv in the madhouse the other harry bj had got harrys message he had said he would know when and where to find her of course he would as the moon neared its full he would be obliged to find her and would know where to look as for the rest of his message how did he know where their enemies were had he interfaced working it out for himself that things were coming to a head and where the ultimate venue must be in which case he was even stronger and stranger than shed thought but then who could know it all about that one her mysterious harry keogh or radus but that remained to be seen and meanwhile she had had to move on if harry was wrong and the drakuls hadnt gone north she couldnt have them knowing her location and then there were the watcher and the ferenczys she knew for certain that they were in the highlands in the spey valley for they had tried to kill auld john in inverdruie so either way harry was halfright some of her enemies at least were up north which in turn meant that bj couldnt be not yet and trapped between two possible perils bj had moved but not too far and not into the highlands if she had with all three rival vampire factions concentrated in one location a narrow valley with a handful of towns and villages sooner or later they must clash and with radus resurgence so close b j wasnt about to risk any further confrontations anyway both the drakuls and the ferenczys were probably just as leery of her now as she was of them in three clashes so far they had come off the worst as for the fourth well poor zahanines death could scarcely be reckoned as part of any legitimate war no for that had been sheer murder and so it was a standoff and they were biding their time having divined radus approximate location and knowing that b j must travel north eventually to attend him in the hour of his rising they would brian lumley lie in wait for her then if they couldnt take her out before she went to radii they would simply follow her and catch both of them at their most vulnerable now bj and the pack were back in edinburgh in a small backstreet hotel never leaving the place except for absolute necessitiesone of which had caused bj her biggest headache to date on the offchance that harry had tried to contact her at the wine bar b j had ventured out one night and followed a circuitous route to the bar there she had found some unimportant messages on her answering machine and two that were very important of the latter one was from a local police station in respect of inspector george lanson and requested that she contact the police at her earliest opportunity and the other was from someone she had never expected to hear from or if not never then certainly not as soon as this radu had thralls in the country moonchildren the sons of the sons of his people from six hundred years ago dwellers in lonely places only two remained but still they were aware of him bj had visited them on occasion when it was safe to do so advising them of their duties at the time of his return her instructions between times had been simple to the point of elementary they were never to contact her until the time appointed and even then the probability was that she would contact them first yet now one of them alan goresci from his home on the edge of bodmin moor had contacted her and left this message bonnie jean this is alanonthemoor tve spoken with young garth who is close by as you know both of us weve heard the call and were restless its the high ground were heading for well be on the way by the time you hear this i wouldnt have contacted you but if you were to do it youve left it a bit late so maybe theres a problem and auld johns no to house that i can see well look him up doubtless through him well find you till then were hoping that all is well under the moon end of message what was she to make of it alan goresci and garth trevalin had heard the call all the way back to her hiding place in the small hotel bj had worried about it they had heard the call radus call obviously and she hadnt what was going on here she had tried calling both men but their telephones had just rung and rung and the doglords return not scheduled for another two months oh really so why were the ferenczys possibly the drakuls too up in the cairngorms so early what did they know and necroscope the lest years vol ii radus other thralls that bj mirlu didnt but her course was set and no changing it now she too must wait for radus call until then there was nothing to do except worry over why she was the last to hear it and to wonder what was on the doglords mind and in sicily in le manse madonie anthony francezci had never felt more alone in his life never in his long his toolong life despite that he and his brother were rarely in complete accord still he missed francesco without him le manse felt like some great stone tomb a house of vampires and the oldest of them all seething in his pit in the very bowels of the place and the daily horror when anthony took to his bed of never knowing what his dreams would be but knowing quite definitely that when they came they would be nightmares even to a monster and knowing too what they would bring with them it had been only nine or ten days since the morning when katerin had stumbled from his room clutching at her throat and vowing to tell no one what she had seen nor would she for her lifes sake he was sure but what difference did it make that no one else knew of his condition the onset of his mutation none at all for anthony himself knew knew that however long it took the day would dawn when he was as his father was now and that fact alone its certainty paled every other eventuality to insignificance bringing him ever closer to the living frothing horror that was angelo ferenczy ten days yes in which short period of time out of all the centuries of his time anthony had become as a ghost now he wafted through le manse madonie much as a vampire thrall in the early days of conversion spending most of his time in the cavern of the pit and those of his men who saw him hardened vampires who yet feared him for what he was wamphyri could only marvel at the change in anthony his sunken cheeks slumped shoulders and fevered eyes but only old katerin and his father knew what troubled him ah my son angelo told him one time where he leaned on the wall of the pit it puts all other problems to flight eh as it was far me so it is for you terrible terrible but can you possibly believe that your brother will be as accommodating to you as you were to me that time all those years ago did you think i did not know oh i knew ifnotfor you your vision your foresight would have been a dead tiling a truly dead thing a long time ago and who can say perhaps that were for the best the old ferenczy was at his most lucid and his most tantalizing how do you mean but anthony was listless enervated he was sleeping badly as from now on he always would in these latter centuries without my guidance my advice without brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii me as your oracle you would have been more like an original you would have had to be wamphyri but now anthony had offered a shrug its a modern world in order to live in it we had to be modern too and sacrifice your vampire powers i have thought long and long on it perhaps it was because i no longer had any real use for my powers that they started to overtake me i was a dam and they were the water piling up within when the pressure was too great and they could no longer be contained they burst forth first the cracks then the flood are you saying our passions were pent too constrained yours especially the other answered francesco gave vent to his desires as a child i had to curb him he and were never close nothing strange in that we are wamphyri but when opportunity presented he went out into the world perhaps to be away from me and you were the home bird you learned wisdom while helearned he was ever the more lustful avaricious bloody which was why in this modern world i must curb him but the truth is that he was more the original too even now so because francesco gave vent as you have it anthony replied and still gives it he has probably saved himself from this but i had thought the opposite was true that a muscle atrophies through rftsuse in human terms according to the physicians of this world yes but the skills of the wamphyri are only ours by virtue of the creature beneath the skin the leech is our strength tony my tony we are each two creatures and we the external creatures believe that we hold the power in this we are mistaken we are the muscle that will atrophy if our vampire leeches are not allowed to use us but when the balance tilts too far even the leech loses control and when francesco sees what is become or becoming of me anthony tried to peer through the miasma rising from the shaft you hinted mat hed be less accommodating than i was i could be wrong but even if i am what is this for accommodationis this what you want my tony to be a thing in a pit i would rather be dead even truly dead my sentiments exactly said the other and i have seeni have seen youve seen what nothing nothing beyond the fact of the doglards return oh and his coming here of course but nothing else no his coming here anthony hissed youve made no mention of this before but i did i did those yean ago before this harry stole into your vault and stole off with your money i told you then that radu would seek us out when anthony gripped the wall leaned out a littie more over the black gulf of the pit when will he come he is awake even now i know that anthony barked for ive spoken with francesco he sensed him in the mountains in scotland radus return will be soon now butyou say hell come here how can that be francesco will stop him surely think not oh your brother is more like an original be sure but radu is an original then ive got to get out of this place anthony was beginning to panic he felt the oppression of le manse madonie as surely as any previous prisoner he would find you wherever you go commonsense says stay here defend what you ve got have you strayed so far from your origins that even your territorialism has deserted you i see right through you anthony snarled finally galvanized he shook of f his mood of morbid depression or his terror did it for him you want me to stay here to defend you no for i see no future for myself now be calm my tony my anthony think what you have here a veritable fortress and men your vampire thralls to defend it how may radu come upon you without that you see him from the rim of the plateau from the walls of le manse madonie vampire eyes at night searching for the great wolf how can he come but across the plateau jumbles or along your roads have you no watchmen also you know when he will come when it is his time one night when the moon is full he will take francesco who by your own words is closer far to your damned original than me yet fall before me and mine also if francesco is on the verge of destruction as you have hinted then why should i concern myself with how he might accommodate me anthonys normally pale face had grown livid now and his eyes blazed red you trip on your own tongue angelo ferenczy the things you say dont add up you are playing a game with me which sooner or later will come to light no games my son my dear sweet tony angelo replied the future was ever devious how may we be sure of anything also these matters are much too serious for games and i am far too old for themnot to mention too hungry deprived i cannot even think straight you have not fed me in a while some tidbit perhaps something sweet someone young no anthony snapped then changed his mind apparently yes when you have told me all you know for i am sure that you have foreseen the end of all this as for now he stumbled back from brian lumley the rim now im weary i cant get enough of cant get any sleep not with this thing in me changing me hi leave you to consider your future staggering to the gears he lowered the halfgrid over the mouth of the shaft and switched on the current but then as he made to leave the cavern angelo lies he lies lies lies the old ferenczys multiminds over which he no longer had total control were suddenly screaming in anthonys head rocking him on his heels what his trembling hands flew to his temples anthony your father is lying to youyou are right he knows the outcome and prepares for it even now the tenacity of the wamphyriangelo neither welcomes nor fears death why a part of him is dead even now in which he is breeding be quiet how has he lied tell me quickly he turned back to the pit hoping they would hear him through his father what is he breeding myriads be quiet myriads of what but anthony saw that already the exhalations from the pit the vapours that were the breath of his father were thinning myriads that word again and finally myriads in a fading whisper which died away entirely then silence climbing towards the saner upper regions of le manse madonie anthony fumed his loathsome father could blame who or whatever he desired for his condition but anthony saw it as hereditary and if angelo hadnt contracted it or if it hadnt been in his blood in the first place then it wouldnt be in anthony well and now the ancient thing was hungry again was he nothing new in that and he wanted something young something sweet for he liked them fresh and clean the old ferenczy and now anthony grinned to himself however viciously he would satisfy the monsters lusts but in his own way and not until he was satisfied himself that angelo had told him all he knew and until then he could starve not that he would starve no he would simply shrink dry out eventually fossilize destroy him with fire ah no francesco had it quite wrong but to seal him in his pit and let him necroscope the lost years vol ii rot and scream forever down there in the darkthat would be much more in keeping then because he suspected that his father might be listening anthony added think on that you old bastard and be sure that it isnt an idle threat as for angelos tidbit anthony had the very thing but here he shielded his thoughts as best he might for he desired that to come as a surprise young and sweet hah but when finally his father gave in to his demands then there would be a reward of sorts certainly her name was katerin in fact the hideous anomaly that was the old ferenczy heard none of this shut down his mass of metamorphic matter slept while moist in a corner of the natural rock cyst that was his cell a deliberately extruded excised part of him rotted down vented warm gasses and stirred with a life of its own purple strands of cryptogenetic mycelium were threading their way through it even now soon it would break open to the pressure of the first of many fungus domes and beneath the black toadstool caps myriad red spores would form like pollen on the gills of these obscene fruiting bodies harry couldnt trust reality indeed from time to time he wondered if there was such a thing but deep inside as an alltoohuman being he was aware of the difference between what could and could not be or should not be and some of the things that had been his life before the times that he no longer wished to remember were surely of the latter variety but here there was no question of what was and wasnt or what should and couldnt possibly be no past and no future to worry about only now which was why he had incarcerated himself in this place of safety this refuge since when he really hadnt bothered thinking much about anything yet now he seemed to be conscious and wondered why he was thinking again and knew why because soon it would be feeding time when the refuge wasnt nearly so safe after all he went to stretch and couldnt couldnt but he could move his head to look and see why he was immobilized and then he remembered or had this vague shadowy recollection of men bringing a heavy padded armchair into his small padded room that had been after a very bad nightmare when hed started to scream and couldnt stop and he remembered the jacket theyd put him in before sitting him down in his chair and strapping his wrists to the padded arms but these were only very small irritations they were as nothing necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley compared to the other thing when he heard dead people talking to him and it happened all the time awake and sleeping alike awake it wasnt so bad he could handle it he knew how to shut them out but asleep it brought on the nightmares when he must struggle and fight and kick to be rid of all that hence thestraitjacket for the people here didnt seem to understand that if they would only keep him awake he wouldnt need to be tied down and they wouldnt let him explain probably because he wasnt very articulate or because he kept mentioning things they didnt want to hear which only frustrated him and made him angry and then when he began to yell they would give him a needle and the teeming dead would start in on him again it was a cycle he couldnt break out of despite that he had broken in and it detracted from his security it wasnt the refuge hed envisaged perhaps he would leave and find some safer place but that would mean going through those doors that didnt existand hed done that for the last time too and anyway he couldnt move not tied down like this but that was ok the solitude and silence and stillness were good werent they except he didnt know what to do about the feeding he sat in his chair itched and couldnt scratch ran his tongue over the roughened areas of his gums above and below his front teeth the rough raw areas of torn skin where willis had forced the sharp spoon into his mouth and he felt the crusted rims of dried food clinging to his nostrils and ears where the sadistic intern had stuffed the mush when harry wouldnt accept it driven savagely into his mouth the next time willis came which would be soon now hed bring a wet sponge with him and clean harry up a little before starting again and while harry wasnt sure what he could do about it exactly still he knew he must do something about the feeding but right now someone was speaking to him a live someone and harry realized hed been answering out loud well not necessarily answering but speaking at least voicing his complaints probably tou see said the voice i just dont know what we are dealing with here if i knew who you were it would help and it would be even better if i knew how you got in here but all you had on you was a notebook with a lot of scribble none of which made any sense and the only person youve spoken about is this harry is that you no second name and no desire tocommunicate second name harry said trying desperately hard to focus his eyes his mind snaithor keoghor kyle and finally he got his bearings brought the room out of blur director cyril quant saw harrys eyes swim into focus and sat still in the lightweight folding chair he had brought with him to harrys cell willis was outside in the corridor where quant had told him to wait but doubtless hed heard this mysterious inmates this illegal inmates mumbled incoherent accusations and quant could see for himself the litter of driedout slop on harrys face but if you fight your feeding he said reasonably you must expect to be made to eat we cant have you dying on us er harry and not even know who you are now can we harry hung on to his vision clung to the idea that somehow this man might be able to help him with this food problem what he saw was weird his eyes werent right they hadnt focused properly for oh for however long hed been here but quant would look funny if he didnt look so grotesque it was some sort of weird telescopic effect quants body was tiny on an even smaller chair swelling up into round humped shoulders supporting a hugely bloated head balding with a few strands of red hair slicked back behind smallish ears and peering at harry through thicklensed spectacles that made his eyes look bigger yet the man was batrachian some kind of superfrog are you smiling quant said do you understand any of this at all no do you harry tried to ask him which came out of his dry throat as a croak a mumble but in any case it was all too much only let it continue theyd lure him back into their world which no longer had any meaning for him best to simply let it slip and quant snorted his disappointment as harrys eyes slid out of focus again and his head lolled from side to side out in the corridor quant spoke to willis he doesnt seem to like you mr willis it cuts both ways willis answered i heard what he was on about feeding time its like feeding a rabid dog i try to get something into him he spits it right back at me how am i supposed to feed him if he wont keep hishead still just for a moment hed almost said las fucking head and quant was looking at him curiously i mean willis continued hurriedly cant we put him on a drip feed him intravenously and whats he still doing here anyway hes not ours he isnt a legitimate inmate shouldnt we dont know give him to the authorities or something leading the way out of the ward through its system of security doors quant answered thats just the problem until we know who he is and how he got in here how do we explain him why bother trying to explain him willis said maybe we simply found him wandering in the grounds inside the security fence no ones going to argue the fact that hes a mental case maybe someone couldnt look after him any longer dumped him on us brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii and what if that someone is the inspectorate the director rounded on him were a hospital a mental institution do you think that puts us beyond scrutiny on the contrary people care about our inmates and we are supposed to care for them and if he is a plant willis argued i mean how do you know theyre not waiting and wondering right now why weve done nothing about him not we me quant snapped and willis shrugged tour problem sir he said with a narroweyed sideways look tomorrow quant nodded entering the elevator ill report what has happened here tomorrow there are higher authorities after all meanwhiletidy him up will you and ensure that he stays tidied up if it means handing him over which it probably will i would want him in the best possible condition and that goes for all of the inmates got it if theres to be an inspection of the facility we need to be beyond criticism as the elevator took quant aloft willis stormed back to the control room it was swill time for all these crazy pigs but he knew who he was going to attend to first were supposed to care for them are we he grumbled to himself and theres a problem with the feeding is there oh really well dave willis knew how to give this mysterious whoeverhefuckingwas lunatic a problem or two and whichever come what may the next can of slop was going down and staying down harry failed to hear willis enter his cell didnt even know he was there until he felt the hot babyfood stew on his lips and the sharp rim of the spoon thrusting in his mouth then shaken from his torpor his immediate reaction was to choke and cough and spit the muck out following which it got much much worse but when it was over and everything was quiet again harry stayed focused because now there was something definite to focus upon at which the great majority his friends in low society saw their best opportunity yet and took it and for once harry listened to them gave them his wholehearted attention or what was left of it because almost anything had to be better than this hes not crazy a man who in life had been a toplevel psychiatrist reported to sir keenan gormley he simply opted out of a world that was crazy from his point of view the problem will lie in getting him to opt back in but right now hes very confused his mind is full of a dislike bordering on hatred for a man called willis by no means unnatural the man is an intern who is abusing and literally torturing harry but on the other hand willis is also the reason we have access harry is looking for a way to escape from the mess hes in which means he can reason well enough if we can supply him with a reason to franz anton mesmer joined in i feel i have something of a stake in this he said harry was my patient first after all or rather he was my therapist first he gave me bach my selfconfidence and now i would like to do the same for him through hypnotism not really mesmer answered my hypnotism only allowed me a degree of access to his mind now i intend to work with what i found there with knowledge yes and ill need your help mary keogh my help what do you mean your promise not to interfere mesmer told her bluntly i dont understand his love for bj mirlu mesmer explained i still know the way into his head and i remember that he feared for her right now she is in danger we all know that from the men and some monsters who have come among us it may be the one thing that can bring him out of this to know that this girl is in danger two things then the psychiatrist put in his love of this woman and his fear of this man willis therefore his desire to be out of it three said nostradamus surprising them with his presence for as yet he hasn t worked through all the riddles i gave him and i know how reluctant the necroscope is to leave unfinished business what else do you know sir keenan asked him what did you see in his future dont ask it nostradamus answered its not far you nor even for me to know not in its entirety so said mesmer whats it to be shall i enter him then shall i remind him that bj mirlu is relying upon him that as yet he has not unriddled nostradamuss clues which may provide the only viable solution and that his one safe place is really a place of torture and peril but harrys ma wanted to know what lies will you tell him about bj only that she loves him which we cant be sure is a lie anyway and also that the case against her remains unproven if he loves herthat should be enough should be enough sir keenan queried mesmers use of the word wheres the risk mesmer was cautious as he answered the interface between the necroscopes reality and unreality has been so weakened by use that it has stretched taut as a tightrope when next he is challenged to choose between what is and what isnt its possible he could fall the wrong way and is that likely to happen mean will his levels interface one last time brian lutnley necroscope the lost years vol u franz antons reluctant incorporeal nod oh yes and the trigger is in bj mirlus hands for long moments there was utter silence in the metaphysical aether until mary keogh sighed and asked and is there no way round it oh yes said mesmer again theres always an alternative to let things be to let a horror befall the living world and everyone in it and then to explain to the multitude when they come among us why we let it happen i know what i choose but i cant make that choice alone and meanwhile time is wasting at which a new voice said you has my vote mr mesmer it was rl stevenson jamieson least ways i can watch out for the necroscope and use my obi to do whatever i can for him he was his usual humble selfless self my vote too said nostradamus for without that the necroscope goes forward he cant go back and icant go it is a paradox as old as time what came first i love him like a sonexcuse me mary said sir keenan god knows i wouldn t place him in jeopardy but to have him as he is now is to have nothing and it is also for him to have nothing doctor i believe i can help with harrys motivation so if i may iii go in with you which left only harrys ma herself with whom no one would dispute the final decision and time ticking inexorably into the future and now continually sliding into the past harry was conscious suddenly conscious and just as suddenly he knew what he had done and what he hadnt he had quit he had given up the ghost with the job halfdone and less than half understood he had let someone or someones do this to him without even knowing who or what they were for even the fear of finding out had been too much for him but it had proved to be the classic case of out of the frying pan into the fire and now he wanted out of the fire too and back into the frying pan but from out of the blue sanity had flowed back into him or rather the emptiness the vacuum which he had selfcreated had been filled again and he wasnt about to let it drain away a second time for if nature abhors a vacuum then how much greater the abhorrence of the dead when the space hi question was one previously filled by the necroscope and so he was suddenly conscious and sane and his bodyclock told him it was close to morning and despite that from the moment he opened his eyes he began to feel stiff he knew that this was only an illusion a natural result of being confined to this chair for his sleep had been deep and restful so that even now there was this fading inner voice reminding him youll sleep deep and soundly harry and wake up feeling quite well and restedwake up feeling well and restedwell and rested there had been other voices too but while they were gone now their messages remained or were die messages simply ideas stuff his computer minј had been working on before it crashed whichever they were there surfacing with harry from his deep and restful sleep the idea that one of his basic problems stemmed from his time with ebranch that was an old one developed from nostradamuss quatrains but what else was locked in those quatrains that he hadnt released yet he had work to do and the idea or more correctly the fact that bonnie jean hadnt yet definitely been proved guilty of fouling up his life not one hundred per cent guilty fiftyfifty at worst if in fact ebranch had had a hand in it too and the idea again a fact that b j was in danger their enemies were abroad probably searching for her even now while harry languished in here and if indeed she loved him and he was suddenly sure that who or whatever she was she did then her enemies were his but he also knew that they were big enemies not just little ones like the one he had here willis morning breakfast no way no fucking way harry turned his head this way and that stared wildly all about his cell opened his channels to the dead it was as good and better than a cry for help a mayday an sos harry said rl stevenson jamieson in a hell of a hurry is you listenin necroscope theres this guy headinyour way right now and he aint exactly a friend how long do i have rl harry tugged uselessly at his bonds the leather straps binding his hands to the arms of the chair he dangled his legs tried kicking them couldnt bring any pressure to bear for his feet were off the floor how long i dont deal in time just distances harry i only knows this guy is closing with you lookin to bein with you i sees your flame burnin and this ones bent on snuffinit well a mite he aint got no good plans for you thats for sure harry quit fighting his wrist straps strained against the broad belt across his chest there was some give in it but nothing to use as a lever except his lungs it was useless even if he got out of the chair hed still be in a straitjacket and panting now he sent is there anyone else out there is there necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley aa morgue in this place there wasnt but even if there had been the thought had already crossed harrys mind that it mightnt be such a good idea to call a madman back from the dead so no physical help not from a physical source anyway but there was someone else out there you have a lot of friends down among the dead men harry keogk said an entirely new but definitely friendly voice the voice of a total stranger and i have to admit ive been j interested in you a long time but they told me you were kind of busy still am the necroscope grunted shaking himself about like a real madman in his chair and friend he let himself loll a while tried to reserve his strength unless youve got some damn good suggestion would you mind making room for someone who has who are you anyway j harrys my name said the other with a grin that only the necroscope t could ever hope to perceive well that was my stage name anyway some kind of joke almost exhausted defeated the necroscope gave a shake of his head if so bad timing amazing said the other harry i spent a lot of time er in my time proving that you and your kind couldnt exist and maybe at that time you couldn t but then you came along since when ive been able to talk to my mother again just as you talk to yours thats one great big debt i owe you harry keogh but its also why i held off for so long because i was afraid that youd turn out to be a charlatan too obviously youre not er harry said harry im sorry if i cant give you my full attention right now but harry houdini said the other im here to do a benefit on the behalf of the great majority and im delighted to make your acquaintance harry houdi harry started to say before his jaw fell open houdini yes the dead showman said from his plot in the machpelah cemetery cypress hills queens brooklyn and out of the blue how much slack have you worked into those things the necroscope said what then finally got himself together again and sighed his relief my straps you mean this straitjacket why not come on in and see for yourself and he opened his mind more yet may i said houdini touching him mindtomind be my guest the necroscope sighed again gladly come right on in harry and make yourself at home but youll have to excuse me if its none too comfortable around here in feet even knowing who you are and something of what youve done it still seems pretty hopeless to me he felt some of the elation of a few seconds ago evaporating time isnt on our side and this jacket would be bad enough without the chair the jackets nothing said the other harry made a study of such restraints the reason youre still in it is to make it easier for your keepers when they want to move you theyll simply release your arms from the chair fold them across your chest and tie them so your only real problem is the chair and harry while i never tried it i think i could probably get out of one of those things underwater ok so just let go and let me take it from here the necroscope did as instructed relaxed as best he could and let the expert take over and a moment later he felt a new and different kind of magic in his life fifteen minutes later willis arrived with harrys breakfast in the control cell the cctv screen had been down which meant he hadnt been able to do a remote check on the wards inmates it didnt matter the padded cells had safetyglass windows harry was sitting in a corner like little jack horner and hed soon be eating his curds and whey or was that little miss muffet whichever hed eat it or get it stuffed into him a single glance into the dim cell had been sufficient no change since last night just the nutter with his arms strapped down and his head on his chest asleep well hed soon be wide awake willis put the tray on a rounded shelf surface built into the padded wall turned and closed the door then turned again to face harry who was facing him good morning mr willis said harry from where he stood not two feet away and then to someone willis couldnt see and wouldnt have believed in anyway sergeant hes all yours and as williss thicklipped mouth formed its incredulous sergeant graham lane an exexarmy physical training instructor did the rest director cyril quant got in to work just half an hour later in time for all hell to break loose it broke as he finished reading the note on his desk for the second time to whoever probably isnt much concerned you have an ape called willis on your staff i wouldnt let this man clean out the monkey house in edinburgh zoo hes brutal and sadistic and has just had his arse kicked when i get the time be sending a full report to the proper authorities or you can investigate yourself and save us both a lot of trouble harry ps leave me out of your investigations unless you want to end up in one of your own straitjackets necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley it was the name that did it director quant tore open his desk drawer ripped out a handful of the paper contents tilted the rest onto the floor but the only evidence that harry had ever been here his scribbled meaningless notebook was no longer there and ten minutes later down in csection of dward quant saw that indeed dave willis had had his arse kicked the other orderlies were in the process of freeing the unconscious simian willis from the chair he had a broken nose and collarbone a black eye and fat lip and his hair was matted with congealing porridge back home the necroscope could scarcely believe the change in himself after a shower some decent food a sleep lasting well into the afternoon he feltwell not quite as good as new but better than hed been for a long time his memory was still at fault but there was this newfound sense of freedom in him that wasnt just the result of his actual freedom in fact he felt uplifted and reasoned that it was because he now had a sense of direction a course to follow and things to do just how those things would work outremained to be seen but it was more than just that in the madhouse harry had regained a little of his faith in the teeming dead therefore in himself he was no longer so shy of them he knew that when he needed them theyd be there for him without knowing what it signified he felt a weakening of james andersons original commands brought about by mesmers probing and he no longer felt so restricted so fearful in his use of the mttbius continuum these things had been major shackles but were now falling away from him likewise his doubts about bj mirlu harry no longer wondered if he was only her dupe if it was so then it was so but nothing was proven and until it was harry would love her as he desperately wanted to believe she loved him should unknown dangers lie ahead they would face them together but at the same time he wasnt about to face anything blindfold or even blinkered nostradamus had given him clues galore only a handful of which had sufficed to drive him over the edge or close enough to it that he didnt care to be reminded yet in a way he felt strengthened by the experience he knew the dangers now of trying to learn too much too soon from this time forward he would proceed step by step adjusting as he went but bonnie jean was constantly on his mind her weird attraction continued to lure him and he felt his recent resolve to stay away from her dissolving to nothing as the monthly cycle neared its full the monthly cycle its full the full moon a msbius trip into town to the newsagents told him how right he was tomorrow the moon would be full tomorrow little wonder he could smell the musk of her perfumeor simply her musk he knew where she was even now and must cling desperately hard to his crumbling will in order not to go to her immediately this very minute but no for there was work to do and he still had a full day in which to do it before he could no longer resist nostradamuss riddles the incoherent ramblings scribbled quatrains and meaningless jottings in his notebook dangerous work he had been trying to decipher them read something into them when hebut that was all over now and he must begin again and sitting in his kitchen he opened the notebook on the table before him necroscope the lost years vol ii harry working ft out moonchhdren answering the call harrys several levels of being and knowledge were once more in place however insecurely on his conscious level in his real world he knew that his future was somehow tied to a place in the cold waste of tibet or perhaps not for he had incontrovertible evidence that he had already returned to that place once to hide zahanines body there so maybe that fulfilled not only his vision but also alec kyles weird forecast of nuclear devastation certainly the necroscope had experienced enormous emotional devastation on discovering zahanines decapitated corpse in his study or perhaps the visions purpose had been simply to make a connection to show him that the device at greenham common was of tibetan origin a fact which darcy clarke had corroborated harry had felt uneasy about those redrobed monks from the beginning but again that could have been a revenant of kyles intuitive precognitive powers so then that the monks were enemies of the country and indeed of the civilized world seemed selfevident but why were they bjs enemies who was bj that she could call up such allies to her aid as he had seen in that animal shelter in the snowstorm but no that line of investigation was forbidden the necroscope had been there before it was one of the reasons he had gone over the edge shutting himself down almost beyond recall and anyway every time he found himself casting doubts on b j a little voice from the back of his head would immediately deny it and cry her innocence actually harry had certain reservations about that voice for sometimes it sounded a hell of a lot like b j herself but there it was again that immediate denial and perhaps a warning too so he went back to thinking about the redrobes some scribbled lines in his notebook took his attention the face staring over the frozen waste red thoughts red robes labyrinth golden bells and the quatrain fell into place the face looks out across a frozen waste red the thoughts and robes of him who dwells within the labyrinth of that dire place within the fluence of the golden bells a face over a dire labyrinthine place looking out across a frozen wasteland the monastery it could only be red the thoughts and robes of him who dwells him and not them the master of the monastery then so whoever he was he would be the one to look out for and there was a line in the notebook containing the word master harry turned a page and found it her masters kennelmaid a castle hollow and high glowing yellow bed resting place did that make sense did he know something about it fuck it why did simply thinking about it make him sweat and so he moved on of one blood composed of it takers of life the stake the fire the knife and again the quatrain they are of one blood one and all composed of blood inheritors of life which was not theirs to take their fall is possible the stake the fire the knife and yet again he must stop for at this juncture the ice was just too thin to support him he let that one ominous word cross his mind again wamphyri and quickly moved on nostradamus had told him that one of his actual published quatrains pertained directly to the necroscope and sure enough when he checked his notebook second c under nostras name tree pride shame whatever it meant it was a couplet in itself second c under nostras name tree is trees and pride is shame outside it was already dark the moon was low almost at its full where it limned the rims of scudding clouds in flowing silver harry brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii shivered closed the curtains made a msbius jump to a back street near the library in bonnyrig the library was closed good another jump took him inside to the shelf with the books on nostradamus he chose an armful at random and took them home with him beginning with a volume containing the complete quatrains he turned the pages to the second century the second set of one hundred fourliners still without knowing what he was looking for all he knew was that it had something to do with nostradamuss name whats in a name names and numbers that was what nostradamus had said to him find it under my name use your numbers and mine but he hadnt meant the necroscopes intuitive grasp of maths no his meaning had been more esoteric indeed he had meant esoteric numerology and so harry used numbers the hebrew system mi cheldenostredame the total of nostradamuss name was seventy which harry remembered from his conversation with the dead seer likewise if he were called michel de nostradamus the modern version of his name the total came out the same in both cases the necroscope had added the seven and the zero to make seven the number of the bookworm mystic occultist and magician but the actual number of his name or names was seventy in both cases and now harry turned to the page with quatrain number of the second century le dard du ciel fera son estendu mors en parlant grand execution la pierre en arbre la fiere gent rendue bruit humain monstre purge expiation damnation it was in the original french they all were with translations according to the author doubtless to suit the authors opinions beginning to feel like a fool on a wildgoose chase the necroscope delved into his pile searching for a book with direct translations but the only one he had didnt contain this specific quatrain he opened metaphysical channels spoke to friends in the local graveyard i need someone who speaks spoke french the teeming dead had never heard him so blunt and to the point they knew his urgency and quickly responded finding him an exlinguist who had once taught french at a school in edinburgh following brief introductions harry quickly took down the translation in his notebook the dart from heaven makes its journey death in speakinga great execution the stone in the tree the toppling of a proud nation suspicion or rumour of human monsters which shall be purged and expiated but nostradamus had seen in brief in flashes or momentary visions and he wrote his quatrains accordingly also he had probably jumbled the sequences to get the things to rhyme but all done very quickly so that the meaning would be lost on anyone except nostradamus therefore harry must use what he knew remembered guessed or sensed to restructure the thing into a meaningful observation or clue the dart completes its cycle to one who speaks from the dead there are rumours of human monsters where the stone rises from the tree but following a purge and expiation a proud race shall be toppled harry remembered the telepathic vision he had been privileged to see in nostradamuss mind of a figure falling into the past spreadeagled as on a cross the figure had been male burned blackened smoking which had been ghastly enough in itself but yet there had been something even more horrible about it and harry had known that hed seen or experienced this thing before or perhaps that he was yet to experience it then that blinding flash that disintegration that bombburst of golden fragments darts that hurtled outwards in all directions from the space where that crucified shell of a body had been the way they had moved full of intent sentient as they sought exits from their now into other places other times and one of them had found nostradamus in time to lift him from the debris of a wrecked life when the physician had been unable to save his wife and family from the bubonic plague he had been the recipient of knowledge from the future hed been gifted with a means to change that future with a means to ensure that eventually a golden dart would come back to him and harry heard himself as in a dream repeating what came first the chicken or the egg as for the line about human monsters the necroscope had purged a few of those in his time but did this mean he was yet to purge more what had happened that time up in the cairngorms when b j necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley cancelled their climbing trip and what else other than a treasure vault had he discovered at le manse madonie thin ice again and time to skate away from it he did so and moved on or tried to but a certain word had stuck in his mind cairngorms harry knew that a cairngorm is a stone a variety of smokyyellow or brown quartz found mainly in the cairngorm mountains of course so that now he thought is it the stone in the trees or the stone rising from the trees is it in fact the granite massif of the cairngorms rising up from the fertile treeclad valley of the spey the cairngorms where b j climbed and lived off the land and auld johns cottage at inverdruie and memories that simply would not come however hard the necroscope tried to recall them to mind bonnie jean bonnie meaning lovely or at the very least pretty and the quatrains sprang at once to mind her name is pretty but her thoughts are dark hers is to choose where no choice fits her rote in his survival six hundred since the mark of pestilence entered his soulless soul she is her masters kennelmaid his castle is a hollow place and high his bed is yellow glowing where he laid himself to rest who would not die he knows yet may not know until set free by the kennelmaid he sees yet may not understand until this prettys eyes search out the treachery in the dog that would bite its keepers hand the interface was very close now and the necroscope knew it beads of sweat formed on his brow tremors shook his body there was knowledge here there was truth and there was great danger the meaning of nostradamuss lines burning now in his memory couldnt be mistaken but the great seer nostradamus himself could be hadnt he admitted that forecasting the future was at best a dubious art harry knew the danger of arguing with himself forced himself to close the books sit back and relax as best he was able until the trembling in his limbs subsided and the kaleidoscopic but indistinct pictures on the flickering screens of his memory and minds eyes gradually faded away something was very wrong and daham drakesh knew it the scenario in england more properly scotland was wrong to start with it was working out other than the last drakul had intended but that was secondary to the main threat the main threat had been reported by colonel tsihong from chungking just a week ago drakesh had received another ominous message from the garrison at xigaze the messenger had been a noncommissioned officer the commander of a snowcat driven by another nco from the rank and file but drakesh wasnt overly concerned with his apparent loss of face the fact that he no longer warranted liaison with a senior officer more importantly the messenger had not even waited on an answer therefore the contents of the sealed envelope could be one of only two things executive commands or matters of an advisory or instructional nature in fact they had been the latter but that hadnt relieved the pressure drakesh understood the communist chinese psyche only too well as an asset their agent in a remote region and especially under the wing as it were of tsihong he had been left largely to his own devices he had even been empowered to argue or state his case make demands and requisitions almost as a puppet dictator though on a much smaller scale his empire was after all no greater than a monastery and walled city and his value as yet conjectural but only let his loyalty fall suspect or his usefulness wane only let him fall from favourhis standing would suffer and indeed was suffering accordingly as to what had brought about this reversal daham drakesh believed he knew that well enough the disappearance and presumed death of chang lun and the deceased majors unfavourable reports before drakesh had dealt with him and the letter had appeared to corroborate this conclusion it was private and bore the signature of tsihong himself also it was to the point the red armys security services were dissatisfied with the situation at the drakesh monastery drakeshs spies his socalled emissaries abroad had brought the sect into disrepute there could be repercussions on an international scale at least one foreign agency had discovered connections between drakeshs monks and certain chinese military authorities in the very highest places behind closed doors awkward questions were being asked and trouble was brewing even now basically that was the substance of it it would be more than tsihongs rank and position were worth to clarify the situation any further but because he had been drakeshs sponsor and therefore necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley might somehow be considered involved in effect the letter was a further warning additional to the one already received and now if there was anything at the monastery or in the walled city that drakesh would not wish to be discovered there anything that lay outside the parameters of drakeshs approved experimental mandate now was the time to be rid of it following which tsihong had appended an apparently innocuous note because of the increasing incidence of tibetan insurrection in a handful of border towns and villages the replacement officer commanding of xigaze garrison was now scheduled to take up his appointment in only nine or ten days time also in respect of the hostilities he would be supported by a halfcompany of special forces stormtroopers armoured transportation for the group was forming up at the airbridgehead in golmud on the sinotibetan border even now it might be prudent to anticipate a meeting with the major just as soon as he was in situ and the last drakul had greatly appreciated this fool colonels warning since the letter had arrived a week ago surely an inspection of his facilities was now imminent indeed drakesh knew it was so for in the last fortyeight hours his familiar albino bats had reported the arrival of several armoured convoys at xigaze and flurries of activity within that previously sluggish garrison his aerial observers unseen against the stark white backdrop of winter would likewise make report to drakesh at the first sign of any massed movement in his direction which would come he was sure a shame for if hed been faced with a merely token force drakesh might have taken them on and gained himself a few extra weeks but a halfcompany of trained commandoes his monks were vampires true but even they were only flesh and blood and as for his warrior creatures they were waxing but not yet formed enough to be brought out of their vats and unleashed like his many children in the walled city they were immature and despite that they were created in his image it would be a while yet before any of them men and monsters alike took on the true aspect of their father except the last drakul wasnt about to wait that long his plans must be brought forward tomorrow would be remembered as the first day in a last long winter of death the death of civilization as humanity knew it but the birth of the new order he had hoped to avoid it until his vat creatures were fully waxed until his brood in the walled city had sucked their mothers dry and gnawed on their bones but alas there was no avoiding it not any longer for he needed a diversion something to draw the attention of the soldiers at xigaze away from himself and then to draw them away from xigaze back to peking and whichever front lines would soon be opening for this would be a diversion of the first magnitude what daham drakesh did not know was that his stolen weapons of mass destruction were no longer a secret no longer in place no longer a threat for two weeks ago yuri andropov had informed his counterpart in peking of the chungking bomb and had supplied the intelligence necessary to make the final connection with drakesh this if response to a british ultimatum that if he didnt tell the chinese authorities they would and as in england and as in russia the chinese were now waiting for that radio signal out of tibet which would inform them of the date and time that the high priest of drakesh monastery was to have commenced armageddon the military force at xigaze would also receive that signal triggering an overwhelming response and at the red chinese airbridgehead in golmud a fighterbomber force was waiting even now so that whether or not mis was an act of rebellion by the tibetan nation or the crazed scheme of one mad mind its author would cease to exist at its source and there was no authority on the entire planet that could condemn china for its action none of which was known to drakesh and certainly not to colonel tsihong who was after all only a civilian in uniform an adviser on the possible military applications of espionage and parapsychology in general without his knowing his superiors had already cleared him but such had been their attitude during a brief period of covert investigation that he had sensed something in the air hence his warning to drakesh he had simply been covering his back meanwhile in a secret room only a block or two away from tsihongs headquarters on kwijiang avenue a team of watchful scientists smoked brown cigarettes while waiting for a motionless needle on an indicator panel to spring into sudden life triangulation systems were already in place even if the task force at xigaze garrison found no conclusive evidence at drakesh monastery these men would know precisely where the signal had its origin and their response would be just as precise and far more effective ten oclock in sicily that night the moon almost at its full when anthony francezci took the call from his brother at aviemore anthony was alone in his private rooms the heavy drapes thrown back and glass doors open to his balcony when he heard his brothers voice he picked up the telephones cradle carried it onto the balcony and sat down at a wroughtiron table and with a cold breeze blowing off the moonsilvered tyrrhenian to cool both his fever and his fear he said necroscope the lost years vol ii brian luraley how goes it brother on the other end of the line francesco frowned at something in his twins tone shrugged it off and at once came to the point the time limit is almost up or it will be in the next twentyfour hours have you spoken to angelo and if so did you get anything out of him one of my assistants has er gone sick you understand vincent came down with something ignored the symptoms paid the price i do not think miss him much but it means im a man short and the job might prove a little harder than i anticipated and after all im not the only one who is after this contract thats one reason i would appreciate a little advance knowledge forewarned is forearmed i know you would agree anthony said give me just a moment putting the phone down he stood up and went to the balcony leaned over looked down onto the patterned mosaic of courtyard flags then lifted his eyes to scan across the broad courtyard to the outer wall angelo was right except to an assault squad this place could be made impregnable if and in the light of what angelo had said it was a big if but if francesco should be successful in scotland it could be made just as difficult for him to get back into le manse madonie as for radu if francesco were unsuccessful convoluted thinking but anthony was good at it moreover the old thing in the pit was probably also right about francescos reaction when he discovered anthonys secret he wasnt at all likely to be accommodating since francesco was very definitely a throwback to his starside origins mercy wasnt one of his virtues and the very thought caused anthony to offer up a mirthless grin to the landscape beyond the outer wall ridiculous for unless tenacity could be considered virtuous the wamphyri had never had any virtues in the first place just love of self and a sense of perpetuity timelessness and now for anthony this new and awful awareness that in fact it was all coming to an end oh years to go and possibly even centuries but no longer years without limit and certainly not withoutcertain restrictions and the bitter knowledge too that when he was gone put out of the way if he was lucky his brother francesco would go on the doglord radu were defeated in the hour of his resurgence and if francesco returned to le manse madonie and to a position of power unopposed angelo believed that francesco was heading for a fall so why not make sure of it forewarned is forearmed true but in this case not to give ample warning indeed to reverse the process would be treachery again anthonys grim mirthless grin as he thought so there you have it and am i not a true original after all he sat down again picked up the telephone brother are you there where else would i be came francescos impatient growl what took you so long im on my balcony and wanted to close the door anthony lied we should keep our conversations private why advertise the fact of vincents er incapacity it would only alarm our people needlessly and im conscious of my insularity divided like this were that much weaker brother speak for yourself the others voice was a sneer what are you lonely then is the place getting you down or can it be that you crave something other than the company of the bastard thing we call francesco anthony snarled a cautionand watched the fingers of his free hand where they gripped the stem of a wineglass elongating like wrinkled boneless worms against his will they wrapped themselves round the glass and crushed it whipped in their own in his own blood until they encountered empty space then slipped from the tables rim and went slithering to ike floor and ah ahhh he cried his eyes starting in their dark shadowed sockets tony he jumped up grabbed his wild hand gritted his teeth and demanded obedience from his wilful flesh his entire left arm felt like jelly it writhed and bulged at the elbow tried to put out another arm or something from the joint then gradually mercifully stiffened as his will won and the rampant metamorphic process reversed itself and very slowly and reluctantly anthony thought his pulsing bloodied tendrils shrank drew back and reshaped themselves into a hand as his arm solidified again tony trembling he picked it up said on the telephone where business is concerned we are always so careful you might have compromised things you got me worked up im afraid ii broke a glass and uh cut myself and again there was that something in anthonys voice that his brother had never heard before or perhaps he had ah yes and francesco could see anthonys face even now his morbid expression and that awed tone he always got in his voice that catch in his throat whenever they visited bagheria the villa palagonia with its lunatic array of carved stone monsters perhaps anthony had been there to stand in awe of those loathsome statues yet again at which in a way francesco came closer to the truth than he could ever have imagined brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii are youall right tony francescos voice was curious now and anthony knew he must bring himself yet more firmly under control yes yes of course i am he said fighting a terrible thing within an inner voice crying that he wasnt all right and far from it now bebe civil will you and tell you what angelo told me get on with it then the hound is finished the contract is yours youll win hands down the opposition will collapse as for the rival outfit you may encounter some token resistance from thembut it will provide the ideal opportunity to put them out of business for good costs to you minimal treachery but it scarcely registered no sick feeling in anthony now just pleasure thats it francesco sounded puzzled angelo didnt go into details you are to do what youll do your plans will suffice no details no as easy as that after all thethe shaggy dog stories hes told us listen ive got angus with me local liaison you know and he says it wont be easy at all hes been here a long time tony and hes wise to the way of things in these parts i can only tell you what angelo told me anthony replied with a typical shrug in his voice he says youll have it easy what more can i say how are things locally are you all set up nothing can get past us unseen francesco answered for the last day and a half weve been on standby the final stages of the contract are crucial of course but we have the chopper er for aerial surveillance in order to cover the high ground you know and weve picked up a lot of quality hardware from italian friends in newcastle then there are gut feelings and mine tell me its going down on schedule so angelo is probably correct let s face it hed fucking better be nothing more to say then said anthony except youll keep me informed ill be in touch as soon as theres anything definite to report take care brother you too said anthony and put the phone down to sit there feeling his face doing things that werent entirely his idea and listening in the back of his mind to his fathers distant lunatic laughter radu had called to them and alanonthemoor alan goresci the real beast of bodmin itinerant farmhand footloose oddjob man and ravaging slaughterer of livestock but so far only livestock and young garth trevalin had answered his call moonchildren descendants of thralls out of the past they had come to radus aid but not without the assistance of auld john and in finding their way to him they had proved francesco francezci quite wrong they could get past him unseen but what were they after all but a pair of skiers from the southwest out to enjoy the last decent snows of the season by no means fullyfledged thralls the musk the aura of the great wolf was not attendant to them their thoughts were neither guarded nor searching and except for an ancient taint their blood was human they had met in edinburgh and hired a car and gear then driven up to the spey valley and found lodgings in newtonmore well to the south of aviemore and the cairngorms sensing them there sniffing out their location the doglord had passed it to auld john who had taken a circuitous route to them avoiding aviemore and the surrounding countryside thus the ferenczys had been avoided too as for the remaining drakuls their new lieutenant commander out of india was a powerful telepath it would be difficult for anyone to avoid such as him especially since in the night last night he had received his final orders from his master in tibet from now on he was to engage his enemies at every opportunity and while keeping it covert as possible he was to take out as many as he was able radu lykan was still the main target of course but secrecy was no longer the top priority not in a world on the verge of nuclear war and so while anthony and francesco francezci conversed by telephone between scotland and sicily and in tibet daham drakesh pondered his doomsday scenario the doglords three remaining moonchildren came together quietly in newtonmore where auld john told the others how it was to be lads he began yell understand ahm no too happy tae be the bearer of bad tidings but hear me out and ahtl tell ye true and if him in his high place has spoken tae ye yell ken mah words are frae his own mouth the wee mistress bonnie jean mirlushe isnae up tae it she has taken a lover and cares more for him than for the master oh shell hear his call and go tae him but no wi a guid heart and the doglord cannae be sure shell no try tae do him harm aye its that bad bjs that smitten wi thisthis bleddy man the three were at a table in a quiet corner of the smokeroom of a small pub beyond bullseye windows a few scattered flakes of snow drifted on the cold still air and alan goresci a man as wiry and lean and wolfish as john himself whispered but why havent you put paid to this man john this what harry did you say if you know him and if youve met himi mean wheres the problem brian lumley necnscope the lost years vol ii aye ah wiz comin tae it john answered but its no that easy see this yins verra important tae the master himsel why it could even be that this harry is the mysterious one that radu has been waiting on a these years his manwitwofaces one o which could even be the doglords own eh young garth trevalin put in he looked a youth but was in fact thirtyfive years old to alan gorescis fifty and john guineys more than sixty for the blood and even a taint in the blood is the life whats that you say he has radus face ah john grinned in his fashion but ye see mah meanin was more that radu could have his at which garth frowned and shook his head i still dont understand well maybe its not for common men to understand alanonthemoor elbowed garth none too gently in the ribs maybe we arent supposed to understand eh john oh but ye are auld john assured them then when we go up tae him tomorrow yell know what its a about see he fears he may have lain too long fears the disease might be in him despite the long centuries hes waited it out or if no the black death his body may have surrendered tae time itsel but radu this wolf of wolves why he was a god hed no want tae come back tae us like some auld rusty hinge thatll break the first time ye bend it he would be young again romp among the lassies get bloodsons and be the true lord and leader his kith and kin across the world have awiz waited for huhr alan scowled his kith and kin what a handful of nobodies like us but auld john only gave his head a shake and muttered oh ye o little faith do ye no ken what a wee bite can do alanonthemoor and you a goresci at that whose forefathers come not only out o olden times but frae a far strange world too if s the full o the moon man and ah ken how the likes o ye can feel it pulling like a tide in yere blood how long dye reckon for radu tae make himsel a pack and wouldnt ye just love tae run wi him under the moon the two o ye aye young garth too his lieutenants in the woods and wilds o tomorrow gods yed be tae all the yobs and expoliticians and lawyers and shite o todays socalled society by which time the two had been leaning forward across the table eager for johns every word and when hes up therell be no stopping him john continued but getting ups the problem if hes been wasted by time or the plague hell need a new body and dinnae ask me how but he can do it he can take this harry keogh and transfer intae him radus mind and powers in this young mans body itll be like starting anew but never frae scratch for this time hell take men and women o power and just like the plague in its time he too will rage across the world tae make it his when do we climb seduced by the fever in johns words young garths voice was husky trembling and glancing from face to face seeing the fire in their halfferal eyes auld john grinned and nodded his head to make his knotted mane bob have ye kept it up have ye been practicing yere climbing the ways hard ahll make no bones o it even the easy route can be treacherous tae them as dinnae ken it itll be a trial in itsel but we have tae go tae bring the great auld wolf up out o his sleeping place and we must be there first radus allies when bonnie jean arrives oh alanonthemoor frowned is b j so far gone then that he cant trust her in any degree but did ah no say so john answered why else would he call tae such as you and me leaving his wee mistress out aye ahve spoken tae him and radu knows his business he fears that bj will try tae keep this harry to hersel and if bad comes tae worst that could be the end o radu but she was so true young garth was mystified i mean after all these years why would she change perhaps yeve hit on it john told him change ye saidand aye ahve seen it for mahsel shes no the lassie she was what b j mirlu a lassie man she can triple mah years and still manage tae look likelike a like a girl young garth prompted him aye but she isnae but she is more like the master than we are too uke him and he willnae have it wamphyri and auld john blinked yellow eyes in the smoky light and nodded ahve seen it for mahsel he repeated often cut her she heals but so quickly and when shes madoh ye wouldnae want tae make bonnie jean mirlu mad he shook his head then whats to choose between them garth in his innocence asked the logical question she hasnae the power auld john answered oh she has the blood all right inherited shes a trueblooded throwback aye but inherited frae him he knows it a while b j has it a tae learn but she hasnae the time not wi a they ferenczys and drakuls bent on destruction the doglordhe sends his very thoughts ye ken if s so for yeve heard him but she doesnae have that no yet and anyway he has proved himsel has he no hes back hes up there the noo in the high places and hes waitin on us so then alan nodded thaf s one question answered but one other remains when do we climb and dont go worrying yourself necroscope the lost yean vol ii brian lumley that we cant make it if you can we can let me tell you john there are crags on the moors so steep and high you wouldnt believe also weve got you to show us the way first light john answered crack o dawn ah have gear enough for a three o us in mah car as for when we start out is the noo soon enough now aye sos tae be at the start o the easy route by daybreak we camp out the nicht under the glorious moon and oh shell inspire us be sure but why camp out because our enemies will have men on the roads and more by daylight so the nicht we drive up by tromie bridge on the badenoch side o the river maybe as far as insh yere vehicle is hired so we take mine then after we ditch it if its discovered so what ahm a local gillie after a itll be just me out in the wild but you twotheyd think ye were lost and send out a search party we dinnae want that and is insh where we start to climb ah no laddie john told him frae insh its a wee trek in the woods some five or six miles or so just in case some damn fool is following to where we camp the nicht that will be our starting point tomorrow morning and if some damn fool or fools is following us alanonthemoor inquired and john narrowed his eyes grimly ahve aready had some dealings wi the like he said theyre no so hard one thing for sure theyre no moors and woodsmen like us ifll mean one or two less o they for radu tae worry over thats a and that had been that and now first light it was crack o dawn or even predawn but it felt like the middle of the night to alanonthemoor and garth shaken awake halfdragged from their sleepingbags by john they were cautioned to silence by his narrowed yellow eyes his finger to his lips and hoarsely whispered some damn fool aye up and away lads up and away then deeper into the woods where the snow hadnt reached and the grey light filtered itself through an evergreen canopy of branches all three men treading lightly never a twig snapped or bird disturbed and whoever followed just as quiet even eerily so so that auld john had to admit theyre like ah dinnae ken ghosts these yins it was ferenczys called on me modern types but these yins have tae be drakuls probably patrollin the roads and found mah car and he was right but they wouldnt know for certain for a while yet after less than a mile where the ground rose steeply into the first craggy ramparts of the cairngorms the trails petered out but the way was as familiar as his own handwriting to auld john and soon the three came to a sheer cliff rearing some two hundred feet or more to a greenclad rim up there a broad ledge like a wee false plateau john whispered some mile and a half long by a quartermile broad theres bonnie fat deer runnin wild and no man alive today who ever saw them except mahseland one woman now quiet as ye go theres a chimney just along here at which alanonthemoor paused held up a finger sniffed the air and something he grunted auld johns nod tere pretty guid alan its that same damn something or someone who has been on our trail since first light but man yere senses are alive and we both know why if s the full moon alan yere blood answers tae it and yere senses too moments later found them at the chimney a vertical fault in the face that climbed through creeper hanging foliage and dusty cavelets into the heights easy as pie alanonthemoor grunted squinting upwards while young garth nodded his agreement the first half for sure john told them after that there are pitons where the face tends tae overhang a mite as yere fingers feel the cold so yere grip weakens were lucky the weather has let up some well ropeup on a ledge ah ken frae a dozen climbs then ah hope tae show ye a wee trick theyre close now alan glanced sharpeyed back through the undergrowth k they have guns they could pick us off but if theyre wanting tae find the doglord auld john reminded him they willnae want tae pick us off anyway we have nae choice so the faster we go the better they climbed to his ledge one hundred and thirty feet up the cliff face where they quickly ropedup looking down the foot of the cliff was lost below dangling creepers crevicegrown shrubs and the canopy of the forest so theytl no be shooting at us after a john commented and now hush he took a coil of rope from his shoulder let out a good length lobbed a smaller coil out into the dim light and down into the woods and there he said itll fall amost tae the bottom and he tied it off onarustypiton the two newcomers glanced at each other with puzzled expressions but said nothing and then they waited until alan tried to whisper theyre closing in but john stopped him with a grip of steel from fingers that dug deep in the flesh of his shoulder brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii still now he muttered dinnae shake the rope theyll think we were in such a hurry we left it adangle nice o us eh see what did ah tell ye the rope went taut vibrating very slightly as someone tested its strength down below under the forests canopy three men dressed in exarmy camouflagegreen combat suits examined disturbed undergrowth in the wake of auld johns party and singra singh drakesh looked up into the tangle narrowed his eyes frowned and hauled on the rope flanking singh the two remaining tibetan thralls seemed eager to climb containing themselves they waited on his word drakeshs lieutenant out of india was cautious however he had been taught something of a lesson by this bonnie jean mirlu and her people and he was still stinging from it but up there in the heights three of them were making for the lair of the doglord radu even now and this could be his chance for revenge and his chance to discover radu still weak from his centuries of sleep he sent his greedy avidly writhing thoughts up into the gloom the telepathic aether was heavy with wolftaint from which his probes recoiled probably just their stinking trail but no thoughts at all to mention or at best only the fading echoes of thoughts which was correct for john and the others werent thinking at all just holding their breath and waiting and go then singra singh drakesh hissed watching his men slide upwards out of sight one after the other vampires or vampire thralls at least they seemed to flow up the rope the chimneys vegetation was barely stirred by their passing below them singh followed their progress for a moment or two then as they disappeared he sent out another probe was theresomething there a feeling ofanticipation at his place in india singh kept venus flytraps their unconscious voraciousness their subsistence on lesser lives had always fascinated him plants they had no thoughts as such but there was this same aura about them like the trapdoor spider lying in wait lying in wait at which singh sprang alert calling out to his men where theyd reached auld johns ledge and his trap the three men on the ledge heard singhs cry of warning simultaneous with the emergence of arms and a shaved head rising into sight at the rim of the ledge then auld john stepped forward grunting and its good morning to ye ye sliteyed yellow bastard as he drove the toe of a climbing boot deep into the drakuls gaping sharptoothed maw teeth splintered blood spurted in the moment before the drakul fell and below him the second tibetan clung tight to the crack in the rock as his colleagues body hurtled by then the second man was frantically wedging his foot in a crevice and trapping the rope under one arm as he tried to unsling an automatic weapon from his shoulder and he had somehow managed it had even started to bring the muzzle of the machine pistol to bear on the trio of faces looking down on him when auld john casually drew his razorsharp clasp knife across the taut rope wedged in a crevice the drakuls ankle snapped before his foot came loose one sharp and weirdly alien cry as he fell in a tangle of rope and leafy debris and one short burst of machinggun fire that buzzed harmlessly off into empty air and only served to accelerate his fall and auld john nodded his approval wagged the sliced end of the rope at his friends and said so then a wee trick and now lets get on down below spreadeagled to the cliff face wideeyed and trembling in rage and disbelief singra singh cursed under his breath as the last of his thralls smashed down into rocks long since fallen from on high and was broken by them even singh himself would have been broken by such a fall if not fatally then most sorely but these tibetans were mere thralls their bones were splintered and their flesh pulped and singh was on his own orders were orders however and at the drakesh monastery the last true drakul would expect them to be carried out to the last singra singh was the last of this group anyway and he was not a man to be confounded or ridiculed by mere thrallsand foјthralls at that and there and then he vowed it that his master would be proud of him yet he would have to be if singh was ever again to meet him face to face but for now there were other ways up this cliff he was sure a lieutenant for long and long he would find one for him the climb would be as easy as taking a walk through the woods after that well the rest might not be so easy but it was definitely preferable to explaining to his master the many fine details of his several failures part revivals and devolutions i radu resurgent the siege at auld johns atop the cliff on the false plateau before the mighty bulk of the cairngorms commenced their true assault on the sky johns party jogtrotted through woods mainly undisturbed for centuries they headed northwest to the foot of a higher much more difficult climb but again john knew a route up the apparently sheer face following which they would make easy going across a gradually climbing terrain of weathered rock creviceclinging heathers crusted snowfilled depressions and rare slanting windblasted pines it was tenthirty in the morning before they reached that higher elevation the severe undulating boulderhttered but mainly open dome of the rock the cairngorm stone rising in or from the woods but theyd covered the ground in half the time it would take the best of ordinary men six miles now said john getting his second wind as he paused to adjust the small pack on his back rough ground and uphill a the way but no more than an hour and a bit tae such as we three last time ah was here the place was a under the snow white over and cold tae freeze yere bones a hell o a climb and going down even worse ah hadinjured mahsel a wee cut ye ken ahd lost a little blood anyway his is much easier but avoid the icedover snow in they hollows and watch for cracks in this auld rock where were going the rock gets more rotten the farther we go and some o they crevasses go down forever he led the way and the stony ground and as often naked rock flew under their booted feet there was no recognizable track that johns companions could see but he was the tracker not them and to auld johns eyes there was a track as clear as day made by a light fleet foot it headed northeast and john knew that in following it hed find the best possible route of course he would the trail had been tried and tested times without number necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley aye fleet ofoot and fair ojace but a cheat for a that who would even cheat on the greatest othem abonnie by name but no by design oh it was a great shame ah well move over wee lassie for theres a man here the noo and the wolfs no much longer in his lair one minute the air was dear and clean only the whistle of the wind through leaning crags and the scratch of blown heatherand the next the helicopter seemed to come out of nowhere rising up over the rim of rock only a halfmile away and die whup whup whup of its rotors reached out to them on a rising scale hell and damnation auld john cursed as he flung himself down in a scoop of rock and to me ye fucking eejits he yelled eh dinnae just stand there gawping alanonthemoor and young garth joined him as john ripped a great swath of heather from its roots to cover and camouflage his body they quickly followed suit huddled together lay still and the helicopter buzzed closer across the roof of die mountain and seemed to descend directly towards them ah might o knownjohn moaned a bleddy whirrbird o course how else were such as they tae get up here eh do you think they saw us alan gasped ah dinnae ken wed be like ants to they for sure aye but the only ants tae be seen wed stick out like sore thumbs if they were looking in the right direction but we were down pretty damn quick ah simply dinnae ken and here they come said garth they cameand went the helicopter passed almost directly overhead flew on uninterrupted in the direction of montrose auld john sighed his relief then cursed again bleddy hellf as he stood tossed heather aside and brushed himself down his companions followed suit but a helicopter here alan looked angry suspicious afraid aye said john mah thoughts exactly at first sight but now it looks like she was frae aviemore some poor sod who couldnae ski straight on his way tae have his bones fixed in montrose or aberdeen but man mah heart was in mah mouth while in the helicopter disgusted frank potenza stuffed binoculars into a padded container in the cabin wall picked up and lovingly fingered a highvelocity rifle with a sniperscope and whispered in italian what an opportunity hey luigi did you see them tying there i could have taken them out before they even knew i was firing on them and you know something im probably going to hate myself forever that i didnt if only for vincents sake tall gaunt vicious yet paradoxically feminine in his mannerisms and movements potenza spoke to the pilot luigi manoza i saw them manoza answered but you know as well as i do what francesco told us to do if we sighted anyone unless it was the woman let it be let them go where theyre going sure its important that we saw them but their direction of travel is more important yet francesco thinks he knows where the doglord is approximately you saw them finebut saw where they were heading before they got down and it looks like francescos right its the same area some four five miles northeast of here thats where he picked up radus scent the first time we were out so potenza whispered if were sure we know the location of this dogbastards lair why cant we knock his people over i mean why wait vincent is dead mean hes really dead if it was up to me id take these fuckers out here and now it would be like swatting flies you worry too much over vincent ragusa manoza told him and i dont think francesco worries about him at all vincent was your boss ok your immediate superior but he was also a pain in the ass thats why hes dead he didnt listen the moral of my story is stop being a pain in the ass the francezci is pretty good at swatting flies too know what i mean huhf said the other as manoza lost altitude swung the helicopter over and headed north now what now were going where i think theyre going the stubby manoza grunted til stay low youll see if you can spot any suspicious or identifying features or landmarks anything that looks like an entrance wolves hole up in caves you know and you can also try to spot a decent level landing place were going down manoza sighed shook his head in mock despair no were not going down not yet anyway when we do ifll be in force i just want to know where im going to land at that time huhf potenza said again why all this muscle against these people i mean theyre just people not even thralls theyre thralls of a sort manoza answered francesco calls them moonchildren dedicated to radu and their blood has the wolftaint also theyre not just people certainly not the woman we cant push them around like its a big night out in palermo they push back hard they sure pushed vincent anyway there was no answer to that so potenza kept quiet skirting higher ground putting it between his machine and the doglords people manoza followed the crack of a ravine in the area where francesco had sensedsomething and ok he told potenza brian lumley keep your eyes peeled this is it or close enough it makes no difference as manoza laid the chopper over on its side and circled the ravine with its ribbon of water foaming at the bottom potenza looked down crevasses he whispered in that way of his and potholes too on the roof some hollows full of water others that look bottomless in the ravine the face of that cliff is riddled the whole place looks rotten ready to cave in cave manoza grinned knowingly thats exactly the kind of word i wanted to hear the kind of place francescos looking for he straightened the chopper up leaned her the other way took a good look for himself and this has to be it he nodded excitedly almost inaccessible and who would want to come here anyway high as hell and cold and hollow as old katerins tits but if s granite it isnt about to cave in just yet he marked a map taped to his control panel straightened his machine up again and followed the course of the ravine back towards aviemore thats it potenza sounded disappointed petulant for now manoza told him but be patient frank ive a feeling well be seeing action soon enough between now and nightfall for sure two hours earlier at his old house in bonnyrig the necroscope harry keogh had slept well despite last nights sense of urgency the feeling that he stood upon the brink of something vast awesome and dangerous slept well despite all feelings of breathless expectancy and weird anticipation despite all of those things and last but not least his inexplicable terror of tomorrow but now it was tomorrow the light of day of morning had brought him awake from a dreamless state where all his mind had wanted to do and all it had done was rest but in the final moments of awakening as had been so often the case that restless urgency reasserted itself and floating up from subconscious wells of mind the lines of what could only be three especially relevant quatrains stood out as clear in his memory as if freshly planted there she is her masters kennelmaid his castle is a hollow place and high his bed is yellow glowing where he laid himself to rest who would not die with numbers and with solar heat and gravecold with mordant acids and his friends in low society and alchemical thunder with all of these behold necroscope the lost years vol ii he may transmute impurity to peace and piety he knows yet may not know until set free by the kennelmaid he sees yet may not understand until this prettys eyes search out the treachery in the dog that would bite its keepers hand and the necroscope knew that he did know yet didnt and couldnt know until set free by this pretty this bonnie jean mirlu but set free of what in what way set free free in his body that wasnt going to be easy oh he had had his doubts but what had they come to in the end only the realization that he loved her set free of that no he didnt want that kind of freedom would much rather stay a prisoner orset free in his mind to be his own man again now that was something else while breakfasting but not tasting anything he remembered something else or rather he knew it without knowing how that today was the day he felt it could feel it even now overthere and he looked at a blank wad but thaf s where it was whatever it was that was tugging at him and the feeling was so strong the urge the compulsion to go to bj right now that after washing his meal down with the dregs of a pot of strong black coffee he went out into the garden to look for it the sign and there it was low on the horizon where harry had known he would find it the full moon hanging pale in the wintry sky and yes of course this was the day and tonight was most certainly the night the night of the full moon harry knew where bj and her girls would be and he must go to her god he wanted desperately to go to her right now but first there were preparations he must attend to certain words from the quatrains repeated hi his head numbers solar heat gravecold mordant acids friends in low society and alchemical thunder using all of these tilings he could put right what was wrong numbers not numerology this time but metaphysics mobius maths of course solar heat the ultimate weapon against whatever it was that was waiting for himwhich was something he still didnt dare concentrate on friends in low society and grave cold well they were one and the same thing and what they were was obvious as for mordant adds that had him baffled but at least he had some knowledge of alchemical thunder hed seen plenty of that on the night the chateau bronnitsy fell he knew how to make alchemical thunder or the chemical sort anywaybut alchemical brian lumley necroscope the lost years voltt to nostradamus in his day and age and if harry didnt know he had plenty of friends in low society who did harry knew where to go and what to borrow he was familiar with the interior of several ammunition dumps and magazines and if there was something new that he might take a fancy to something he might have difficulty figuring out well there were plenty of bombdisposal people among the great majority to help him out or expeople anyway by midday he had everything he needed except maybe a little extra time but time to do what worry about what had to be done and what he was going to do anyway come what may and at last kitted out in much the same rig as hed worn for that job at le manse madonie black tracksuit and black canvas shoes black tshirt and an exarmy web belt with canvas pouch attachments he was ready the only additions he had made in deference to the weather were thick black socks and a heavy black woollen commandostyle pullover finally he thought about a gun then decided against it go up against armed killers with a gun and they werent going to try to take him prisoner and at last it was time for the wee puppy to go and see the kennelmaid he took the mobius route into the undergrowth at the edge of a copse to one side of auld johns cottage in inverdruie it was sheer guesswork not the coordinates for he still remembered those from that time when he and b j had visited the old gillie but that she would be there but obviously bj would have to have a starting place and she was probably relying on auld john so his cottage in inverdruie seemed the best bet and harry was right it was his best bet and his worst and hed landed right in the middle of it a big black mercedes saloon was parked on the service road with its nose pointing in the direction of the main road and aviemore from what the necroscope could see no one was in it in the cottage downstairs the curtains were drawn upstairs faces and figures female he thought flitted before small windows occasionally and cautiously a figure would pause to look out but briefly and always from the side the reason was simple the place was under siege outside a man splashed petrol from a heavy plastic container all around the perimeter of the house but especially on wooden fixtures such as doors windows the timbered frame and a leanto firewood store covered by a second man with a machinepistol who crouched not twenty paces from harry behind the boles of a clump of silver birches the wouldbe arsonist kept low he seemed eager to get done and he too had an automatic weapon slung from his shoulder harry gave a moments study to the house in the wall facing him a singlepaned kitchen window he could of course make a mttbius jump directly into the house but that would mean hed probably be seen materializing by those inside b j and the girls he presumed or at least raise awkward questions that wouldnt do he couldnt display his talents to anyone and the man with the petrol was moving now round a corner of the frontfacing wall of the house slopping fuel as he went and suddenly bj was there at an open window almost directly over the arsonists head twisting her body leaning far out of the narrow space she aimed her crossbow at which the necroscope heard the dull but vicious phut phut of a silenced weapon the man in the birches had taken out a pistol was aiming and firing across his arm his bullets spanged off the wall close to b js head spoiling her aim as she squeezed the trigger of her weapon and causing her to duck inside and now harry wished hed given more thought to carrying a gun but bjs ami hadnt been entirely spoiled her bolt had flown home transfixing the arsonists right shoulder any ordinary man would probably have fainted in agony this one let go the container of petrol slumped against the wall for a moment then straightened up and picked up the container lefthanded harry had seen more than enough he knew what he must do and in the brief moment of time that he would be visible to the sniperwell he would sooner face single shots from a hastily aimed pistol than a burst from a machinegun and conjuring a door he entered the msbius continuum and exited on the far side of the mercedes from this angle he could see the bonnet of sandras car sticking out from behind the house so the merc was theirs the people who held bj in siege and the drivers door was open it took just a second or so to set the timer on a small but deadly item no bigger than a packet of cigarettes and deposit it under the drivers seat then harry used the continuum again and emerged running not five paces from the house and its kitchen window diving forward and up in a curving trajectory he rolled curled himself into a ball hit the window with his shoulder and went through the glass onto the kitchen table which gave under his weight in the moment it took to disengage from the mess of torn curtains and wreckage hurried footsteps sounded on the stairs and also from a corridor leading to the back of the house and b j he yelled if s me harry three seconds later and the kitchen door flew open b j stood there hair awry and slanted eyes blazing a furious yellow in the unlit necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lutnley winter gloom of the house her crossbow was pointing into the room aimed directly at harry until she saw that it really was him and applied the safety then she was in his arms and her breathing a sob of relief he knew but for him not for herself as she crushed to him her face in the crook of his neck and her body straining against hisfor a moment then she pulled away and as harrys eyes adjusted to the light she even turned away as if to hide something the necroscope was fairly sure he knew what she was hidingbut he dared not let himself dwell on that he stepped forward and was right behind bj when she started to say harry man until he slapped his hand over her mouth no he said im already switched on bj as far as i want to be anyway and believe me i can work better without it trust me he gave her a little shake trust me ok for a moment he felt her furious strength it was in her live like the contained hum of a giant dams dynamos the only sign of the power raging within and bjs hand where it grasped his wrist felt like an iron band but then she relaxed pulled his fingers free said all right all right harry then turning to him she was bj again but where have you been you and john too i dont know where john is he shook his head licked his dry lips b j theres no time for any of that not now do you have any other weapons he took the crossbow from her upstairs a shotgun she said then gogo now cover me from upstairs her eyes went wide in fear for him harry i its what i do remember she bit her lip nodded and went as soon as she was out of the room he smashed some loose glass from the window simulating an exit and departed via a mftbius door back to the copse the entire episode in the house had taken only half a minute at most and the man with the petrol was just finishing up tossing the container to the ground he fumbled in his pockets lefthanded for a cigarette lighter harry saw a glint of metal in the mans hand thumbed the safety off the crossbow pointed it and let fly the bolt flew true or as true as it had been aimed struck home in almost the same place as bjs bolt it jerked its target upright and pinned his shoulder to the wall of the house and the cigarette lighter went flying this time the man yelped his agonyyet a moment later he was jerking his body from side to side snapping the hardwood bolt and staggering away from the cottage towards the mercedes hed had enough but he was still on his feet and now harry was indeed switched on he knew exactly what he was dealing with here vampires but suddenly lead wasps were buzzing to left and right of him followed by the telltale phut phut of silenced fire the man in the birches had stepped clear of the trees in a crouch he was firing at harry then from the open upstairs window a single shotgun blast which did the trick the distance was too great to do permanent damage but still the man with the pistol leaped and cavorted as his long overcoat was blown open and a moment later he too was running for the mercedes harry stepped deeper into the copse where unseen he conjured a mobius door it took him to the road where he crouched down behind snowclad bushes and took a transmitter from one of the ammunition pouches on his belt the mercedes went rocketing by and harry let it go a halfmile before jumping ahead of it why he didnt simply extend the transmitters antenna and press the button he couldnt say but so far his actions in this business whatever it was about had been covert and he wanted to keep them that way maybe that was it as for his powerswell these creatures were hardly going to be talking to anyone about his use of the mobius continuum were they not when they were in the continuum and not when they were deep in the shit the merc came blazing and harry stepped out into the road in front of it they saw him and maybe even recognized him and the driver grinned and kept right on coming harry had set the timer on his bomb for just three seconds time enough to prepare himself and turn his face from the blast but that had been when he was thinking in mundane terms and now he wasnt this wasnt going to happen in mundane space and time he had learned a new trick when zahanine was murdered or terminated in his house at bonnyrig he knew about zahanine now and accepted it that it hadnt been a dream the stains on his floor hadnt been a dream anyway and he knew where he had taken her body and how a new trick yes the car bore down on him and the drivers mouth was open in a ghastly gaping laugh of pure pleasure so harry laughed too and conjured a door big enough to take the whole car and a splitsecond before the car disappeared he pressed the button on his transmitter then throwing up an arm and turning away even the necroscope unable to accept that a ton of hurtling metal was simply going to vanish at his command he gritted his teeth and halfclosed his eyes and in so doing omitted to collapse the door onehundredtwohundredthreehundred there was a muffled roar and an explosion as if from for far away a sound or feeling more in the mind than in the real world and brian lumley necroscope the last years vol ii then a very real sound a clanging clattering skittering metallic sort of sound harry opened his eyes above the road a red lick of fire that burned itself out as it rose through a ring of smoke and in the air spinning end over end bounding one last time as it hit the road and flew sideways to scythe among the roadside trees the twisted smouldering rear fender of the mercedes nothing more than that and the necroscope gave a small shudder as he pictured it in the mbbius continuum a meteorite shooting through the endless night its fireball winking out and a cloud of shattered debris plastic and metal and flesh and blood going nowhere and taking forever to do it half an hour earlier auld john guiney alanonthemoor and garth trevalin had arrived on the crumbling striated and windscarred dome of the rock over the cavern system of radus redoubt rusty pitons hidden under shards of stone had told a tale pointed the way and were still usable ropes had been lowered into the throat of a black echoing pothole down which the men had slithered descending into the hollow unhallowed skull of the mountain and in the gloomy cavernriddled world below john had led the others deeper still into the secret heart of the rock to radu lykans resting place at the doglords sarcophagus on its platform of stony rubble john and the others had climbed to the rim and looked down on him his outline had been dim vague blurred by his bath of glutinous resin and the cracked dusty yellow crust on its surface but where the blot of his head was situated the darkness glowed with twin areas of red light and its like some kind o weird womb john had explained in a throaty whisper surrounding our master a thin envelope of fluids that replenishes itsel by drawing off the essence die preservative powers o the resin and he lives young garth had been awed by the wonder of it after all these years are his eyes no open john had answered reverently has he no spoken tae ye tae a o us calling tae us wi his mind oh he lives laddie aye the nichtwell see him up and be his loyal subjects for a time immortals among common men but times wasting so lets be at it the noo then hed freshened and set fire to the flambeaux in their sockets about the base of radus stone coffin and warned young garth yere task now garth tae keep yere eye on they torches there and when the warm resin starts tae drip frae the outlets tae ensure the flame doesnae jump this resins the stuff that blazes up in auld pine logsit doesnae take verra much tae set it afire but its a comfortable wee job ye can have yeresel a snack from yere pack and ahve something here that will warm ye up no end a drop o red wine aye guid for the blood so it is from his own pack john had taken a bottle of wine popped the cork poured the thick resinous stuff into their drinking mugs then a toast as theyd drained it away heres to radu long has he waited and long may he reign to radu theyd echoed him not noticing or used now to the gleam of fervour in johns yellow eyes but hed poured himself the merest drop and then scarcely touched it and alan smacking his lips had questioned but if this is garths task what about us a great task ours auld john had answered what garth does here we do elsewhere for radu isnae the only one wholl be up the nicht and we must ease the way for his creature too so come on with me now alanonthemoor for its amost noon ah but this yin will take some melting out be sure then before leaving garth to his vigil john had poured him a further measure of wine winked and asked him yell no be well afeared tae stay here on yere own ah mean whats to fear garth had narrowed his eyes tve some food and water light and warmth from the torches plenty more torches if these burn low how long will you be anyway as long as it takes john had answered but when were gone yell find it awfy quiet guid no yin can come upon ye or take ye by surprise and remember if theres some problem ye only need tae yell these caverns will carry yere cry like the echo o a howling wolf as they will soon be echoing aye and he and alan had gone off into the mazy interior their footsteps rapidly fading as the silence of forgotten centuries had come crowding in ten minutes and garth had felt drowsy shaking himself he had climbed again to the rim of the sarcophagus looked down on radu but by then the doglords outline had become very indistinct distorted by the slow circulation of resin at the bottom of the great vat and a froth of bubbles had begun rising ohsoslowly gathering under the crust and seeking a way through garth had sat with his back against the base of the sarcophagus a while until again hed felt himself nodding it must be the warmth of the torches he had supposed and after checking them hed climbed down to the rubblestrewn floor to eat a bite from a sandwich sitting there in the gloom in the rhythmic flickering torchlight his nerves brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii had slowly relaxed his muscles softened and his head had fallen onto his chest just once garth had started at what he imagined was some faraway cry but it was nothing and the torches were burning steadily and there was this slow drip drip drip hypnotic in the regularity of its pacing or regular to garth at least as the effect of johns or radus wine worked steadily on his system except the drip wasnt regular but speeding up and on the dais slow puddles of yellow resin forming and in the stone sarcophagus an original lord of the wamphyri sending out telepathic probes which at this range couldnt help but find their target auld john and alanonthemoor came to the vat of radus creature my god said alan looking at the massive stone staves of the container bolstered at the bottom with boulders in the light of johns torch what the hell and john looked at him strangely god did ye say do ye have faith then alan i mean other than faith in him the other shook his head you mix with men and talk with men you end up thinking and speaking like them thaf s why you are so lucky up here on your own john but i worked in a brewery a while and ive seen ten thousand gallons of beer brewed in smaller vats than this ah said john but its no beer brewing here listen and he placed his ear to the cold stone alan followed suit and at once reacted and sprang away what he said a heartbeat but what kind of heart a big yin aye john grinned and continued listening but after a moment the smile fell from his face replaced by a frown of strange concern the heavy thudding beat was far more frequent than on previous occasions but it was also very irregular if the thing in the great womb were a human sleeper he would either be nightmaring or very very sickor perhaps simply weak well maybe john had the cure for his weakness which was why he was here after all and why alanonthemoor was here too up ye go john grunted lighting the way with his torch and now yere really going tae see something to one side a stairway of stacked stone slabs lay against the vat suddenly tired depleted alan clambered to the eightfoot high rim with auld john right behind himand failed to see the old gillie reaching into a deep crack under a slab or what he brought out at the top alan crept forward on hands and knees until a sickly sweet resinreek wafted up to him a sweetness and the smell of something other than resin and other than sweet john planted the torch in a crack well back from the rim and said well what dye make o that shaking his dizzy head alanonthemoor gazed down into the semisolid murk of a mainly opaque luminous resin reservoir and as his eyes adjusted peered through the crusted surface into the looser liquids beneathat the thing that lay halfcurled there no longer entirely foetal just waiting to be born the massive head triangular in profile dog jaws two and a half feet long the yellow glow of an eye as big as a saucer that opened and turned in its socket to glare up at alan even as he gave a strangled cry and lurched back from the rim driving his spine onto the sharp metal point that auld john rammed forward to transfix and hold him shuddering like a hapless slug on a nail the beasts feeding funnel which made as good a weapon as any as for the rest john didnt make a meal of it his knife across alans throat and the tube withdrawn thrust deep into the resin to catch his spurting blood then the fluids of the saclike inner egg turning red as alans life drained into it no john didnt make a meal of itbut he hoped that radus warriorcreature would down the stone steps auld john went to set light to the row of great torches around the base of the vat and watching them flare up feeling them warming the feeding beast and the liquids that had preserved it through six long centuries he congratulated himself on a task well done and only alans single strangled cry when the sharp feeder chopped into his spine to give the game away except young garth would be so far gone by now he probably hadnt heard it in fact garth had heard it but it had made no impression and now he was lost to his stupor and to the doglords hypnotic telepathic voice in his stumbling staggering mind garth oh you faithful one you child of my children you moonchild you heard and you cameyou are here here to be my protection my guide toto sustain me in the hour of my resurgence and you shall be one with me garth and when lesser men speak to me they shall also speak to you for we snail be inseparable you and i you shall be named raduesuvia who came out ofradu yet you will forever be a part of me exceptwhy do you sit so far apart who will sit upon my right hand forever i need you here to feel my strengthening heartbeat the stirring of these stiffened limbs of mine to help me up from my cold stone coffin come garth come and be my strong right hand it seemed an invitation which was in fact an irresistible command and with his eyes full of moonlight and a cold sweat upon his brow necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley garth stood up swaying as he clambered awkwardly up the tangle of stone that held aloft the dais and sarcophagus until he crouched at the rim the resin bubbled not from the heat of the torches or only partly but mainly from the commotion beneath the surface and ah ahhh it was a cry of pain almost a birthpang in garths mind would breathe garth i would be up see see reach for you for the light for the full moon where soon my olden mistress will ride the sky but i have not the strength the surface of the resin bulged split sent out a jet of gas and a spurt of yellow liquid like pus that slopped garths face beguiled he felt nothing saw nothing but the heaving of a glorious womb heard only radiis telepathic voice now child of my children now garth see i breathe would be born so bring me up bring me forth from these ugly juices now garth now pink and purple tubeworms broke the surface of the liquid where its crust had split resin bubbled up as the worms developed pouting mouths that sucked greedily at the air a hand or more properly a great dogs black leathery paw with threeinch claws reached upwards in an agonized spasm and clutched at thin air but garth saw only a hand and washed by the bubbling resin a face floating just beneath the surface the kindly beneficent but agonized face of a god suffering all the pain of the world and he clasped the hand that the doglord offered but on the instant everything changed garth was garth again in the full knowledge of where he was and what he was about and radu was radu and as the doglords soft trembling hand firmed up grew hard and drew garth inexorably into the sarcophagus ahhhhhhr said radu auld john heard the cry that rising shriek that echoing earpiercing scream that climbed the scales to the whistle of a boiler about to burst and his eyes went up to the shimmering vibrating air of the cavern complex and when the scream stopped and the air stopped trembling he smiled his wolfish smile and aye he said after a moment and returned to lighting more torches to warm the vat of radus creature thatll be him the noo bless ye alanonthemoor and especially ye garth trevalin for we shall long remember ye then as the first low howl ululated in distant darkness johns feral eyes widened and lit like yellow lamps and shaking his fists at the world he cried oh ahm coming dinnae fear as he went loping off into the cavern labyrinth to greet his reborn master bjs girls were dousing the lower walls and woodwork of auld johns house with water when harry came striding down the service road bj saw him went running held him close for a momentthen pushed him away cover you she said cover you i didnt even see you leave but i saw you put a bolt right next to mine in thatthat mans shoulder and that vampires shoulder harry said dont worry about those two theyre finished but bj its time you levelled with me i already know most of it and i dont think it makes any dif ference to my feelings its the half i dont know that worries me because that might make a difference but im here for what thats worth and you know you have me now i want to know if i have you i want to know that and everything else i meaneverything and youre the only one who can tell me he undipped her crossbow from his belt gave it back to her come back to the house she said were making ready to leave but weve a few minutes and then you can decide whether or not you want to come with us into the mountain he said walking with her towards the cottage and if i decide not to you wont she shook her head you dont intend toaccept my refusal cant i cant accept it harry you have to come tell me everything and let me decide for myself he answered you said you loved me and if thafs true it is then you wouldnt place me in jeopardy and if i climb that mountain with you he came to a halt caught her arm she turned to face him and he could see how torn she was if you dont climb it im dead she said quite simply and if i do tell you everything now all at once you could be dead too a different kind of dead but close enough it makes no difference they started to walk again and harry said a part of my life maybe several parts have been a lie and youre the one who told it it wasnt an accusation just a statement that was before i loved you but youve kept the lie going now it was an accusation no she answered and to herself yesfor two hundred years until i saw the truth but i cant show it to you no suddenly he looked haggard bj youre lying even now at the door of the cottage it was bjs turn to catch at his arm only on the surface she blurted theyre only lies on the surface underneath you already know the truth brian lumley i know the but ii dont understand or did he he knows yet may not know until set free by the kennelmaid he sees yet may not understand you know most of it yes except for the real lies if i tell you about the real lies then really lose you ill lose you harry if i tell you that your search for your wife and child was the biggest lie of all and if i tell you it was for me not for radu youve always known she went on but you cant remember not until i switch you on i mean all the way on then do it harry said as they entered the cottage do it now switch me on all the way and lef s see what happens i mean lets face it if s got to be better than being a halfperson see im trying hard to hang on but i think im losing it bj he tried to grin but only twisted his face and suddenly she looked just as haggard as he felt which made him feel better because he knew this must be equally hard for her love was like that it was only real when it hurt inside the house gloomy now that they were out of the daylight even the winter daylight bj put her arms round harry and held him close do you remember that time we came here i asked you about life what it was all about about growing old and watching your partner grow old and wondering where it had all gone you gave me your philosophy of life said that when we are young we know everything but the older we get the more we realize we dont know any fucking thing and i said what if it didnt have to be that way i remember yes he frowned but not how the conversation ended we wereinterrupted she told him but this time we wont be harry what if you could love me always i mean what if we could always be the same and never have to change or at least not for a very long time what he said feeling her pressing against him and loving it is that a mountain up there or shangrila is this an invitation to a nightmare or the fountain of youth his questions were serious and now she understood that in fact he did half know i believed in something worked towards something oh for a very long time she said and then you came along and changed my mind but are you right is love really the way or are you a false prophet switch me on he urged her holding her away from him you may hate me there was fear in her face and enormous inner pain and emotions beyond harrys or any mere mans understanding and yet she looked more human than he had necroscope the last yean vol ii ever seen her and he knew too why that thought had occurred but darent admit it and when he made no reply it will hurt you she said you know something said harry i dont think i care what that im a liar that im notinnocent there it was half out his mind reeled but a very little for hed been expecting it whats done is done from now on lef s be straight and bj thought if i tell him and if it breaks him damages his mind then hell be lost to me but hell also be lost to raduwhich would be good except radu will exact payment from me and if i dont tell him hell never be himself mentally he will vegetate hell only be what i tell him to be he wont be the real harry keogh the man i fell in love with but hed never get that far anyway for radu would have him and so it boils down to this do i love him enough to risk his sanity to believe that he will still love me and that together we can defeat and destroy the doglord my socalled fucking master but right at the end of the question she knew shed answered it herself and looking at her face the necroscope knew it too her name is pretty but her thoughts are dark hers is to choose where no choice fits her role in his survival my fucking master yes yes she did have a choice and she had made it for radu lykan was treacherous and the worst possible liar compared to whom bj was in fact an innocent auldjohn missing alanonthemoor and young garth trevalin nowhere to be found oh really but bj knew where they were all right that bastard thing in the resin had called them to his redoubt he knew bj s destiny and was taking no chances wouldnt let her reach it she had discovered his mysterious one and was no longer of any use none that bj could contemplate anyway b j harry said taking a pace backwards away from her and his strange eyes had a look in them that she had never seen before not fear or fascination but an odd mixture of both and a great sadness too and bj knew now for certain that he had spoken the truth he did know half of it at least and now he must know it all controlling the beast within she said you win harry mah wee man the necroscope jerked his head took a second step backwards and the backs of his knees hit johns old rocking chair tipping him into it the full moon blazed down on him with the silhouette of a f brian lumley great wolfs head black against the yellow and the rocking chair rocked back and forwards and harry said youre his kennelmaid his castle is a hollow place and high do you remember what i told you about the wamphyri lords of starside harry she said stepping forward and bending to loosen the belt around his waist the strap over his shoulder and about radu the drakuls and ferenczys she took the belt and his explosive devices from him dropping them to the floor behind her no you dontbecause i told you to forget it all until we were ready to go up against radus enemies well and now were ready except the doglord is one of them one of our enemies one of my enemies so now if you havent worked it out already you can remember what the drakuls did to zahanine at your place in bonnyrig revenge for the two we killed in the spey valley probably and you can remember that too how they died in their blazing car also what i told you about ferenczy lykan and drakul history and brenda your search for her but it never happened harry all the places you remember going to well you didnt those were memories that put there that i suggested to you because i wanted you for myself and now im admitting it and so losing you so whatever else you do dont you ever dare ask me again if i fucking love you from outside sandra was shouting b j were ready there and now you have it bj continued so remember it all harry every damn thing put it all together tie it up in one big bundle and when you know what youre running from and if youre still capable of running then when you wake up run run run he rocked back and forward back and forward and his eyes were huge and round and his face was pale and blank b j sobbed got behind him and took up her shotgun from where it leaned against the wall for she had made another decision and must act now before she changed her mind radus mysterious one his manwithtwofaces harry keogh well ac radu the twofaced treacherous bastard and whether harry wanted to be in on this or not whether he would or wouldnt be able to be in on it it was too damn late now he wouldnt be going anywhere not for a couple of hours at least but when he did wake up at least hed know that she had loved him and as the chair rocked forward she gritted her teeth and smacked the butt of the shotgun up against the back of harrys head so that he kept right on going off the chair and crumpled to the floor ii restraints removed the real harry keogh auld john was heading back now alone along the easy route no longer held back by his role of guide and watchdog for inexperienced companions as for the two he had guided well they had been found worthy and accepted so best to forget them now and because on this occasion john had not been weakened by any sacrifice of his own blood he was able to make even better speed which was very necessary for he had a job to do loping along the nearinvisible but wellknown trail that led down to the secret plateau and forest and on to the final cliff descent he thought back on what radu lykan had told him when hed returned to the sarcophagus the torches at the base of that high altar had been flickering low by then and no sign of garth trevalin for a moment that had worried john until hed heard his masters voice in his mind just a second or so before realizing that it wasnt in his mind at all but in his ears john ah john you faithful one that low growl that rumble of sound the power in that voice and yet was there something else in it some pain secret knowledge recognition and acceptance of some doomfraught intuition concerned john had turned in a circle at the foot of the jumbled slab pyramid looked all around in the gloom as he searched for the source of that voice on the floor the imprints of feet or great paws or a cross between the two laid down in resin on the cracked slabs and fallen lintels had directed his eyes towards a crevice in the rotted stone of an inner wall and from the deeper gloom within that crack a pair of triangular eyes like crimson lanterns had stared out at him john would have gone to him at once but radus voice had held him at bay brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii no john not now i would not have you see me now i ambasic i am risen but yet laid low not the man i would be but its not too late and i can be that man even now so listen to me listen and obey me from out of the darkness the fire of his eyes had burned into johns wolf soul searing his words there go down from here and find the mysterious one he is here i know it i found him in bonnie jeans mind he came to her as she must come to me which is a confrontation i no longer relish and bj is no longer the wee mistress whom we trusted john she will not bring this man my manwithtwofaces to me and without him all this is for nothing wherefore you must bring him here do you understand master john had stumbled a pace closer to the crack in the wall no be still that rumble had come again not only the physical sound of it but the feel of it too like a tightening of telepathic jaws on johns brain for radu had made contact waking contact at close range and was now firmly established in johns mind yes master auld john had come to a halt stood stock still do you understand what must be done tm tae find harry keogh and bring him here and without delay john if im not to suffer for if s not only bonnie jean but others i fear now aye and ah have dealt with some o they john had answered a ferenczy and drakuls too and the doglord had seen the truth of it in johns mind good good but still others will come i sense them close to me sniffing me out i may have to hide from them when i would so love to ravage among them but i will not hide from you when you return with my mysterious one very well go now my faithful but hurry for the time is nigh then the redglowing eyes had dimmed a little backed off and turned away and john had heard the receding sound of slowpadding footsteps and when at last he had ventured to stand in the mouth of the crevice it had been dark deep and empty time had been of the essence but still john had stolen a little of it to climb the jumble to the foot of radus sarcophagus and snuff the failing torches following which he must get on his way and there on the dais platform hed seen the resin slopped from radus emergence and something else to stop him momentarily in his tracks a white alabaster hand hanging loose over the rim of the huge stone coffin a hand so white it looked carved from snow young garths hand obviously for it wore his gold ring on the index finger but no longer young the arm was shrivelled that of an old old man and john remembered the rising scream shut off at its zenith well and there you had it and john could find nothing to fault it what was the doglords to give was his to take away and he had and after all wasnt it only to be expected after a fast such as his after that time was of the essence and john had wasted no more of it retracing his tracks through the labyrinth and climbing up his rope through a vertical pothole he had exited from the lair onto the rotten roof of the promontory and at the moment he emerged thought to see some hasty movement among a clump of boulders but there were only clouds scudding west in a lowering sky the wind in the signpost branches of a leaning stunted pine and the hammering of his own heart the perhaps imagined motion could only be his nerves or a rabbit or maybe an eagle settling to its nest beyond the rim and without more ado john had set off southwest along the wellknown trail never knowing that singra singh drakesh was his rabbit or eagle settling to its nest and in his nest of boulders the drakul lieutenant composed himself in a meditative trance completely ignored the cold and settled down to wait for whatever would be oh he could have ventured down into this wolfs lair there and then but singra singh was an exceptional telepath in his own right and had overheard radus conversation with auld john radu was weak perhaps from his years of hibernation perhaps from something else what use to catch and kill one ailing lord of the wamphyri when others might soon be presenting themselves as unsuspecting targets and then there was the woman and her girls too and this was now singhs vendetta no less than that of his tibetan master and last but by no means least there was this harry keogh the last drakuls instructions with regard to keogh the destroyer of his bloodson had been especially explicit and so with his eyes closed and palms flattened together on his chest singra singh sat amidst the boulders of the mountain composed himself in a discipline learned as a boy sixty years ago at the drakesh monastery felt the comforting weight of the machinepistol in his lap and waited at aviemore francesco francezci was furious but the resort wasnt le manse madonie he couldnt display his displeasure too openly the dark genie of the wamphyri must be contained bottled up inside for now in the icedover tennis court that served as a makeshift helipad he spoke whispered spat at luigi manoza and angus mcgowan where none of the resort staff could see them where the fuck are they wheres jimmy nicosia and that idiot potenza you sent them out in the car francesco to that gamekeepers brian lumley necroscopt ttu lost yean vol ii place the stubby manoza nervously answered tou said they were to check if the woman was there butthat was all of an hour ago it was more than an hour francesco continued to spit his words what for a job that should have taken twenty minutes aye it was a mistake that angus mcgowan noddedand at once stepped back a pace as he realized his own mistake the francezci rounded on him his dark eyes bloodshot in their corners ah mean mcgowan hurriedly added a mistake for ye tae place yere trust in they two split up theyre ok but put em taegether a pair o fuckin hotheads no worthy o ye francesco damn them to every hell francesco hissed from between clenched teeth are all of my people idiots they were too long under vincent manoza tried to calm him down find excuses for the missing men and for everyone maybe they found what they were looking for but werent satisfied to leave it at that maybe they did it for vincent did what got themselves killed francesco snarled not yet knowing that he had guessed the truth of it i told them to observe and report back and i told them when to be back aye mcgowan took another chance but maybe they found what they werent lookin for or werent expectin and maybe they were observed eh i should have sent you francesco said and maybe guy dancers a dummy too but at least he does as hes fucking told here he comes now manoza said glad of the diversion as tanziano tooled the second of their saloons into the court as they reached him he was opening the boot dancer was a sixfoot wedge of bulletheaded muscle his piggy eyes met theirs redirecting their gaze into the boot of the big car what said the francezci his jaw falling open what the it was caught up in a bush about a kilometre from that old guys house dancer grunted i recognized it it was me hired the car in aberdeen but i used fake id so therell be no trouble with the hire company no trouble with the francesco looked at him disbelievingly fuck the hire company where are jimmy and frank but dancer could only shrug as manoza picked up one end of the buckled fender and sniffed it i thought so he said this is hitech stuff ordinary plastics about as deadly as toothpaste by comparison and thisis all thats left francesco still couldnt believe it and a few nuts and bolts dancer told him shrugging in a way that only increased his masters irritation i checked out the whole area but there was nothing just scorch marks on the road scorch marks francesco was trembling now barely able to contain his rage fucking scorch marks harry keogh said mcgowan his ugh face as thin as a greyhounds eyes silveryyellow under the brim of his hat francesco whirled on him again but eagerly now no longer in anger do you think so i saw the mess that yin made o the drakuls that time mcgowan answered their car was a wreck too and keogh didnae fuck about wi them either francesco actually grinned but it was mirthless a grin full of malice and the promise of an agonizing death and you think he could be with the woman at the cottage personally i want that one more than i want the doglord angus you found fault with my sending jimmy and frank to do a simple job well the jobs still available but its not so simple now if keogh and the woman are there theyll be alert for us so this time youre going you and dancer ill be here with luigi when you get back but do try to get back wont you itll take maybe half an hour mcgowan called after him as francesco and manoza strode off towards the ski lodge but no longer francesco called back in something less than four hours it will be dark and we still have to load thethe cameras he was talking about a box of heavy weapons left on their own on the tennis court mcgowan and tanziano looked at each other then the latter turned up the collar of his overcoat and got back into the drivers seat while mcgowan sniffed at the cold air for a moment or two before joining him and guy laddie he said this is where it really begins ah can feel it in the air so ah can tomorrow itll a be over and well be able tae take it easy and sit down tae a guid breakfast but as tanziano headed back for the road the little man quietly added or we wont francesco was watching from a table in the lodge bars panoramic window when the saloon returned it drew up under the helicopters rotors and a moment later mcgowan and dancer unloaded something from the boot of the car into the aircrafts passenger cabin then lets go said francesco he and manoza carried a heavy wooden box marked cameras out of the bar to the tennis court where tanziano had lowered steps from the aircrafts interior hoisting the box between them francesco and manoza passed it up to dancer and mcgowan and looking up at mcgowan francesco saw that he was wearing a grin as broad as his narrow face so what have you got he said climbing the steps except for one item mcgowan answered assisting francesco up necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lutnley the cottage was deserted he pointed to a corner of the cabin francesco looked said what a sleeping bag and whats in it mcgowan stooped unzipped the top of the bag and harry keoghs pale face lolled out someone has given him a bump on the head hell no forget in a while hes out cold oh and one other thing there was a lot of makins explosive makins tossed under a bush outside the house keoghs gear ah reckon itll have his prints a over it but none o ours so ah left it there it looks like ah was right and hes the one who got frank and jimmy manoza had joined them inside the cabin closing the door behind him he said so what have we here then he saw what they had here and gave a low whistle francesco was smiling it would pass for a smile anyway and the best prize of all he grunted well done angus also the little man told him if yere interested we spotted two o bj mirlus girls in the woods on the mountain side o the road at least one o them was armed wi a shotgun theyll be coverin bjs tracks ah reckon an ambush for anyone who might try tae follow her francescos smile grew broader yet oh indeed i am interested he said and he visibly relaxed for suddenly he was in no great hurry bjs girls in the woods he repeated thats means shes not long flown and how long do you think to climb that mountain angus for me i wouldnae even try for her shes been doin it since she was a girl and that was a long long time ago still and a she couldnae make it in daylight itll be late in the evening by the time shes up and we can do it in fifteen minutes francesco was almost ecstatic now and meanwhilefrom this one i want answers we can wait for him to wake up and from those girls more answers about bjs and maybe even radus plans the more we can find out the better before we fly up to the dome of that mountain and finish this thing he turned to manoza luigi you stay and look after this one tie him up throw the sleeping bag over him and watch him i mean stay here with him this is one slippery fish later want to know why he fell out with the woman and there are also a few things i want to know about his visit to le manse madonie that time hah but one thing is certain however he did it he wont be doing it again myself im going with dancer and angus to see if i can get hold of one of these girls any questions there were none and manoza was left alone in the helicopter guarding the unconscious necroscope bjs rearguard was made up of moreen lowrie and margaret macdowell which was all she could afford they were moonchildren which is to say wouldbe werewolves and bloodtakers naturally but they were up against francesco francezci a lord of the wamphvri angus mcgowan a lieutenant of longstanding and guy dancer tanziano a brutal thug of a vampire thrall trapped in a pincer manoeuvre they didnt stand a chance separating trying to lead their pursuers off through the woods in different directions away from the foothills route taken by bj and sandra margaret was the first to be caught and killed by dancer broken like a stick over his knee when she fought back with such ferocity as to demonstrate to him that there was no other way dumping her body in a deep ditch he rolled rocks and earth on top to bury and hide it by then francesco and mcgowan had taken moreen when she ran out of shotgun shells theyd jumped her and francesco had knocked her unconscious then back to the car where dancer had parked it at the edge of the woods and so on to john guineys place in this francesco took a chance but he didnt have too much choice unable to take the girl live and kicking back to the lodge at aviemore the old gamekeepers cottage had seemed the next best bet and with the big saloon hidden behind the cottage invisible from the road the francezci did what he liked best working on the girl to get the information he wanted left outside to keep watch tanziano felt a little out of things but mcgowan soon came to him grinning and told him it would be their turn before too long shes talking dancers pale blank oval of a face showed signs of animation he knew that when the francezci was through with the girl shed be his and mcgowans oh aye mcgowan told him with francescos hand up her muff shes talkin all right and so would ye imagine havin a wee umbrella wi sharp spokes up yere dick and if yere difficult somebody puts the brolly up and yanks on the handle eh if s a verra weird thing a womans muff outside if s no such a sensitive part as ye might think but insidetheres organs up there thats verra sensitive and those hands o francescos man theyre like so many snakes twenty minutes later francesco came to them said shes all yours ive gagged her i dont want any screaming also when youve done her body goes with us we can dump it in the heights i have this feeling theres too much rubbish been left lying around already none of this was as tidy as it might have been you first mcgowan told dancer who was grateful only dinnae necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumtey kill her or knock too much life out o her ahll enjoy doin that mahsel ok oh and make sure that gag is secure for now anyway and dancer went off to the house francesco said nothing it was as well to keep ones lieutenants and thralls satisfied in however small a measure and it was of old repute that angus had a thing for tongues not for languages so much as real tongues and especially womens tongues as for this one screaming shed have no strength for that when dancer was done and no capacity for it after mcgowan out of curiosity he asked are you hungry then angus oh ye ken yere people well francesco mcgowan answered with a grin ah cannae help but wonder how many throats shes had that slippery tongue o hers down but when ah take it off at the roots mine will be the last as for her heart when ah call a girl sweetheart it has a different meanin entirely aye while his men shared the girl francesco thought over what she had told him first that bj mirlu had ascended and was wamphyri perhaps after all this time that was only to be expected no ordinary thrall could have lived her years without at least a dash of superior blood or in the case of a doglady inferior blood but wamphyri blood in any case and so radus watchdog or bitch had ascended but only very recently this made her a lykan of course an immemorial enemy to drakul and ferenczy in that respect nothing had changed but in another everything had changed for in the grand tradition of the old wamphyri b j was now opposed to her old master his enemy all of b js life through all the years she had served the doglord during his absence she had been the mistress of these territories if only in her own mind and now she was reluctant to give them up also she had fallen for this man this harry keogh and if there was one thing about the werewolf radu that was certain it would have to be that he wasnt about to entertain the notion of a human rival when mcgowan and dancer were done with moreen after theyd bundled her body into the boot of the car and on the way back to aviemore francesco told them what he had learned from her and outlined his plan for tonight bj mirlu was climbing to radus lair with another girl called sandra the last of her pack b j suspected that auld john guiney and two others of radus thralls had sided with the doglord and were already in the mountain it fitted with luigi manozas sighting of three men up there and probably meant that the woman would have a fight on her hands before shed had time to recover from her climb since the doglord must be active by now she couldnt possibly win but she might take out one or two of his people which was all to the good as for the drakuls who were known to be in the vicinity if they were in the mountain that was better still let them all fight it out between them and then the francezcis more properly the ferenczys would pick off any survivors and so it appeared that old angelo and francescos dear brother had been right it was going to be that easy but francesco concluded anthony also said our losses would be light his exact words or as near as i can remember were the hound is finished youll win hands down the opposition which i took to mean the drakuls and bj mirlu and her people will collapse theyll offer only token resistance and costs to you will be minimal francesco paused narrowed his eyes a little then shrugged well and so far our costs our losses have been minimal ragusa and potenza what were they for a loss nothing as for jimmy nicosia well that was unfortunate but no one can expect to win all the time then they were back at aviemore where francesco told the others including luigi manoza now we wait for nightfall we have a couple of hours yet you three take it in turn to watch that one he aimed a thumb at the helicopter and we can all relax and eat in the barthats if youre still hungry if or when this keogh wakes up no matter what we get out of him or dont were taking him with us into the mountain up into the mountain and down from it or more properly down from the chopper he flew like a ghost into and out of le manse madonie that time so now he can fly again into thin air im going to enjoy watching that bastard step or get tossed into space a couple of thousand feet up which the others found a very agreeable sentiment bj had hit harry very hard perhaps even too hard but shed wanted to be sure he wasnt going anywhere that he was definitely out of the real trouble it had never occurred to her that leaving him at johns house might place him in yet more jeopardy surely after the fighting there and this close to radus rising her enemies wouldnt go back there they must know she would no longer be there so shed reckoned but reckoned without the tenacity of the wamphyri by now the necroscope had been out for almost four hours it was the twilight before true night and a full moon was coming up over the cairngorms wrapped in a blanket moreens body had been transferred to the helicopter her killers were aboard and luigi manoza was warming up the engine waiting for francescos order to get aloft necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley the moon is on the roof of the mountains even now francesco said are we all readythen tell you what you can expect by now there may well have been fighting up there between drakuls and lykan thralls and maybe including the doglord radu himself it could be going on right now and from the moment we touch down we could be in the thick of it so what do we have against radu who is wamphyri first theres me for i too am wamphyri i can be hurt can be killed but thats not an easy thing to do and we have it on very good authority advance information courtesy of angelo that we are on the winning side then we have superior weapons youve seen what the woman had a shotgun hah but on the other hand the drakuls could be heavily armed though not as heavily as us i fancy youve all got red armbands and you can all see in the dark there can be no errors if it moves and it isnt wearing red shoot it and shoot to kill radu the odds are hell be weak physically but if hes still the legendary wolf we can tame him every third round in your magazines is a silver bullet deadly to all of us i know but even more so to him if you see him if you get him in your sights dont fuck with him give him all youve got and when hes down get up close and keep hosing it to him i want him in pieces and then i want to burn each piece he looked at the faces of mcgowan and tanziano where they were seated with him in the passenger cabin and at the back of luigi manozas head at the controls thats it then now are there any questions there were none and francesco leaned forward to give manoza a tap on the shoulder luigi can you put her down ok i got a good look at the place manoza shouted over the rising clamour of the rotors most of it is fairly flat where put down the weather forecast gives us a clear night no wind to mention and the temperature several degrees above zero it couldnt be better and then theres the doglords big silver friend in the sky he meant the full moon itll be like daylight francesco nodded yes this time his silver mistress has really let him down very well lets get on our way harry heard none of this or if he did it was as a fuzzy background static to the gradual transition he was making from true unconsciousness to healing sleep the sleeping bag tossed over him had kept him relatively warm and his good physical condition overall had guaranteed that apart from a headache he would come out of this intact for however long or short a time he was aware however dimly dreamily that someone else was with him close to him he could feel a cold marble thigh against his and a cold arm across his body but then again it could be part of his dream except he dreamed of flightof motion through the air it would be soothing like rocking in a chair or drowsing in a hammock except someone seemed to be trying to tip him out of the hammock whoever you are please piss off he tried to say but if he said anything at all it was lost in the rumbling of the helicopters rotors the necroscopes mental barriers were down the disturbance he experienced wasnt anyone trying to tip him out of anything but rather into something in fact into a response it was sir keenan gormley who was insisting harry for gods sake accept me cant you listen to me i thought wed lost you we all didfor suddenly you werent there your light had gone out and there was nothing but darkness out there but just a moment ago it flared up again so i know youre still there and harry my boy i must talk to you keenan cant it keep i don tfeel too good need to take it easy it was a weak response as weak as and weaker than sir keenan had ever had from the necroscope but knowing him of old the exhead of ebranch read him like a book and youve been hurt well that doesnt surprise me for without your full range of talents without being able to use them to maximum effect what are you but a man after all but harry i can give them back to you or if i cant i know someone who can now sir keenan had his full attention even if it hurt and harry said give something back what are we talking about the mobius continuum sir keenan told him its unrestricted use harry youve been robbed and you dont even know it i was robbed he spoke out loud or rather in a croaky whisper unheard over the throb of the helicopters engine and the whup whup whup of rotors as one of his legs jerked in a semiconscious reflex manner striking against a naked figure lying beside him harry was waking up and francesco francezci had noticed his twitching keogh moved he said to angus mcgowan and dancer seated opposite him tanziano at once reached down flicked aside the blanket covering the girls body but when he went to yank the sleeping bag from the necroscopes crumpled figure francesco stopped him let it be he said i cant really talk to him here anyway and who cares hes a dead man our mission is as good as accomplished we have my fathers guarantee that were coming out on top and if this one is or was as dangerous as angelo thought he was why keep him around any longer than we have to eh he reached out touched manozas shoulder luigi lets have a little altitude theres someone back here wants to go skydiving brian lumley necroscope the lost yean vol ii meanwhile sir keenan gormley had introduced harry to a new voice in the metaphysical aether but whoever it belonged to he was so faint distant damaged that the connection was like a longdistance call to another planet we met once harry the disembodied dislocated voice told him maybe youll remember it wasnt long ago at ebranch hq in london you darcy clarke and ben trash you gave me a lift home one night but i didnt make it since thenits taken me a long time to get it together and mewell i dont suppose iii ever get myself together my name isor was james anderson i was a selfstyled doctor and my businesswas hypnotism i did the occasional work for ebranch and you and i was one of your subjects even halfasleep harrys voice was hard he caught on fast and tilings were dropping into place and the more they dropped the closer he came to waking anderson told him everything and however faintly his message got through and because intercourse with the dead is more akin to telepathy than physical speech more an experience than a conversation harry absorbed it all in doublequick time but when he knew how anderson had died and why he was so faintthen there was nothing for it but to accept his apology and forgive him for anderson hadnt known what it was all about after all only that he was doing a job for ebranch and bloody ebranch harry said disgustedly they dropped you right in it didnt they oh theyre good at that well i dont know if this will help any but i can tell you or show you what happened to the two whowho did it to you and he pictured again the explosion in the mttbius continuum a fireball expanding then shrinking as the wreckage of the mercedes sped on forever and the deathshrieks of the men inside going on forever too forever anderson queried his voice even smaller i cant say harry answered i dont know i dont want to think about it and a moment later explosively tucking ebranch he spat as one of nostradamuss quatrains leaped to mind six hundred north and west unto the zero the men of magic are his friends but chained they may not help the one who is their hero or tell him that which may not be explained chained by their own rules yes by the minister responsible bureaucracy governmental expediency by the department of dirty tricks but mainly by their fear that someone else might try to recruit him after hed quit harry saw it all now hed always suspected that there was something darcy desperately wanted to tell him but didnt know how to explain it ebranch the bastards but harry anderson told him can put it right im the only one who can put it right why its as easy as this and this time there was no conflict harrys various levels of conscious awareness his several realities interfaced perfectly because the man who had been responsible for creating the first of his mindblocks was also the one who removed it and dancer said francesco this guys talking to himself and starting to move hes coming out of it but not quite for the dead were still talking to the necroscope and they still had his attention indeed they had his attention more fully than at any time since anderson had placed his posthypnotic manacles on harrys mind and behaviour constraints which were now lifted harry said a new voice male with a slight scottish accent a voice of onceauthority but shaky now and with nothing of its former confidence i just wanted to warn you about who or what youre up against exinspector george lanson paused to introduce himself and then quickly told his storywhich was as bad or worse than andersons so there you have it he finished with a mental shudder that little man mcgowan a man i catted my friend has to be the devil incarnate and while he is alive ican never rest literally one devil harry answered just one of many so thanks for the warning but it really wasnt necessary i know theyve got to go its them or me and i dont intend it to be me was a man of law and justice lanson told him but there can be no sane or civilized trialfor such as them just revenge or maybe a just revenge im only one harry but how many other victims have there been and his voice slowly faded into the background static of the grave or in lansons case a place even darker than the grave the necroscopes anger was making him restless now it was a cold anger that bit into his soul like an icy blast all the way down the line he had been everybodys fool and hed placed all of the blame on himself he had actually believed himself a drunk or an amnesiac or a madman he had committed himself to an asylum and only now when it might well be too late did he have the complete story only now the missing pieces of the puzzle had fallen into place and the bitter chill of realization of knowledge was eating deeper and deeper into him harry said a female voice from close very close at hand can il mean would you mind if i talked to you too you are human but necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumtey you were our friend my friend briefly but you should know i cant couldnt kelp what i was and neither can bj it was in the blood thats all in her more titan in me or any of the girls thats not an excuse ifs simply a fact and harry if you dont already know then you should know that she really does love you the necroscope knew the voice it was moreen one of b js girls but dead by the watchers hand mcgowans hand yes she said but i wont go into details anyway who ami to say what should or shouldnt be what with my background but that policeman you were talking tohes so right harry for no matter what i was that little man is the devil incarnate the helicopter rolled a little and moreens arm flopped across harrys face he felt it there and knew it for what it was then the icy blast hit him again and not only in his soul but physically a blast from the open door and the whup whup whup of the choppers rotors finally getting through to him harry gave a single spastic kick yelled out loud jerked awake he scrambled halfway to his feet fell to his knees as whipcrack lightning flashes from the back of his head threatened to engulf him again mcgowan and dancer flanked him grabbed bis arms yanked him moaning upright in the red glow of the cabin lights hanging onto a ceiling strap francesco francezci grinned directly into his face and said hallo whoever you fucking are and goodbye he jerked his head to indicate the open door and the end of harrys life disoriented the necroscope let himself be dragged to the door then seeing what had been planned for him he might have fought but it was too late as they catapulted him into space mcgowan leaned his devils face out after him a little way and grinned from ear to ear for a moment then he stopped grinning gave a wild shriek and came tumbling after while in the aircraft francesco took the safety off the machinepistol slung over his shoulder cursed and brought die weapon up into the firing position and let fly pointblank with a spray of bulletsdirectly into the naked back of an entirely dead moreen dead with her tongue and heart ripped out her blood stolen and her body ravaged but alive enough to have clawed herself up of f the floor and to have pushed angus mcgowan out into thin air and harry hadnt even asked devastated by the spray of bullets almost cut in half hurled forward projected out of the door she was only a rag doll again fluttering in the downblast and her last words to the necroscope were it seems i left it too long sorry harry but dont be he told her falling and dont worry you wont be alone the dead may take their time but theyll talk to you eventually and so will i when i get the chance his first thought was to conjure a mobius door but then he saw mcgowan angling towards him the little man was falling like a genuine skydiver with arms and legs forming something of an aerofoil and harry remembered from what lanson had told him that this one had been a lieutenant for a long time even as he watched mcgowans body was flattening more surely gliding and his arms were stretching reaching extending towards harry and his face his mad eyes blazing triumphant his jaws gaping wider and wider and his teeth elongating curving up out of riven bleeding gums his hands were hooked into claws and they were only inches away when harry mouthed so youre the devil himself are you well then welcome to hell watcher and opening a door directly beneath his falling body the necroscope plunged through it but only mcgowans arms sliced through above the elbows went with him hot blood sprayed and harry held up an arm to deflect its red jet then it was over and he was hanging there as limp as a rag cold damp motionless but safe now in the nothingness of the mobius continuum while in the universe hed just left mcgowan howled his agony and his helplessness waved his scarlet stumps and went plummeting into a rocky gorge a thousand feet below if someone were cruel enough to hurl a garden snail onto a concrete slab he would get much the same result george lanson could rest easier now moreen too and many another with them and in the helicopter shocked rigid astonished guy tanziano stood frozen beside the open door and even more ashen than usual francesco slumped back into his seat and said shut the fucking thing and did you see that or am i going mad that girl what happened at the controls luigi manoza had caught very little of the action she was alive dancer mumbled stupidly sliding the cabin door shut and turning the locking handle no francesco got a grip on himself snarled low in his throat she was dead meat buti dont know he they had seemed to be talking to each other and to himself didnt angela tell us that he talks to dead people maybe said dancer er maybe necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley maybe what the francezci spoke as if to himself he was scarcely able to believe what had happened maybe shed been a thrall even a lieutenant longer than we thought what but suddenly francesco was seeing dancer in a new light for maybe he was right at that no maybe about it he had to be right the girl had been a fullyfledged vampire and this had been her last shot at metamorphism nothing to do with life or intelligence just the vampire stuff inside her hanging on to dear life but no longer by now shed be so much slop what i mean what luigi manozas chubby white face was still staring back into the passenger cabin the francezci looked at him and said mcgowans gone an accident now there are just the three of us it had been the fastest climb of bjs life as if everything else she had done every moment of practice on a hundred cliff faces but especially on this one had been trial runs for the one big effort like an athlete who holds himself in reserve for the big race bj had held herself back for this one even handicapped by climbing with sandra to whom for the last thirteen years bj had been teaching everything she knew still she had outdone herself for the last hour or so however sandra had been flagging bj had more or less dragged her through the final stages of the ascent but where she had been sandras lifesupport system on the inhospitable often vertical granite faces sandra would be hers when at last she stood face to face with her terrible master or her exmaster as she kept reminding herself for where bj was expert with her naked hands as well as with the despised ropes and pitons of the climber sandra was a crack shot and in her small pack she carried a pistol loaded with very special ammunition silver bullets that b j had never believed she would use except against her mortal or nearimmortal enemies but what the hellthe doglord was her enemy now else he would surely have contacted her before this but here the full moon lit their way and radus redoubt no more than a slight overhang and a narrow rocky ledge away and still the psychic aether was as empty of living thoughts as a crumbling ruin or perhaps not for every now and then briefly as a ripple on water or a riffle through the pages of her mind b j would feel an observer where there could not possibly be one but it wasnt radu no for she would know his mind his feral feel his mental musk anywhere if radu was up if auld john and the others had had any success in raising him from the resin then the doglord was keeping very quiet about it and so bj must be mistaken it had to be the proximity of the redoubt preying on her mind she took a small grapple from her belt sprang its tines and swung it up into the riven rock some twelve feet overhead it caught at once and she tried her weight on it while still clinging tight to the cliff face no problem shed done this a hundred times before she braced her feet climbed hand over hand to the overhang reached across it and drew herself up on to the ledge eight feet overhead the grapple was still firmly wedged and sandra she called down softly you climb ill pull the girl at once obeyed and she was on the rope bracing her legs leaning back into space and looking up at b j when it happened sandras eyes went wide she saw beyond b j and uttered a small gasp that had nothing at all to do with her exertions bj rolled on her side and looked up above her ledge a hole or cave in the honeycombed rock it too must penetrate into the mountain but on a slightly higher level and looking down on her out of the mouth of the cave over the rim of the rock the vicious visage of an asiatic a drakul and revenge singra singh drakesh thought directly into bjs mind as he sliced through the rope revenge for mine that your people broke on the rocks of this selfsame mountain bj had the rope in her hands but sandra had panicked now she dangled there with all of her weight on the rope that slid ever faster through bjs fingers and she couldnt trap it blood spurted where the rope cut lubricating its passage until the sliced end whipped between her fingers and was gone and sandra gone with it a small frightened figure twirling in darkness down to the black river where it frothed at the bottom of the gorge as quick as that b j stuck her legs deep into the narrow slit of the rubblelittered natural window at the back of her ledge looked up again and panted you you bastard youre a dead man on his belly singra singh looked down on her and said i think not his knife had been put away but now he dragged something else into view seeing the bluedsteel muzzle of an ugly machinepistol bj scrambled to turn her body out of the line of fire draw herself under the lip of rock into the labyrinthine system of caves that she knew lay within but her gear snagged on something trapping her and singhs thin lips formed a grinning gash in his face where they drew back from needle teeth taking his time he lined up his sights and a growling voice in both of their minds that yet spoke to singra singh said you are by far the lesser of two evils true but you are closer to hand and by preference i would kill a drakul every time before a lykan even a treacherous bitch like that one brian lumley thensomething crunched it crunched so loud and clear that b j could almost feel it the snapping of bones and the agonized tortured look on singra singhs face said it all as he dropped his weapon and flopped like a beached fishthen began to slide backwards dragged effortlessly into his cave b j knew what had him but had to see it for herself that monstrous paw that reached out over his head to catch it in the raking hooks of threeinch talons and snatch it out of view and the drakuls deathcry rising up and up ah ah akkkr before it shuddered into an awful silence then galvanized by her terror bj struggled free of the opening and into the redoubt and slipping into the darkness of mazy caverns and corridors that no other person had ever known so well she took her crossbow from her belt opened its wings and nocked it slid a bolt into place on the tiller with sandra gone the crossbow was her only weapon against all the pentup horror and lust of six centuries and her single advantage for what it was worth was that now she had only herself to worry about in in radus redoubt harry and the doglord that was our biggest fear sir keenan told harry shortly after the necroscope emerged from the mobius continuum at auld johns place that the interface would cause a complete and final mental breakdown thank god we were wrong but harry had never been too sure about god and so answered i prefer to thank nostradamus and maybe mesmer im not sure what mesmer did but i think he eased the way for me nostradamus took a chance and again im not too sure about a lot of the stuff he told me but in making me work some of it out for myself he provided the cure the way i see it its easy to be scared of the unknown but once you begin to understand what you are dealing with then it gets easier your mother said as much sir keenan told him and harry nodded if i had been hit with the whole thing all at one time im pretty sure i would have lost it totally but bit by bit i could take it and not only that but im mad as hell i mean angry mad and this time it was me who said as much sir keenan said worriedly but not so mad that youll start taking chances til do what i have to harry answered and now i have to make myself useful please excuse me he found his belt and munitions where b j had tossed them under a bush close to the house and reequipped himself also he looked for and pocketed the cigarette lighter dropped by the ferenczy thrall when he had shot him after that there was only one thing left to do one place to go and he believed he knew the exact location for when bj had told him or retold him about the wamphyri she had awakened certain memories too one of them was about a dream hed had or a premonition or since it had been a long time even years ago when the necroscope necroscope the lost yean vol ii brian lumley had been new to alec kyles body maybe it had been one of kyles glimpses out of the future whichever he had visited radus redoubt and stood by the doglords sarcophagus and now he need only recall that specific scene to mind and the coordinates were there rock solid in his renewed repaired and even refreshed memory climb to the lair he had no doubt that he could but that was for people who knew no other way harrys way was simply to go there and taking a deep breath he prepared to do just that francesco francezci guy tanziano and luigi manoza found auld johns rope still dangling into the pothole where he had left it and clambered down into darkness vampires they found no great difficulty in the climb the lack of daylight was hardly problematic the light of the full moon and the coldly enigmatic stars lit their way through the first stage and when they were down into the labyrinth their eyes quickly adjusted the francezcis eyes flared red and those of the others were the sulphur yellow of vampire thralls they went carefully soundlessly at first radus redoubt wasnt what they had expected it seemed rough uninhabitable deserted it seemed deserted at least its many levels were hollow and echoing the deeper they penetrated the more constant and lifesustaining the temperature which was typical of cavern complexes worldwide overall the silence both physical and psychic was utter the three we saw tanziano whispered hoarsely the old tracker and his friends they were definitely headed this way and then theres that rope somebody came down here obviously said francesco but that was hours ago and they could just as easily have left on the other handperhaps something stopped them from leaving radu has been down a long time with little or no sustenance to see him through the centuries personally i shall be interested to see how he did it but now waking he would have his needs immediate needs i mean and while you may not smell it to me this place stinks of wolf so it could be that hes resting after taking food anyway lets keep it quiet sound will travel a long way down here and thoughts go further and faster yet so as of now you would be wise to guard your thoughts and if you feel or sense anything at all he looked at his thralls nodded meaningfully and left the rest unspoken they followed footprints occasionally mere scuff marks in places where the dust of centuries lay thin on the naked stone after a while descending a steep passage to a floor of broken flags laid in a rough crazypaving fashion tanziano pointed a blunt finger grunted two sets of tracks going in both directions francesco nodded and whispered but the majority go this way he eased back the cocking handle on his machinepistol so that the distinctive chching as it engaged was kept to a minimum of noise and the others followed suit they were down now onto the floor of the main cavern into the lair itself and every one of francescos vampire instincts told him it was so but he still couldnt detect the doglord himself he was here certainly wolfmusk lay thick in francescos mind almost as if he felt it on his skin but radus actual location remained unknown anthony francezci would not have found this surprising through greater contact with his father anthony had learned far more of wamphyri history than his brother he knew that two thousand years ago in starside the doglord was already a powerful telepath he could control his thoughts disappear from the mental aether as surely as angelo ferenczy himself but tony francezci wasnt hereand this was the last place he would want to be despite that he had assured his brother of his coming triumph following the major trail of prints and scuffs eventually the trio came to radus sarcophagus atop its dais of piled debris here the wolftaint was thick if only to francesco but something of the eeriness of the place its pregnant silence perhaps or distant monotonous almost musical drip of water had got through to guy tanziano tugging on francescos sleeve where the francezci looked up at the great stone coffin he whispered this place makes the pit back at le manse madonie feel downright friendly francesco shrugged him off scowled at his obvious reluctance stay here then and watch our backs he said and with a twitch of his head he indicated that manoza should accompany him up to the sarcophagus leaving tanziano at the foot of the pile tile two climbed to the daiss platform and lit the stubs of several torches in their sconces then stepping across the pooled resin they carried on up to the rim of radus coffin shit said manoza then gazing down on what the bath of gluey yellow fluids contained but francesco only grinned and used the folded butt of his weapon to prod the pair of corpses where they lay halfsubmerged in the resin i was right he said hes not only awake but hes up and hes hungry he teas hungry anyway one of the corpses was that of a young man nothing extraordinary about him except the wolftaint moonchild francesco commented drained to the last drop and drowned in the resin just to be sure that radus bite wouldnt take the doglord isnt making lieutenants not just yet anyway and this other one a drakul definitely asiatic a fullfledged lieutenant and leader of his group which tells me that his group is probably no more he would be the last to go brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii and manoza murmured in something of awe his backs like a z and those knife marks go right through to his skull and hes missing his heart its like he went through the cogs of a big machine not knife marks francesco shook his head claw marks while down at the foot of the stack tanziano gave a start and turned in a jerky circle his eyes swivelling this way and that as they tried to follow a shadow that seemed to leap from wall to wall and surface to surface in the flickering light of the torches until finally his gaze rested on a vertical crack in the caverns wall where for a moment the torchlight seemed reflected by twin points of red and gritting his teeth nodding his bullet head and unnoticed by his companions dancer pointed his weapon ahead of him moved in that direction while the francezci said to manoza its like i told you it would be the bloodwar is on and theyve already engaged each other somewhere in this maze well find the rest of them those you observed on their way here the woman and the last of her girls and of course the doglord radu if they havent killed each other off already we can always hope eh he turned glanced down to the foot of the pile and started to say guy now were going to follow that other set of tracks guy dancer his voice came echoing back but that was all tanziano wasnt there the francezci and manoza scrambled down to the floor and francesco called dancer where the hell and it was as if the cavern had been waiting for just such a question where the hell where the where it echoed and then something that wasnt an echo but a hoarse whisper yet sharp and clear as a shout to their enhanced hearing and not only in francescos ears but in his mind oh indeed where the hell but the hell is here ferenczy scum wolf francesco snarled as that cough bark rumble of sound faded in his head he and manoza stood back to back and stared into shadows left and right nothing moved for a moment until suddenly something was lobbed out from behind a massive natural column of rock it spun lazily in the smoky air landed soggily on the roughhewn flags slid a little way and left a red trail it was an arm torn off at the shoulder like a chicken joint with all of the ligaments the flesh and tendons of the right shoulder and breast attached and it was still clad in the sleeves of guy dancer tanzianos parka jacket and shirt the howling when it came was an anticlimax but more than howling francesco knew it was also laughter and reverberating in his mind as well as through the maze of caverns it bounced from wall to wall and nerveending to nerveending like an outofkilter dervish howling manoza said unnecessarily and laughter francesco snarled the bastards laughing at us i only heard the howling said manoza visibly shaken he looked at the francezci wide and wildeyed francesco are we nuts or something what thewe are we doing here francesco indicated the massive column of rock til take this side you take the other circle the column stay dose to the rock and fire at anything that moves but as they came together on the other side without seeing anything far too late too slow came that deep dark rumble of a voice in francescos mind three of you came down here came of your own free will but now there are only two soon only you and i ferenczy are you afraid for a moment it was as if francesco had been slapped in the face then he snarled out loud what afraid of a halfling of a dogthing if youre such a menace such a threat radu then why not do it here now face to face it was partbravado and part something else for he had sensed what frustration or desperation something in the doglords bluster something behind it that he was trying to cover up and radu knew that he had sensed it the telepathic contact hed established had conveyed far more than he had wanted francesco to know and the doglords growl became a furious whine as he withdrew his probe francesco turned to manoza who was looking at him as if he were mad oh what now the francezci scowled you wereyou were talking to him manoza said you were challenging him but hes not here francesco grinned his humourless grin of course he has moved on luigi gone from here because hes afraid but he heard me well enough and i challenged him because he is weak radu is ill hes sick from his hibernation from the waking from disease and from time itself this is one sick old wolf and his only advantage is his familiarity with this damn labyrinth but his thoughts give him away theyre tike a beacon to me come on follow the trail it was a trail of blood dancers blood which after a handful of paces came to an abrupt end at his body where his legs stuck out from behind a slab of rock his fat tongue had been ripped hah from its roots dragged forward to block his mouth and stop him crying out his back was broken his heart had been torn out through a gaping hole in his chest and shattered ribs holy said luigi manoza his throat bobbing with the effort of gathering saliva to get the one word out holy francesco glared at him holy necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley holy shit manoza finally gasped he was a vampire but he was only a thrall and this was the work of something else wamphyri but different again from francesco ahead an interior rock wall was split into twin tunnels tracks went into both of them you can see in the dark the francezci reminded the badly shaken manoza you have a superior weapon you can pump twentyfive rounds a second into this bastard get into that tunnel if the trail peters out come back to this point and i shall do likewise now move manoza moved but only a few stumbling paces into the tunnel he saw an irregular patch of light far overhead and to one side blocks of stone piled into steps with more steps cut into the wall leading to what looked like the arch of a natural rock causeway everything led upwards and out of here which seemed to manoza a very good place to be the francezci would kill him if he didnt get killed himself but right now not knowing what francesco knew or thought he knew manoza considered that a distinct possibility and the chopper was up there and light and air and freedom and down here the true death in the shape of a terror out of time not much of a choice especially with that growling voice in his mind urging him run little man run save yourself for your master is as good as dead and with a hammering heart manoza ran or rather climbed and a gibbering horror seemed right behind him all the way in the continuum harry had thought twice about it and in the end he hadnt taken the mobius route directly into radiis lair for one thing his olden dream or preview forbade it more than a dream that had been a nightmare and for another he wanted to see what was going on up there on the mountain with drakul and ferenczy involvement it could and most probably would be a minefield and so he had gone in stages from false plateau to ledge to rocky butte and finally to the dome of the mountain there he had found the helicopter deserted on flat ground close to a huge fissure in the pitted rock a rope dangled into another smaller pothole close by and he rightly supposed that this had been the ferenczy gangs route into the lair but knowing they were equipped with highpowered weapons and likewise their advantage in the dark he hadnt followed them or tried jumping ahead of them and despite that the necroscopes heart was in his mouth for bonnie jean though in truth he couldnt say why still hed sat it out for more than half an hour to see what would happen now he was more cold and anxious than ever and the moonlit scene was as still as when hed first arrived here still and quiet or maybe unquiet except for the low moaning of a steady breeze that swept across the mountains dome quiet yesor perhaps not he was close to the pothole entrance when he saw the rope go taut and heard a distant panting then the vibration of the rope as someone climbed into view by then harry had moved back into the cover of a clump of rocks but when the stubby man who climbed out of the pothole headed for the helicopter he stepped into view the man was in a hurry and failed to see him reaching the airplane he yanked open a door in the machines side harry couldnt see him too well didnt recognize him and wanted to be sure of who he was and what was going on here so he called out hey you luigi manozas answer might easily have cut him in pieces whirling the thug opened up with his machinepistol and lead and a little silver buzzed like a cloud of angry wasps all around most of the rounds were wasted trapped by the mobius door that harry erected as manoza spun and went into a crouch the ones that went wide of the door were the ones that buzzed and now harry could be sure of what he was dealing with but manoza couldnt he had fired on someone had used up half a magazine on him from a distance of some forty or fortyfive feet away and that someone or thing was still on its feet and hadnt even moved that was more than enough for manoza scrambling aboard the airplane he slammed the door shut after him and threw himself into the pilots chair the flick of a handful of switches the pressure of the thugs thumb on the starter button and the engine coughed into life then the vanes began their whupwhuupwhuuup airslicing revolutions quickly blurring into a shining fan whose draught bounced the machine on its pontoons taking out a transmitter from one of his pouches extending the aerial harry waited for the helicopter to drift just an inch or two off the ground then pressed the button at the choppers tailend just below the lateral fan a magnetic mine consisting of a detonator and four ounces of plastic exploded blew the fan off and sent the airplane crazy she keeled over and snapped a pontoon rolled the other way and forwards until the vanes hit the deck and snapped off in razorsharp sections one such section shot in through the windscreen and pinned manoza to his seat holding him there while the chopper skittered like a singed moth to the edge of the fissure it tilted for a moment stood in a balletdancer pose on one pontoon and fell a count of four and the fuel tanks blew and seventy gallons of avgas made a blast that shook the rock under the necroscopes feet and a smokering that went up and up following a tongue of fire that licked fifty feet into the night sky harry nodded grimly to himself another ferenczy down and just two to go of this mob anyway moreover he had destroyed their brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii escape route maybe now it was time he had a look inside radus lair as he conjured a mobius door another explosion shook the mountain from deep within and the great fissure vented streamers of black smoke now more than ever the necroscope was conscious of his error the fact that he didnt have a sidearm his bombs devastating as they were and even his grenades werent designed for closequarter combat on the other hand what good was a conventional handgun against the wamphyri instead he palmed a heavy little fragmentation grenade before making his jump in his dream remembered as clearly now as if hed experienced it just last night he had seen ragged natural windows in the crumbling outer wall of the lair located at a seemingly safe distance from radus sarcophagus the coordinates were clear in his mind as he conjured a door and his dream came to life as he stepped from the mobius continuum at one of those precise coordinates r barely in time to witness an astonishing occurrence and one that he had set in motion the place was reverberating with distant and notsodistant echoes creakings and groanings dust settled in rivulets from a ceiling lost in height and darkness also from various ledges and levels even a handful of stony splinters and one or two geometrically shaped slabs of granite came hurtling from on high but all of this mainly in the unsupported central section of the cavern not on the perimeter where harry stood nor was this disturbance finished there was a continuous metallic grinding a nerveshattering screech of tortured metal which seemed if anything to be getting louder and from a huge boreholelike aperture or cave where the dim ceiling curved out of the heights to form an inner wall an intermittent stream of stony rubble and smoke but when fire gushed from the hole like a giants blowtorch harry believed he knew what he was seeing through unknown caverns stony chutes and rockslides the wrecked helicopter had found its way down to this level and as the blowtorch blaze turned to black smoke and a twisted mass of hot blistered metal erupted from the hole and smashed down in the caverns debris harry saw that he was right but the glare of the fireball had lit up the whole cavern and the necroscope had taken the opportunity to note his position the best route to radus dais and sarcophagus and especially the fact that the place seemed void of life but certainly life had been here for just a few short paces ahead of him he had also seen bjs crossbow still loaded lying on the floor where she had tossed it or where it had fallen stepping forward he put away his grenade retrieved the crossbow refused to dwell on what its discovery meant the guttering torches at the base of radus coffin served as his guide and in a little while he was there a few moments more and he would know if the doglord was up and about in the world but if he wasnt then he never would be and holding the crossbow waisthigh aiming it ahead determined to see this thing through to the end harry climbed the jumble to its level dais avoided the slopped resin and resolutely continued on up to the rim of the great sarcophagus the doglord radu lykan was finished he knew it and had known it even before rising from the resin it was only since rising that he had come to accept it that in his current shape he was finished in his current shape and form aye which was why he had sent auld john to bring the mysterious one his manwithtwofaces to him in his lair for the man called harry keogh was his one way out of a fix that had stayed with him stalking him through six long centuries but to think of it at any length to even consider it was simply too much that one of the greatest predators of all time a lord of the wamphyri out of olden starside indeed a primal werewolf should have been brought low by one of the very smallest predators by the bite of a flea carried on the back of a rat out of asia the black death which had defied even his vampire leech to combat the poison in his otherwise allconquering system he had known it from the moment he crawled from the resin and loped to groom himself in the waterfall near the great vat that contained his warrior creature oh he could still run especially after feeding on the blood of a strong man and the heart and vampire leech of a drakul but even then he had felt the poison coursing in his veins and had suspected that it was more than just the ache of centuries that gnawed at his bones and at the waterfallhe had proved it the black pustules in his armpits and groin the texture of his flesh which no longer answered when he called for metamorphosis but seemed stuck in his wolf shape and the fire inside called lust the lust for life a life that could last forever which he felt burning low to match the flow of energy energy he had none oh sufficient to enter the mind of a mere moonchild and beguile him to suicide certainty and then bolstered by that ones blood to pluck the life of some piddling drakul lieutenant and tear loose the arm of a trembling ferenczy thrall but how much energy did that take none at all not to the wamphyri not to a vampire lord in all the strength of his youth except where was his youth now left behind in a different world a different time and his strength all eaten up by a flea and his lust brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii for life but how may one lust with great black lumps in his groin poison in his piss and a sure knowledge of his bones crumbling under the ancient leather of his hide yet even now it seemed a scurrilous accusation to blame all this on a poor flea for while blackrat fleas had carried the plague it was a different bite entirely that had transferred it into radus system until now it seemed there was no way of getting it out for the resin hadnt workedit had merely preserved him to die later to die now and his leech hadnt worked for it was dying too for a little while radu had felt a surge of power as his system converted garth trevalins lifeblood but every action since then had only served to drain him like a leaking bucket six drops spilled for every five put in it couldnt go on he was dying and the rate of his decline was accelerating moreover along with his physical strength his mental powers were likewise diminished that was how the ferenczy this weak socalled sophisticated modern version of a lord of the wamphyri had seen through his bluster but wouldnt it be the irony of all time or of six hundred years of time at least if radu were to be destroyed by a ferenczy for it was doubtless an ancestor of this francesco who all those years ago first stabbed a plagueridden corpse then plunged his sword into radu in which case it were better he had died then than to let a member of the same cursed clan kill him now his one chance harry keogh metempsychosis into the body and mind of a new or newer man and then keoghs physical conversion into radu and thus auld john guiney sent out upon his most important mission to bring keogh here for bonnie jean would not could not not in her present condition position but auld john radu had found him with a weak probe discovered him nursing an arm broken in a fall in the final stage of his descent which had made it appear that that avenue too was now closed yet during all the years of radus oneiromantic dreaming he had frequently scried this selfsame harry keogh and had known that his mysterious one would be here to sustain him in one way or another at the time of his resurgence ah but how often in his waking years had it been proved to the doglord that the future is a devious thing oh the future win always be of course for what force can ever stop it but it will seldom be as foreseen and yetperhaps there was still a chance albeit a slim one for bj mirlu was a beguiler second only to radu himself a hypnotist with her eyes and mind and a seducer with her body if she had followed radus good advice which he knew she had then by now this harry was far more her thrall than any mere bite might ever decree and if he knew she was here surely he would want to know what was become of her for which reason radu would cling to life to the bitter end in the hope that his manwithtwofaces would yet put in a late appearance and meanwhile there was this ferenczy scum to deal with who might yet deal with him for radu had seen in the ferenczys mind the devastation he held in his eager hands a technology lost on the doglord which he scorned as much as he misunderstood it he too could have control of just such a weapon yet he had taken guy tanzianos machinepistol and broken it in pieces against a granite wall and all that remained to him now were the wiles of a wolf with which to combat this ancient enemy which was why he had doubled back to the lairs main cavern in the hope of eluding him but just as surely as radus mistress moon blazed high in the night sky his immemorial enemy was returning for him even now and radu knew it the doglord was right alerted by a shuddering underfoot and in the walls and an uproar of inexplicable sounds from behind him the francezci had abandoned the trail and returned to the main cavern in time to witness the wrecked helicopters plunge then working out what had happened had scarcely taxed his intelligence and while he waited for the rockfall to subside and the dust to settle he roundly cursed the coward manoza for whatever good that would do him what good to curse the dead who were beyond it oh but if only he had the little fat bastard here now insteadhe had someone else here for in the caverns smoky light francesco had seen a slim male figure climbing the jumbled rock pile to radus great coffin just who it might behe couldnt say wouldnt hazard a guess though certainly he seemed familiar but then again what odds if he was here he was an enemy and all of francescos passions were incensed to murder so he went from shadow to shadow flowing in the manner of the wamphyri soundlessly across the rubblestrewn floor in the direction of the dais and its massive sarcophagus white at the coffin itself harry remembered his dream in it no less than in radus he and the doglord had come face to face which was the part that had been the nightmare so that now in real life he was taking no chances with the crossbow at arms length he gradually raised himself up to look in at an angle on the contents of the coffin and he saw what francesco had seen but no sign of radu until claws like the tines of a garden fork set in a paw eight necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley inches across sank into his clothing but not into his skin for the doglord wasnt about to pass on his ancient disease to his futureself and so perpetuate it at the shoulder turning him about radu had emerged from behind his sarcophagus and was crouching on the uneven tangle of granite slabs at the head of the coffin like some grotesque gargoyle inches from the necroscopes astonished face a pair of great triangular yellow eyes with crimson cores bored searchingly into his own and radus breath was as hot and rank as molten copper in a forge and ahhhh the mysterious one that vast mouth cracked open in wonder in something of disbelief and finally in a twisted drooling smile my mysterious one harry couldnt get the crossbow between them crushed to the side of the sarcophagus he tried was rewarded by a glancing buffet from the monsters free paw that nearly broke his wrist and sent the crossbow flying free thenharry knew he was a dead man held like a child in radus grip he could conjure a mobius door but couldnt move to step through it he knew he was dead but the doglord only knew he was alive and his eyes continued to hold him to hold him yes with a grip as powerful as his great paw harry felt himself held felt his muscles relax his breathing slow from its hoarse panting and finally he felt radus mind groping to be inside his dr james andersens posthypnotic restraints had been lifted to such a telepathic power as radu harrys very soul was laid bare radu saw and absorbed all almost in as little time as it takes to tell necroscope he talks to the dead and can call them from their graves he moves in the spaces between the spaces goes from place to place as quick as thought he is a man of the modern world and understands all of its technology its scientific wonders yet not one of its wonders or all of them together can explain or understand him he knows about the wamphyrihas even removed destroyed members of our species drakuls and ferenczys he knows the locations of all my enemies out of time their powerbases their seats in this modern world he is my mysterious one but mysterious no longer and now necroscope now radu growled a low rumble in his great throat as his eyes grew large as lanterns in harrys trapped perspective tell me is there room in that marvellous mind of yours for both of us well for however brief a time radu the shout snapped like the crack of a whip in the great cavern snatching the doglord upright from his gargoyle crouch all seven feet of him and jerking him to face the one who shouted but his great paw remained fastened on harrys shoulder and the necroscope could only hang there like a rabbit snapped up by a hunter dazed in radus grasp dazed mainly by his telepathic encounter which had had the effect of draining him and at the foot of the dais francesco francezci or more properly the ferenczy aimed his machinepistol and grinned as he squeezed the trigger radu read the others mind whined ah no not now nooooor but the bullets paid no attention whatever the staccato coughing and spanging of that stream of lead and silver would have been an obscenity in itself without the amplifying echoing qualities of the labyrinth but the liquid spattering that accompanied it was far worse for it signified hits on radus flesh not that harry felt any sympathy for the doglord but the huge hairy twitching shuddering body that gave him cover had only so much resistance and any one of the bullets might find its way right through radu was hit a dozen or more times as the ferenczy hosed him down waving his clamouring weapon to and fro in a crisscross over his halfhuman target harry saw bright splashes of red against the side of the sarcophagus and gobs of red sent flying during the frantic seconds of the machinepistols mad chattering and he wondered if in fact he too had been hit but then it was over and the doglords weight radus dead weight came down on him trapped as the werewolf was thrown back against him jammed down into the ragged jaws of a broken slab between radus quivering slumping frame and the side of the sarcophagus harry was still trying to recover his orientation following radus invasion and nearoccupation of his mind indeed the roots of that contact were still there and the pain he imagined he felt was the doglords death agony but it was ebbing very quickly now and realizing he was still alive and apparently unharmed the necroscope began struggling to free himself all the time aware that a scarleteyed vampire lord was climbing the rocky jumble towards him francesco however was taking his time for radu was wamphyri too and there might yet be a few surprisesas there doubtless would be when he set fire to his body but no great ruckus as yet so maybe hed got radus leech too crippled by a silver bullet or perhaps hed been right to suspect that the doglord was on his last legs and his vampire leech with him hah but after six hundred years in a bath of resin wasnt it only to be expected thus francesco rationalized as he climbed warily towards harry and the monster pinning him but in the necroscopes metaphysical mind necroscope the last years vol ii brian lumley dead murdered by a ferenczy killed harry corrected him silently executed not murdered but put down like a mad dog so close radu whined so very close we could have been great together necroscope no harry answered it doesnt work that way no partnerships not with your sort and well you know it but in death the old wolfs mind was as agile as in life and he saw a way to prolong his existence even now obscuring his true thoughts he said you are eager to insinuate quick to accuse necroscope but did you ever see me do wrong what evil act pray have i per formed against you how have i mistreated you that you should so misjudge me no dont tell me what you think i have done but what you know have done which you have seen with your own eyes how to answer nun harry had forced himself halfway out from beneath the doglords body but the pouches on his belt were caught up on sharp edges of rock i only know what b j mirlu told me he finally gasped out loud but i also know that shethat shes a liar just like the rest of you all of your glorious bloody history a handful of truths a few halftruths but mainly damned lies what francesco francezci his head and shoulders level with the daiss platform now looked to see who the necroscope was talking to harrys top half was sticking out from beneath the doglords carcass and he made the mistake of looking directly at francesco who could no longer doubt the evidence of his own excellent eyesight before the ferenczy hadnt even considered the possibility but now what the he said and how for the man trapped under radus riddled body was the same one hed had thrown out of the helicopter for a moment it stopped him dead in his tracks the doglord read the fact of it right out of the necroscopes mind also the absolute certainty that francesco wouldnt miss this second opportunity to kill harry and what he growled do you give in that easily but you can stop him even now and permanently orwe can the dead come up of their own accord harry told him i suppose im the focus but their love is the true catalyst what francesco said again frowning as he climbed on up to the dais are you a madman not that it matters for youre certainly a dead one but first i want to know how you did it love radu growled human love hah but that is something i left behind along with my humanity hate i understand and greed and lust maybe i can use them instead no i thought not so now it is up to you if you would live call me upor dont you ever want to see bj again with which he played his one trump card harry dragged the upper half of his body to one side out of francescos immediate line of fire clawed his way just two or three inches to the edge of a tilted slab and glanced over between his clutching fingers and the ferenczy rose up to face him grinning from ear to ear and pointing the ugly muzzle of his weapon directly into harrys face on the other hand francesco grunted dont bother telling me how for it no longer matters maybe there were two of you eh twins well since my father has assured me you talk to dead men give your twin my regards when next you see him ok and radu said harry ii think i may need you which seemed to be quite enough the doglords weight lifted off him and he at once rolled to one side through a mbius door but not before he saw a massive monstrous paw reach out in a dark blur of motion to swat francescos weapon aside then materializing a third of the way across the floor of the great cavern the necroscope breathed his relief and looked back on what hed left behind he saw and heard it alland then for a while wished that he hadnt the ferenczys sobbing at first then his pleading as radu dragged him writhing and kicking up the last of the stone steps to his sarcophagus finally his shrieking and the sharp snap of his arms as radu broke them across his knee one after the other at the elbows upended francescos cries were reduced to guttural gulps and gurgles as the great wolf plunged him headlong into the warm resin that remained in his coffin only to drag him out again and but youre dead a final explosion of disbelief from the doomed francesco his words coughed out in resin slops and yellow bubbles from gaping jaws youre only a ffucking dead thing radu picked him up by the broken arms whiplashed him in an arc over his head and down onto the stone steps and growlingly joyfully answered apparently but not nearly as dead as you are about to be and planting his feet on francescos shoulders catching him under the chin and at the back of his skull with several expert twists and turns of his hugely corded arms and straightening his back in one smooth movement he very quickly pulled his head off the pulpy sound as living flesh was literally torn apart would have been sickening in itself but the sight of it was worse the necroscope had seen many horrific things in his time but this ranked among the worst of them that incredible elongation of francescos neck until his metamorphic flesh could take no more of it and came apart and the upper part of his backbone dragged out in a red spray like the spine of a gutted fish except fish dont have leprous corrugated living flesh twined brian lumky necroscope the lost years vol ii about their spines francescos leech which radu tore free with a howl of delight and dangled into the red cave of his throat it was gone in two bites two massive swallows and only then the real commotion one smoky torch still flared and sputtered at the base of the coffin in a bound the doglord leaped free of the lashing nest of grey and purple tentacles sprouting from the ferenczys shattered erupting body tossed his head up into the sarcophagus and followed it with the torch twirling end over end the torch flared up with die rush of air and came down on the warm resin and blue fire lit the cavern as the semiliquid surface was patterned with whooshing streamers of flame like some fine fiery greek brandy following the trail of resin that spattered the rim the fire leaped to francescos soaked broken body and mindless vampire protoplasm with neither the will nor the intelligence to escape the flames began to roast it went on for quite some time until the doglord came loping in harrys direction calling necroscope a proposal i dont think so harry backed off hastily conjured a door its time you rested from all this radu for that one was right you are a dead thing wait the other skidded to a halt some thirty feet away tve rested long enough and what about bonnie jean dont do it harry not if you would see her again harry hesitated he more than hesitated for the fact was that he didnt know if he could put radu down again when members of the teeming dead came up it was out of love or fear for him as he had stated and when they went back down it was because they were no longer needed but radu wasnt here out of love or fear but hatred and the necroscope wasnt sure he had any control over that his shields were up again however and radu read nothing of his uncertainty the doglord took a loping tentative step closer prompting harry to warn him stay right there radu and because he didnt know what else to do so what do you propose help me and help you radu barked refuse me and bj rots in hell forever harry avoided his eyes help you but youre beyond help youre dead would you destroy an entire species yes and bj too is she wamphyri a fledgling lady yes but only a fledgling i can stop it she can be wholly human again what is in her can be taken out of her ive heard such lies from the like of you before harry answered even as he felt his heart leap within him no the doglord laughed coughed barked not so for there never has been the like of me before and i promise you i can give the woman back to you clean of this contagion you see it as a contagion perhaps upon a time oh a very long time ago but no longer now i see it as life you see it as a contagion dont bandy terms will you hear my proposal where is bj is she safe but radu knew that the necroscope was hooked he laid back his head and howled to set the cavern echoing then fell to all fours and pointed his terrible muzzle in harrys direction and his lantern eyes blazed as he said for the last time hear me out or put me down and kill that bitch bonnie jean too all in one fell stroke whats it to be one more bound will force your hand necroscope no more arguing then for it will all be over for me at least and for b j his muscles seemed bunched to spring very well harry licked his dry lips nodded his agreement lets hear it radu relaxed a little sat back on his haunches and growled in one way at least our aims are much of a sort for the last six centuries i have dreamed a dream whose source lies two thousand years ago in olden starside in another world but now in this world there is only one way my dream can come true without more ado he told harry what he wanted and he was right their aims were much of a sort for the necroscope wanted it too ffecroscope the lost years vol ii iv dead reckonings like some strange gaunt bird of prey hunchshouldered and sunkeneyed the oncehandsome anthony francezci stood alone for the first time truly alone beside the pit under le manse madonie the current was off and the wiremesh cover stood open on its hinges the heavy chain hung stationary on its pulleys its load delivered into the unknown the sounds of furious seething sounds like hard acid biting into bone had died down and faded to nothing but there had been no sounds of rending no screaming from the crone katerin or at best only a brief period of gasping an ah ah aahhhr sound almost of pleasure then silence and strangest of all no cries of outrage from the old ferenczy angelo himself the nightmarish inhabitant of the pit then again there had been nothing from him for quite some time now which was why anthony had come down here because something less than an hour ago at eightthirty he had received some sort of communication a message from his twin brother or not a message as such butknowledge pain momentary there had been a brief aching in his arms his back his neck a burning in his blood and since then nothing except a dawning awareness that it was dark out there and darker still in his mind an awareness that indeed he was quite alone except for angelo for francesco was dead and so anthony had brought katerin down here as an offering to his father in the hope of soliciting a corroboration or explanation of his suspicion for of course the mutant thing in the pit would know old katerin yes but he hadnt told angelo what he had for him only that she was a tidbit hah the pit had been silent just as silent as it was now so that no amount of cajoling threatening or bribing could solicit an answer and in the end anthony had given in and lowered a mildly anaesthetized katerin down the throat of the pit the pain would bring her out of it of course and that was important for not only did anthony want his father to know what he was getting but katerin to know who was getting her and when she was down he had waited for her screaming and for the old ferenczys cursing but no there had been only the unknown creeping and the seething and at the end katerins ah ah aahhhr cry or sigh in response to what some weird sexual pleasure or perhaps exquisite pain and now this unbearable silence of which anthony had had quite enough and fuck you angelo he cried out beating on the old well wall with his fist are you beyond all this is that what you have become what shall become a pile of slop in a stinking pit not knowing the difference between a juicy young girl and a smelly old hag ver y well then rot down there if you will but whether francesco is dead or not i live on he is dead came the gale in anthonys mind so sudden it drove him back from the rim he is dead and iprepare anthony came forward again stabbed at the button to work the hoist to bring it up then as the motor throbbed and the gears engaged and the chain quivered as it wound on its pulleys he said prepare oh really his voice dripped its sarcasm and do you have something to prepare for father death maybe the true death when i plug this stinking hole life said the other the volume of his telepathic sending more nearly bearable now lives and death yes but anthony ah my tony havent you learned anything dont you know that there is life in death especially for such as you and i rot down here but ive been doing that for long and long and i tell you that life may spring even from corruption life in death undeath you mean but anthony was feeling very uncertain now his fathers tone was so doomfraught so mournful undeath is one thing the pitdweller said but there are others i prepare for one of the others whileyouyou have your own problems the platform was coming up into view but old katerin was still on it what anthonys eyes bugged several problems his father went on for one he is coming as he came once before only this time he isnt coming to steal from you and he isnt coming alone what anthony said again bringing the hoist to a jerky halt and in his confusion switching on the electric current the chain swung against the open cover made contact sparks skittered down the chain and ten feet down the shaft on necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley the dangling platform old katerins body swelled up like a grotesque balloon and burst burst open revealing a part of angelo hie old bastard would have tried to escape or something of him at least but escaped to where to whom anthony believed he knew well enough to whom not now however for katerins gutted body had collapsed back to the driedout husk or less than the husk that it had been and a corrugated nucleus of purplegrey protoplasm ten to twelve inches in diameter with dozens of flickering cilialike tentacles propelling it was skittering down the sheer wall of the shaft like a crazed alien spider damn you anthony snarled was that youryour preparation did you intend that for me to go on in me a mutant leech from your own mutant body to continue in me bringing up katerins remains he switched off the electricity and swept the debris from the platform to flutter in rags and tatters back into the pit then with the current on again he let the wiremesh cover fall with a clang and watched the breath of the pitthing steaming and sputtering where it drifted up and made contact with the grid tenacious his father told him and anthony sensed the old ferenczys irritation his impatient mental shrug but nothing more than that as if this were some minor setback its in our nature and we cant help it in you just as its in me and oh im not finished yet my tony not yet but you are for hes here they are here madman anthony hissed mad thing who is here you grow more like your brother every day said the other for he never listened either an alarm went off high in the wall and from up above the concerted clamouring of more alarms anthony stared at the silvery blur of the bells hammer striking its dome and back down into the pit he they he mouthed do you mean that fucking thief and radu but that cant be it cant be but it can be angelos multiminds screamed in unison in wild excitement he comes to destroy you and ie manse madone and all of us for which we have prayed at which anthony was gone from there rushing like a wind through the subterranean system up into le manse madonie where he was met in the great hall by the cadaverous mario what is it he grabbed maries shirt front in claw hands what in the name of hell is it and where is everyone theyre all at their posts mario told him on the walls or in the courtyard or outside the walls i sent them out and i set off the alarms because i didnt know where you were he led the way up the great staircase to anthonys private rooms but why whats happening anthony swept along behind his first lieutenant a man on the wall thought he saw something mario answered as anthony let them into his rooms thought anthony was less panicked now on a clear night like this someone thought he saw something what is he going blind or someth but there he paused choking on the words they were through his rooms to the balcony out there the courtyard armed men scattering left and right taking up defensive positions on the walls or hurrying out under the wide arch of the main entrance and in through that entrance a mist came creeping but such a mist in the valleys and coastal villages it wouldnt be too extraordinary but up here in the high mountains rolling in off the plateau the mist seemed concentrated in front of le manse madonie a dense white bank of mist writhing at the high wall and as anthony gasped his astonishment an eerie howl came echoing out of the mist the inhuman ululating cry of a beast but in no way mournful and in every way threatening radu anthony whispered a dog mario shrugged no anthony turned on him grabbed him again a wolf a wolf up here on the madonie the wolf anthony gasped and quickly pulled himself together you he snapped you stay with me and if youre not already armed do it now orders to the rest of them anything that moves and i do mean anything shoot it especially if they seea big dog go tell them then come back here and mario is the chopper fuelled yes the other answered but as he left radu anthony breathed again then leaning on his balcony feeling suddenly weak in all his limbs he anxiously scanned the courtyard and the ocean of mist beyond and his eyes were like crimson marbles rolling in the orbits of his skull out on the plateau in radus mist harry and the doglord were on the far side of a clump of boulders your mist has its disadvantages radu the necroscope said they cant see us but neither can we see them sunside of the barrier mountains in my own world i used it as cover the doglord coughed here i use it differently to inspire fear when the ferenczy sees it and when he hears this he laid back his head and howled at the full moon hanging low on the horizon and harry stepped back a pace then he will know what is what but i have discovered a weird thing that what i did in life i do with greater brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii efficiency in death because in life there were die limitations of the flesh air to be breathed and a body to be fuelled lest it fail through exhaustion but in death there are no limitsexcept that you impose them necroscope hahr cocking his head on one side he let his lantern gaze light on harry ah but without you there would be nothing at all i suppose i must be thankful well so be it now i drive my mist in through that archway he called the mist up from the dry earth let it roll from his bodys pores and loping towards the vague white blur of le manse madonies lights drove it before him the men outside the walls were engulfed in it it rolled over them into the courtyard piled in a swirling drift against the manse itself and now said radu quivering and leaning forward as if drawn by a magnet i go to ravage among them he dumped heavy sausage bags one from each shoulder terenczys the doglord snarled the first and worst of my enemies wait harry told him we have things to do you canravage later if you must and be careful with those bags that stuff is dangerous dangerous that wasnt the half of it the necroscope had stolen it right out of the czechoslovakian plant that manufactured it a single stray shot could set it off a thought that the werewolf read clearly in harrys mind so for now harry continued first things first thats if we dont want anyone to walk away from this i agree radu barked straightening from his crouch no one is to walk away from it and any who run i shall be behind them hows the mist coming the necroscope heard himself say it thought about it blinked and shook his head as if to clear it good grief he wasnt only accepting all this he was actually getting used to it the courtyard is filled with my mist radu growled then let s go said harry he made to pick up the sausage bags but radu beat him to them you do your part necroscope and i shall do mine they emerged from the mobius continuum in a corner of the courtyard and radu quickly sniffed out what harry was looking for as he was finishing up the job two armed thralls came at a run calling to each other through the mist and ran right into radu the speed the savage efficiency of the doglord as he dealt with them was incredible and terrifying to watch but harry quickly turned away the sound of it was enough mercifully they were sounds that were lost in the general confusion and finally thats it said the necroscope their transport is useless to them theyre stuck here trapped by now most of them will be out here and the interior of le manse madonie will be empty thats how it was last time anyway give me the bags radu read what was in his mind said what about me stay clear of the place harry answered theres a rocky outcrop in that direction he pointed wait for me there and take this with you he handed him a transmitter if you see a vehicle or vehicles on the move press the buttons till you get the right one another of your modern toys i hate them harry showed him a mental picture of what this modern toy would do and radu grunted his reluctant appreciation and if something happens to you then it happens to you too he conjured a door and took radu back out onto the plateau watched him lope away into the thinning mist and without pause returned to le manse madonie to the coordinates of a forbidden location in the very bowels of the place the cavern of the pit the spotlights lanced down illuminating the throat of that ominous shaft the electrified exit was barred the alarm clamoured high on the wall except for a cloud of red vapour drifting over the pit nothing moved the cavern seemed still safe harry checked again then made an exit through his door which he hadnt collapsed he had another use for some of his plastic that he hadnt wanted the doglord to know about but on a count of ten he was back again carrying just one of the sausage bags the weird red cloud over the pit was denser now lured by the ventilation system it was drifting towards the airducts whatever the stuff was harry was well away from it but as he moulded plastic twenty pounds of plastic into a wide crack in the wall necroscope and harry gave a massive start rl is that you damn you nearly scared the life out of me you mean like you is scaring me necroscope rl stevenson jamieson came back what im scaring you harry didnt understand man you has enemies all around you a million of em i what harry fell into a crouch scanned the cavern all around nothing rl your obi must be playing tricks on you theres no one here hell no rl insisted my obis just fine harry and theres moren i can even calclate butbut theys all the same one it was quite beyond harry but ok rl be looking out for them whatever they are and he finished packing the plastic into brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol the wall but as he stuck the timer and detonator into the explosive mass harry said another voice is that what i think it is and if so do you know what it vfill do down there it was j humphrey jackson jr humph to his mends the american who had built the francezci treasure vault in another part of the underground system a man they had murdered for his efforts i know what it will do humph harry said i shouldnt think youd have any complaints about that not as long as youre out of there when it happens necroscope humph said but do you really know what youre doing how do you mean mean this is sicily and these mountains are as shaky as a lightningstruck tree hell i even warned the francezci brothers they shouldnt do any blasting down there but in my day well we had nothing like that stuff i want to reduce this place to rubble and destroy whats in that pit harry said dispassionately i am with you humph said i just thought maybe i should you know point out that were on a faultline here this part of the med is volcanic from here across to etna and due north into italy then west through the peloponnese to the greek islands one big lightningflash of a fault oh you wont be setting anything really big off but i think you ii do a lot more damage than just fitting in a hole good harry said and set the timer for two minutes now i have to be out of here have fun humph you too said the other as harry conjured a door and left but he and humph didnt know the half of it couldnt know for instance that anthony francezci had also boobytrapped the treasure vault and other rooms and junctions in the tunnel system and now from the balcony of his private rooms he and the corpselike mario were watching the madness that was going on at the arched entrance to the courtyard and on the plateau searchlight beams were sweeping the plateau diffused by radiis dispersing mist they found nothing yet when anthony had ordered a land rover out onto the rough terrain just a minute agothe vehicle had travelled maybe forty yards beyond the archway before it blew itself to pieces in a searing flash of light that was still fading on his retinas and now the men on and outside the walls were firing at nothing blazing away with fire and steel cutting holes in the swirling mist did something hit the land rover or was it sabotaged marios slit of a mouth hung open sabotage anthonys face was a mad white mask sabotage the last time this bastard was here that was sabotage he is here came a desperate cry in anthonys mind he is down here under le manse madonie or he was just a moment ago angelo angelo are you sure yes yes i am sure and i know what he did goodbye my anthony goodbye my dear sweet tooonnnnyyyyy two more vehicles went speeding out under the archway but they got no further than the land rover hot twisted metal shot aloft and fire lanced the night we cant fight this anthony snarled fuck theres nothing to fight hunched over he ran inside yanked open a drawer in his desk and pressed a button in six different locations some deep and others not so deep under his feet under le manse madonie timers started counting off the seconds two minutes anthonys face cracked open in an uncontrollable grin snarl something his gums spurted blood as teeth like knifes sliced up through them his tongue seemed to unwind endlessly from his throat do you think he choked on that fantastic snake of a tonguei mean do you think that we canthat we can make the chopper in justin just two minutes mario mario ran for the helicopter of course but also away from anthony out of his rooms down the great staircase and out into the courtyard and his master came flowing and floating collapsing and reforming laughing and loping behind him harry emerged from the mobius continuum near the rocky outcrop where radu came running to meet him all done necroscope i think so harry nodded but well see better from up there they ran back to the rocks and radu sprang to the summit in two bounds harry climbed looked up saw the doglords great paw reaching down for him and his lantern eyes watching his every move allies for the moment harry radu growled harry took the preferred paw and the doglord pulled him up all the lights blazed in le manse madonie weapons blazed too uselessly headlights swept the plateau as another vehicle the francezcis stretch limo glided out under the archway the doglord grunted and pressed the last but one button on the necroscopes remote and the cars roof blew off and its sides ruptured as the blast expanded into a red and yellow fireball then a lone wheel went bounding and a bent axle turned lazily in the updraught it was a scene in slowmotion which suddenly speeded up scarred metal rained to earth leaving other scraps burning where they drifted on high harry nodded and glanced at his watch i dont know how much necroscope the lost yean vol ii brian lumley well see of this he said maybe nothing of the actual bang but its due just aboutnow then very faintly the ground trembled underfoot a section of le manse madonies courtyard wall buckled and fell dust fountained up from a jagged crack that suddenly appeared in the earth zigzagging like a bite from rim to rim of the high promontory and encompassing the sprawling villa and its walls lights dimmed went out and cries of alarm came drifting from antlike figures staggering atop the walls and damn harry said it looks like humph was wrong but then the dust jets geysered higher yet and the crack widened as yet more detonations mysterious this time were felt underfoot get her up anthony mouthed as mario gunned the helicopters engine willing her to lift off the machine twitched bumped skittered and began to lift as the engines whine climbed up and up and anthony frothed and foamed where his rubbery tentacle fingers couldnt fasten his seatbelt then the walls of le manse madonie were falling away but they were falling faster than the chopper was lifting literally falling and the entire francezciferenczy empire going with them crumbling from the face of the great cliff anthony laughed and laughed his flesh rippling his face transforming and mario leaned away from him choking where he fought to control the aircraft but she was lifting yes gaining elevation even as le manse madonie lost it and slid groaning into the ravine and a quartermile away on the roof of the rocky outcrop radu and harry saw the choppers lights and heard the accelerating whup whup whup of its rotors the other brother harry said grimly you can bet your life or you cant that its him the last button radu time to press it the effect was extraordinarily dramatic like a giant fan cut loose the complete rotor assembly blew off shot into the night sky trailing sparks and the body of the machine was gutted a black shape disintegrating in the fireball that consumed it and the blast that reduced it and its vampire passengers to the basic elements of plastic and metal and flesh indistinguishable one from the other where le manse madonie had stood there was now the rim of a cliff fresh and raw and scraps of debris still floating on the billowing air of the ferenczy dynasty nothing remained except a few antlike figures thralls and a lieutenant or two stumbling in their dazed panicflight across the plateau and now i ravage radu growled harry thought who better and said while i have other things to do the drakuls i should be there radu was uncertain no harry answered best if youclean up here radu nodded his great shaggy head i have faith in you of a sort and he urged do it for me necroscope tm afraid not harry told him im doing it for someone else a whole lot of someone elses dont forget to come back for me said radu and then the inevitable threat remember theres always bonnie jean oh i havent forgotten said harry in a certain way with a certain look then he was gone and radu went to ravage midnight was two hours past in the socalled drakesh monastery on the tingri plateau yet still daham drakesh held back despite that he had read the deathcries of his lieutenant singra singh across all the miles between and despite knowledge of a new regime at the xigaze garrison and the fact that he could be visited and investigated at any time still he held back his creatures were not yet waxed his many children in the old walled city were as yet infants drawing blood from flameeyed vampirized mothers his monastery was still the safest place in the world especially a world primed to burst into flame at the touch of a button drakesh had planned to press that button still planned to do so but yet hoped that the task force at xigaze would hold off a little longer if he was forced to flee this place on his own to leave his children and waxing warriors behind he could not doubt but that they would be destroyed all laid to waste and he would have to start again without advantage in a world likewise laid to waste also it could be true that the special forces at xigaze were in fact there to put down tibetan insurrection and that drakesh and his project had little or nothing to do with their current deployment and what a folly that would be to abandon his works and initiate armageddon out of an illfounded sense of insecurity on the other hand he could always preempt matters press the button anyway and blow central london moscow and chungking to hell which might do the trick at that china would doubtless discover new priorities and deploy her forces elsewhere thus the high priest of the sect was torn two ways where he paced the floors of his apartment pondered his options and waited on word from his familiar albino bats but for the necroscope harry keogh there was only one option one objective as he exited from the mobius continuum at the only coordinate he was absolutely certain of zahanines snowedin car where he had left it in the lee of a cluster of rocks on the frozen brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii plateau a mile from the drakesh monastery almost entirely buried in a drift now with only its rearend free where it stood at an angle with its trunk to the leaning boulders the car formed a hump of snow entirely in keeping with the terrain but knowing what was under the hump a modern motor vehicle where never such a thing was seen before and knowing who sat with her back to the fender a black girl in modern western clothing equally alien to these parts the necroscope felt the strangeness of it like a scene from some weird fantasy the large trunk was open a soft bed of snow lay within harry picked the girl up and put her inside she was solid in his arms like an icesculpture then he got in with her and yanked down on the cover from the inside until the frozen hinges gave way and the cover crunched most of the way shut and now for the real miracle scrambling over the seats to the front harry found the keys in the ignition where hed left them using the cigarette lighter salvaged from auld johns place to warm the frozen barrel finally he tried turning the key and even harry was surprised when the engine gave a muffled cough caught and began to tick over the cars nose was way under the snow but it was soft fluffy stuff thered be plenty of air down there also the radiator was very likely full of antifreeze said zahanine startling him in the winter in edinburgh i never took chances always used twice the recommended dose and then straight to the point whats on your mind necroscope getting the accelerator pedal working jamming it in a fast tickover and turning on the heater harry told her and as the car and the dead girl warmed up a little zahanine told him one or two things too for she had been here a while now and shed talked to the local dead of which the drakesh monastery was responsible for more than its fair share now the necroscope could talk to them too and he did talked to the original inhabitants of the forbidden city about the plague that had taken them a hundred years ago and how drakesh had used them and used them up in building his monastery talked to a certain wouldhavebeen initiate a boy the necroscope had once seen in a precognitive vision tramping the white waste to the monastery in the company of six of the sects belljingling acolytes a mere youth crushed like an orange for its juice to fuel the vampire appetite of the high priest daham drakesh and talked to others who knew the innermost secrets of that nightmarish temple until he knew those secrets too and until he knew their coordinates and even when he thought he was through there were others waiting to talk to him major chang lun for instance speaking from the bottom of a ravine near xigaze where he and his mangled driver were friends now forever lying frozen and broken in the tangle of wreckage that had been their snowcat so that finally all the pieces of this last corner of the jigsaw puzzle came together and harry could see the whole picture except for one detail one last piece which would remain missing until he fixed it in place and need your help he told zahanine and major chang lun against the drakuls zahanine was eager against their master the necroscope answered against him and his charnel house that entire temple of blood then youve got it harry she told him let me know what you want and its yours and chang lun was in complete agreement harry explained what he would do and finished by saying i want to drive him to the limit panic him into action he is a madman chang lun said or teetering on the edge at least a megalomaniac yes but even so how can you make him do a thing like that i probably cant but you can and again harry explained his meaning hes on the edge you said so why not push him right over i would very much like him to do it himself do it to himselfbut if not then youll be there to finish it and if i should fail or something should go wrong nothing will go wrong and i know its going to work for ive seen it its just waiting to happen there in my future or as it now seems in all our futures what will be has been except we dont have futures said zahanine of herself and chang lun and so nothing to lose so lets do it and as coincidence would have it at the vampire monastery daham drakeshs albino familiars reported back to him that a large contingent of military vehicles at xigaze had commenced forming up in his direction they were coming by night doubtless to surprise him well surprise was on his side they would be in radio contact with each other and with the garrison of course and the garrison with red china and if anything were to happen in the outside world more specifically chungking they might yet be diverted if they werentthen drakesh would let the soldiers into the monastery but of necessity their vehicles and most of their firepower must stay outside and in the monastery his bats would fight of course likewise his priests fight with the strength of vampires and win but even if they lost drakesh would not lose there were refuges in the outside world where he would be welcome where he could start again as the planet devolved into chaos and if he won then he would stay here and finish his work with brian lumley little or no threat of outside interference indeed tibet would be the last bastion of mainly radiationfree airbreathing man and the first whole nation with a new ideology vampirism enough they had forced his hand hurrying through the monastery issuing orders as he went drakesh climbed to the transmitter room in the hollowed dome of the skull and found major chang lun his old enemy waiting for him there where harry keogh had left him at a little after pm gmt the american air force base at greenham common was a quiet place it was a weekday and people had to work in the morning security and other duty posts were filled of course but the bombproof underground storage facilities might just as well have been tombs which would make the necroscope a ghost where he emerged from the mobius continuum at a coordinate remembered from his one previous visit a short mobius jump took him into the container with the combination safe he kneeled frowned at the knurled numbered knob and said harry this is it but he wasnt talking to himself and harry houdini answered ok i see it but now i need to feel it through your fingers the necroscope blanked his mind let the other harry take over felt his fingers thrill to the weird magic of houdinis entirely different talent the knob twirled this way and that spinning through a seemingly endless sequence of combinations but to the dead magician it was as easy as turning a key in a lock when a final sharp click sounded harrys hand left the knob to yank on the safes handle and the door sprang open damn youre good the necroscope said but houdini only chuckled tell that to my agent the next time you stop by his way he answered harry took the harmlesslooking receiver and antenna from the safe made a second short jump into the container with the bomb on its trolley but the floor of the container was wired and as it took his weight alarms were triggered as the first distant sirens started to sound he placed the receiver on the trolley conjured another door and wheeled the entire contraption through it and right out of there and out of this universe taking his deadly cargo with him he followed the instantaneous mbius route to zahanine while in daham drakeshs transmitter room chang lun was a lumpish broken scarecrow caricature of the man drakesh had known and killed but he was unmistakably chang lun splintered bones stuck out of his torn dishevelled uniform necroscope the lost years vol ii sagging to the right from a crushed spine he threatened to crumple to the floor his left shoulder hung awkwardly askew but his right arm and hand seemed to be in good working order especially the hand and the pistol that followed drakeshs every move not that the last drakul was moving much spreadeagled to the wall his bloodred eyes bugged and his split tongue wriggled like a crippled snake uselessly in his gaping mouth but chang lun stood between drakesh and the transmitters console and as drakesh gradually recovered from his shock he knew he would have to move die major in order to finalize his plan but what would he be moving a corpse a figment of his imagination his conscience ridiculous he had no conscience and whatever this thing was it was real it was happening facing him chang lun faced a dilemma of his own he was here to drive drakesh over the edge but the master of the monastery was already past that point he wanted to press the button to press it twice once to arm his bombs and once again to detonate them but chang lun couldnt let him not until the necroscope gave him the word harry where are you chang luns dead thoughts went out and the great majority were breathless keeping the psychic aether clear right here harry answered where at that very moment he and zahanine wheeled the trolley out through a mobius door into the bowels of the monastery indeed into the temple of selfflagellation with its bloody trough and terrible sluices none of drakeshs people were there now but from his conversations with expriests and initiates the necroscope knew well enough where he was and it was as good or bad a place as any drakesh was a hugely talented telepath while he couldnt intercept or read the incorporeal thoughts of the dead or the necroscopes thoughts while he was using that medium still he sensed that something some form of communication was happening here and putting out a vampire probe he at once found a second intruder harry keogh in the guts of the monastery and his crazed mind immediately flew to the wrong conclusion or a conclusion that was only partright he was under attack his plan was known they would stop him destroy the monastery his works even daham drakesh himself he couldnt be sure who they were but it was definitely time to give them something else to worry about advancing on the dead man his clawlike hands and arms elongated towards him and the pistol in major chang luns dead hand went click click click the weapon was empty drakesh swept chang lun aside like a tailors manikin the necroscope the lost years vol ii brian lumley majors broken spine collapsed his legs gave way and he crumpled to the cold stone floor and drakesh stabbed at the button onceand paused blinked reconsidered as he saw what a smile transforming chang luns face alive the chinese major would be in agony dead he wouldnt be feeling anything but he was it was a smile of satisfaction yes of triumph and again drakeshs probe went out to the necroscope and read and saw what was on his mind instantly he snatched his skeletal hand from the console staggered turned and ran out of the room up the last flight of stone steps to the bald dome of the skull carved in the mountainside ran like the grotesque parasite he was from a terror beyond anything he could ever dream to conjure from a man who called up dead men from their graves to enact their own vengeance and high on the moonlit dome of the skull he threw up his spindly arms to the night and willed metamorphosis that greatest of all the skills of the vampire lords at which every drakul before him had been pastmaster while in the room of the transmitter chang lun still had a job to do and dragging himself inch by inch back across the floor he somehow managed to heave his wreck of a body upright at the console and necroscope he said im too badly broken i cant keep it together i can still do it but dont wait too long thats ok harry answered for by now he had told zahanine what she must do on a count of five major and thanks and he conjured a door and stepped through itand immediately removed himself far from the monastery a little over two miles to a spot close to zahanines car then harry knew what was coming with no time to spare he dug through the crusty snow and buried himself in the softer stuff beneath and in the monastery zahanine extended the aerial and made the connection and buckling at the knees chang lun fell facedown on the fatal button daham drakesh flew like some monstrous manlizard like primal pteranodon he spiralled up up into the night sky above the monastery and his retinue of pinkeyed familiars with him or more properly he flew like an illfated moth and only for a single instant recognized his fate when the biggest candle in the world burst into flame directly beneath him a candle brilliant as the solar orb itself made of the same deadly energy it was a mighty merciful singeing at first the necroscope was surprised it seemed such a small thing a small beginning a shudder felt or sensed deep down under the snow in the earth and then a moment of stunned silence following which it became something else the crust of snow overhead was ripped away then the softer stuff peeling in layers and finally harry himself snatched up and whirled head over heels like a leaf in a gale and hurled down in the drift that had piled against zahanines car and overhead a wind a storm a hurricane the crackling of massive bursts of electricity a tracery of electrical fires racing across the sky the sky itself turning dirtyred and an awesome rumbling that grew louder and louder until it was deafening in short it was his vision all over again and briefly snatches from nostradamuss quatrains passed before his minds eye the means is in the sun as it transpireswith numbers and with solar heat and gravecold with mordant acids and his friends in low society most of it had meaning but the mordant acids were yet to be explained when the ground stopped shaking harry sat up in the hole his hurtling body had made in the snow he looked across a dirtygrey desolation at a low flattopped mushroom cloud bulging upwards and still expanding he looked at it for long moments and then no more because for all that the necroscope had seen in his short life still there were some things that were just too terrible to contemplate and this was one of them another was the squadron of red chinese bombers that was passing overhead releasing their napalm payload some distance away on the forbidden walled city which was one job at least that harry wouldnt have to deal with napalmwas this the mordant acid he wondered shaken harry conjured a door and almost fell through it and in the eternal peace and quiet of the m bius continuum in his own time he went back to sicily the madonie and the doglord radu lykan radu had done with ravaging there was nothing left to ravage and he gave his assurance that the plateau of the madonie was clean ive played my part harry told him time now to fulfil your end of our agreement bonnie jean the doglord growled she is a treacherous bitch we dont need her we doesnt come into it harry said there is no you and t there never can be the way i remember it you gave your word he was standing close to radu would have to be if he wanted to convey him via the mobius continuum and you trust the word of a lord of the wamphyri radu caught brian lumley harrys jacket his shoulder and drew him closer still do i have a choice you could try searching my lair for her on your own and with luck you might even find her in time before what before my creature is up and about i left her as a tidbit to break his long long fast harry took a gasping breath in which case it could be too late even now oh hahaha the doglords barking laugh and then his snarled no for my warrior needs me to bring him forth in the mbbius continuum harry said gritting his teeth i could transport you instantaneously to the other side of the world into brilliant sunlight and if i thought you would radu answered i could grip your scrawny neck and squeeze your head off harry looked into his lantern gaze then looked away let himself cool off and finally youll take me to bonnie jean such was my word radu nodded his grinning wolfs head but first you must take me to my redoubt and there was nothing else for it harry knew the precise coordinates but so did radu as they emerged at the foot of his dais the doglord beat harry to it reached down and took up bjs crossbow bent it out of shape and tossed it aside one of us might be tempted to cheat he explained knowingly and then they went to b j radu led the way loping like a wolf but upright leaning forward once long ago he said blinking his feral eyes oh centuries ago i had just such a hollow place a crag in moldavia i built it so as to be able to destroy it utterly in the event i must evacuate this place is very much the same a bonfire down here would crack these columns bring down the rotten walls floors ceilings destroy all evidence of my ever having been here my plan for continuity longevity is synonymous with anonymity what continuity said harry hard on radus heels through the labyrinth i see no continuity not any longer youve fulfilled your ambition to outlive all your enemies radu paused a moment to look back at him all but one as it now appears he said and before harry could answer he turned and loped on closer to their destination in a very dark place radu paused again his eyes lit the walls of the narrow passage time you were rid of your belt and munitions necroscope he said my trust goes only so far necmscope the lost yean vol ii harry released the belt let it fall mine too he said and in a little while they were there at the place of the huge stone vat that housed radus warrior there was the sound of rushing water the dim sheen of water falling from on high also from somewhere far below the splash and gurgle of a subterranean sump apart from that it was a dim smoky place the torches in the base of the stone vat had long since burned out but one last torch stood fresh and unlit in its sconce on the wall of the cave facing the massive stone staves of the vat we could use a little light harry said uncertainly by all means radu growled low in his wolfs throat i gave my word that you would see her at least one more time or one last time and with his heart thudding harry fumbled the cigarette lighter from his pocket and brought the torch flaring to light and sure enough bj was there and alive but only just she was hanging by her feet which were caught fast in a noose the rope was wrapped around a knob of rock and tied off bjs head hung level with the rim of a broad zigzagging crevasse a crack in the floor that might go down forever for all harry knew but at least as far as the underground lake bj was naked unconscious blood had dried on her arms which were hanging limply into the chasm and more blood caked her hair as she turned slowly on the rope harry saw the gash in her back where the doglord had torn her leech right out of her spine his legs numb he stumbled towards her went to his knees from which position he saw another rope round her neck a long length of rope its other end was tied around a boulder that must weigh at least two hundredweights the tenth part of a ton balanced at the edge of the crevice radu stood grinning beside the boulder and harry knew what he would do and when he would do it right now no he choked the word out didnt i tell you that what was in her could be taken out radu growled so it has been and now say goodbye to her and as the necroscopes jaw fell open as he reached out his arms uselessly spastically towards bj radu gave a grunt and a heave and rolled the great rock from the rim it fell the rope uncoiled thirtyodd feet of rope and the boulder hurtling faster and faster and then that sound that harry knew he would hear for ever and ever but not the sight of it for he had closed his eyes but the doglord only laughed and said well now you can say goodbye to her indeed youre the only one who can bastard thing harry gasped whispered choked his face a frozen grimace eyes tightly closed you lousy bastard wolfthing why why did you have toto radu came close caught him by the shoulder drew him up you brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii would have killed her anyway because she was wamphyri i did it because it was my right and she was treacherous in my world in our world there will be no room for traitors especially ladies of the wamphyri bastard thing harry said again limp in radus grasp i remember how it was the other told him when i was a man and lost loved ones for a little while it made me weak but then it made me strong right now you are weak but shall make you strong you are a dead thing harry told him a dead soulless thing go back down into death radu ah no i think not said the other holding the necroscope closer still you guarded your mind well harry but little by little i prised it open i have seen your greatest fear you dont know if you can put me down apparently you cant then youll rot harry told him because youre a dead thing yours is just a semblance of life cling to it while you may until your flesh is seething and all your bones separating at the joints but it would be easier to go down now radu look at me said radu and his voice was hypnotic now harry must open his eyes must look into the feral yellow gaze with its twin scarlet cores must swim in the fires burning in the centre of radus mind and the doglord said i dreamed of a man with two faces one who would be with me when i triumphed over death you merely dreamed of metempsychosis the necroscopes voice was faint now faltering ii have already known it ive had two faces i dont want a third but you have no choice radu said as his eyes expanded in harrys sight and in his mind i stand on your threshold and i will enter of my own free will no way james anderson told him his mental gaze a furnace to match radus own and to heel great dog said franz anton mesmer the necroscopes friends in low society who were far more adept in death than ever they had been in life their combined hypnotic power sliced into the doglords like hot knives through butter radu pushed harry away to arms length snarled what and there was sudden movement a surging of liquids a mewling of some vast thing in terrible agony from behind him one of the stone staves of the great vat cracked buckled outwards slopped resin others followed suit and a wave of resin came gurgling over the high rim its stench sickening where it flooded the cave and flowed sluggishly over the jagged lip of the chasm radus warrior creature had waxed at last what the doglord said again and was knocked from his feet as more staves collapsed and a second wave of resin drenched him threatening to carry him into the depths releasing harry in order to save himself radu pushed him away shaking his head to clear it harry backed off got to his feet stumblingly retreated to the wall of the cave and when radus feral glare had faded in his eyes and his mind he took in the entire scene at a glance that black lumpish misshapen wolfthing emerging flopping in agony through the shattering staves from its womb of stinking liquids living corruption in a shape from a madmans worst dreams vast and vastly diseased even as its maker himself with a plague six hundred years old its sick red saucer eyes pleaded with the doglord but it was the necroscope who put it out of its agony the creature and its father both the blazing torch was to hand hissing spitting and flaring brilliantly in the flow of gases from the vat harry need only wrench it from its sconce and toss it in a lazy arc he conjured a door and was thrust through it by a huge hot hand a jump took him to the far end of the tunnel only to witness a roaring yellow fireball expanding along it in his direction another jump to radus sarcophagus behind which he had deposited his second sausage bag of high explosives which now he would use but not until he had seen to bonnie jean if that were at all possible and one last long howl ringing in harrys mind and a picture of the doglord blazing bright as a star gloriously as indeed he had seen himself in his visions of the future except as he remembered now too late and only too well the future was ever an unknown quantity ever a devious thing certain members of the teeming dead talked made their points argued their arguments but it was nostradamus who won could not knout he said could only say as i saw and saw only what i was allowed to see but it appears that i showed too much if the necroscope works it all out which he will given time maybe he wont want to go on and were all agreed he must and if he tries to change what will be he can only damage himself wherefore you must limit the damage now harder still you must eliminate it from your own minds too for from now on you can never so much as hint of it and the ones he spoke to bj mary keogh franz anton mesmer keenan gormley james anderson and any and all of the great majority who had played their parts in the thing they all agreed epilogue there was no sign of any commotion bj was or had been after all a fledgling lady with her leech gone her flesh had simply succumbed and the doglord he was a smoking cindered black thing still dumbstruck from the realization of his true his final death crumbling underfoot like charcoal he made no protest when harry separated his dust and brushed him into diverse corners and crevices in the burnedout cave of the warrior creature that thing had been burning still and its stench was terrible doomed from the day of its conception in this place six hundred years ago it was no threat bj still hung there miraculously though the rope was charred it hadnt burned right through and after several hazardous trialanderror mobius jumps into mainly unknown depths the necroscope found her head oddly or perhaps not from the one glance he was able to give her face without completely breaking down she looked at peace something b j could never be if shed survived for then she would be wamphyri harry took her remains wrapped in a blanket up onto the roof of the mountain under the moon and stars where she surprised him by saying so what they told me is true and didn t i always know you were the strange one strange and deep oh it was in your eyes right from the beginning and i thought i was the beguiler tou were he told her but i loved you for you not for your lying eyes do you forgive me for that for in the end as you see i went against radu for you harry guarded his thoughts because now in his turn he too must lie but a white lie for there was no way of telling even now whether she spoke the truth or not had she in fact turned against the dog brian lumley necroscope the lost years vol ii lord for harry or to possess harry she would have been a lady after all terrible and possessive and territorial these mountains had been hers for two hundred years it would be hard to turn them over to radu and as for turning the necroscope overwho could say but he wanted to believe her anyway and so said theres nothing to forgive i feel your warmth she said thoughtfully little wonder they love you too strange that such warmth lies behind those cold cold eyes and in that cold cold mind or maybe not so strange you walk with death which has to be a cold path and like a fool i once asked you for your thoughts on life harry was choked now but he didnt want b j to see him like that and so he changed the subject youre a brave one he said sometimes it takes a long time toto get used to the idea but they welcomed me she explained the teeming dead for now theyve welcomed me anyway though i fancy the what the novelty may soon wear off your mother welcomed me and your friends you have a great many harry a great majority so for the moment im at peace with them im glad said harry but if i want to keep it that way i cant stay here bj continued so tell mehave you thought what to do with me do with you harrys emotions were on the boil now they threatened to spill over dont she told him tremulously youll only set me going too he fought it down said where do you want to go and she showed him a far cold golden place but one that was entirely in keeping he took her there but alive he could only accompany her so far and at the end he spilled her body gently through his door and let it drift to earth but not to earth then suddenly furious harry returned to radus lair where he separated his deadly plastic set fuses and stood off across the gorge to watch the rotten rock of the uppermost dome of the mountain crumple down into itself and it was done now he could look up at the moon again see bj there and say his last goodbye was ever a moonchild she told him from afar and so in a way ive returned to my beginnings you too harry you must return to yours and forget me but how could i ever forget you he husked and couldnt stop the tears that came and kept coming ah see bj said that was how you beat me and how you beat radu and i was right the cold in you is only the way you are destined to walk along a cold cold path but you inside youre burning and those tears are like some mordant acid that burns more on the inside than outwhich we cant allow what harry said but he knew what with numbers and with solar heat and gravecold with mordant acids and his friends in low society go home harry b j told him none of this ever happened only your search for brenda and your child was real yet at the same time nothing has been lost only your wife and child and whether you find them or not you will recover and you will go on bj dont do it said harry but she they had to and before he could erect his shields together all three of them bj james anderson and franz anton mesmer snapped their magical fingers in the necroscopes mind returning from edinburgh ben trask reported directly to darcy clarke seating himself tiredly in front of darcys desk in his office trask shrugged his shoulders and said nothing he had nothing to do with any of it that unholy mess at greenham common nothing events in tibet sicily forget it harry wasnt involved reports of explosions in the cairngorms and missing people left right and centre a complete blank i approached it all obliquely of course but he never even twitched the only thing he was interested in and then not too interested not any longer was to ask me if wed heard anything of his wife and child i told him no nothing in other words it was nothing all round but on second thought oh ben straightened up a little there is one thing darcy looked at him something good ben grinned it rather depends on how you look at it he said at the time i didnt think so but when it was time for me to leave he asked me if id like a lift a lift darcy frowned then sat up straighter himself and laughed out loud what along the mobius route ben nodded it looks like youre off the hook he said hes not afraid to talk about it any more or even to do it but i was i came back by train it was a weight off darcys mind so what do you think he said could we perhaps ask him if the branch trask shook his head sighed i didnt get the warmest possible reception no i suggest you leave it out for now he wont be coming back in a while and they would leave it out for almost four more years brian lumley but at the next full moon harry was on the riverbank talking to his ma spring she said lean feel it in the air spring when a young mans fancy turns to springcleaning said harry theres still a lot i can do to the house god more than four years and it doesnt feel like ive done anything much youd be surprised she said hmmm i said im always surprised she corrected herself at the way time flies i mean even down here and tempus fuckit thought harry perverting the latin but keeping the thought to himself four years yes it wasit was like they were lost years but of course they werent and in a little while when his ma started pestering him about catching a cold again he walked back to the house under the moon in inverdruie auld john nursed an arm that didnt seem to want to heal and stood under that same moon looking up at the high cairngorms for the first time in his life he felt old and he really was old time had caught up with john as if some deadly catalyst had been added to his blood to make it congeal or as if something had gone out of him out of his life and he believed he knew what it was it was the howling he would never again hear in his mind the fever that was fled out of his veins for the auld wolf was gone as if hed never been and that barking was only a dog out with his master running for the joy of it in the streaming moonlight the end authors end note in part four chapter iii the seventieth quatrain from nostradamuss second century is authentic and coincidental naturally in the same chapter the hebrew cryptogram as used by numerologists is also authentic and the results of the necroscopes nostradamuss and darcy clarkes numbers are likewise coincidental of course my own lifelong interest in numbers the macabre and magical things in general isyet another happy coincidence brian lumley
