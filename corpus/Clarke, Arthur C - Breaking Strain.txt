breaking strain arthur c clarke originally published as thirty seconds thirty days grant was writing up the star queens log when he heard the cabin door opening behind him he didnt bother to look roundit was hardly necessary for there was only one other man aboard the ship but when nothing happened and when mcneil neither spoke nor came into the room the long silence finally roused grants curiosity and he swung the seat round in its gimbals mcneil was just standing in the doorway looking as if he had seen a ghost the trite metaphor flashed into grants mind instantly he did not know for a moment how near the truth it was in a sense mcneil had seen a ghostthe most terrifying of all ghosts his own whats the matter said grant angrily you sick or something the engineer shook his head grant noticed the little beads of sweat that broke away from his forehead and went glittering across the room on their perfectly straight trajectories his throat muscles moved but for a while no sound came it looked as though he was going to cry were done for he whispered at last oxygen reserves gone then he did cry he looked like a flabby doll slowly collapsing on itself he couldnt fall for there was no gravity so he just folded up in midair grant said nothing quite unconsciously he rammed his smoldering cigarette into the ash tray grinding it viciously until the last tiny spark had died already the air seemed to be thickening around him as the oldest terror of the spaceways gripped him by the throat he slowly loosed the elastic straps which while he was seated gave some illusion of weight and with an automatic skill launched himself toward the doorway mcneil did not offer to follow even making every allowance for the shock he had undergone grant felt that he was behaving very badly he gave the engineer an angry cuff as he passed and told him to snap out of it the hold was a large hemispherical room with a thick central column which carried the controls and cabling to the other half of the dumbbellshaped spaceship a hundred meters away it was packed with crates and boxes arranged in a surrealistic threedimensional array that made very few concessions to gravity but even if the cargo had suddenly vanished grant would scarcely have noticed he had eyes only for the big oxygen tank taller than himself which was bolted against the wall near the inner door of the airlock it was just as he had last seen it gleaming with aluminum paint and the metal sides still held the faint touch of coldness that gave the only hint of the contents all the piping seemed in perfect condition there was no sign of anything wrong apart from one minor detail the needle of the contents gauge lay mutely against the zero stop grant gazed at that silent symbol as a man in ancient london returning home one evening at the time of the plague might have stared at a rough cross newly scrawled upon his door then he banged half a dozen times on the glass in the futile hope that the needle had stuckthough he never really doubted its message news that is sufficiently bad somehow carries its own guarantee of truth only good reports need confirmation when grant got back to the control room mcneil was himself again a glance at the opened medicine chest showed the reason for the engineers rapid recovery he even assayed a faint attempt at humor it was a meteor he said they tell us a ship this size should get hit once a century we seem to have jumped the gun with ninetyfive years still to go but what about the alarms the air pressures normalhow could we have been holed we werent mcneil replied you know how the oxygen circulates nightside through the refrigerating coils to keep it liquid the meteor must have smashed them and the stuff simply boiled away grant was silent collecting his thoughts what had happened was seriousdeadly seriousbut it need not be fatal after an the voyage was more than three quarters over surely the regenerator can keep the air breathable even if it does get pretty thick he asked hopefully mcneil shook his head ive not worked it out in detail but i know the answer when the carbon dioxide is broken down and the free oxygen gets cycled back theres a loss of about ten per cent thats why we have to carry a reserve the spacesuits cried grant in sudden excitement what about their tanks he had spoken without thinking and the immediate realization of his mistake left him feeling worse than before we cant keep oxygen in themit would boil off in a few days theres enough compressed gas there for about thirty minutes merely long enough for you to get to the main tank in an emergency there must be a way outeven if we have to jettison cargo and run for it lets stop guessing and work out exactly where we are grant was as much angry as frightened he was angry with mcneil for breaking down he was angry with the designers of the ship for not having foreseen this godknewhowmanymilliontoone chance the deadline might be a couple of weeks away and a lot could happen before then the thought helped for a moment to keep his fears at arms length this was an emergency beyond doubt but it was one of those peculiarly protracted emergencies that seem to happen only in space there was plenty of time to thinkperhaps too much time grant strapped himself in the pilots seat and pulled out a writingpad lets get the facts right he said with artificial calmness weve got the air thats still circulating in the ship and we lose ten per cent of the oxygen every time it goes through the generator chuck me over the manual will you i can never remember how many cubic meters we use a day in saying that the star queen might expect to be hit by a meteor once every century mcneil had grossly but unavoidably oversimplified the problem for the answer depended on so many factors that three generations of statisticians had done little but lay down rules so vague that the insurance companies still shivered with apprehension when the great meteor showers went sweeping like a gale through the orbits of the inner worlds everything depends of course on what one means by the word meteor each lump of cosmic slag that reaches the surface of the earth has a million smaller brethren that perish utterly in the no mansland where the atmosphere has not quite ended and space has yet to beginthat ghostly region where the weird aurora sometimes walks by night these are the familiar shooting stars seldom larger than a pins head and these in turn are outnumbered a million fold again by particles too small to leave any visible trace of their dying as they drift down from the sky all of them the countless specks of dust the rare boulders and even the wandering mountains that earth encounters perhaps once every million yearsall of them are meteors for the purposes of spaceflight a meteor is only of interest if on penetrating the hull of a ship it leaves a hole large enough to be dangerous this is a matter of relative speeds as well as size tables have been prepared showing approximate collision times for various parts of the solar systemand for various sizes of meteors down to masses of a few milligrams that which had struck the star queen was a giant being nearly a centimeter across and weighing all of ten grams according to the table the waitingtime for collision with such a monster was of the order of ten to the ninth dayssay three million years the virtual certainty that such an occurrence would not happen again in the course of human history gave grant and mcneil very little consolation however things might have been worse the star queen was days on her orbit and had only still to go she was traveling as did all freighters on the long tangential ellipse kissing the orbits of earth and venus on opposite sides of the sun the fast liners could cut across from planet to planet at three times her speed and ten times her fuel consumptionbut she must plod along her predetermined track like a streetcar taking days more or less for each journey anything more unlike the earlytwentiethcentury idea of a spaceship than the star queen would be hard to imagine she consisted of two spheres one fifty and the other twenty meters in diameter joined by a cylinder about a hundred meters long the whole structure looked like a matchstickandplasticine model of a hydrogen atom crew cargo and controls were in the larger sphere while the smaller one held the atomic motors and wasto put it mildlyout of bounds to living matter the star queen had been built in space and could never have lifted herself even from the surface of the moon under full power her ion drive could produce an acceleration of a twentieth of a gravity which in an hour would give her all the velocity she needed to change from a satellite of the earth to one of venus hauling cargo up from the planets was the job of the powerful little chemical rockets in a month the tugs would be climbing up from venus to meet her but the star queen would not be stopping for there would be no one at the controls she would continue blindly on her orbit speeding past venus at miles a secondand five months later she would be back at the orbit of the earth though earth itself would then be far away it is surprising how long it takes to do a simple addition when your life depends on the answer grant ran down the short column of figures half a dozen times before he finally gave up hope that the total would change then he sat doodling nervously on the white plastic of the pilots desk with all possible economies he said we can last about twenty days that means well be ten days out of venus when his voice trailed off into silence ten days didnt sound muchbut it might just as well have been ten years grant thought sardonically of all the hack adventure writers who had used just this situation in their stories and radio serials in these circumstances according to the carboncopy expertsfew of whom had ever gone beyond the moonthere were three things that could happen the popular solutionwhich had become almost a clichйwas to turn the ship into a glorified greenhouse or a hydroponic farm and let photosynthesis do the rest alternatively one could perform prodigies of chemical or atomic engineeringexplained in tedious technical detailand build an oxygen manufacturing plant which would not only save your lifeand of course the heroinesbut also make you the owner of fabulously valuable patents the third or deus ex machina solution was the arrival of a convenient spaceship which happened to be matching your course and velocity exactly but that was fiction and things were different in real life although the first idea was sound in theory there wasnt even a packet of grass seed aboard the star queen as for feats of inventive engineering two menhowever brilliant and however desperate were not likely to improve in a few days on the work of scores of great industrial research organizations over a full century the spaceship that happened to be passing was almost by definition impossible even if other freighters had been coasting on the same elliptic pathand grant knew there were nonethen by the very laws that governed their movements they would always keep their original separations it was not quite impossible that a liner racing on its hyperbolic orbit might pass within a few hundred thousand kilometers of thembut at a speed so great that it would be as inaccessible as pluto if we threw out the cargo said mcneil at last would we have a chance of changing our orbit grant shook his head id hoped so he replied but it wont work we could reach venus in a week if we wishedbut wed have no fuel for braking and nothing from the planet could catch us as we went past not even a liner according to lloyds register venus has only a couple of freighters at the moment in any case it would be a practically impossible maneuver even if it could match our speed how would the rescue ship get back it would need about fifty kilometers a second for the whole job if we cant figure a way out said mcneil maybe someone on venus can wed better talk to them im going to grant replied as soon as ive decided what to say go and get the transmitter aligned will you he watched mcneil as he floated out of the room the engineer was probably going to give trouble in the days that lay ahead until now they had got on well enoughlike most stout men mcneil was goodnatured and easygoing but now grant realized that he lacked fiber he had become flabbyphysically and mentally living too long in space a buzzer sounded on the transmitter switchboard the parabolic mirror out on the hull was aimed at the gleaming arclamp of venus only ten million kilometers away and moving on an almost parallel path the threemillimeter waves from the ships transmitter would make the trip in little more than half a minute there was bitterness in the knowledge that they were only thirty seconds from safety the automatic monitor on venus gave its impersonal go ahead signal and grant began to talk steadily and he hoped quite dispassionately he gave a careful analysis of the situation and ended with a request for advice his fears concerning mcneil he left unspoken for one thing he knew that the engineer would be monitoring him at the transmitter as yet no one on venus would have heard the message even though the transmission timeag was over it would still be coiled up in the recorder spools but in a few minutes an unsuspecting signal officer would arrive to play it over he would have no idea of the bombshell that was about to burst triggering trains of sympathetic ripples on all the inhabited worlds as television and newssheet took up the refrain an accident in space has a dramatic quality that crowds all other items from the headlines until now grant had been too preoccupied with his own safety to give much thought to the cargo in his charge a sea captain of ancient times whose first thought was for his ship might have been shocked by this attitude grant however had reason on his side the star queen could never founder could never run upon uncharted rocks or pass silently as so many ships have passed forever from the knowledge of man she was safe whatever might befall her crew if she was undisturbed she would continue to retrace her orbit with such precision that men might set their calendars by her for centuries to come the cargo grant suddenly remembered was insured for over twenty million dollars there were not many goods valuable enough to be shipped from world to world and most of the crates in the hold were worth more than their weightor rather their massin gold perhaps some items might be useful in this emergency and grant went to the safe to find the loading schedule he was sorting the thin tough sheets when mcneil came back into the cabin ive been reducing the air pressure he said the hull shows some leaks that wouldnt have mattered in the usual way grant nodded absently as he passed a bundle of sheets over to mcneil heres our loading schedule i suggest we both run through it in case theres anything in the cargo that may help if it did nothing else he might have added it would at least give them something to occupy their minds as he ran down the long columns of numbered itemsa complete crosssection of interplanetary commercegrant found himself wondering what lay behind these inanimate symbols item book kilos gross he whistled as he noticed that it was a staffed item insured for a hundred thousand dollars and he suddenly remembered hearing on the radio that the hesperian museum had just bought a first edition seven pillars of wisdom a few sheets later was a very contrasting item miscellaneous books kilos no intrinsic value it had cost a small fortune to ship those books to venus yet they were of no intrinsic value grant let his imagination loose on the problem perhaps someone who was leaving earth forever was taking with him to a new world his most cherished treasuresthe dozen or so volumes that above all others had most shaped his mind item reels film that of course would be the neronian superepic while rome burns which had left earth just one jump ahead of the censor venus was waiting for it with considerable impatience medical supplies kilos case of cigars i kilo precision instruments kilos so the list went on each item was something rare or something which the industry and science of a younger civilization could not yet produce the cargo was sharply divided into two classesblatant luxury or sheer necessity there was little in between and there was nothing nothing at all which gave grant the slightest hope he did not see how it could have been otherwise but that did not prevent him from feeling a quite unreasonable disappointment the reply from venus when it came at last took nearly an hour to run through the recorder it was a questionnaire so detailed that grant wondered morosely if hed live long enough to answer it most of the queries were technical ones concerning the ship the experts on two planets were pooling their brains in the attempt to save the star queen and her cargo well what do you think of it grant asked mcneil when the other had finished running through the message he was watching the engineer carefully for any further sign of strain there was a long pause before mcneil spoke then he shrugged his shoulders and his first words were an echo of grants own thoughts it will certainly keep us busy i wont be able to do all these tests in under a day i can see what theyre driving at most of the time but some of the questions are just plain crazy grant had suspected that but said nothing as the other continued rate of hull leakagethats sensible enough but why should anyone want to know the efficiency of our radiation screening i think theyre trying to keep up our morale by pretending they have some bright ideasor else they want to keep us too busy to worry grant was relieved and yet annoyed by mcneils calmness relieved because he had been afraid of another scene and annoyed because mcneil was not fitting at all neatly into the mental category he had prepared for him was that first momentary lapse typical of the man or might it have happened to anyone grant to whom the world was very much a place of blacks and whites felt angry at being unable to decide whether mcneil was cowardly or courageous that he might be both was a possibility that never occurred to him there is a timelessness about spaceflight that is unmatched by any other experience of man even on the moon there are shadows that creep sluggishly from crag to crag as the sun makes its slow march across the sky earthward there is always the great clock of the spinning globe marking the hours with continents for hands but on a long voyage in a gyrostabilized ship the same patterns of sunlight lie unmoving on wall or floor as the chronometer ticks off its meaningless hours and days grant and mcneil had long since learned to regulate their lives accordingly in deep space they moved and thought with a leisureliness that would vanish quickly enough when a voyage was nearing its end and the time for braking maneuvers had arrived though they were now under sentence of death they continued along the wellworn grooves of habit every day grant carefully wrote up the log checked the ships position and carried out his various routine duties mcneil was also behaving normally as far as could be told though grant suspected that some of the technical maintenance was being carried out with a very light hand it was now three days since the meteor had struck for the last twentyfour hours earth and venus had been in conference and grant wondered when he would hear the result of their deliberations he did not believe that the finest technical brains in the solar system could save them now but it was hard to abandon hope when everything still seemed so normal and the air was still clean and fresh on the fourth day venus spoke again shorn of its technicalities the message was nothing more or less than a funeral oration grant and mcneil had been written off but they were given elaborate instructions concerning the safety of the cargo back on earth the astronomers were computing all the possible rescue orbits that might make contact with the star queen in the next few years there was even a chance that she might be reached from earth six or seven months later when she was back at aphelion but the maneuver could be carried out only by a fast liner with no payload and would cost a fortune in fuel mcneil vanished soon after this message came through at first grant was a little relieved if mcneil chose to look after himself that was his own affair besides there were various letters to write though the lastwillandtestament business could come later it was mcneils turn to prepare the evening meal a duty he enjoyed for he took good care of his stomach when the usual sounds from the galley were not forthcoming grant went in search of his crew he found mcneil lying in his bunk very much at peace with the universe hanging in the air beside him was a large metal crate which had been roughly forced open grant had no need to examine it closely to guess its contents a glance at mcneil was enough its a dirty shame said the engineer without a trace of embarrassment to suck this stuff up through a tube cant you put on some g so that we can drink it properly grant stared at him with angry contempt but mcneil returned his gaze unabashed oh dont be a sourpuss have some yourselfwhat does it matter now he pushed across a bottle and grant fielded it deftly as it floated by it was a fabulously valuable winehe remembered the consignment nowand the contents of that small crate must be worth thousands i dont think theres any need said grant severely to behave like a pigeven in these circumstances mcneil wasnt drunk yet he had only reached the brightly lighted anteroom of intoxication and had not lost all contact with the drab outer world i am prepared he said with great solemnity to listen to any good argument against my present course of actiona course which seems eminently sensible to me but youd better convince me quickly while im still amenable to reason he pressed the plastic bulb again and a purple jet shot into his mouth apart from the fact that youre stealing company property which will certainly be salvaged sooner or lateryou can hardly stay drunk for several weeks that said mcneil thoughtfully remains to be seen i dont think so retorted grant bracing himself against the wall he gave the crate a vicious shove that sent it flying through the open doorway as he dived after it and slammed the door he heard mcneil shout well of all the dirty tricks it would take the engineer some timeparticularly in his present conditionto unbuckle himself and follow grant steered the crate back to the hold and locked the door as there was never any need to lock the hold when the ship was in space mcneil wouldnt have a key for it himself and grant could hide the duplicate that was kept in the control cabin mcneil was singing when some time later grant went back past his room he still had a couple of bottles for company and was shouting we dont care where the oxygen goes if it doesnt get into the wine grant whose education had been severely technical couldnt place the quotation as he paused to listen he suddenly found himself shaken by an emotion which to do him justice he did not for a moment recognize it passed as swiftly as it had come leaving him sick and trembling for the first time he realized that his dislike of mcneil was slowly turning to hatred it is a fundamental rule of spaceflight that for sound psychological reasons the minimum crew on a long journey shall consist of not less than three men but rules are made to be broken and the star queens owners had obtained full authority from the board of space control and the insurance companies when the freighter set off for venus without her regular captain at the last moment he had been taken ill and there was no replacement since the planets are disinclined to wait upon man and his affairs if she did not sail on time she would not sail at all millions of dollars were involvedso she sailed grant and mcneil were both highly capable men and they had no objection at all to earning double their normal pay for very little extra work despite fundamental differences in temperament they got on well enough in ordinary circumstances it was nobodys fault that circumstances were now very far from ordinary three days without food it is said is long enough to remove most of the subtle differences between a civilized man and a savage grant and mcneil were still in no physical discomfort but their imaginations had been only too active and they now had more in common with two hungry pacific islanders in a lost canoe than either would have cared to admit for there was one aspect of the situation and that the most important of all which had never been mentioned when the last figures on grants writingpad had been checked and rechecked the calculation was still not quite complete instantly each man had made the one further step each had arrived simultaneously at the same unspoken result it was terribly simplea macabre parody of those problems in firstyear arithmetic that begin if six men take two days to assemble five helicopters how long the oxygen would last two men for about twenty days and venus was thirty days away one did not have to be a calculating prodigy to see at once that one man and one man only might yet live to walk the metal streets of port hesperus the acknowledged deadline was twenty days ahead but the unmentioned one was only ten days off until that time there would still be enough air for two menand thereafter for one man only for the rest of the voyage to a sufficiently detached observer the situation would have been very entertaining it was obvious that the conspiracy of silence could not last much longer but it is not easy even at the best of times for two people to decide amicably which one of them shall commit suicide it is still more difficult when they are no longer on speaking terms grant wished to be perfectly fair therefore the only thing to do was to wait until mcneil sobered up and then to put the question to him frankly he could think best at his desk so he went to the control cabin and strapped himself down in the pilots chair for a while he stared thoughtfully into nothingness it would be better he decided to broach the matter by correspondence especially while diplomatic relations were in their present state he clipped a sheet of notepaper on the writingpad and began dear mcneil then he tore it out and started again mcneil it took him the best part of three hours and even then he wasnt wholly satisfied there were some things it was so darned difficult to put down on paper but at last he managed to finish he sealed the letter and locked it away in his safe it could wait for a day or two few of the waiting millions on earth and venus could have any idea of the tensions that were slowly building up aboard the star queen for days press and radio had been full of fantastic rescue schemes on three worlds there was hardly any other topic of conversation but only the faintest echo of the planetwide tumult reached the two men who were its cause at any time the station on venus could speak to the star queen but there was so little that could be said one could not with any decency give words of encouragement to men in the condemned cell even when there was some slight uncertainty about the actual date of execution so venus contented itself with a few routine messages every day and blocked the steady stream of exhortations and newspaper offers that came pouring in from earth as a result private radio companies on earth made frantic attempts to contact the star queen directly they failed simply because it never occurred to grant and mcneil to focus their receiver anywhere except on venus now so tantalizingly near at hand there had been an embarrassing interlude when mcneil emerged from his cabin but though relations were not particularly cordial life aboard the star queen continued much as before grant spent most of his waking hours in the pilots position calculating approach maneuvers and writing interminable letters to his wife he could have spoken to her had he wished but the thought of all those millions of waiting ears had prevented him from doing so interplanetary speech circuits were supposed to be privatebut too many people would be interested in this one in a couple of days grant assured himself he would hand his letter to mcneil and they could decide what was to be done such a delay would also give mcneil a chance of raising the subject himself that he might have other reasons for his hesitation was something grants conscious mind still refused to admit he often wondered how mcneil was spending his time the engineer had a large library of microfilm books for he read widely and his range of interests was unusual his favorite book grant knew was jurgen and perhaps even now he was trying to forget his doom by losing himself in its strange magic others of mcneils books were less respectable and not a few were of the class curiously described as curious the truth of the matter was that mcneil was far too subtle and complicated a personality for grant to understand he was a hedonist and enjoyed the pleasures of life all the more for being cut off from them for months at a time but he was by no means the moral weakling that the unimaginative and somewhat puritanical grant had supposed it was true that he had collapsed completely under the initial shock and that his behavior over the wine wasby grants standards reprehensible but mcneil had had his breakdown and had recovered therein lay the difference between him and the hard but brittle grant though the normal routine of duties had been resumed by tacit consent it did little to reduce the sense of strain grant and mcneil avoided each other as much as possible except when mealtimes brought them together when they did meet they behaved with an exaggerated politeness as if each were striving to be perfectly normaland inexplicably failing grant had hoped that mcneil would himself broach the subject of suicide thus sparing him a very awkward duty when the engineer stubbornly refused to do anything of the sort it added to grants resentment and contempt to make matters worse he was now suffering from nightmares and sleeping very badly the nightmare was always the same when he was a child it had often happened that at bedtime he had been reading a story far too exciting to be left until morning to avoid detection he had continued reading under the bedclothes by flashlight curled up in a snug whitewalled cocoon every ten minutes or so the air had become too stifling to breathe and his emergence into the delicious cool air had been a major part of the fun now thirty years later these innocent childhood hours returned to haunt him he was dreaming that he could not escape from the suffocating sheets while the air was steadily and remorselessly thickening around him he had intended to give mcneil the letter after two days yet somehow he put it off again this procrastination was very unlike grant but he managed to persuade himself that it was a perfectly reasonable thing to do he was giving mcneil a chance to redeem himselfto prove that he wasnt a coward by raising the matter himself that mcneil might be waiting for him to do exactly the same thing somehow never occurred to grant the alltooliteral deadline was only five days off when for the first time grants mind brushed lightly against the thought of murder he had been sitting after the evening meal trying to relax as mcneil clattered around in the galley with he considered quite unnecessary noise what use he asked himself was the engineer to the world he had no responsibilities and no familyno one would be any the worse off for his death grant on the other hand had a wife and three children of whom he was moderately fond though for some obscure reason they responded with little more than dutiful affection any impartial judge would have no difficulty in deciding which of them should survive if mcneil had a spark of decency in him he would have come to the same conclusion already since he appeared to have done nothing of the sort he had forfeited all further claims to consideration such was the elemental logic of grants subconscious mind which had arrived at its answer days before but had only now succeeded in attracting the attention for which it had been clamoring to grants credit he at once rejected the thought with horror he was an upright and honorable person with a very strict code of behavior even the vagrant homicidal impulses of what is misleadingly called normal man had seldom ruffled his mind but in the daysthe very few daysleft to him they would come more and more often the air had now become noticeably fouler though there was still no real difficulty in breathing it was a constant reminder of what lay ahead and grant found that it was keeping him from sleep this was not pure loss as it helped to break the power of his nightmares but he was becoming physically run down his nerve was also rapidly deteriorating a state of affairs accentuated by the fact that mcneil seemed to be behaving with unexpected and annoying calmness grant realized that he had come to the stage when it would be dangerous to delay the showdown any longer mcneil was in his room as usual when grant went up to the control cabin to collect the letter he had locked away in the safe it seemed a lifetime ago he wondered if he need add anything more to it then he realized that this was only another excuse for delay resolutely he made his way toward mcneils cabin a single neutron begins the chainreaction that in an instant can destroy a million lives and the toil of generations equally insignificant and unimportant are the triggerevents which can sometimes change a mans course of action and so alter the whole pattern of his future nothing could have been more trivial than that which made grant pause in the corridor outside mcneils room in the ordinary way he would not even have noticed it it was the smell of smoketobacco smoke the thought that the sybaritic engineer had so little selfcontrol that he was squandering the last precious liters of oxygen in such a manner filled grant with blinding fury he stood for a moment quite paralyzed with the intensity of his emotion then slowly he crumpled the letter in his hand the thought which had first been an unwelcome intruder then a casual speculation was at last fully accepted mcneil had had his chance and had proved by his unbelievable selfishness unworthy of it very wellhe could die the speed with which grant had arrived at this conclusion would not have deceived the most amateurish of psychologists it was relief as much as hatred that drove him away from mcneils room he had wanted to convince himself that there would be no need to do the honorable thing to suggest some game of chance that would give them each an equal probability of life this was the excuse he needed and he had seized upon it to salve his conscience for though he might plan and even carry out a murder grant was the sort of person who would have to do it according to his own particular moral code as it happened he wasnot for the first timebadly misjudging mcneil the engineer was a heavy smoker and tobacco was quite essential to his mental wellbeing even in normal circumstances how much more essential it was now grant who only smoked occasionally and without much enjoyment could never have appreciated mcneil had satisfied himself by careful calculation that four cigarettes a day would make no measurable difference whatsoever to the ships oxygen endurance whereas they would make all the difference in the world to his own nerves and hence indirectly to grants but it was no use explaining this to grant so he had smoked in private and with a selfcontrol he found agreeably almost voluptuously surprising it was sheer bad luck that grant had detected one of the days four cigarettes for a man who had only at that moment talked himself into murder grants actions were remarkably methodical without hesitation he hurried back to the control room and opened the medicine chest with its neatly labeled compartments designed for almost every emergency that could occur in space even the ultimate emergency had been considered for there behind its retaining elastic bands was the tiny bottle he had been seeking the image of which had been lying hidden far down in the unknown depths of his mind through all these days it bore a white label carrying a skullandcrossbones and beneath them the words approx onehalf gram will cause painless and almost instantaneous death the poison was painless and instantaneousthat was good but even more important was a fact unmentioned on the label it was also tasteless the contrast between the meals prepared by grant and those organized with considerable skill and care by mcneil was striking anyone who was fond of food and who spent a good deal of his life in space usually learned the art of cooking in selfdefense mcneil had done this long ago to grant on the other hand eating was one of those necessary but annoying jobs which had to be got through as quickly as possible his cooking reflected this opinion mcneil had ceased to grumble about it but he would have been very interested in the trouble grant was taking over this particular meal if he noticed any increasing nervousness on grants part as the meal progressed he said nothing they ate almost in silence but that was not unusual for they had long since exhausted most of the possibilities of light conversation when the last dishesdeep bowls with inturned rims to prevent the contents drifting outhad been cleared away grant went into the galley to prepare the coffee he took rather a long time for at the last moment something quite maddening and quite ridiculous happened he suddenly recalled one of the film classics of the last century in which the fabulous charlie chaplin tried to poison an unwanted wifeand then accidentally changed the glasses no memory could have been more unwelcome for it left him shaken with a gust of silent hysteria poes imp of the perverse that demon who delights in defying the careful canons of selfpreservation was at work and it was a good minute before grant could regain his selfcontrol he was sure that outwardly at least he was quite calm as he carried in the two plastic containers and their drinking tubes there was no danger of confusing them for the engineers had the letters mac painted boldly across it at the thought grant nearly relapsed into psychopathic giggles but just managed to regain control with the somber reflection that his nerves must be in even worse condition than he had imagined he watched fascinated though without appearing to do so as mcneil toyed with his cup the engineer seemed in no great hurry and was staring moodily into space then he put his lips to the drinking tube and sipped a moment later he spluttered slightlyand an icy hand seemed to seize grants heart and hold it tight then mcneil turned to him and said evenly youve made it properly for once its quite hot slowly grants heart resumed its interrupted work he did not trust himself to speak but managed a noncommittal nod mcneil parked the cup carefully in the air a few inches away from his face he seemed very thoughtful as if weighing his words for some important remark grant cursed himself for having made the drink so hotthat was just the sort of detail that hanged murderers if mcneil waited much longer he would probably betray himself through nervousness i suppose said mcneil in a quietly conversational sort of way it has occurred to you that theres still enough air to last one of us to venus grant forced his jangling nerves under control and tore his eyes away from that hypnotic cup his throat seemed very dry as he answered itit had crossed my mind mcneil touched his cup found it still too hot and continued thoughtfully then wouldnt it be more sensible if one of us decided to walk out of the airlock sayor to take some of the poison in there he jerked his thumb toward the medicine chest just visible from where they were sitting grant nodded the only trouble of course added the engineer is to decide which of us will be the unlucky one i suppose it would have to be by picking a card or in some other quite arbitrary way grant stared at mcneil with a fascination that almost outweighed his mounting nervousness he had never believed that the engineer could discuss the subject so calmly grant was sure he suspected nothing obviously mcneils thoughts had been running on parallel lines to his own and it was scarcely even a coincidence that he had chosen this time of all times to raise the matter mcneil was watching him intently as if judging his reactions youre right grant heard himself say we must talk it over yes said mcneil quite impassively we must then he reached for his cup again put the drinking tube to his lips and sucked slowly grant could not wait until he had finished to his surprise the relief he had been expecting did not come he even felt a stab of regret though it was not quite remorse it was a little late to think of it now but he suddenly remembered that he would be alone in the star queen haunted by his thoughts for more than three weeks before rescue came he did not wish to see mcneil die and he felt rather sick without another glance at his victim he launched himself toward the exit immovably fixed the fierce sun and the unwinking stars looked down upon the star queen which seemed as motionless as they there was no way of telling that the tiny dumbbell of the ship had now almost reached her maximum speed and that millions of horsepower were chained within the smaller sphere waiting for the moment of its release there was no way of telling indeed that she carried any life at all an airlock on the nightside of the ship slowly opened letting a blaze of light escape from the interior the brilliant circle looked very strange hanging there in the darkness then it was abruptly eclipsed as two figures floated out of the ship one was much bulkier than the other and for a rather important reasonit was wearing a spacesuit now there are some forms of apparel that may be worn or discarded as the fancy pleases with no other illeffects than a possible loss of social prestige but spacesuits are not among them something not easy to follow was happening in the darkness then the smaller figure began to move slowly at first but with rapidly mounting speed it swept out of the shadow of the ship into the full blast of the sun and now one could see that strapped to its back was a small gascylinder from which a fine mist was jetting to vanish almost instantly into space it was a crude but effective rocket there was no danger that the ships minute gravitational pull would drag the body back to it again rotating slightly the corpse dwindled against the stars and vanished from sight in less than a minute quite motionless the figure in the airlock watched it go then the outer door swung shut the circle of brilliance vanished and only the pale earthlight still glinted on the shadowed wall of the ship nothing else whatsoever happened for twentythree days the captain of the hercules turned to his mate with a sigh of relief i was afraid he couldnt do it it must have been a colossal job to break his orbit singlehandedand with the air as thick as it must be by now how soon can we get to him it will take about an hour hes still got quite a bit of eccentricity but we can correct that good signal the leviathan and titan that we can make contact and ask them to take off will you but i wouldnt drop any tips to your news commentator friends until were safely locked the mate had the grace to blush i dont intend to he said in a slightly hurt voice as he pecked delicately at the keys of his calculator the answer that flashed instantly on the screen seemed to displease him wed better board and bring the queen down to circular speed ourselves before we call the other tugs he said otherwise well be wasting a lot of fuel shes still got a velocity excess of nearly a kilometer a second good ideatell leviathan and titan to stand by but not to blast until we give them the new orbit while the message was on its way down through the unbroken cloudbanks that covered half the sky below the mate remarked thoughtfully i wonder what hes feeling like now i can tell you hes so pleased to be alive that he doesnt give a hoot about anything else still im not sure id like to have left my shipmate in space so that i could get home its not the sort of thing that anyone would like to do but you heard the broadcasttheyd talked it over calmly and the loser went out of the airlock it was the only sensible way sensible perhapsbut its pretty horrible to let someone else sacrifice himself in such a coldblooded way so that you can live dont be a ruddy sentimentalist ill bet that if it happened to us youd push me out before i could even say my prayers unless you did it to me first still i dont think its ever likely to happen to the hercules five days out of ports the longest weve ever been isnt it talk about the romance of the spaceways the captain didnt reply he was peering into the eyepiece of the navigating telescope for the star queen should now be within optical range there was a long pause while he adjusted the vernier controls then he gave a little sigh of satisfaction there she isabout ninefifty kilometers away tell the crew to stand byand send a message to cheer him up say well be there in thirty minutes even if it isnt quite true slowly the thousandmeter nylon ropes yielded beneath the strain as they absorbed the relative momentum of the ships then slackened again as the star queen and the hercules rebounded toward each other the electric winches began to turn and like a spider crawling up its thread the hercules drew alongside the freighter men in spacesuits sweated with heavy reaction unitstricky work thisuntil the airlocks had registered and could be coupled together the outer doors slid aside and the air in the locks mingled fresh with foul as the mate of the hercules waited oxygen cylinder in hand he wondered what condition the survivor would be in then the star queens inner door slid open for a moment the two men stood looking at each other across the short corridor that now connected the two airlocks the mate was surprised and a little disappointed to find that he felt no particular sense of drama so much had happened to make this moment possible that its actual achievement was almost an anticlimax even in the instant when it was slipping into the past he wishedfor he was an m curable romanticthat he could think of something memorable to say some doctor livingstone i presume phrase that would pass into history but all he actually said was well mcneil im pleased to see you though he was considerably thinner and somewhat haggard mcneil had stood the ordeal well he breathed gratefully the blast of raw oxygen and rejected the idea that he might like to lie down and sleep as he explained he had done very little but sleep for the last week to conserve air the first mate looked relieved he had been afraid he might have to wait for the story the cargo was being transshipped and the other two tugs were climbing up from the great blinding crescent of venus while mcneil retraced the events of the last few weeks and the mate made surreptitious notes he spoke quite calmly and impersonally as if he were relating some adventure that had happened to another person or indeed had never happened at all which was of course to some extent the case though it would be unfair to suggest that mcneil was telling any lies he invented nothing but he omitted a good deal he had had three weeks in which to prepare his narrative and he did not think it had any flaws grant had already reached the door when mcneil called softly after him whats the hurry i thought we had something to discuss grant grabbed at the doorway to halt his headlong flight he turned slowly and stared unbelievingly at the engineer mcneil should be already deadbut he was sitting quite comfortably looking at him with a most peculiar expression sit down he said sharplyand in that moment it suddenly seemed that all authority had passed to him grant did so quite without volition something had gone wrong though what it was he could not imagine the silence in the control room seemed to last for ages then mcneil said rather sadly id hoped better of you grant at last grant found his voice though he could barely recognize it what do you mean he whispered what do you think i mean replied mcneil with what seemed no more than mild irritation this little attempt of yours to poison me of course grants tottering world collapsed at last but he no longer cared greatly one way or the other mcneil began to examine his beautifully kept fingernails with some attention as a matter of interest he said in the way that one might ask the time when did you decide to kill me the sense of unreality was so overwhelming that grant felt he was acting a part that this had nothing to do with real life at all only this morning he said and believed it hmm remarked mcneil obviously without much conviction he rose to his feet and moved over to the medicine chest grants eyes followed him as he fumbled in the compartment and came back with the little poison bottle it still appeared to be full grant had been careful about that i suppose i should get pretty mad about this whole business mcneil continued conversationally holding the bottle between thumb and forefinger but somehow im not maybe its because i never had many illusions about human nature and of course i saw it coming a long time ago only the last phrase really reached grants consciousness yousaw it coming heavens yes youre too transparent to make a good criminal im afraid and now that your little plots failed it leaves us both in an embarrassing position doesnt it to this masterly understatement there seemed no possible reply by rights continued the engineer thoughtfully i should now work myself into a good temper call venus central and denounce you to the authorities but it would be a rather pointless thing to do and ive never been much good at losing my temper anyway of course youll say thats because im too lazybut i dont think so he gave grant a twisted smile oh i know what you think about meyouve got me neatly classified in that orderly mind of yours havent you im soft and selfindulgent i havent any moral courageor any morals for that matterand i dont give a damn for anyone but myself well im not denying it maybe its ninety per cent true but the odd ten per cent is mighty important grant grant felt in no condition to indulge in psychological analysis and this seemed hardly the time for anything of the sort besides he was still obsessed with the problem of his failure and the mystery of mcneils continued existence mcneil who knew this perfectly well seemed in no hurry to satisfy his curiosity well what do you intend to do now grant asked anxious to get it over i would like said mcneil calmly to carry on our discussion where it was interrupted by the coffee you dont mean but i do just as if nothing had happened that doesnt make sense youve got something up your sleeve cried grant mcneil sighed he put down the poison bottle and looked firmly at grant youre in no position to accuse me of plotting anything to repeat my earlier remarks i am suggesting that we decide which one of us shall take poisononly we dont want any more unilateral decisions alsohe picked up the bottle againit will be the real thing this time the stuff in here merely leaves a bad taste in the mouth a light was beginning to dawn in grants mind you changed the poison naturally you may think youre a good actor grant but franklyfrom the balconyi thought the performance stank i could tell you were plotting something probably before you knew it yourself in the last few days ive deloused the ship pretty thoroughly thinking of all the ways you might have done me in was quite amusing and helped to pass the time the poison was so obvious that it was the first thing i fixed but i rather overdid the danger signals and nearly gave myself away when i took the first sip salt doesnt go at all well with coffee he gave that wry grin again also id hoped for something more subtle so far ive found fifteen infallible ways of murdering anyone aboard a spaceship but i dont propose to describe them now this was fantastic grant thought he was being treated not like a criminal but like a rather stupid schoolboy who hadnt done his homework properly yet youre still willing said grant unbelievingly to start all over again and youd take the poison yourself if you lost mcneil was silent for a long time then he began slowly i can see that you still dont believe me it doesnt fit at all nicely into your tidy little picture does it but perhaps i can make you understand its really quite simple ive enjoyed life grant without many scruples or regretsbut the better part of its over now and i dont cling to whats left as desperately as you might imagine yet while i am alive im rather particular about some things it may surprise you to know that ive got any ideals at all but i have grantive always tried to act like a civilized rational being ive not always succeeded when ive failed ive tried to redeem myself he paused and when he resumed it was as though be and not grant was on the defensive ive never exactly eked you grant but ive often admired you and thats why im sorry its come to this i admired you most of all the day the ship was holed for the first time mcneil seemed to have some difficulty in choosing his words when he spoke again he avoided grants eyes i didnt behave very well then something happened that i thought was impossible ive always been quite sure that id never lose my nerve butwellit was so sudden it knocked me over he attempted to hide his embarrassment by humor the same sort of thing happened on my very first trip i was sure id never be space sickand as a result i was much worse than if i had not been overconfident but i got over it thenand again this time it was one of the biggest surprises of my life grant when i saw that you of all people were beginning to crack oh yesthe business of the wines i can see youre thinking about that well thats one thing i dont regret i said id always tried to act like a civilized manand a civilized man should always know when to get drunk but perhaps you wouldnt understand oddly enough that was just what grant was beginning to do he had caught his first real glimpse of mcneils intricate and tortuous personality and realized how utterly he had misjudged him nomisjudged was not the right word in many ways his judgment had been correct but it had only touched the surfacehe had never suspected the depths that lay beneath i in a moment of insight that had never come before and from the nature of things could never come again grant understood the reasons behind mcneils action this was nothing so simple as a coward trying to reinstate himself in the eyes of the world for no one need ever know what happened aboard the star queen in any case mcneil probably cared nothing for the worlds opinion thanks to the sleek selfsufficiency that had so often annoyed grant but that very selfsufficiency meant that at all costs he must preserve his own good opinion of himself without it life would not be worth livingand mcneil had never accepted life save on his own terms the engineer was watching him intently and must have guessed that grant was coming near the truth for he suddenly changed his tone as though he was sorry he had revealed so much of his character dont think i get a quixotic pleasure from turning the other cheek he said just consider it from the point of view of pure logic after all weve got to come to some agreement has it occurred to you that if only one of us survives without a covering message from the other hell have a very uncomfortable time explaining just what happened in his blind fury grant had completely forgotten this but he did not believe it bulked at all important in mcneils own thoughts yes he said i suppose youre right he felt far better now all the hate had drained out of him and he was at peace the truth was known and he accepted it that it was so different from what he had imagined did not seem to matter now well lets get it over he said unemotionally theres a new pack of cards lying around somewhere i think wed better speak to venus firstboth of us replied mcneil with peculiar emphasis we want a complete agreement on record in case anyone asks awkward questions later grant nodded absently he did not mind very much now one way or the other he even smiled ten minutes later as he drew his card from the pack and laid it face upward beside mcneils so thats the whole story is it said the first mate wondering how soon he could decently get to the transmitter yes said mcneil evenly thats all there was to it the mate bit his pencil trying to frame the next question and i suppose grant took it all quite calmly the captain gave him a glare which he avoided and mcneil looked at him coldly as if he could see through to the sensation mongering headlines ranged behind he got to his feet and moved over to the observation port you heard his broadcast didnt you wasnt that calm enough the mate sighed it still seemed hard to believe that in such circumstances two men could have behaved in so reasonable so unemotional a manner he could have pictured all sorts of dramatic possibilitiessudden outbursts of insanity even attempts at murder yet according to mcneil nothing at all had happened it was too bad mcneil was speaking again as if to himself yes grant behaved very wellvery well indeed it was a great pity then he seemed to lose himself in the everfresh incomparable glory of the approaching planet not far beneath and coming closer by kilometers every second the snowwhite crescent arms of venus spanned more than half the sky down there were life and warmth and civilizationand air the future which not long ago had seemed contracted to a point had opened out again into all its unknown possibilities and wonders but behind him mcneil could sense the eyes of his rescuers probing questioningyes and condemning too all his life he would hear whispers voices would be saying behind his back isnt that the man who he did not care for once in his life at least he had done something of which he could feel unashamed perhaps one day his own pitiless selfanalysis would strip bare the motives behind his actions would whisper in his ear altruism dont be a fool you did it to bolster up your own good opinion of yourselfso much more important than anyone elses but the perverse maddening voices which all his life had made nothing seem worthwhile were silent for the moment and he felt content he had reached the calm at the center of the hurricane while it lasted he would enjoy it to the full
