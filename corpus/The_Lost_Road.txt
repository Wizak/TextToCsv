 the lost road the novels and stories of richard harding davis contains the lost road the miracle of las palmas evil to him who evil thinks the men of zanzibar the long arm the god of coincidence the buried treasure of cobre the boy scout somewhere in france the deserter to my wife an introduction by john t mccutcheon with davis in vera cruz brussels and salonika in common with many others who have been with richard harding davis as correspondents i find it difficult to realize that he has covered his last story and that he will not be seen again with the men who follow the war game rushing to distant places upon which the spotlight of news interest suddenly centres it seems a sort of bitter irony that he who had covered so many big events of world importance in the past twenty years should be abruptly torn away in the midst of the greatest event of them all while the story is still unfinished and its outcome undetermined if there is a compensating thought it lies in the reflection that he had a life of almost unparalleled fulness crowded to the brim up to the last moment with those experiences and achievements which he particularly aspired to have he left while the tide was at its flood and while he still held supreme his place as the best reporter in his country he escaped the bitterness of seeing the ebb set in when the youth to which he clung had slipped away and when he would have to sit impatient in the audience while younger men were in the thick of great worldstirring dramas on the stage this would have been a real tragedy in dick daviss case for while his body would have aged it is doubtful if his spirit ever would have lost its youthful freshness or boyish enthusiasm it was my privilege to see a good deal of davis in the last two years he arrived in vera cruz among the first of the sixty or seventy correspondents who flocked to that news centre when the situation was so full of sensational possibilities it was a time when the american newspaperreading public was eager for thrills and the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the correspondents in vera cruz were tried to the uttermost to supply the demand in the face of the fiercest competition it fell to daviss lot to land the biggest story of those days of marking time the story broke when it became known that davis medill mccormick and frederick palmer had gone through the mexican lines in an effort to reach mexico city davis and mccormick with letters to the brazilian and british ministers got through and reached the capital on the strength of those letters but palmer having only an american passport was turned back after an ominous silence which furnished american newspapers with a lively period of suspense the two men returned safely with wonderful stories of their experiences while under arrest in the hands of the mexican authorities mccormick in recently speaking of davis at that time said that as a correspondent in difficult and dangerous situations he was incomparable cheerful ingenious and undiscouraged when the time came to choose between safety and leaving his companion he stuck by his fellow captive even though as they both said a firingsquad and a blank wall were by no means a remote possibility this mexico city adventure was a spectacular achievement which gave davis and mccormick a distinction which no other correspondents of all the ambitious and able corps had managed to attain davis usually hunted alone he depended entirely upon his own ingenuity and wonderful instinct for news situations he had the energy and enthusiasm of a beginner with the experience and training of a veteran his interest in things remained as keen as though he had not been years at a game which often leaves a man jaded and blase his acquaintanceship in the american army and navy was wide and for this reason as well as for the prestige which his fame and position as a national character gave him he found it easy to establish valuable connections in the channels from which news emanates and yet in spite of the fact that he was on his own instead of having a working partnership with other men he was generous in helping at times when he was able to do so davis was a conspicuous figure in vera cruz as he inevitably had been in all such situations wherever he went he was pointed out his distinction of appearance together with a distinction in dress which whether from habit or policy was a valuable asset in his work made him a marked man he dressed and looked the war correspondent such a one as he would describe in one of his stories he fulfilled the popular ideal of what a member of that fascinating profession should look like his code of life and habits was as fixed as that of the briton who takes his habits and customs and games and tea wherever he goes no matter how benighted or remote the spot may be he was just as loyal to his code as is the briton he carried his bathtub his immaculate linen his evening clothes his war equipment in which he had the pride of a connoisseur wherever he went and what is more he had the courage to use the evening clothes at times when their use was conspicuous he was the only man who wore a dinner coat in vera cruz and each night at his particular table in the crowded portales at the hotel diligencia he was to be seen as fresh and clean as though he were in a new york or london restaurant each day he was up early to take the train out to the gap across which came arrivals from mexico city sometimes a good story would come down as when the longheralded and longexpected arrival of consul silliman gave a firstpage feature to all the american papers in the afternoon he would play water polo over at the navy aviation camp and always at a certain time of the day his striker would bring him his horse and for an hour or more he would ride out along the beach roads within the american lines after the first few days it was difficult to extract real thrills from the vera cruz situation but we used to ride out to el tejar with the cavalry patrol and imagine that we might be fired on at some point in the long ride through unoccupied territory or else go out to the front at legarto where a little american force occupied a sunbaked row of freightcars surrounded by malarial swamps from the top of the railroad watertank we could look across to the mexican outposts a mile or so away it was not very exciting and what thrills we got lay chiefly in our imagination before my acquaintanceship with davis at vera cruz i had not known him well our trails didnt cross while i was in japan in the japaneserussian war and in the transvaal i missed him by a few days but in vera cruz i had many enjoyable opportunities of becoming well acquainted with him the privilege was a pleasant one for it served to dispel a preconceived and not an entirely favorable impression of his character for years i had heard stories about richard harding davis stories which emphasized an egotism and selfassertiveness which if they ever existed had happily ceased to be obtrusive by the time i got to know him he was a different davis from the davis whom i had expected to find and i can imagine no more charming and delightful companion than he was in vera cruz there was no evidence of those qualities which i feared to find and his attitude was one of unfailing kindness considerateness and generosity in the many talks i had with him i was always struck by his evident devotion to a fixed code of personal conduct in his writings he was the interpreter of chivalrous wellbred youth and his heroes were young cleanthinking college men heroic biggame hunters war correspondents and idealized men about town who always did the noble thing disdaining the unworthy in act or motive it seemed to me that he was modelling his own life perhaps unconsciously after the favored types which his imagination had created for his stories in a certain sense he was living a life of makebelieve wherein he was the hero of the story and in which he was bound by his ideals always to act as he would have the hero of his story act it was a quality which only one could have who had preserved a fresh youthfulness of outlook in spite of the hardening processes of maturity his power of observation was extraordinarily keen and he not only had the rare gift of sensing the vital elements of a situation but also had to an unrivalled degree the ability to describe them vividly i dont know how many of those men at verz cruz tried to describe the kaleidoscopic life of the city during the american occupation but i know that daviss story was far and away the most faithful and satisfying picture the story was photographic even to the sounds and smells the last i saw of him in vera cruz was when on the utah he steamed past the flagship wyoming upon which i was quartered and started for new york the battenberg cup race had just been rowed and the utah and florida crews had tied as the utah was sailing immediately after the race there was no time in which to row off the tie so it was decided that the names of both ships should be engraved on the cup and that the florida crew should defend the title against a challenging crew from the british admiral craddocks flagship by the end of june the public interest in vera cruz had waned and the corps of correspondents dwindled until there were only a few left frederick palmer and i went up to join carranza and villa and on the th of july we were in monterey waiting to start with the triumphal march of carranzas army toward mexico city there was no sign of serious trouble abroad that night ominous telegrams came and at ten oclock on the following morning we were on a train headed for the states palmer and davis caught the lusitania sailing august from new york and i followed on the saint paul leaving three days later on the th of august i reached brussels and it seemed the most natural thing in the world to find davis already there he was at the palace hotel where a number of american and english correspondents were quartered things moved quickly on the th irvin cobb will irwin arno dosch and i were caught between the belgian and german lines in louvain our retreat to brussels was cut and for three days while the vast german army moved through the city we were detained then the army having passed we were allowed to go back to the capital in the meantime davis was in brussels the germans reached the outskirts of the city on the morning of the th and the correspondents who had remained in brussels were feverishly writing despatches describing the imminent fall of the city one of them harry hansen of the chicago daily news tells the following story which i give in his words while we were writing says hansen richard harding davis walked into the writingroom of the palace hotel with a bunch of manuscript in his hand with an amused expression he surveyed the three correspondents filling white paper i say men said davis do you know when the next train leaves there is one at three oclock said a correspondent looking up that looks like our only chance to get a story out said davis well well trust to that the story was the german invasion of brussels and the train mentioned was considered the forlorn hope of the correspondents to connect with the outside world that is every correspondent thought it to be the other mans hope secretly each had prepared to outwit the other and secretly davis had already sent his story to ostend he meant to emulate archibald forbes who despatched a courier with his real manuscript and next day publicly dropped a bulky package in the mailbag davis had sensed the news in the occupation of brussels long before it happened with dawn he went out to the louvain road where the german army stood prepared to smash the capital if negotiations failed his observant eye took in all the details before noon he had written a comprehensive sketch of the occupation and when word was received that it was under way he trusted his copy to an old flemish woman who spoke not a word of english and saw her safely on board the train that pulled out under belgian auspices for ostend with passes which the german commandant in brussels gave us the correspondents immediately started out to see how far those passes would carry us a number of us left on the afternoon of august for waterloo where it was expected that the great clash between the german and the anglofrench forces would occur we had planned to be back the same evening and went prepared only for an afternoons drive in a couple of hired street carriages it was seven weeks before we again saw brussels on the following day august davis started for mons he wore the khaki uniform which he had worn in many campaigns across his breast was a narrow bar of silk ribbon indicating the campaigns in which he had served as a correspondent he so much resembled a british officer that he was arrested as a british derelict and was informed that he would be shot at once he escaped only by offering to walk to brand whitlock in brussels reporting to each officer he met on the way his plan was approved and as a hostage on parole he appeared before the american minister who quickly established his identity as an american of good standing to the satisfaction of the germans in the following few months our trails were widely separated i read of his arrest by german officers on the road to mons later i read the story of his departure from brussels by train to holland a trip which carried him through louvain while the town still was burning and still later i read that he was with the few lucky men who were in rheims during one of the early bombardments that damaged the cathedral by amazing luck combined with a natural news sense which drew him instinctively to critical places at the psychological moment he had been a witness of the two most widely featured stories of the early weeks of the war arrested by the germans in belgium and later by the french in france he was convinced that the restrictions on correspondents were too great to permit of good work so he left the european war zone with the widely quoted remark the day of the war correspondent is over and yet i was not surprised when one evening late in november of last year he suddenly walked into the room in salonika where william g shepherd of the united press jimmy hare the veteran war photographer and i had established ourselves several weeks before the hotel was jammed and the city with a normal capacity of about one hundred and seventyfive thousand was struggling to accommodate at least a hundred thousand more there was not a room to be had in any of the better hotels and for several days we lodged davis in our room a vast chamber which formerly had been the main diningroom of the establishment and which now was converted into a bedroom there was room for a dozen men if necessary and whenever stranded americans arrived and could find no hotel accommodations we simply rigged up emergency cots for their temporary use the weather in salonika at this time late november was penetratingly cold in the mornings the steam coils struggled feebly to dispel the chill in the room early in the morning after davis had arrived we were aroused by the sound of violent splashing accompanied by shuddering gasps and we looked out from the snug warmth of our beds to see davis standing in his portable bathtub and drenching himself with icecold water as an exhibition of courageous devotion to an established custom of life it was admirable but im not sure that it was prudent for some reason perhaps a defective circulation or a weakened heart his system failed to react from these coldwater baths all through the days he complained of feeling chilled he never seemed to get thoroughly warmed and of us all he was the one who suffered most keenly from the cold it was all the more surprising for his appearance was always that of a man in the pink of athletic fitness ruddyfaced cleareyed and full of tireless energy on one occasion we returned from the french front in serbia to salonika in a box car lighted only by candles bitterly cold and frightfully exhausting we were seven hours in travelling fiftyfive miles and we arrived at our destination at three oclock in the morning several of the men contracted desperate colds which clung to them for weeks davis was chilled through and said that of all the cold he had ever experienced that which swept across the macedonian plain from the balkan highlands was the most penetrating even his heavy clothing could not afford him adequate protection when he was settled in his own room in our hotel he installed an oilstove which burned beside him as he sat at his desk and wrote his stories the room was like an oven but even then he still complained of the cold when he left he gave us the stove and when we left some time later it was presented to one of our doctor friends out in a british hospital where im sure it is doing its best to thaw the balkan chill out of sick and wounded soldiers davis was always up early and his energy and interest were as keen as a boys we had our meals together sometimes in the crowded and rather smart bastasinis but more often in the maelstrom of humanity that nightly packed the olympos palace restaurant davis shepherd hare and i with sometimes mr and mrs john bass made up these parties which for a period of about two weeks or so were the most enjoyable daily events of our lives under the glaring lights of the restaurant and surrounded by british french greek and serbian officers german austrian and bulgarian civilians with a sprinkling of american english and scotch nurses and doctors packed so solidly in the huge highceilinged room that the waiters could barely pick their way among the tables we hung for hours over our dinners and left only when the landlord and his austrian wife counted the days receipts and paid the waiters at the end of the evening one could not imagine a more charming and delightful companion than davis during these days while he always asserted that he could not make a speech and was terrified at the thought of standing up at a banquettable yet sitting at a dinnertable with a few friends who were only too eager to listen rather than to talk his stories covering personal experiences in all parts of the world were intensely vivid with that remarkable holding quality of description which characterizes his writings he brought his own bread a coarse brown sort which he preferred to the better white bread and with it he ate great quantities of butter as we sat down at the table his first demand was for mastika a peculiar greek drink distilled from mastic gum and his second demand invariably was du beurre with the rs as silent as the stars and if it failed to come at once the waiter was made to feel the enormity of his tardiness the reminiscences ranged from his early newspaper days in philadelphia and skipping from manchuria to cuba and central america to his early sun days under arthur brisbane they ranged through an endless variety of personal experiences which very nearly covered the whole course of american history in the past twenty years perhaps to him it was pleasant to go over his remarkable adventures but it could not have been half as pleasant as it was to hear them told as they were with a keenness of description and brilliancy of humorous comment that made them gems of narrative at times in our work we all tried our hands at describing the salonika of those early days of the allied occupation for it was really what one widely travelled british officer called it the most amazingly interesting situation ive ever seen but daviss description was far and away the best just as his description of vera cruz was the best and his wonderful story of the entry of the german army into brussels was matchless as one of the great pieces of reporting in the present war in thinking of davis i shall always remember him for the delightful qualities which he showed in salonika he was unfailingly considerate and thoughtful through his narratives one could see the pride which he took in the width and breadth of his personal relation to the great events of the past twenty years his vast scope of experiences and equally wide acquaintanceship with the big figures of our time were amazing and it was equally amazing that one of such a rich and interesting history could tell his stories in such a simple way that the personal element was never obtrusive when he left salonika he endeavored to obtain permission from the british staff to visit moudros but failing in this he booked his passage on a crowded little greek steamer where the only obtainable accommodation was a lounge in the dining saloon we gave him a farewell dinner at which the american consul and his family with all the other americans then in salonika were present and after the dinner we rowed out to his ship and saw him very uncomfortably installed for his voyage he came down the sea ladder and waved his hand as we rowed away that was the last i saw of richard harding davis john t mccutcheon the lost road during the war with spain colton lee came into the service as a volunteer for a young man he always had taken life almost too seriously and when after the campaign in cuba he elected to make soldiering his profession the seriousness with which he attacked his new work surprised no one finding they had lost him forever his former intimates were bored but his colonel was enthusiastic and the men of his troop not only loved but respected him from the start he determined in his new life women should have no part a determination that puzzled no one so much as the women for to lee no woman old or young had found cause to be unfriendly but he had read that the army is a jealous mistress who brooks no rival that red lips tarnish the scabbard steel that he travels the fastest who travels alone so when white hands beckoned and pretty eyes signalled he did not look for five years until just before he sailed for his three years of duty in the philippines he succeeded not only in not looking but in building up for himself such a fine reputation as a womanhater that all women were crazy about him had he not been ordered to agawamsett that fact would not have affected him but at the officers school he had indulged in hard study rather than in hard riding had overworked had brought back his cuban fever and was in poor shape to face the tropics so for two months before the transport was to sail they ordered him to cape cod to fill his lungs with the bracing air of a new england autumn he selected agawamsett because when at harvard it was there he had spent his summer vacations and he knew he would find sailboats and tennis and through the pine woods back of the little whaling village many miles of untravelled roads he promised himself that over these he would gallop an imaginary troop in route marches would manoeuvre it against possible ambush and in combat patrols ground scouts and cossack outposts charge with it as foragers but he did none of these things for at agawamsett he met frances gardner and his experience with her was so disastrous that in his determination to avoid all women he was convinced he was right when later he reached manila he vowed no other woman would ever again find a place in his thoughts no other woman did not because he had the strength to keep his vow but because he so continually thought of frances gardner that no other woman had a chance miss gardner was a remarkable girl her charm appealed to all kinds of men and unfortunately for lee several kinds of men appealed to her her fortune and her relations were bound up in the person of a rich aunt with whom she lived and who it was understood some day would leave her all the money in the world but in spite of her charm certainly in spite of the rich aunt lee true to his determination might not have noticed the girl had not she ridden so extremely well it was to the captain of cavalry she first appealed but even a cavalry captain whose duty in life is to instruct sixty men in the art of taking the life of as many other men as possible may turn his head in the direction of a goodlooking girl and when for weeks a man rides at the side of one through pine forests as dim and mysterious as the aisles of a great cathedral when he guides her across the wet marshes when the sun is setting crimson in the pools and the wind blows salt from the sea when he loses them both by moonlight in woodroads where the hoofs of the horses sink silently into dusty pine needles he thinks more frequently of the girl at his side than of the faithful troopers waiting for him in san francisco the girl at his side thought frequently of him with the surface indications of a young man about to ask her to marry him she was painfully familiar but this time the possibility was the reverse of painful what she meant to do about it she did not know but she did know that she was strangely happy between living on as the dependent of a somewhat exacting relative and becoming the full partner of this young stranger who with men had proved himself so masterful and who with her was so gentle there seemed but little choice but she did not as yet wish to make the choice she preferred to believe she was not certain she assured him that before his leave of absence was over she would tell him whether she would remain on duty with the querulous aunt who had befriended her or as his wife accompany him to the philippines it was not the answer he wanted but in her happiness which was evident to every one he could not help but take hope and in the questions she put to him of life in the tropics of the life of the officers ladies he saw that what was in her mind was a possible life with him and he was content she became to him a wonderful glorious person and each day she grew in loveliness it had been five years of soldiering in cuba china and on the mexican border since he had talked to a woman with interest and now in all she said in all her thoughts and words and delights he found fresher and stronger reasons for discarding his determination to remain wedded only to the united states army he did not need reasons he was far too much in love to see in any word or act of hers anything that was not fine and beautiful in their rides they had one day stumbled upon a longlost and longforgotten road through the woods which she had claimed as their own by right of discovery and no matter to what point they set forth each day they always returned by it their way through the woods stretched for miles it was concealed in a forest of stunted oaks and black pines with no sign of human habitation save here and there a clearing now long neglected and alive only with goldenrod trunks of trees mossgrown and crumbling beneath the touch of the ponies hoofs lay in their path and above it the branches of a younger generation had clasped hands at their approach squirrels raced for shelter woodcock and partridge shot deeper into the network of vines and saplings and the click of the steel as the ponies tossed their bits and their own whispers alone disturbed the silence it is an enchanted road said the girl or maybe we are enchanted not i cried the young man loyally i was never so sane never so sure never so happy in knowing just what i wanted if only you could be as sure one day she came to him in high excitement with a book of verse he has written a poem she cried about our own woods about our lost road listen she commanded and she read to him they shut the road through the woods seventy years ago weather and rain have undone it again and now you would never know there was once a road through the woods before they planted the trees it is underneath the coppice and heath and the thin anemones only the keeper sees that where the ringdove broods and the badgers roll at ease there was once a road through the woods yet if you enter the woods of a summer evening late when the night air cools on the troutringed pools where the otter whistles his mate they fear not men in the woods because they see so few you will hear the beat of a horses feet and the swish of a skirt in the dew steadily cantering through the misty solitudes as though they perfectly knew the old lost road through the woods but there is no road through the woods i dont like that at all cried the soldierman its too too sad it doesnt give you any encouragement the way it ends i mean but there is no road through the woods of course theres a road for us there always will be im going to make sure im going to buy those woods and keep the lost road where we can always find it i dont think said the girl that he means a real road i know what he means cried the lover and hes wrong there is a road and you and i have found it and we are going to follow it for always the girl shook her head but her eyes were smiling happily the season at agawamsett closed with the tennis tournament and it was generally conceded fit and proper from every point of view that in mixed doubles lee and miss gardner should be partners young stedman the boston artist was the only one who made objection up in the sailloft that he had turned into a studio he was painting a portrait of the lovely miss gardner and he protested that the three days tournament would sadly interrupt his work and frances who was very much interested in the portrait was inclined to agree but lee beat down her objections he was not at all interested in the portrait he disapproved of it entirely for the sittings robbed him of frances during the better part of each morning and he urged that when he must so soon leave her between the man who wanted her portrait and the man who wanted her it would be kind to give her time to the latter but i had no idea protested frances he would take so long he told me hed finish it in three sittings but hes so critical of his own work that he goes over it again and again he says that i am a most difficult subject but that i inspire him and he says if i will only give him time he believes this will be the best thing he has done thats an awful thought said the cavalry officer you dont like him reproved miss gardner he is always very polite to you hes polite to everybody said lee thats why i dont like him hes not a real artist hes a courtier god gave him a talent and he makes a mean use of it uses it to flatter people hes like these longhaired violinists who play anything you ask them to in the lobster palaces miss gardner looked away from him her color was high and her eyes very bright i think she said steadily that mr stedman is a great artist and some day all the world will think so too lee made no answer not because he disagreed with her estimate of mr stedmans geniushe made no pretense of being an art critic but because her vehement admiration had filled him with sudden panic he was not jealous for that he was far too humble indeed he thought himself so utterly unworthy of frances gardner that the fact that to him she might prefer some one else was in no way a surprise he only knew that if she should prefer some one else not all his troop horses nor all his men could put humpty dumpty back again but if in regard to mr stedman miss gardner had for a moment been at odds with the man who loved her she made up for it the day following on the tennis court there she was in accord with him in heart soul and body and her sharp well played partner thrilled him like one of his own bugle calls for two days against visiting and local teams they fought their way through the tournament and the struggle with her at his side filled lee with a great happiness not that the championship of agawamsett counted greatly to one exiled for three years to live among the moros he wanted to win because she wanted to win but his happiness came in doing something in common with her in helping her and in having her help him in being if only in play if only for three days her partner after they won they walked home together each swinging a fat heavy lovingcup on each was engraved mixed doubles agawamsett lee held his up so that the setting sun flashed on the silver i am going to keep that he said as long as i live it means you were once my partner its a sign that once we two worked together for something and won in the words the man showed such feeling that the girl said soberly mine means that to me too i will never part with mine either lee turned to her and smiled appealing wistfully it seems a pity to separate them he said theyd look well together over an open fireplace the girl frowned unhappily i dont know she protested i dont know the next day lee received from the war department a telegram directing him to proceed without delay to san francisco and there to embark for the philippines that night he put the question to her directly but again she shook her head unhappily again she said i dont know so he sailed without her and each evening at sunset as the great transport heaved her way across the swell of the pacific he stood at the rail and looked back with the aid of the first officer he calculated the difference in time between a whaling village situated at fortyfour degrees north and an army transport dropping rapidly toward the equator and so each day kept in step with the girl he loved now he would tell himself she is in her cart in front of the postoffice and while they sort the morning mail she gossips with the fisher folks the summer folks the grooms and chauffeurs now she is sitting for her portrait to stedman he did not dwell long on that part of her day and now she is at tennis or as she promised riding alone at sunset down our lost road through the woods but that part of her day from which lee hurried was that part over which the girl herself lingered as he turned his eyes from his canvas to meet hers stedman the charming the deferential the adroit who never allowed his painting to interrupt his talk told her of what he was pleased to call his dreams and ambitions of the great and beautiful ladies who had sat before his easel and of the only one of them who had given him inspiration especially of the only one who had given him inspiration with her always to uplift him he could become one of the worlds most famous artists and she would go down into history as the beautiful woman who had helped him as the wife of rembrandt had inspired rembrandt as mona lisa had made leonardo gilbert wrote it is not the lover who comes to woo but the lovers way of wooing his successful lover was the one who threw the girl across his saddle and rode away with her but one kind of woman does not like to have her lover approach shouting at the gallop charge she prefers a man not because he is masterful but because he is not she likes to believe the man needs her more than she needs him that she and only she can steady him cheer him keep him true to the work he is in the world to perform it is called the mothering instinct frances felt this mothering instinct toward the sensitive imaginative charming stedman she believed he had but two thoughts his art and herself she was content to place his art first she could not guess that to one so unworldly to one so wrapped up in his art the fortune of a rich aunt might prove alluring when the transport finally picked up the landfalls of cavite harbor lee with the instinct of a soldier did not exclaim this is where dewey ran the forts and sank the spanish fleet on the contrary he was saying when she comes to join me it will be here i will first see her steamer i will be waiting with a fieldglass on the end of that wharf no i will be out here in a shoreboat waving my hat and of all those along the rail my heart will tell me which is she then a barefooted filipino boy handed him an unsigned cablegram it read if i wrote a thousand words i could not make it easier for either of us i am to marry arthur stedman in december lee was grateful for the fact that he was not permitted to linger in manila instead he was at once ordered upcountry where at a onetroop post he administered the affairs of a somewhat hectic province and under the guidance of the local constabulary chased willothewisp brigands on a shelf in his quarters he placed the silver lovingcup and at night when the village slept he would sit facing it filling one pipe after another and through the smoke staring at the evidence to the fact that once frances gardner and he had been partners in these postmortems he saw nothing morbid with his present activities they in no way interfered and in thinking of the days when they had been together in thinking of what he had lost he found deep content another man having lost the woman he loved would have tried to forget her and all she meant to him but lee was far too honest with himself to substitute other thoughts for those that were glorious that still thrilled him the girl could take herself from him but she could not take his love for her from him and for that he was grateful he never had considered himself worthy and so could not believe he had been ill used in his thoughts of her there was no bitterness for that also he was grateful and as he knew he would not care for any other woman in the way he cared for her he preferred to care in that way even for one who was lost than in a lesser way for a possible she who some day might greatly care for him so she still remained in his thoughts and was so constantly with him that he led a dual existence in which by day he directed the affairs of an alien and hostile people and by night again lived through the wonderful moments when she had thought she loved him when he first had learned to love her at times she seemed actually at his side and he could not tell whether he was pretending that this were so or whether the force of his love had projected her image half around the world often when in single file he led the men through the forest he seemed again to be back on cape cod picking his way over their own lost road through the wood and he heard the beat of a horses feet and the swish of a skirt in the dew and then a carbine would rattle or a horse would stumble and a trooper swear and he was again in the sweating jungle where men intent upon his life crouched in ambush she spared him the mockery of weddingcards but the announcement of the wedding came to him in a threemonthsold newspaper hoping they would speak of her in their letters he kept up a somewhat onesided correspondence with friends of mrs stedmans in boston where she now lived but for a year in none of their letters did her name appear when a mutual friend did write of her lee understood the silence from the first the mutual friend wrote the life of mrs stedman and her husband was thoroughly miserable stedman blamed her because she came to him penniless the rich aunt who had heartily disapproved of the artist had spoken of him so frankly that frances had quarrelled with her and from her no longer would accept money in his anger at this stedman showed himself to frances as he was and only two months after their marriage she was further enlightened an irate husband made him the central figure in a scandal that filled the friends of frances with disgust and that for her was an awakening cruel and humiliating men no longer permitted their womenfolk to sit to stedman for a portrait and the need of money grew imperative he the more blamed frances for having quarrelled with her aunt told her it was for her money he had married her that she had ruined his career and that she was to blame for his ostracism a condition that his own misconduct had brought upon him finally after twelve months of this one morning he left a note saying he no longer would allow her to be a drag upon him and sailed for europe they learned that in paris he had returned to that life which before his marriage even in that easygoing city had made him notorious and frances continued lees correspondent has left boston and now lives in new york she wouldnt let any of us help her nor even know where she is the last we heard of her she was in charge of the complaint department of a millinery shop for which work she was receiving about the same wages i give my cook lee did not stop to wonder why the same woman who to one man was a drag was to another even though separated from her by half the world a joy and a blessing instead he promptly wrote his lawyers to find mrs stedman and in such a way as to keep her ignorant of their good offices see that she obtained a position more congenial than her present one and one that would pay her as much as without arousing her suspicions they found it possible to give three months had passed and this letter had not been answered when in manila where he had been ordered to make a report he heard of her again one evening when the band played on the luneta he met a newly married couple who had known him in agawamsett they now were on a ninetyday cruise around the world close friends of frances gardner they remembered him as one of her many devotees and at once spoke of her that blackguard she married the bridegroom told him was killed three months ago racing with another car from versailles back to paris after a dinner at which it seems all present drank burgundy out of the fingerbowls coming down that steep hill into saint cloud the cars collided and stedman and a woman whose husband thought she was somewhere else were killed he couldnt even die without making a scandal of it but the worst added the bride is that in spite of the way the little beast treated her i believe frances still cares for him and always will thats the worst of it isnt it she demanded in words lee did not answer but in his heart he agreed that was much the worst of it the fact that frances was free filled him with hope but that she still cared for the man she had married and would continue to think only of him made him ill with despair he cabled his lawyers for her address he determined that at once on learning it he would tell her that with him nothing was changed he had forgotten nothing and had learned much he had learned that his love for her was a splendid and inspiring passion that even without her it had lifted him up helped and cheered him made the whole world kind and beautiful with her he could not picture a world so complete with happiness since entering the army he had never taken a leave of absence and he was sure if now he asked for one it would not be refused he determined if the answer to his cable gave him the address he would return at once and again offer her his love which he now knew was deeper finer and infinitely more tender than the love he first had felt for her but the cable balked him address unknown it read believed to have gone abroad in capacity of governess have employed foreign agents will cable their report whether to wait for and be guided by the report of the detectives or to proceed to europe and search for her himself lee did not know he finally determined that to seek for her with no clew to her whereabouts would be but a waste of precious moments while if in their search the agents were successful he would be able to go directly to her meanwhile by cable he asked for protracted leave of absence and while waiting for his answer returned to his post there within a week he received his leave of absence but in a fashion that threatened to remove him forever from the army the constabulary had located the willothewisp brigands behind a stockade built about an extinct volcano and lee and his troop and a mountain battery attempted to dislodge them in the fight that followed lee covered his brows with laurel wreaths and received two bullet wounds in his body for a month death stood at the side of his cot and then still weak and at times delirious with fever by slow stages he was removed to the hospital in manila in one of his sane moments a cable was shown him it read whereabouts still unknown lee at once rebelled against his doctors he must rise he declared and proceed to europe it was upon a matter of life and death the surgeons assured him his remaining exactly where he was also was a matter of as great consequence lees knowledge of his own lack of strength told him they were right then from headquarters he was informed that as a reward for his services and in recognition of his approaching convalescence he was ordered to return to his own climate and that an easy billet had been found for him as a recruiting officer in new york city believing the woman he loved to be in europe this plan for his comfort only succeeded in bringing on a relapse but the day following there came another cablegram it put an abrupt end to his mutiny and brought him and the war department into complete accord she is in new york it read acting as agent for a charitable institution which one not known but hope in a few days to cable correct address in all the world there was no man so happy the next morning a transport was sailing and probably because they had read the cablegram the surgeons agreed with lee that a sea voyage would do him no harm he was carried on board and when the propellers first churned the water and he knew he was moving toward her the hero of the fight around the crater shed unmanly tears he would see her again hear her voice the same great city would shelter them it was worth a dozen bullets he reached new york in a snowstorm a week before christmas and went straight to the office of his lawyers they received him with embarrassment six weeks before on the very day they had cabled him that mrs stedman was in new york she had left the charitable institution where she had been employed and had again disappeared lee sent his trunks to the army and navy club which was immediately around the corner from the recruiting office in sixth avenue and began discharging telegrams at every one who had ever known frances gardner the net result was discouraging in the year and a half in which he had been absent every friend of the girl he sought had temporarily changed his place of residence or was permanently dead meanwhile his arrival by the transport was announced in the afternoon papers at the wharf an admiring trooper had told a fine tale of his conduct at the battle of the crater and reporters called at the club to see him he did not discourage them as he hoped through them the fact of his return might be made known to frances she might send him a line of welcome and he would discover her whereabouts but though many others sent him hearty greetings from her there was no word on the second day after his arrival one of the telegrams was answered in person by a friend of mrs stedman he knew only that she had been in new york that she was very poor and in ill health that she shunned all of her friends and was earning her living as the matron of some sort of a club for working girls he did not know the name of it on the third day there still was no news on the fourth lee decided that the next morning he would advertise he would say only will mrs arthur stedman communicate with messrs fuller fuller fuller fuller were his lawyers that afternoon he remained until six oclock at the recruiting office and when he left it the electric street lights were burning brightly a heavy damp snow was falling and the lights and the falling flakes and the shouts of drivers and the toots of taxicabs made for the man from the tropics a welcome homecoming instead of returning at once to his club he slackened his steps the shop windows of sixth avenue hung with christmas garlands and colored lamps glowed like open fireplaces lee passed slowly before them glad that he had been able to get back at such a season for the moment he had forgotten the woman he sought and was conscious only of his surroundings he had paused in front of the window of a pawnshop over the array of cheap jewelry of banjos shotguns and razors his eyes moved idly and then they became transfixed and staring in the very front of the window directly under his nose was a tarnished silver lovingcup on it was engraved mixed doubles agawamsett in all the world there were only two such cups and as though he were dodging the slash of a bolo lee leaped into the shop many precious seconds were wasted in persuading mrs cohen that he did not believe the cup had been stolen that he was not from the central office that he believed the lady who had pawned the cup had come by it honestly that he meant no harm to the lady that he meant no harm to mrs cohen that much as the young lady may have needed the money mrs cohen had loaned her on the cup he needed the address of the young lady still more mrs cohen retired behind a screen and lee was conscious that from the other side of it the whole family of cohens were taking his measurements he approved of their efforts to protect the owner of the cup but not from him he offered if one of the younger cohens would take him to the young lady to let him first ask her if she would receive captain lee and for his service he would give the young cohen untold gold he exhibited the untold gold the young cohen choked at the sight and sprang into the seat beside the driver of a taxicab to the working girls home on tenth street he commanded through the falling snow and the flashing lights they slid skidded and leaped inside the cab lee shivered with excitement with cold with fear that it might not be true he could not realize she was near it was easier to imagine himself still in the jungle with months of time and sixteen thousand miles of land and water separating them or in the hospital on a whiteenamel cot watching the shadow creep across the whitewashed wall or lying beneath an awning that did not move staring at a burning brazen sea that did not move on a transport that timed by the beating of his heart stood still those days were within the radius of his experience separation absence the immutable giants of time and space he knew with them he had fought and could withstand them but to be near her to hear her voice to bring his love into her actual presence that was an attack upon his feelings which found him without weapons that for a very few dollars she had traded the cup from which she had sworn never to part did not concern him having parted from him what she did with a silver mug was of little consequence it was of significance only in that it meant she was poor and that she was either an inmate or a matron of a lodginghouse for working girls also showed she was poor he had been told that was her condition and that she was in ill health and that from all who loved her she had refused to accept help at the thought his jaws locked pugnaciously there was one who loved her who should she refuse his aid was prepared to make her life intolerable he planned in succession at lightning speed all he might do for her among other things he would make this christmas the happiest she or he would ever know not for an instant did he question that she who had refused help from all who loved her could refuse anything he offered for he knew it was offered with a love that demanded nothing in return with a love that asked only to be allowed to love and to serve to refuse help inspired by such a feeling as his would be morbid wicked ridiculous as though a flower refused to turn its face to the sun and shut its lips to the dew the cab stopped in front of a brick building adorned with many fireescapes afterward he remembered a bare brilliantly lit hall hung with photographs of the acropolis and a stout capable woman in a cap who looked him over and said you will find mrs stedman in the writingroom and he remembered entering a room filled with mission furniture and readinglamps under green shades it was empty except for a young girl in deep black who was seated facing him her head bent above a writingdesk as he came into the circle of the lamps the girl raised her eyes and as though lifted to her feet by what she saw and through no effort of her own stood erect and the young man who had persuaded himself his love demanded nothing who asked only to worship at her gate found his arms reaching out and heard his voice as though it came from a great distance cry frances and the girl who had refused the help of all who loved her like a homing pigeon walked straight into the outstretched arms after five minutes when he was almost able to believe it was true he said in his commanding masterful way and now im going to take you out of here im going to buy you a ring and a sable coat and a house to live in and a dinner which shall we buy first first said frances frowning happily i am afraid we must go to the ritz to tell aunt emily she always loved you and it will make her so happy to the ritz stammered the young man to aunt emily i thought they told me your aunt andyou we quarrelled yes said frances and she has forgiven me but she has not forgiven herself so she spoils me and already i have a house to live in and several sable coats and oh everything everything but the ring i am so sorry cried lee i thought you were poor i hoped you were poor but you are joking he exclaimed delightedly you are here in a working girls home it is one of aunt emilys charities she built it said frances i come here to talk to the girls but persisted lee triumphantly if you are not poor why did you pawn our silver lovingcup the face of the girl became a lovely crimson and tears rose to her eyes as though at a confessional she lifted her hands penitently try to understand she begged i wanted you to love me not for my money but you knew cried lee i had to be sure begged the girl and i wanted to believe you loved me even if i did not love you when it was too late i knew you loved me as no woman ever deserved to be loved and i wanted that love i could not live without it so when i read in the papers you had returned i wouldnt let myself write you i wouldnt let myself beg you to come to see me i set a test for you i knew from the papers you were at the army and navy club and that around the corner was the recruiting office id often seen the sergeant there in uniform at the door i knew you must pass from your club to the office many times each day so i thought of the lovingcup and the pawnshop i planted it there it was a trick a test i thought if you saw it in a pawnshop you would believe i no longer cared for you and that i was very poor if you passed it by then i would know you yourself had stopped caring but if you asked about it if you inquired for me then i would know you came to me of your own wish because you lee shook his head you dont have to tell me he said gently why i came ive a cab outside you will get in it he commanded and we will rescue our cup i always told you they would look well together over an open fireplace the miracle of las palmas this is the story of a gallant officer who loved his profession his regiment his country but above all whiskey of his miraculous conversion to total abstinence and of the humble instrument that worked the miracle at the time it was worked a battalion of the thirtythird infantry had been left behind to guard the zone and was occupying impromptu barracks on the hill above las palmas that was when las palmas was one of the four thousand stations along the forty miles of the panama railroad when the railroad was reconstructed the name of las palmas did not appear on the new timetable and when this story appears las palmas will be eighty feet under water so if any one wishes to dispute the miracle he will have to conduct his investigation in a divingbell on this particular evening young major aintree in command of the battalion had gone up the line to panama to dine at the hotel tivoli and had dined well to prevent his doing this a paternal government had ordered that at the tivoli no alcoholic liquors may be sold but only two hundred yards from the hotel outside the zone of temperance lies panama and angelinas and during the dinner between the tivoli and angelinas the jamaican waiterboys ran relay races after the dinner the jamaican waiterboys proving too slow the dinnerparty in a body adjourned to angelinas and when later major aintree moved across the street to the night train to las palmas he moved unsteadily young standish of the canal zone police who though but twentysix was a full corporal was for that night on duty as train guard and was waiting at the rear steps of the last car as aintree approached the steps he saw indistinctly a boyish figure in khaki and mistaking it for one of his own men he clasped the handrail for support and halted frowning observing the condition of the officer the policeman also frowned but in deference to the uniform slowly and with reluctance raised his hand to his sombrero the reluctance was more apparent than the salute it was less of a salute than an impertinence partly out of regard for his rank partly from temper chiefly from whiskey aintree saw scarlet when you slute your sperior officer he shouted you slute him quick you unnerstan you slute him quick slute me again he commanded and slute me damn quick standish remained motionless as is the habit of policemen over all the world his thumbs were stuck in his belt he answered without offense in tones matteroffact and calm you are not my superior officer he said it was the calmness that irritated aintree his eyes sought for the infantrymans cap and found a sombrero you damned leatherneck he began ill report im not a marine either interrupted standish im a policeman move on he ordered youre keeping these people waiting others of the dinnerparty formed a flying wedge around aintree and crowded him up the steps and into a seat and sat upon him ten minutes later when standish made his rounds of the cars aintree saw him approaching he had a vague recollection that he had been insulted and by a policeman you he called and so loudly that all in the car turned im going to report you going to report you for insolence whats your name looking neither at aintree nor at the faces turned toward him standish replied as though aintree had asked him what time it was standish he said corporal shield number on train guard he continued down the aisle ill remember you aintree shouted but in the hot glaring dawn of the morning after aintree forgot it was standish who remembered the men of the zone police are handpicked they have been soldiers marines cowboys sheriffs black hussars of the pennsylvania state constabulary rough riders with roosevelt mounted police in canada irregular horse in south africa they form one of the bestorganized bestdisciplined most efficient most picturesque semimilitary bodies in the world standish joined them from the philippine constabulary in which he had been a second lieutenant there are several like him in the zone police and in england they would be called gentlemen rankers on the isthmus because of his youth his fellow policemen called standish kid and smart as each of them was each of them admitted the kid wore his uniform with a difference with him it always looked as though it had come freshly ironed from the colon laundry his leather leggings shone like meerschaum pipes the brim of his sombrero rested impudently on the bridge of his nose hes been an officer they used to say in extenuation you can tell when he salutes he shows the back of his hand secretly they were proud of him standish came of a long chain of soldiers and that the weakest link in the chain had proved to be himself was a sorrow no one else but himself could fathom since he was three years old he had been trained to be a soldier as carefully with the same singleness of purpose as the crown prince is trained to be a king and when after three happy glorious years at west point he was found not clever enough to pass the examinations and was dropped he did not curse the gods and die but began again to work his way up he was determined he still would wear shoulderstraps he owed it to his ancestors it was the tradition of his family the one thing he wanted it was his religion he would get into the army even if by the side door if only after many years of rough and patient service he knew that some day through his record through the opportunity of a war he would come into his inheritance meanwhile he officered his soul disciplined his body and daily tried to learn the lesson that he who hopes to control others must first control himself he allowed himself but one dissipation one excess that was to hate major aintree commanding the thirtythird infantry of all the world could give aintree possessed everything that standish considered the most to be desired he was a graduate of west point he had seen service in cuba in the boxer business and in the philippines for an act of conspicuous courage at batangas he had received the medal of honor he had had the luck of the devil wherever he held command turned out to be the place where things broke loose and aintree always attacked and routed them always was the man on the job it was his name that appeared in the newspapers it was his name that headed the list of the junior officers mentioned for distinguished conduct standish had followed his career with an admiration and a joy that was without taint of envy or detraction he gloried in aintree he delighted to know the army held such a man he was grateful to aintree for upholding the traditions of a profession to which he himself gave all the devotion of a fanatic he made a god of him this was the attitude of mind toward aintree before he came to the isthmus up to that time he had never seen his idol aintree had been only a name signed to brilliant articles in the service magazines a man of whom those who had served with him or under him when asked concerning him spoke with loyalty and awe the man the newspapers called the hero of batangas and when at last he saw his hero he believed his worship was justified for aintree looked the part he was built like a greyhound with the shoulders of a stevedore his chin was as projecting and as hard as the pointed end of a flatiron his every movement showed physical fitness and his every glance and tone a confidence in himself that approached insolence he was thirtyeight twelve years older than the youth who had failed to make his commission and who as aintree strode past looked after him with wistful heroworshipping eyes the revulsion when it came was extreme the heroworship gave way to contempt to indignant condemnation in which there was no pity no excuse that one upon whom so much had been lavished who for himself had accomplished such good things should bring disgrace upon his profession should by his example demoralize his men should risk losing all he had attained all that had been given was intolerable when standish learned his hero was a drunkard when day after day aintree furnished visible evidences of that fact standish felt aintree had betrayed him and the army and the government that had educated trained clothed and fed him he regarded aintree as worse than benedict arnold because arnold had turned traitor for power and money aintree was a traitor through mere weakness because he could not say no to a bottle only in secret standish railed against aintree when his brother policemen gossiped and jested about him out of loyalty to the army he remained silent but in his heart he could not forgive the man he had so generously envied the man after whose career he had wished to model his own had voluntarily stepped from his pedestal and made a swine of himself and not only could he not forgive but as day after day aintree furnished fresh food for his indignation he felt a fierce desire to punish meanwhile of the conduct of aintree men older and wiser if less intolerant than standish were beginning to take notice it was after a dinner on ancon hill and the women had left the men to themselves they were the men who were placing the panama canal on the map they were officers of the army who for five years had not worn a uniform but for five years they had been at war with an enemy that never slept daily they had engaged in battle with mountains rivers swamps two oceans and disease where aintree commanded five hundred soldiers they commanded a body of men better drilled better disciplined and in number half as many as those who formed the entire army of the united states the mind of each was occupied with a world problem they thought and talked in millions of millions of cubic yards of dirt of millions of barrels of cement of millions of tons of steel of hundreds of millions of dollars of which latter each received enough to keep himself and his family just beyond the reach of necessity to these men with the world waiting upon the outcome of their endeavor with responsibilities that never relaxed aintrees behavior was an incident an annoyance of less importance than an overturned dirt train that for five minutes dared to block the completion of their work but they were human and loyal to the army and in such an infrequent moment as this over the coffee and cigars they could afford to remember the junior officer to feel sorry for him for the sake of the army to save him from himself he takes his orders direct from the war department said the chief ive no authority over him if hed been one of my workmen id have shipped him north three months ago thats it said the surgeon hes not a workman he has nothing to do and idleness is the curse of the army and in this climate nothing to do snorted the civil administrator keeping his men in hand is what he has to do theyre running amuck all over panama getting into fights with the spiggoty police bringing the uniform into contempt as for the climate its the same climate for all of us look at butlers marines and barbers zone police the climate hasnt hurt them theyre as smart men as ever wore khaki its not the climate or lack of work that ails the thirtythird its their commanding officer so the colonel so the regiment thats as old as the hills until aintree takes a brace his men wont some one ought to talk to him its a shame to see a fine fellow like that going to the dogs because no one has the courage to tell him the truth the chief smiled mockingly then why dont you he asked im a civilian protested the administrator if i told him he was going to the dogs hed tell me to go to the devil no one of you army men must do it hell listen to you young captain haldane of the cavalry was at the table he was visiting panama on leave as a tourist the chief turned to him haldanes the man he said youre his friend and youre his junior in rank so what you say wont sound official tell him people are talking tell him it wont be long before theyll be talking in washington scare him the captain of cavalry smiled dubiously aintrees a hard man to scare he said but if its as bad as you all seem to think ill risk it but why is it he complained that whenever a man has to be told anything particularly unpleasant they always pick on his best friend to tell him it makes them both miserable why not let his bitterest enemy try it the enemy at least would have a fine time because said the chief aintree hasnt an enemy in the worldexcept aintree the next morning as he had promised haldane called upon his friend when he arrived at las palmas although the morning was well advanced toward noon he found aintree still under his mosquito bars and awake only to command a drink the situation furnished haldane with his text he expressed his opinion of any individual friend or no friend officer or civilian who on the zone where all men begin work at sunrise could be found at noon still in his pajamas and preparing to face the duties of the day on an absinth cocktail he said further that since he had arrived on the isthmus he had heard only of aintrees misconduct that soon the war department would hear of it that aintree would lose his commission would break the backbone of a splendid career its a friend talking continued haldane and you know it its because i am your friend that ive risked losing your friendship and whether you like it or not its the truth youre going downhill going fast going like a motorbus running away and unless you put on the brakes youll smash aintree was not even annoyed thats good advice for the right man he granted but why waste it on me i can do things other men cant i can stop drinking this minute and it will mean so little to me that i wont know ive stopped then stop said haldane why demanded aintree i like it why should i stop anything i like because a lot of old women are gossiping because old men who cant drink green mint without dancing turkeytrots think im going to the devil because i can drink whiskey im not afraid of whiskey he laughed tolerantly it amuses me thats all it does to me it amuses me he pulled back the coat of his pajamas and showed his giant chest and shoulder with his fist he struck his bare flesh and it glowed instantly a healthy splendid pink see that commanded aintree if theres a man on the isthmus in any better physical shape than i am ill he interrupted himself to begin again eagerly ill make you a sporting proposition he announced ill fight any man on the isthmus ten rounds no matter who he is a wop laborer shovel man barbadian nigger marine anybody and if he can knock me out ill stop drinking you see he explained patiently im no mollycoddle or jellyfish i can afford a headache and besides its my own head if i dont give anybody else a headache i dont see that its anybody elses damned business but you do retorted haldane steadily youre giving your own men worse than a headache youre setting them a rotten example youre giving the thirtythird a bad name aintree vaulted off his cot and shook his fist at his friend you cant say that to me he cried i do say it protested haldane when you were in manila your men were models here theyre unshaven sloppy undisciplined they look like bellhops and its your fault and everybody thinks so slowly and carefully aintree snapped his fingers and you can tell everybody from me he cried thats all i care what they think and now he continued smiling hospitably let me congratulate you on your success as a missionary and to show you theres not a trace of hard feeling we will have a drink informally haldane reported back to the commission and the wife of one of them must have talked for it was soon known that a brother officer had appealed to aintree to reform and aintree had refused to listen when she heard this grace carter the wife of major carter one of the surgeons at the ancon hospital was greatly perturbed aintree was engaged to be married to helen scott who was her best friend and who was arriving by the next steamer to spend the winter when she had helen safely under her roof mrs carter had planned to marry off the young couple out of hand on the isthmus but she had begun to wonder if it would not be better they should delay or best that they should never marry the awakening is going to be a terrible blow to helen she said to her husband she is so proud of him on the contrary he protested it will be the awakening of aintree if helen will stand for the way hes acting she is not the girl i know and when he finds she wont and that he may lose her hell pull up short hes talked helen to me night after night until hes bored me so i could strangle him he cares more for her than he does for anything for the army or for himself and thats saying a great deal one word from her will be enough helen spoke the word three weeks after she arrived it had not been necessary to tell her of the manner in which her lover was misconducting himself at various dinners given in their honor he had made a nuisance of himself on another occasion while in uniform he had created a scene in the diningroom of the tivoli under the prying eyes of three hundred seeingthecanal tourists and one night he had so badly beaten up a cabman who had laughed at his condition that the man went to the hospital major carter largely with money had healed the injuries of the cabman but helen who had witnessed the assault had suffered an injury that money could not heal she sent for aintree and at the home of her friend delivered her ultimatum i hit him because he was offensive to you said aintree thats why i hit him if id not had a drink in a year id have hit him just as quick and just as hard cant you see said the girl that in being not yourself when i was in your care you were much more insulting to me than any cabman could possibly be when you are like that you have no respect for me or for yourself part of my pride in you is that you are so strong that you control yourself that common pleasures never get a hold on you if you couldnt control your temper i wouldnt blame you because youve a villainous temper and you were born with it but you werent born with a taste for liquor none of your people drank you never drank until you went into the army if i were a man declared the girl id be ashamed to admit anything was stronger than i was you never let pain beat you ive seen you play polo with a broken arm but in this you give pain to others you shame and humiliate the one you pretend to love just because you are weak just because you cant say no aintree laughed angrily drink has no hold on me he protested it affects me as much as the lights and the music affect a girl at her first dance and no more but if you ask me to stop i do not said the girl if you stop youll stop not because i have any influence over you but because you dont need my influence if its wrong if its hurting you if its taking away your usefulness and your power for good thats why youll stop not because a girl begs you or youre not the man i think you aintree retorted warmly im enough of a man for this he protested im enough of a man not to confess i cant drink without making a beast of myself its easy not to drink at all but to stop altogether is a confession of weakness id look on my doing that as cowardly i give you my word not that ill swear off that ill never do but i promise you youll have no further reason to be what you call humiliated or ashamed you have my word for it a week later aintree rode his pony into a railway cutting and rolled with it to the tracks below and if at the time he had not been extremely drunk would have been killed the pony being quite sober broke a leg and was destroyed when word of this came to helen she was too sick at heart to see aintree and by others it was made known to him that on the first steamer miss scott would return north aintree knew why she was going knew she had lost faith and patience knew the woman he loved had broken with him and put him out of her life appalled at this calamity he proceeded to get drunk in earnest the night was very hot and the humidity very heavy and at las palmas inside the bungalow that served as a policestation the lamps on either side of the lieutenants desk burned like tiny furnaces between them panting in the moist heat and with the sweat from his forehead and hand dripping upon an otherwise immaculate report sat standish two weeks before the chief had made him one of his six lieutenants with the force the promotion had been most popular since his promotion standish had been in charge of the policestation at las palmas and daily had seen aintree as on his way down the hill from the barracks to the railroad the hero of batangas passed the door of the stationhouse also on the morning aintree had jumped his horse over the embankment standish had seen him carried up the hill on a stretcher at the sight the lieutenant of police had taken from his pocket a notebook and on a flyleaf made a cross on the flyleaf were many other dates and opposite each a cross it was aintrees record and as the number of black crosses grew the greater had grown the resentment of standish the more greatly it had increased his anger against the man who had put this affront upon the army the greater became his desire to punish in police circles the night had been quiet the cells in the yard were empty the telephone at his elbow had remained silent and standish alone in the stationhouse had employed himself in cramming mosss manual for subalterns he found it a fascinating exercise the hope that soon he might himself be a subaltern always burned brightly and to be prepared seemed to make the coming of that day more certain it was ten oclock and las palmas lay sunk in slumber and after the down train which was now due had passed there was nothing likely to disturb her slumber until at sunrise the great army of dirtdiggers with shrieks of whistles with roars of dynamite with the rumbling of dirttrains and steamshovels again sprang to the attack down the hill a hundred yards below standish the night train halted at the station with creakings and groanings continued toward colon and again las palmas returned to sleep and then quickly and viciously like the crack of a mulewhip came the reports of a pistol and once more the hot and dripping silence on post at the railroadstation whence the shots came was meehan one of the zone police an exsergeant of marines on top of the hill outside the infantry barracks was another policeman bullard once a cowboy standish ran to the veranda and heard the pebbles scattering as bullard leaped down the hill and when in the light from the open door he passed the lieutenant shouted at him to find meehan and report back then the desk telephone rang and standish returned to his chair this is meehan said a voice those shots just now were fired by major aintree he came down on the night train and jumped off after the train was pulling out and stumbled into a negro and fell hes been drinking and he swore the nigger pushed him and the man called aintree a liar aintree pulled his gun and the nigger ran aintree fired twice then i got to him and knocked the gun out of his hand with my nightstick there was a pause until he was sure his voice would be steady and official the boy lieutenant did not speak did he hit the negro he asked i dont know meehan answered the man jumped for the darkest spot he could find the voice of meehan lost its professional calm and became personal and aggrieved aintrees on his way to see you now lieutenant hes going to report me for what the voice over the telephone rose indignantly for knocking the gun out of his hand he says its an assault hes going to break me standish made no comment report here he ordered he heard bullard hurrying up the hill and met him at the foot of the steps theres a nigger began bullard lying under some bushes hush commanded standish from the path below came the sound of footsteps approaching unsteadily and the voice of a man swearing and muttering to himself standish pulled the excowboy into the shadow of the darkness and spoke in eager whispers you understand he concluded you will not report until you see me pick up a cigar from the desk and light it you will wait out here in the darkness when you see me light the cigar you will come in and report the cowboy policeman nodded but without enthusiasm i understand lieutenant he said but he shook his head doubtfully it sizes up to me like what those police up in new york call a frameup standish exclaimed impatiently its not my frameup he said the mans framed himself up all im going to do is to nail him to the wall standish had only time to return to his desk when aintree stumbled up the path and into the stationhouse he was fighting drunk ugly offensive all but incoherent with anger you in charge he demanded he did not wait for an answer ive been saulted he shouted saulted by one of your damned policemen he struck me struck me when i was protecting myself he had a nigger with him first the nigger tripped me then when i tried to protect myself this thug of yours hits me clubs me you unnerstan clubs me i want him he was interrupted by the entrance of meehan who moved into the light from the lamps and saluted his lieutenant thats the man roared aintree the sight of meehan whipped him into greater fury i want that man broke i want to see you strip his shield off him now you unnerstan now for saulting me for saulting an officer in the united states army and if you dont he threw himself into a position of the prizering ill beat him up and you too through want of breath he stopped and panted again his voice broke forth hysterically im not afraid of your damned nightsticks he taunted i got five hundred men on top this hill all ive got to do is to say the word and theyll roughhouse this place and throw it into the cut and you with it standish rose to his feet and across the desk looked steadily at aintree to aintree the steadiness of his eyes and the quietness of his voice were an added aggravation suppose you did said standish that would not save you from what roared aintree think im afraid of your nightsticks from arrest arrest me yelled aintree do you know whos talking to you do you know who i am im major aintree damn you commanding the infantry an im here to charge that thug you are here because you are under arrest said standish you are arrested for threatening the police drunkenness and assaulting a citizen with intent to kill the voice of the young man turned shrill and rasping and if the man should die aintree burst into a bellow of mocking laughter standish struck the desk with his open palm silence he commanded silence to me roared aintree you impertinent pup he flung himself forward shaking his fist im major aintree im your superior officer im an officer an a gentleman you are not replied standish you are a drunken loafer aintree could not break the silence amazement rage stupefaction held him in incredulous wonder even meehan moved uneasily between the officer commanding the infantry and an officer of police he feared the lieutenant would not survive but he heard the voice of his lieutenant continuing evenly coldly like the voice of a judge delivering sentence you are a drunken loafer repeated the boy and you know it and i mean that tomorrow morning every one on the zone shall know it and i mean tomorrow night every one in the states shall know it youve killed a man or tried to and im going to break you with his arm he pointed to meehan break that man he demanded for doing his duty for trying to stop a murder strip him of his shield the boy laughed savagely its you i am going to strip aintree he cried you hero of batangas im going to strip you naked im going to cut the buttons off your coat and tear the stripes away im going to degrade you and disgrace you and drive you out of the army he threw his notebook on the table theres your dossier aintree he said for three months youve been drunk and theres your record the police got it for me its written there with dates and the names of witnesses ill swear to it ive been after you to get you and ive got you with that book with what you did tonight youll leave the army you may resign you may be courtmartialled you may be hung i dont give a damn what they do to you but you will leave the army he turned to meehan and with a jerk of the hand signified aintree put him in a cell he said if he resists aintree gave no sign of resisting he stood motionless his arms hanging limp his eyes protruding the liquor had died in him and his anger had turned chill he tried to moisten his lips to speak but his throat was baked and no sound issued he tried to focus his eyes upon the menacing little figure behind the desk but between the two lamps it swayed and shrank and swelled of one thing only was he sure that some grave disaster had overtaken him something that when he came fully to his senses still would overwhelm him something he could not conquer with his fists his brain even befuddled as it was told him he had been caught by the heels that he was in a trap that smashing this boy who threatened him could not set him free he recognized and it was this knowledge that stirred him with alarm that this was no ordinary officer of justice but a personal enemy an avenging spirit who for some unknown reason had spread a trap who for some private purpose of revenge would drag him down frowning painfully he waved meehan from him wait he commanded i don unnerstan what goods it goin to do you to lock me up an disgrace me what harm have i done you who asked you to run the army anyway who are you my name is standish said the lieutenant my father was colonel of the thirtythird when you first joined it from the academy aintree exclaimed with surprise and enlightenment he broke into hurried speech but standish cut him short and general standish of the mexican war he continued was my grandfather since washington all my people have been officers of the regular army and id been one too if id been bright enough thats why i respect the army thats why im going to throw you out of it youve done harm fifty men as good as you cant undo youve made drunkards of a whole battalion youve taught boys who looked up to you as i looked up to you once to laugh at discipline to make swine of themselves youve set them an example im going to make an example of you thats all there is to this ive got no grudge against you im not vindictive im sorry for you but he paused and pointed his hand at aintree as though it held a gun you are going to leave the army like a man coming out of an ugly dream aintree opened and shut his eyes shivered and stretched his great muscles they watched him with an effort of the will force himself back to consciousness when again he spoke his tone was sane see here standish he began ill not beg of you or any man i only ask you to think what youre doing this means my finish if you force this through tonight it means courtmartial it means i lose my commission i lose lose things you know nothing about and if ive got a record for drinking ive got a record for other things too dont forget that standish shook his head i didnt forget it he said well suppose i did demanded aintree suppose i did go on the loose just to pass the time just because im sick of this damned ditch is it fair to wipe out all that went before for that im the youngest major in the army i served in three campaigns im a medalofhonor man ive got a career ahead of me and and im going to be married if you give me a chance standish struck the table with his fist i will give you a chance he cried if youll give your word to this man and to me that so help you god youll never drink again ill let you go if what standish proposed had been something base aintree could not have accepted it with more contempt ill see you in hell first he said as though the interview was at an end standish dropped into his chair and leaning forward from the table picked up a cigar as he lit it he motioned meehan toward his prisoner but before the policeman could advance the sound of footsteps halted him bullard his eyes filled with concern leaped up the steps and ran to the desk lieutenant he stammered that man the nigger that officer shot hes dead aintree gave a gasp that was partly a groan partly a cry of protest and bullard as though for the first time aware of his presence sprang back to the open door and placed himself between it and aintree its murder he said none of the three men spoke and when meehan crossed to where aintree stood staring fearfully at nothing he had only to touch his sleeve and aintree still staring fell into step beside him from the yard outside standish heard the iron door of the cell swing shut heard the key grate in the lock and the footsteps of meehan returning meehan laid the key upon the desk and with bullard stood at attention waiting give him time whispered standish let it sink in at the end of half an hour standish heard aintree calling and with meehan carrying a lantern stepped into the yard and stopped at the cell door aintree was quite sober his face was set and white his voice was dull with suffering he stood erect clasping the bars in his hands standish he said you gave me a chance a while ago and i refused it i was rough about it im sorry it made me hot because i thought you were forcing my hand blackmailing me into doing something i ought to do as a free agent now i am a free agent you couldnt give me a chance now you couldnt let me go now not if i swore on a thousand bibles i dont know what theyll give me leavenworth for life or hanging or just dismissal but youve got what you wanted im leaving the army between the bars he stretched out his arms and held a hand toward meehan and standish in the same dull numbed voice he continued so now he went on that ive nothing to gain by it i want to swear to you and to this man here that whether i hang or go to jail or am turned loose i will never so help me god take another drink standish was holding the hand of the man who once had been his hero he clutched it tight aintree he cried suppose i could work a miracle suppose ive played a trick on you to show you your danger to show you what might come to you any day does that oath still stand the hand that held his ground the bones together ive given my word cried aintree for the love of god dont torture me is the man alive as standish swung open the cell door the hero of batangas he who could thrash any man on the isthmus crumpled up like a child upon his shoulder and meehan as he ran for water shouted joyfully that nigger he called to bullard can go home now the lieutenant dont want him no more evil to him who evil thinks as a rule the instant the season closed aline proctor sailed on the first steamer for london where awaited her many friends both english and american and to paris where she selected those gowns that on and off the stage helped to make her famous but this particular summer she had spent with the endicotts at bar harbor and it was at their house herbert nelson met her after herbert met her very few other men enjoyed that privilege this was her wish as well as his they behaved disgracefully every morning after breakfast they disappeared and spent the day at opposite ends of a canoe she knowing nothing of a canoe was happy in stabbing the waters with her paddle while he told her how he loved her and at the same time with anxious eyes on his own paddle skilfully frustrated her efforts to drown them both while the affair lasted it was ideal and beautiful but unfortunately it lasted only two months then lord albany temporarily in america as honorary attache to the british embassy his adoring glances his accent and the way he brushed his hair proved too much for the susceptible heart of aline and she chucked herbert and asked herself how a woman of her age could have seriously considered marrying a youth just out of harvard at that time she was a woman of nineteen but as she had been before the public ever since she was eleven the women declared she was not a day under twentysix and the men knew she could not possibly be over sixteen alines own idea of herself was that without some one in love with her she could not exist that unless she knew some man cared for her and for her alone she would wither and die as a matter of fact whether any one loved her or not did not in the least interest her there were several dozen men who could testify to that they knew what she really wanted was to be head over ears in love to adore some one to worship him to imagine herself starving for him and making sacrifice hits for him but when the moment came to make the sacrifice hit and marry the man she invariably found that a greater truer love had arisen for some one else this greater and truer love always made her behave abominably to the youth she had just jilted she wasted no time on postmortems she was so eager to show her absolute loyalty to the new monarch that she grudged every thought she ever had given the one she had cast into exile she resented him bitterly she could not forgive him for having allowed her to be desperately in love with him he should have known he was not worthy of such a love as hers he should have known that the real prince was waiting only just round the corner as a rule the rejected ones behaved well each decided aline was much too wonderful a creature for him and continued to love her cautiously and from a distance none of them ever spoke or thought ill of her and would gladly have punched any one who did it was only the women whose young men aline had temporarily confiscated and then returned saddened and chastened who were spiteful and they dared say no more than that aline would probably have known her mind better if she had had a mother to look after her this coming to the ears of aline caused her to reply that a girl who could not keep straight herself but needed a mother to help her would not keep straight had she a dozen mothers as she put it cheerfully a girl who goes wrong and then pleads no mother to guide her is like a jockey who pulls a race and then blames the horse each of the young men aline rejected married some one else and except when the name of aline proctor in the theatrical advertisements or in electric lights on broadway gave him a start forgot that for a month her name and his own had been linked together from portland to san francisco but the girl he married did not forget she never understood what the public saw in aline proctor that aline was the queen of musical comedy she attributed to the fact that aline knew the right people and got herself written about in the right way but that she could sing dance act that she possessed compelling charm that she got across not only to the tired business man the wine agent the college boy but also to the children and the old ladies was to her never apparent just as aline could not forgive the rejected suitor for allowing her to love him so the girl he married never forgave aline for having loved her husband least of all could sally winthrop who two years after the summer at bar harbor married herbert nelson forgive her and she let herbert know it herbert was properly in love with sally winthrop but he liked to think that his engagement to aline though brief and abruptly terminated had proved him to be a man fatally attractive to all women and though he was hypnotizing himself into believing that his feeling for aline had been the grand passion the truth was that all that kept her in his thoughts was his own vanity he was not discontented with his lot his lot being sally winthrop her millions and her estate of three hundred acres near westbury nor was he still longing for aline it was only that his vanity was flattered by the recollection that one of the young women most beloved by the public had once loved him i once was a king in babylon he used to misquote to himself and she was a christian slave he was as young as that had he been content in secret to assure himself that he once had been a reigning monarch his vanity would have harmed no one but unfortunately he possessed certain documentary evidence to that fact and he was sufficiently foolish not to wish to destroy it the evidence consisted of a dozen photographs he had snapped of aline during the happy days at bar harbor and on which she had written phrases somewhat exuberant and sentimental from these photographs nelson was loath to part especially with one that showed aline seated on a rock that ran into the waters of the harbor and on which she had written as long as this rock lasts each time she was in love aline believed it would last that in the past it never had lasted did not discourage her what to do with these photographs that so vividly recalled the most tumultuous period of his life nelson could not decide if he hid them away and sally found them he knew she would make his life miserable if he died and sally then found them when he no longer was able to explain that they meant nothing to him she would believe he always had loved the other woman and it would make her miserable he felt he could not safely keep them in his own house his vanity did not permit him to burn them and accordingly he decided to unload them on some one else the young man to whom he confided his collection was charles cochran cochran was a charming person from the west he had studied in the beaux arts and on foot had travelled over england and europe preparing himself to try his fortune in new york as an architect he was now in the office of the architects post constant and lived alone in a tiny farmhouse he had made over for himself near herbert nelson at westbury long island post constant were a fashionable firm and were responsible for many of the french chateaux and english country houses that were rising near westbury hempstead and roslyn and it was cochrans duty to drive over that territory in his runabout keep an eye on the contractors and dissuade clients from grafting mansard roofs on italian villas he had built the summer home of the herbert nelsons and herbert and charles were very warm friends charles was of the same lack of years as was herbert of an enthusiastic and sentimental nature and like many other young men the story of his life also was the lovely and muchdesired aline proctor it was this coincidence that had made them friends and that had led herbert to select charles as the custodian of his treasure as a custodian and confidant charles especially appealed to his new friend because except upon the stage and in restaurants charles had never seen aline proctor did not know her and considered her so far above him so unattainable that he had no wish to seek her out unknown he preferred to worship at a distance in this determination herbert strongly encouraged him when he turned over the pictures to charles herbert could not resist showing them to him they were in many ways charming they presented the queen of musical comedy in several new roles in one she was in a sailor suit giving an imitation of a girl paddling a canoe in another she was in a ridinghabit mounted upon a pony of which she seemed very much afraid in some she sat like a siren among the rocks with the waves and seaweed snatching at her feet and in another she crouched beneath the wheel of herberts touring car all of the photographs were unprofessional and intimate and the legends scrawled across them were even more intimate as long as this rock lasts read herbert at arms length he held the picture for cochran to see and laughed bitterly and unmirthfully as he had heard leading men laugh in problem plays that is what she wrote he mocked but how long did it last until she saw that little redheaded albany playing polo that lasted until his mother heard of it she thought her precious lamb was in the clutches of a designing actress and made the foreign office cable him home then aline took up one of those army aviators and chucked him for that fellow who painted her portrait and threw him over for the lawntennis champion now shes engaged to chester griswold and heaven pity her of course hes the greatest catch in america but hes a prig and a snob and hes so generous with his money that hell give you five pennies for a nickel any time you ask him hes got a heart like the metre of a taxicab and hes jealous as a cat aline will have a fine time with chester i knew him at st pauls and at harvard and hes got as much red blood in him as an eel cochran sprang to the defense of the lady of his dreams there must be some good in the man he protested or miss proctor oh those solemn snobs declared herbert impress women by just keeping still griswold pretends the reason he doesnt speak to you is because hes too superior but the real reason is that he knows whenever he opens his mouth he shows he is an ass reluctantly herbert turned over to charles the precious pictures it would be a sin to destroy them wouldnt it he prompted cochran agreed heartily you might even suggested herbert leave one or two of them about you have so many of aline already that one more wouldnt be noticed then when i drop in i could see it he smiled ingratiatingly but those i have i bought cochran pointed out anybody can buy them but yours are personal and theyre signed no one will notice that but me protested herbert just one or two he coaxedstuck round among the others theyd give me a heap of melancholy pleasure charles shook his head doubtfully your wife often comes here with you he said i dont believe theyd give her melancholy pleasure the question is are you married to sally or to aline proctor oh of course exclaimed herbert if you refuse with suspicious haste charles surrendered i dont refuse he explained i only ask if its wise sally knows you were once very fond of miss proctor knows you were engaged to her but protested herbert sally sees your photographs of aline what difference can a few more make after shes seen a dozen she gets used to them no sooner had herbert left him than the custodian of the treasure himself selected the photographs he would display in them the young woman he had from the front row of the orchestra so ardently admired appeared in a new light to cochran they seemed at once to render her more kindly more approachable to show her as she really was the sort of girl any youth would find it extremely difficult not to love cochran found it extremely easy the photographs gave his imagination all the room it wanted he believed they also gave him an insight into her real character that was denied to anybody else he had always credited her with all the virtues he now endowed her with every charm of mind and body in a week to the two photographs he had selected from the loan collection for purposes of display and to give herbert melancholy pleasure he had added three more in two weeks there were half a dozen in a month nobly framed in silver in leather of red green and blue the entire collection smiled upon him from every part of his bedroom for he now kept them where no one but himself could see them no longer was he of a mind to share his borrowed treasure with others not even with the rightful owner chester griswold spurred on by aline proctor who wanted to build a summer home on long island was motoring with post of post constant in the neighborhood of westbury post had pointed out several houses designed by his firm which he hoped might assist griswold in making up his mind as to the kind of house he wanted but none they had seen had satisfied his client what i want is a cheap house explained the young millionaire i dont really want a house at all he complained its miss proctors idea when we are married i intend to move into my mothers town house but miss proctor wants one for herself in the country ive agreed to that but it must be small and it must be cheap cheap was a word that the clients of post constant never used but post knew the weaknesses of some of the truly rich and he knew also that no house ever built cost only what the architect said it would cost i know the very house you want he exclaimed one of our young men owns it he made it over from an old farmhouse its very well arranged weve used his groundplan several times and it works out splendidly if hes not at home i show you over the place myself and if you like the house hes the man to build you one when they reached cochrans home he was at garden city playing golf but the servant knew mr post and to him and his client threw open every room in the house now this exclaimed the architect enthusiastically is the masters bedroom in your case it would probably be your wifes room and you would occupy the one adjoining which cochran now uses as a guestroom as you see they are entirely cut off from mr griswold did not see up to that moment he had given every appearance of being both bored and sulky now his attention was entirely engaged but not upon the admirable simplicity of mr cochrans groundplan as mr post had hoped instead the eyes of the greatest catch in america were intently regarding a display of photographs that smiled back at him from every corner of the room not only did he regard these photographs with a savage glare but he approached them and carefully studied the inscriptions scrawled across the face of each post himself cast a glance at the nearest photographs and then hastily manoeuvred his client into the hall and closed the door we will now he exclaimed visit the butlers pantry which opens upon the diningroom and kitchen thus saving but griswold did not hear him without giving another glance at the house he stamped out of it and plumping himself down in the motorcar banged the door not until post had driven him well into new york did he make any comment what did you say he then demanded is the name of the man who owns that last house we saw post told him i never heard of him said griswold as though he were delivering young cochrans death sentence who is he hes an architect in our office said post we think a lot of him hell leave us soon of course the best ones always do his work is very popular so is he i never heard of him repeated griswold then with sudden heat he added savagely but i mean to tonight when griswold had first persuaded aline proctor to engage herself to him he had suggested that to avoid embarrassment she should tell him the names of the other men to whom she had been engaged what kind of embarrassment would that avoid if i am talking to a man said griswold and he knows the woman im going to marry was engaged to him and i dont know that he has me at a disadvantage i dont see that he has said aline if we suppose for the sake of argument that to marry me is desirable i would say that the man who was going to marry me had the advantage over the one i had declined to marry i want to know who those men are explained griswold because i want to avoid them i dont want to talk to them i dont want even to know them i dont see how i can help you said aline i havent the slightest objection to telling you the names of the men i have cared for if i can remember them but i certainly do not intend to tell you the name of any man who cared for me enough to ask me to marry him thats his secret not mine certainly not yours griswold thought he was very proud he really was very vain and as jealousy is only vanity in its nastiest development he was extremely jealous so he persisted will you do this he demanded if i ever ask you is that one of the men you cared for will you tell me if you wish it said aline but i cant see any health in it it will only make you uncomfortable so long as you know i have given you the greatest and truest love i am capable of why should you concern yourself with my mistakes so that i can avoid meeting what you call your mistakes said griswold and being friendly with them i assure you laughed aline it wouldnt hurt you a bit to be as friendly with them as theyd let you maybe they werent as proud of their families as you are but they made up for that by being a darned sight prouder of me later undismayed by this and unashamed on two occasions griswold actually did demand of aline if a genial youth she had just greeted joyfully was one of those for whom she once had cared and aline had replied promptly and truthfully that he was but in the case of charles cochran griswold did not ask aline if he was one of those for whom she once had cared he considered the affair with cochran so serious that in regard to that man he adopted a different course in digging rivals out of the past his jealousy had made him indefatigable but in all his researches he never had heard the name of charles cochran that fact and the added circumstance that aline herself never had mentioned the man was in his eyes so suspicious as to be almost a damning evidence of deception and he argued that if in the past aline had deceived him as to charles cochran she would continue to do so accordingly instead of asking her frankly for the truth he proceeded to lay traps for it and if there is one thing truth cannot abide it is being hunted by traps that evening aline and he were invited to a supper in her honor and as he drove her from the theatre to the home of their hostess he told her of his search earlier in the day the electric light in the limousine showed alines face as clearly as though it were held in a spotlight and as he prepared his trap griswold regarded her jealously post tells me he said he has the very man you want for your architect hes sure youll find him most understanding and andsympathetic hes a young man who is just coming to the front and hes very popular especially with women whats his being popular with women asked aline got to do with his carrying out my ideas of a house thats just it said griswold its the woman who generally has the most to say as to how her house shall be built and this man understands woman i have reasons for believing he will certainly understand you if he understands me well enough to give me all the linenclosets i want said aline he will be perfectly satisfactory before delivering his blow griswold sank back into his corner of the car drew his hat brim over his forehead and fixed spying eyes upon the very lovely face of the girl he had asked to marry him his name he said in fateful tones is charles cochran it was supposed to be a body blow but to his distress aline neither started nor turned pale neither for trying to trick her did she turn upon him in reproof and anger instead with alert eyes she continued to peer out of the window at the electriclight advertisements and her beloved broadway well demanded griswold his tone was hoarse and heavy with meaning well what asked aline pleasantly how demanded griswold do you like charles cochran for an architect how should i know asked aline ive not met him yet she had said it and she had said it without the waver of one of her lovely eyelashes no wonder the public already hailed her as a finished actress griswold felt that his worst fears were justified she had lied to him and as he knew she had never before lied to him that now she did so proved beyond hope of doubt that the reason for it was vital imperative and compelling but of his suspicions griswold gave no sign he would not at once expose her he had trapped her but as yet she must not know that he would wait until he had still further entangled her until she could not escape and then with complete proof of her deceit he would confront and overwhelm her with this amiable purpose in mind he called early the next morning upon post constant and asked to see mr cochran he wished he said to consult him about the new house post had not yet reached the office and of griswolds visit with post to his house cochran was still ignorant he received griswold most courteously he felt that the man who was loved by the girl he also had long and hopelessly worshipped was deserving of the highest consideration griswold was less magnanimous when he found his rival for as such he beheld him was of charming manners and gallant appearance he considered that fact an additional injury but he concealed his resentment for he was going to trap cochran too he found the architect at work leaning over a drawingboard and as they talked cochran continued to stand he was in his shirtsleeves which were rolled to his shoulders and the breadth of those shoulders and the muscles of his sunburned arms were much in evidence griswold considered it a vulgar exhibition for over ten minutes they talked solely of the proposed house but not once did griswold expose the fact that he had seen any more of it than any one might see from the public road when he rose to take his leave he said how would it do if i motored out sunday and showed your house to miss proctor sunday is the only day she has off and if it would not inconvenience you the tender heart of cochran leaped in wild tumult he could not conceal his delight nor did he attempt to do so and his expression made it entirely unnecessary for him to assure griswold that such a visit would be entirely welcome and that they might count on finding him at home as though it were an afterthought griswold halted at the door and said i believe you are already acquainted with miss proctor cochran conscious of five years of devotion found that he was blushing and longed to strangle himself nor was the blush lost upon griswold im sorry said cochran but ive not had that honor on the stage of course he shrugged the broad shoulders deprecatingly as though to suggest that not to know miss proctor as an artist argues oneself unknown griswold pretended to be puzzled as though endeavoring to recall a past conversation he frowned but aline he said told me she had met youmet you at bar harbor in the fatal photographs the familiar landfalls of bar harbor had been easily recognized the young architect shook his head it must be another cochran he suggested i have never been in bar harbor with the evidence of the photographs before him this last statement was a verdict of guilty and griswold not with the idea of giving cochran a last chance to be honest but to cause him to dig the pit still deeper continued to lead him on maybe she meant york harbor again cochran shook his head and laughed believe me he said if id ever met miss proctor anywhere i wouldnt forget it ten minutes later griswold was talking to aline over the telephone he intended to force matters he would show aline she could neither trifle with nor deceive chester griswold but the thought that he had been deceived was not what most hurt him what hurt him was to think that aline had preferred a man who looked like an advertisement for readymade clothes and who worked in his shirtsleeves griswold took it for granted that any woman would be glad to marry him so many had been willing to do so that he was convinced when one of them was not it was not because there was anything wrong with him but because the girl herself lacked taste and perception that the others had been in any degree moved by his many millions had never suggested itself he was convinced each had loved him for himself alone and if aline after meeting him would still consider any one else it was evident something was very wrong with aline he was determined that she must be chastened must be brought to a proper appreciation of her good fortune and of his condescension on being called to the telephone at ten in the morning aline demanded to know what could excuse griswold for rousing her in the middle of the night griswold replied that though the day was young it also was charming that on sunday there might be rain and that if she desired to see the house he and post thought would most suit her he and his car would be delighted to convey her to it they could make the run in an hour lunch with friends at westbury and return in plenty of time for the theatre aline was delighted at the sudden interest griswold was showing in the new house without a moments hesitation she walked into the trap she would go she declared with pleasure in an hour he should call for her exactly an hour later post arrived at his office he went directly to cochran charles he said im afraid i got you into trouble yesterday i took a client to see your house you have often let us do it before but since i was there last youve made some changes in your bedroom post stopped cochrans naive habit of blushing told him it was not necessary to proceed in tones of rage and mortification cochran swore explosively post was relieved to find he was swearing at himself i ought to be horsewhipped roared cochran ill never forgive myself who he demanded saw the pictures was it a man or a woman post laughed unhappily it was chester griswold a remarkable change came over cochran instead of sobering him as post supposed it would the information made him even more angry only now his anger was transferred from himself to griswold the blanketyblank bounder yelled cochran that was what he wanted thats why he came here here demanded post not an hour ago cried cochran he asked me about bar harbor he saw those pictures were taken at bar harbor i think said post soothingly hed a right to ask questions there were so many pictures and they were very well very id have answered his questions roared cochran if hed asked them like a man but he came snooping down here to spy on me he tried to trick me he insulted me he insulted her he emitted a howl of dismay and i told him id never been to bar harbor that id never met aline proctor cochran seized his coat and hat he shouted to one of the office boys to telephone the garage for his car what are you where are you going demanded post im going home first cried cochran to put those pictures in a safe as i should have done three months ago and then im going to find chester griswold and tell him hes an ass and a puppy if you do that protested post youre likely to lose us a very valuable client and your client roared charles is likely to lose some very valuable teeth as charles whirled into the country road in which stood his house he saw drawn up in front of it the long gray car in which that morning chester griswold had called at the office cochran emitted a howl of anger was his home again to be invaded and again while he was absent to what extreme would griswolds jealousy next lead him he fell out of his own car while it still moved and leaped up the garden walk the front rooms of the house were empty but from his bedroom he heard raised in excited tones the voice of griswold the audacity of the man was so surprising and his own delight at catching him redhanded so satisfying that no longer was cochran angry the lord had delivered his enemy into his hands and as he advanced toward his bedroom not only was he calm but at the thought of his revenge distinctly jubilant in the passageway a frightened maid servant who at his unexpected arrival was now even more frightened endeavored to give him an explanation but he waved her into silence and striding before her entered his bedroom he found confronting him a tall and beautiful young woman it was not the aline proctor he knew it was not the wellpoised gracious and distinguished beauty he had seen gliding among the tables at sherrys or throwing smiles over the footlights this aline proctor was a very indignant young person with flashing eyes tossing head and a stamping foot extended from her at arms length she held a photograph of herself in a heavy silver frame and as though it were a weapon she was brandishing it in the face of chester griswold as cochran in amazement halted in the doorway she was exclaiming i told you i didnt know charles cochran i tell you so now if you cant believe me out of the corner of her flashing eyes the angry lady caught sight of cochran in the doorway she turned upon the intruder as though she meant forcibly to eject him who are you she demanded her manner and tone seemed to add and what the deuce are you doing here charles answered her tone i am charles cochran he said i live here this is my house these words had no other effect upon miss proctor than to switch her indignation down another track she now turned upon charles then if this is your house cried that angry young person why have you filled it with photographs of me that belong to some one else charles saw that his hour had come his sin had found him out he felt that to prevaricate would be only stupid griswold had tried devious methods and look where his devious methods had dumped him griswold certainly was in wrong charles quickly determined to adopt a course directly opposite griswold had shown an utter lack of confidence in aline charles decided that he would give her his entire confidence would throw himself upon the mercy of the court i have those photographs in my house miss proctor he said because i have admired you a long time they were more like you than those i could buy having them here has helped me a lot and it hasnt done you any harm you know very well you have anonymous admirers all over this country im only one of them if i have offended i have offended with many many thousands already it has been related that cochran was very good to look upon at the present moment as he spoke in respectful even soulful accents meekly and penitently proclaiming his longconcealed admiration miss proctor found her indignation melting like an icicle in the sun still she did not hold herself cheaply she was accustomed to such open flattery she would not at once capitulate but these pictures she protested i gave to a man i knew you have no right to them they are not at all the sort of picture i would give to an utter stranger with anxiety the lovely lady paused for a reply she hoped that the reply the tall young man with appealing eyes would make would be such as to make it possible for her to forgive him he was not given time to reply with a mocking snort griswold interrupted aline and charles had entirely forgotten him an utter stranger mimicked griswold oh yes hes an utter stranger youre pretty good actors both of you but you cant keep that up long and youd better stop it now stop what asked miss proctor her tone was cold and calm but in her eyes was a strange light it should have warned griswold that he would have been safer under the bed stop pretending cried griswold i wont have it i dont understand said miss proctor she spoke in the same cold voice only now it had dropped several degrees nearer freezing i dont think you understand yourself you wont have what griswold now was frightened and that made him reckless instead of withdrawing he plunged deeper i wont have you two pretending you dont know each other he blustered i wont stand being fooled if youre going to deceive me before were married what will you do after were married charles emitted a howl it was made up of disgust amazement and rage fiercely he turned upon miss proctor let me have him he begged no almost shouted miss proctor her tone was no longer cold it was volcanic her eyes flashing beautifully were fixed upon griswold she made a gesture as though to sweep charles out of the room please go she demanded this does not concern you her tone was one not lightly to be disregarded charles disregarded it it does concern me he said briskly nobody can insult a woman in my house you least of all he turned upon the greatest catch in america griswold he said i never met this lady until i came into this room but i know her understand her value her better than youd understand her if you knew her a thousand years griswold allowed him to go no farther i know this much he roared she was in love with the man who took those photographs and that man was in love with her and youre that man what if i am roared back charles men always have loved her men always will because shes a fine big wonderful woman you cant see that and you never will you insulted her now ill give you time to apologize for that and then ill order you out of this house and if miss proctor is the sort of girl i think she is shell order you out of it too both men swung toward miss proctor her eyes were now smiling excitedly she first turned them upon charles blushing most becomingly miss proctor she said hopes she is the sort of girl mr cochran thinks she is she then turned upon the greatest catch in america you neednt wait chester she said not even to apologize chester griswold alone in his car was driven back to new york on the way he invented a story to explain why at the eleventh hour he had jilted aline proctor but when his thoughts reverted to the young man he had seen working with his sleeves rolled up he decided it would be safer to let miss proctor tell of the broken engagement in her own way charles would not consent to drive his fair guest back to new york until she had first honored him with her presence at luncheon it was served for two on his veranda under the climbing honeysuckles during the luncheon he told her all miss proctor in the light of his five years of devotion magnanimously forgave him such a pretty house she exclaimed as they drove away from it when griswold selected it for our honeymoon he showed his first appreciation of what i really like it is still at your service said charles miss proctors eyes smiled with a strange light but she did not speak it was a happy ride but when charles left her at the door of her apartmenthouse he regarded sadly and with regret the bundle of retrieved photographs that she carried away what is it she asked kindly im thinking of going back to those empty frames said charles and blushed deeply miss proctor blushed also with delighted and guilty eyes she hastily scanned the photographs snatching one from the collection she gave it to him and then ran up the steps in the light of the spring sunset the eyes of charles devoured the photograph of which at last he was the rightful owner on it was written as long as this rock lasts as charles walked to his car his expression was distinctly thoughtful the men of zanzibar when his hunting trip in uganda was over hemingway shipped his specimens and weapons direct from mombasa to new york but he himself journeyed south over the few miles that stretched to zanzibar on the outward trip the steamer had touched there and the little he saw of the place had so charmed him that all the time he was on safari he promised himself he would not return home without revisiting it on the morning he arrived he had called upon harris his consul to inquire about the hotel and that evening harris had returned his call and introduced him at the club one of the men there asked hemingway what brought him to africa and when he answered simply and truthfully that he had come to shoot big game it was as though he had said something clever and every one smiled on the way back to the hotel as they felt their way through the narrow slits in the wall that served as streets he asked the consul why every one had smiled the consul laughed evasively its a local joke he explained a lot of men come here for reasons best kept to themselves and they all say what you said that theyve come to shoot big game its grown to be a polite way of telling a man it is none of his business but i didnt mean it that way protested hemingway i really have been after big game for the last eight months in the tone one uses to quiet a drunken man or a child the consul answered soothingly of course he assented of course you have but to show he was not hopelessly credulous and to keep hemingway from involving himself deeper he hinted tactfully maybe they noticed you came ashore with only one steamer trunk and no guncases oh thats easily explained laughed hemingway my heavy luggage the consul had reached his house and his boy was pounding upon it with his heavy staff please dont explain to me he begged its quite unnecessary down here were so darned glad to see any white man that we dont ask anything of him except that he wont hurry away we judge them as they behave themselves here we dont care what they are at home or why they left it hemingway was highly amused to find that he a respectable sportloving hemingway of massachusetts should be mistaken for a gunrunner slavedealer or escaping cashier greatly delighted him all right he exclaimed ill promise not to bore you with my past and i agree to be judged by zanzibar standards i only hope i can live up to them for i see i am going to like the place very much hemingway kept his promise he bored no one with confidences as to his ancestors of his past he made a point never to speak he preferred that the little community into which he had dropped should remain unenlightened should take him as they found him of the fact that a college was named after his grandfather and that on his fathers railroad he could travel through many states he was discreetly silent the men of zanzibar asked no questions that hemingway could play a stiff game of tennis a stiffer game of poker and on the piano songs from home was to them sufficient recommendation in a week he had become one of the most popular members of zanzibar society it was as though he had lived there always hemingway found himself reaching out to grasp the warmth of the place as a flower turns to the sun he discovered that for thirty years something in him had been cheated for thirty years he had believed that completely to satisfy his soul all he needed was the gray stone walls and the grayshingled cabins under the gray skies of new england that what in nature he most loved was the pine forests and the fields of goldenrod on the rockbound coast of the north shore but now like a man escaped from prison he leaped and danced in the glaring sunlight of the equator he revelled in the reckless generosity of nature in the glorious confusion of colors in the blooming blue of the indian ocean in the arabian nights spent upon the housetops under the purple sky and beneath silver stars so near that he could touch them with his hand he found it like being perpetually in a comic opera and playing a part in one for only the scenic artist would dare to paint houses in such yellow pink and cobaltblue only a producer who had never ventured farther from broadway than the atlantic city boardwalk would have conceived costumes so mad and so magnificent instinctively he cast the people of zanzibar in the conventional roles of musical comedy his choruses were already in waiting there was the sultans bodyguard in goldlaced turbans the merchants of the bazaars in red fezzes and gowns of flowing silk the malay sailors in blue the black native police in scarlet the ladies of the harems closely veiled and cloaked the market women in a single garment of orange or scarlet or purple or of all three and the happy hilarious zanzibari boys in the color god gave them for hours he would sit under the yellowandgreen awning of the greek hotel and watch the procession pass or he would lie under an umbrella on the beach and laugh as the boatmen lifted their passengers to their shoulders and with them splash through the breakers or in the bazaars for hours he would bargain with the indian merchants or in the great mahogany hall of the ivory house to the whisper of a punka and the tinkle of ice in a tall glass listen to tales of arab raids of elephant poachers of the trade in white and black ivory of the great explorers who had sat in that same room of emin pasha of livingstone of stanley his comic opera lacked only a heroine and the love interest when he met mrs adair he found both polly adair as every one who dared to do so preferred to call her was like himself an american and though absurdly young a widow in the states she would have been called an extremely pretty girl in a community where the few dozen white women had wilted and faded in the fierce sun of the equator and where the rest of the women were jet black except their teeth which were dyed an alluring purple polly adair was as beautiful as a june morning at least so hemingway thought the first time he saw her and each succeeding time he thought her more beautiful more lovely more to be loved he met her three days after his arrival at the residence of the british agent and consulgeneral where lady firth was giving tea to the six nurses from the english hospital and to all the other respectable members of zanzibar society my husbands typist said her ladyship as she helped hemingway to tea is a copatriot of yours shes such a nice gell not a bit like an american i dont know what id do in this awful place without her promise me she begged tragically you will not ask her to marry you unconscious of his fate hemingway promised because all the men do sighed lady firth and i never know what morning one of the wretches wont carry her off to a home of her own and then what would become of me men are so selfish if you must fall in love suggested her ladyship promise me you will fall in love with she paused innocently and raised babyblue eyes in a babylike stare with some one else again hemingway promised he bowed gallantly that will be quite easy he said her ladyship smiled but hemingway did not see the smile he was looking past her at a girl from home who came across the terrace carrying in her hand a stenographers notebook lady firth followed the direction of his eyes and saw the look in them she exclaimed with dismay already already he deserts me even before the ink is dry on the paper she drew the notebook from mrs adairs fingers and dropped it under the teatable letters must wait my child she declared but sir george protested the girl sir george must wait too continued his wife the foreign office must wait the british empire must wait until you have had your tea the girl laughed helplessly as though assured her fellow countryman would comprehend she turned to him theyre so exactly like what you want them to be she said i mean about their tea hemingway smiled back with such intimate understanding that lady firth glanced up inquiringly have you met mrs adair already she asked no said hemingway but i have been trying to meet her for thirty years perplexed the englishwoman frowned and then with delight at her own perspicuity laughed aloud i know she cried in your country you are what they call a hustler is that right she waved them away take mrs adair over there she commanded and tell her all the news from home tell her about the railroad accidents and washouts and the latest thing in lynching the young people stretched out in long wicker chairs in the shade of a tree covered with purple flowers on a perch at one side of them an orangoutang in a steel belt was combing the whiskers of her infant daughter at their feet what looked like two chow puppies but which happened to be lady firths pet lions were chewing each others toothless gums and in the immediate foreground the hospital nurses were defying the sun at tennis while the sultans band played selections from a gaiety success of many years in the past with these surroundings it was difficult to talk of home nor on any later occasions except through inadvertence did they talk of home for the reasons already stated it amused hemingway to volunteer no confidences on account of what that same evening harris told him of mrs adair he asked none harris himself was a young man in no way inclined to withhold confidences he enjoyed giving out information he enjoyed talking about himself his duties the other consuls the zanzibaris and his native state of iowa so long as he was permitted to talk the listener could select the subject but combined with his loquacity hemingway had found him kindhearted intelligent observing and the call of a common country had got them quickly together hemingway was quite conscious that the girl he had seen but once had impressed him out of all proportion to what he knew of her she seemed too good to be true and he tried to persuade himself that after eight months in the hinterland among hippos and zebras any reasonably attractive girl would have proved equally disturbing but he was not convinced he did not wish to be convinced he assured himself that had he met mrs adair at home among hundreds of others he would have recognized her as a woman of exceptional character as one especially charming he wanted to justify this idea of her he wanted to talk of mrs adair to harris not to learn more concerning her but just for the pleasure of speaking her name he was much upset at that and the discovery that on meeting a woman for the first time he still could be so boyishly and ingenuously moved greatly pleased him it was a most delightful secret so he acted on the principle that when a man immensely admires a woman and wishes to conceal that fact from every one else he can best do so by declaring his admiration in the frankest and most open manner after the teaparty as harris and himself sat in the consulate he so expressed himself what an extraordinary nice girl he exclaimed is that mrs adair i had a long talk with her she is most charming however did a woman like that come to be in a place like this judging from his manner it seemed to hemingway that at the mention of mrs adairs name he had found harris mentally on guard as though the consul had guessed the question would come and had prepared for it she just dropped in here one day said harris from no place in particular personally i always have thought from heaven its a good address said hemingway it seems to suit her the consul agreed anyway if she doesnt come from there thats where shes going just on account of the good shes done us while shes been here she arrived four months ago with a typewritingmachine and letters to me from our consuls in cape town and durban she had done some typewriting for them it seems that after her husband died which was a few months after they were married she learned to make her living by typewriting she worked too hard and broke down and the doctor said she must go to hot countries the hotter the better so shes worked her way half around the world typewriting she worked chiefly for her own consuls or for the american commission houses sometimes she stayed a month sometimes only over one steamer day but when she got here lady firth took such a fancy to her that she made sir george engage her as his private secretary and shes been here ever since in a community so small as was that of zanzibar the white residents saw one another every day and within a week hemingway had met mrs adair many times he met her at dinner at the british agency he met her in the country club where the white exiles gathered for tea and tennis he hired a launch and in her honor gave a picnic on the north coast of the island and on three glorious and memorable nights after different dinnerparties had ascended to the roof he sat at her side and across the white level of the housetops looked down into the moonlit harbor what interest the two young people felt in each other was in no way discouraged by their surroundings in the tropics the tender emotions are not winter killed had they met at home the conventions his own work her social duties would have kept the progress of their interest within a certain speed limit but they were in a place free of conventions and the preceding eight months which hemingway had spent in the jungle and on the plain had made the society of his fellow man and of mrs adair in particular especially attractive hemingway had no work to occupy his time and he placed it unreservedly at the disposition of his countrywoman in doing so it could not be said that mrs adair encouraged him hemingway himself would have been the first to acknowledge this from the day he met her he was conscious that always there was an intangible barrier between them even before she possibly could have guessed that his interest in her was more than even she attractive as she was had the right to expect she had wrapped around herself an invisible mantle of defense there were certain speeches of his which she never heard certain tones to which she never responded at moments when he was complimenting himself that at last she was content to be in his company she would suddenly rise and join the others and he would be left wondering in what way he could possibly have offended he assured himself that a woman young and attractive in a strange land in her dependent position must of necessity be discreet but in his conduct there certainly had been nothing that was not considerate courteous and straightforward when he appreciated that he cared for her seriously that he was gloriously happy in caring and proud of the way in which he cared the fact that she persistently held him at arms length puzzled and hurt at first when he had deliberately set to work to make her like him he was glad to think that owing to his reticence about himself if she did like him it would be for himself alone and not for his worldly goods but when he knew her better he understood that if once mrs adair made up her mind to take a second husband the fact that he was a social and financial somebody and not as many in zanzibar supposed hemingway to be a social outcast would make but little difference nor was her manner to be explained by the fact that the majority of women found him unattractive as to that the pleasant burden of his experience was to the contrary he at last wondered if there was some one else if he had come into her life too late he set about looking for the man and so he believed he soon found him of the little colony arthur fearing was the man of whom hemingway had seen the least that was so because fearing wished it like himself fearing was an american young and a bachelor but very much unlike hemingway a hermit and a recluse two years before he had come to zanzibar looking for an investment for his money in zanzibar there were gentlemen adventurers of every country who were welcome to live in any country save their own to them mr fearing seemed a heavensent victim but to him their alluring tales of the fortunes that were to rise from buried treasures lost mines and pearl beds did not appeal instead he conferred with the consuls the responsible merchants the partners in the prosperous trading houses after a month of looking around he had purchased outright the goodwill and stock of one of the oldest of the commission houses and soon showed himself to be a most capable man of business but except as a man of business no one knew him from the dim recesses of his warehouse he passed each day to the seclusion of his bungalow in the country and although every one was friendly to him he made no friends it was only after the arrival of mrs adair that he consented to show himself and it was soon noted that it was only when she was invited that he would appear and that on these occasions he devoted himself entirely to her in the presence of others he still was shy gravely polite and speaking but little and never of himself but with mrs adair his shyness seemed to leave him and when with her he was seen to talk easily and eagerly and on her part to what he said polly adair listened with serious interest lady firth who at home was a trained and successful matchmaker and who in zanzibar had found but a limited field for her activities decided that if her companion and protegee must marry she should marry fearing fearing was no gentleman adventurer remittanceman or humble clerk serving his apprenticeship to a steamship line or an ivory house he was one of the pillars of zanzibar society the trading house he had purchased had had its beginnings in the slavetrade and now under his alert direction was making a turnover equal to that of any of its ancient rivals personally fearing was a most desirable catch he was wellmannered wellread of good appearance steady and in a latitude only six degrees removed from the equator of impeccable morals it is said that it is the person who is in love who always is the first to discover his successful rival it is either an instinct or because his concern is deeper than that of others and so when hemingway sought for the influence that separated him from polly adair the trail led to fearing to find that the obstacle in the path of his true love was a man greatly relieved him he had feared that what was in the thoughts of mrs adair was the memory of her dead husband he had no desire to cross swords with a ghost but to a living rival he could afford to be generous for he was sure no one could care for polly adair as he cared and like every other man in love he believed that he alone had discovered in her beauties of soul and character that to the rest of mankind were hidden this knowledge he assured himself had aroused in him a depth of devotion no one else could hope to imitate and this depth of devotion would in time so impress her would become so necessary to her existence that it would force her at last into the arms of the only man who could offer it having satisfied himself in this fashion he continued cheerfully on his way and the presence of a rival in no way discouraged him it only was polly adair who discouraged him and this in spite of the fact that every hour of the day he tried to bring himself pleasantly to her notice all that an idle young man in love aided and abetted by imagination and an unlimited letter of credit could do hemingway did but to no end the treasures he dug out of the bazaars and presented to her under false pretenses as trinkets he happened at that moment to find in his pockets were admired by her at their own great value and returned also under false pretenses as having been offered her only to examine it is for your sister at home i suppose she prompted its quite lovely thank you for letting me see it after having been several times severely snubbed in this fashion hemingway remarked grimly as he put a black pearl back into his pocket at this rate sister will be mighty glad to see me when i get home it seems almost a pity i havent got a sister the girl answered this only with a grave smile on another occasion she admired a polo pony that had been imported for the stable of the boy sultan but next morning hemingway after much diplomacy became the owner of it and proudly rode it to the agency lady firth and polly adair walked out to meet him arm in arm but at sight of the pony there came into the eyes of the secretary a look that caused hemingway to wish himself and his mount many miles in the jungle he saw that before it had been proffered his gifthorse had been rejected he acted promptly lady firth he said youve been so awfully kind to me made this place so like a home to me that i want you to put this mare in your stable the sultan wanted her but when he learned i meant to turn her over to you he let her go we both hope youll accept lady firth had no scruples in five minutes she had accepted had clapped a sidesaddle on her rich gift and was cantering joyously down the pearl road polly adair looked after her with an expression that was distinctly wistful thus encouraged hemingway said im glad you are sorry i hope every time you see that pony youll be sorry why should i be sorry asked the girl because you have been unkind said hemingway and it is not your character to be unkind and that you have shown lack of character ought to make you sorry but you know perfectly well said mrs adair that if i were to take any one of these wonderful things you bring me i wouldnt have any character left she smiled at him reassuringly and you know she added that that is not why i do not take them it isnt because i cant afford to or because i dont want them because i do but its because i dont deserve them because i can give you nothing in return as the copybook says returned hemingway the pleasure is in the giving if the copybook dont say that i do and to pretend that you give me nothing that is ridiculous it was so ridiculous that he rushed on vehemently why every minute you give me something he exclaimed just to see you just to know you are alive just to be certain when i turn in at night that when the world wakes up again you will still be a part of it that is what you give me and its name is happiness he had begun quite innocently he had had no idea that it would come but he had said it as clearly as though he had dropped upon one knee laid his hand over his heart and exclaimed most beautiful of your sex i love you will you marry me his eyes and the tone of his voice had said it and he knew that he had said it and that she knew her eyes were filled with sudden tears and so wonderful was the light in them that for one mad moment hemingway thought they were tears of happiness but the light died and what had been tears became only wet drops of water and he saw to his dismay that she was most miserable the girl moved ahead of him to the cliff on which the agency stood and which overhung the harbor and the indian ocean her eyes were filled with trouble as she raised them to his they begged of him to be kind i am glad you told me she said i have been afraid it was coming but until you told me i could not say anything i tried to stop you i was rude and unkind you certainly were hemingway agreed cheerfully and the more you would have nothing to do with me the more i admired you and then i learned to admire you more and then to love you it seems now as though i had always known and always loved you and now this is what we are going to do he wouldnt let her speak he rushed on precipitately we are first going up to the house to get your typewritingmachine and we will bring it back here and hurl it as far as we can off this cliff i want to see the splash i want to hear it smash when it hits that rock it has been my worst enemy because it helped you to be independent of me because it kept you from me time after time on the veranda when i was pretending to listen to lady firth i was listening to that damned machine banging and complaining and tiring your pretty fingers and your dear eyes so first it has got to go you have been its slave now i am going to be your slave you have only to rub the lamp and things will happen and because ive told you nothing about myself you mustnt think that the money that helps to make them happen is tainted it isnt nor am i nor my father nor my fathers father i am asking you to marry a perfectly respectable young man and when you do again he gave her no opportunity to interrupt but rushed on impetuously we will sail away across that ocean to wherever you will take me to ceylon and tokio and san francisco to naples and new york to greece and athens they are all near they are all yours will you accept them and me he smiled appealingly but most miserably for though he had spoken lightly and with confidence it was to conceal the fact that he was not at all confident as he had read in her eyes her refusal of his pony he had read even as he spoke her refusal of himself when he ceased speaking the girl answered if i say that what you tell me makes me proud i am saying too little she shook her head firmly with an air of finality that frightened hemingway but what you ask what you suggest is impossible you dont like me said hemingway i like you very much returned the girl and if i dont seem unhappy that it cant be it is because i always have known it cant be why cant it be rebelled hemingway i dont mean that i cant understand your not wanting to marry me but if i knew your objection maybe i could beat it down again with the same air of finality the girl moved her head slowly as though considering each word she began cautiously i cannot tell you the reason she said because it does not concern only myself if you mean you care for some one else pleaded hemingway that does not frighten me at all it did frighten him extremely but believing that a faint heart never won anything he pretended to be brave for you he boasted i would go down into the grave as deep as any man he that hath more let him give i know what i offer i know i love you as no other man the girl backed away from him as though he had struck her you must not say that she commanded for the first time he saw that she was moved that the fingers she laced and unlaced were trembling it is final exclaimed the girl i cannot marry you or any one i i have promised i am not free nothing in the world is final returned hemingway sharply except death he raised his hat and as though to leave her moved away not because he admitted defeat but because he felt that for the present to continue might lose him the chance to fight again but to deliver an ultimatum he turned back as long as you are alive and i am alive he told her all things are possible i dont give up hope i dont give up you the girl exclaimed with a gesture of despair he wont understand she cried hemingway advanced eagerly help me to understand he begged you wont understand explained the girl that i am speaking the truth you are right that things can change in the future but nothing can change the past cant you understand that what do i care for the past cried the young man scornfully i know you as well as though i had known you for a thousand years and i love you the girl flushed crimson not my past she gasped i meant i dont care what you meant said hemingway im not prying into your little secrets i know only one thing two things that i love you and that until you love me i am going to make your life hell he caught at her hands and for an instant she let him clasp them in both of his while she looked at him something in her face other than distress and pity caused his heart to leap but he was too wise to speak and that she might not read the hope in his eyes turned quickly and left her he had not crossed the grounds of the agency before he had made up his mind as to the reason for her repelling him she is engaged to fearing he told himself she has promised to marry fearing she thinks that it is too late to consider another man the prospect of a fight for the woman he loved thrilled him greatly his lower jaw set pugnaciously ill show her its not too late he promised himself ill show her which of us is the man to make her happy and if i am not the man ill take the first outbound steamer and trouble them no more but before that happens he also promised himself fearing must show he is the better man in spite of his brave words in spite of his determination within the day hemingway had withdrawn in favor of his rival and on the crown prince eitel bound for genoa and new york had booked his passage home on the afternoon of the same day he had spoken to polly adair hemingway at the sunset hour betook himself to the consulate at that hour it had become his custom to visit his fellow countryman and with him share the gossip of the day and such a cocktail as only a fellow countryman could compose later he was to dine at the house of the ivory company and as his heart never ceased telling him mrs adair also was to be present it will be a very pleasant party said harris they gave me a bid too but its steamer day tomorrow and ive got to get my mail ready for the crown prince eitel mrs adair is to be there hemingway nodded and with pleasant anticipation waited of mrs adair harris always spoke with reverent enthusiasm and the man who loved her delighted to listen but this time harris disappointed him and fearing too he added again hemingway nodded the conjunction of the two names surprised him but he made no sign loquacious as he knew harris to be he never before had heard his friend even suggest the subject that to zanzibar had become of acute interest harris filled the two glasses and began to pace the room when he spoke it was in the aggrieved tone of one who feels himself placed in a false position theres no one he complained suddenly so popularly unpopular as the man who butts in i know that but still ive always taken his side ive always been for him he halted straddling with legs apart and hands deep in his trousers pockets and frowned down upon his guest suppose he began aggressively i see a man driving his car over a cliff if i tell him that road will take him over a cliff the worst that can happen to me is to be told to mind my own business and i can always answer back i was only trying to help you if i dont speak the man breaks his neck between the two it seems to me sooner than have any ones life on my hands id rather be told to mind my own business hemingway stared into his glass his expression was distinctly disapproving but undismayed the consul continued now we all know that this morning you gave that polo pony to lady firth and one of us guesses that you first offered it to some one else who refused it one of us thinks that very soon tomorrow or even tonight at this party you may offer that same person something else something worth more than a polo pony and that if she refuses that it is going to break you all up is going to hurt you for the rest of your life lifting his eyes from his glass hemingway shot at his friend a glance of warning in haste harris continued i know he protested answering the look i know that this is where mr buttinsky is told to mind his business but im going right on im going to state a hypothetical case with no names mentioned and no questions asked or answered im going to state a theory and let you draw your own deductions he slid into a chair and across the table fastened his eyes on those of his friend confidently and undisturbed but with a wry smile of dislike hemingway stared fixedly back at him what demanded harris is the first rule in detective work hemingway started he was prepared for something unpleasant but not for that particular form of unpleasantness but his faith was unshaken and he smiled confidently he let the consul answer his own question it is to follow the woman declared harris and accordingly what should be the first precaution of a man making his getaway to see that the woman does not follow but suppose we are dealing with a fugitive of especial intelligence with a criminal who has imagination and brains he might fix it so that the woman could follow him without giving him away he might plan it so that no one would suspect she might arrive at his hidingplace only after many months only after each had made separately a long circuit of the globe only after a journey with a plausible and legitimate object she would arrive disguised in every way and they would meet as total strangers and as strangers under the eyes of others they would become acquainted would gradually grow more friendly would be seen more frequently together until at last people would say those two mean to make a match of it and then one day openly in the sight of all men with the aid of the law and the church they would resume those relations that existed before the man ran away and the woman followed there was a short silence hemingway broke it in a tone that would accept no denial you cant talk like that to me he cried what do you mean without resentment the consul regarded him with grave solicitude his look was one of real affection and although his tone held the absolute finality of the family physician who delivers a sentence of death he spoke with gentleness and regret i mean he said that mrs adair is not a widow that the man she speaks of as her late husband is not dead that that man is fearing hemingway felt afraid a month before a rhinoceros had charged him and had dropped at his feet at another time a wounded lioness had leaped into his path and crouched to spring then he had not been afraid then he had aimed as confidently as though he were firing at a straw target but now he felt real fear fear of something he did not comprehend of a situation he could not master of an adversary as strong as fate by a word something had been snatched from him that he now knew was as dear to him as life that was life that was what made it worth continuing and he could do nothing to prevent it he could not help himself he was as impotent as the prisoner who hears the judge banish him into exile he tried to adjust his mind to the calamity but his mind refused as easily as with his finger a man can block the swing of a pendulum and halt the progress of the clock harris with a word had brought the entire world to a full stop and then above his head hemingway heard the lazy whisper of the punka and from the harbor the raucous whistle of the crown prince eitel signalling her entrance the world had not stopped for the punkaboy for the captain of the german steamer for harris seated with face averted the world was still going gayly and busily forward only for him had it stopped in spite of the confident tone in which harris had spoken in spite of the fact that unless he knew it was the truth he would not have spoken hemingway tried to urge himself to believe there had been some hideous absurd error but in answer came back to him snatches of talk or phrases the girl had last addressed to him you can command the future but you cannot change the past i cannot marry you or any one i am not free and then to comfort himself he called up the look he had surprised in her eyes when he stood holding her hands in his he clung to it as a drowning man will clutch even at a piece of floating seaweed when he tried to speak he found his voice choked and stifled and that his distress was evident he knew from the pity he read in the eyes of harris in a voice strange to him he heard himself saying why do you think that youve got to tell me i have a right to know this morning i asked mrs adair to marry me the consul exclaimed with dismay and squirmed unhappily i didnt know he protested i thought i was in time i ought to have told you days ago but tell me now commanded hemingway i know it in a thousand ways began harris hemingway raised his eyes hopefully but the consul shook his head but to convince you he went on i need tell you only one the thousand other proofs are looks they have exchanged sentences i have chanced to overhear and that each of them unknown to the other has told me of little happenings and incidents which i found were common to both each has described the house in which he or she lived and it was the same house they claim to come from different cities in new england they came from the same city they claim that is no proof cried hemingway either that they are married or that the man is a criminal for a moment harris regarded the other in silence then he said youre making it very hard for me i see ive got to show you its kindest after all to cut quick he leaned farther forward and his voice dropped speaking quickly he said last summer i lived outside the town in a bungalow on the pearl road fearings house was next to mine this was before mrs adair went to live at the agency and while she was alone in another bungalow farther down the road i was ill that summer my nerves went back on me i couldnt sleep i used to sit all night on my veranda and pray for the sun to rise from where i sat it was dark and no one could see me but i could see the veranda of fearings house and into his garden and night after night i saw mrs adair creep out of fearings house saw him walk with her to the gate saw him in the shadow of the bushes take her in his arms and saw them kiss the voice of the consul rose sharply no one knows that but you and i and he cried defiantly it is impossible for us to believe ill of polly adair the easy explanation we refuse it is intolerable and so you must believe as i believe that when she visited fearing by night she went to him because she had the right to go to him because already she was his wife and now when every one here believes they met for the first time in zanzibar when no one will be surprised if they should marry they will go through the ceremony again and live as man and wife as they are as they were before he fled from america hemingway was seated with his elbows on the table and his face in his hands he was so long silent that harris struck the table roughly with his palm well he demanded why dont you speak do you doubt her dont you believe she is his wife i refuse to believe anything else said hemingway he rose and slowly and heavily moved toward the door and i will not trouble them any more he added ill leave at sunrise on the eitel harris exclaimed in dismay but hemingway did not hear him in the doorway he halted and turned back from his voice all trace of emotion had departed why he asked dully do you think fearing is a fugitive not that it matters to her since she loves him or that it matters to me only i would like to think you were wrong i want her to have only the best again the consul moved unhappily i oughtnt to tell you he protested and if i do i ought to tell the state department and a detective agency first they have the call they want him or a man damned like him his voice dropped to a whisper the man wanted is henry brownell a cashier of a bank in waltham mass thirtyfive years of age smoothshaven collegebred speaking with a marked new england accent and and with other marks that fit fearing like the cover on a book the department and the pinkertons have been devilling the life out of me about it for nine months they are positive he is on the coast of africa i put them off i wasnt sure youve been protecting them said hemingway i wasnt sure reiterated harris and if i were the pinkertons can do their own sleuthing the mans living honestly now anyway isnt he he demanded and she loves him at least shes stuck by him why should i punish her his tone seemed to challenge and upbraid good god cried the other im not blaming you id be proud of the chance to do as much i asked because id like to go away thinking shes content thinking shes happy with him doesnt it look as though she were harris protested shes followed him followed him half around the globe if shed been happier away from him shed have stayed away from him so intent had been the men upon their talk that neither had noted the passing of the minutes or what at other times was an event of moment that the mail steamer had distributed her mail and passengers and when a servant entered bearing lamps and from the office the consuls clerk appeared with a bundle of letters from the eitel both were taken by surprise so late exclaimed hemingway i must go if im to sail with the eitel at daybreak ive little time but he did not go as he advanced toward harris with his hand outstretched in adieu the face of the consul halted him with the letters the clerk had placed upon the table a visitingcard and as it lay in the circle of light from the lamp the consul as though it were alive and menacing stared at it in fascination moving stiffly he turned it so that hemingway could see on it hemingway read george s sheyer and on a lower line representing william l pinkerton to the woman he loved the calamity they dreaded had come and hemingway with a groan of dismay exclaimed aloud it is the end from the darkness of the outer office a man stepped softly into the circle of the lamp they could see his figure only from the waist down the rest of him was blurred in shadows it is the end he repeated inquiringly he spoke the phrase with peculiar emphasis as though to impress it upon the memory of the two others his voice was cool alert authoritative the end of what he demanded sharply the question was most difficult in the silence the detective moved into the light he was tall and strongly built his face was shrewd and intelligent he might have been a prosperous man of business which of you is the consul he asked but he did not take his eyes from hemingway i am the consul said harris but still the detective did not turn from hemingway why he asked did this gentleman when he read my card say it is the end the end of what has anything been going on here that came to an end when he saw my card disconcerted in deep embarrassment harris struggled for a word but his distress was not observed by the detective his eyes suspicious and accusing still were fixed upon hemingway and under their scrutiny harris saw his friend slowly retreat slowly crumple up into a chair slowly raise his hands to cover his face as though in a nightmare he heard him saying savagely it is the end of two years of hell it is the end of two years of fear and agony now i shall have peace now i shall sleep i thank god youve come i thank god i can go back harris broke the spell by leaping to his feet he sprang between the two men what does this mean he commanded hemingway raised his eyes and surveyed him steadily it means he said that i have deceived you harris that i am the man you told me of i am the man they want he turned to the officer i fooled him for four months he said i couldnt fool you for five minutes the eyes of the detective danced with sudden excitement joy and triumph he shot an eager glance from hemingway to the consul this man he demanded who is he with an impatient gesture hemingway signified harris he doesnt know who i am he said he knows me as hemingway i am henry brownell of waltham mass again his face sank into the palms of his hands and im tired tired he moaned i am sick of not knowing sick of running away i give myself up the detective breathed a sigh of relief that seemed to issue from his soul my god he sighed youve given me a long chase ive had eleven months of you and im as sick of this as you are he recovered himself sharply as though reciting an incantation he addressed hemingway in crisp emotionless notes henry brownell he chanted i arrest you in the name of the commonwealth of massachusetts for the robbery on october the eleventh nineteen hundred and nine of the waltham title and trust company i understand he added you waive extradition and return with me of your own free will with his face still in his hands hemingway murmured assent the detective stepped briskly and uninvited to the table and seated himself he was beaming with triumph with pleasurable excitement i want to send a message home mr consul he said may i use your cable blanks harris was still standing in the centre of the room looking down upon the bowed head and shoulders of hemingway since in amazement he had sprung toward him he had not spoken and he was still silent inside the skull of wilbur harris of iowa u s a american consul to zanzibar east africa there was going forward a mighty struggle that was not fit to put into words for harris and his conscience had met and were at odds one way or the other the fight must be settled at once and whatever he decided must be for all time this he understood and as his sympathies and conscience struggled for the mastery the pen of the detective scratching at racing speed across the paper warned him that only a few seconds were left him in which to protest or else to forever after hold his peace so realistic had been the acting of hemingway that for an instant harris himself had been deceived but only for an instant with his knowledge of the circumstances he saw that hemingway was not confessing to a crime of his own but drawing across the trail of the real criminal the convenient and useful red herring he knew that already hemingway had determined to sail the next morning in leaving zanzibar he was making no sacrifice he merely was carrying out his original plan and by taking away with him the detective was giving brownell and his wife at least a month in which to again lose themselves what was his own duty he could not determine that of hemingway he knew nothing he could truthfully testify and if now hemingway claimed to be henry brownell he had no certain knowledge to the contrary that through his adventure hemingway would come to harm did not greatly disturb him he foresaw that his friend need only send a wireless from nantucket and at the wharf witnesses would swarm to establish his identity and make it evident the detective had blundered and in the meanwhile brownell and his wife in some settlement still further removed from observation would for the second time have fortified themselves against pursuit and capture he saw the eyes of hemingway fixed upon him in appeal and warning the brisk voice of the detective broke the silence you will testify if need be mr consul he said that you heard the prisoner admit he was henry brownell and that he surrendered himself of his own free will for an instant the consul hesitated then he nodded stiffly i heard him he said three hours later at ten o clock of the same evening the detective and hemingway leaned together on the rail of the crown prince eitel forward in the glare of her cargo lights to the puffing and creaking of derricks and donkey engines bundles of beeswax of rawhides and precious tusks of ivory were being hurled into the hold from the shoreboats clinging to the ships sides came the shrieks of the zanzibar boys from the smokingroom the blare of the stewards band and the clink of glasses those of the youth of zanzibar who were on board the german and english clerks and agents saw in the presence of hemingway only a purpose similar to their own the desire of a homesick exile to gaze upon the mirrored glories of the eitels saloon at the faces of white men and women to listen to homemade music to drink homebrewed beer as he passed the smokingroom they called to him and to the stranger at his elbow but he only nodded smiling and avoiding them ascended to the shadow of the deserted boatdeck you are sure he said you told no one no one the detective answered of course your hotel proprietor knows youre sailing but he doesnt know why and by sunrise well be well out at sea the words caught hemingway by the throat he turned his eyes to the town lying like a field of snow in the moonlight somewhere on one of its flat roofs a merry dinnerparty was laughing drinking perhaps regretting his absence wondering at his excuse of sudden illness she was there and he with the detective like a shadow at his elbow was sailing out of her life forever he had seen her for the last time that morning for the last time had looked into her eyes had held her hands in his he saw the white beach the white fortresslike walls the hanging gardens the courtesying palms dimly it was among those that he who had thought himself content had found happiness and had then seen it desert him and take out of his life pleasure in all other things with a pain that seemed impossible to support he turned his back upon zanzibar and all it meant to him and as he turned he faced coming toward him across the moonlit deck fearing his instinct was to cry out to the man in warning but his second thought showed him that through his very effort to protect the other he might bring about his undoing so helpless to prevent in agitation and alarm he waited in silence of the two men fearing appeared the least disturbed with a polite but authoritative gesture he turned to the detective i have something to say to this gentleman before he sails he said would you kindly stand over there he pointed across the empty deck at the other rail in the alert confident young man in the english messjacket cleanshaven and bronzed by the suns of the equator the detective saw no likeness to the pale bearded bank clerk of the new england city this he guessed must be some english official some friend of brownells who generously had come to bid the unfortunate fugitive godspeed assured of this the detective also bowed politely and out of hearing but with his prisoner in full view took up a position against the rail opposite turning his back upon the detective and facing hemingway with his eyes close to his fearing began abruptly his voice was sunk to a whisper but he spoke without the slightest sign of trepidation without the hesitation of an instant two years ago when i was indicted he whispered and ran away polly paid back half of the sum i stole that left her without a penny thats why she took to this typewriting since then i have paid back nearly all the rest but polly was not satisfied she wanted me to take my punishment and start fresh she knew they were watching her so she couldnt write this to me but she came to me by a roundabout way taking a year to get here and all the time shes been here shes been begging me to go back and give myself up i couldnt see it i knew in a few months id have paid back all i took and i thought that was enough i wanted to keep out of jail but she said i must take my medicine in our own country and start square with a clean slate shes done a lot for me and whether id have done that for her or not i dont know but now i must what you did tonight to save me leaves me no choice so ill sail with an exclamation of anger hemingway caught the other by the shoulder and dragged him closer to save you he whispered no ones thinking of you i didnt do it for you i did it that you both could escape together to give you time but i tell you protested fearing she doesnt want me to escape and maybe shes right anyway were sailing with you at we echoed hemingway that again he was to see the woman he loved that for six weeks through summer seas he would travel in her company filled him with alarm with distress with a wonderful happiness we he whispered steadying his voice then then your wife is going with you fearing gazed at him as though the other had suddenly gone mad my wife he exclaimed i havent got a wife if you mean polly mrs adair she is my sister and she wants to thank you shes below he was not allowed to finish hemingway had flung him to one side and was racing down the deck the detective sprang in pursuit one moment there he shouted but the man in the white messjacket barred his way in the moonlight the detective saw that the alert bronzed young man was smiling thats all right said fearing hell be back in a minute besides you dont want him im the man you want the long arm the safe was an old one that opened with a key as adjutant captain swanson had charge of certain funds of the regiment and kept in the safe about five thousand dollars no one but himself and rueff his first sergeant had access to it and as rueff proved an alibi the money might have been removed by an outsider the courtmartial gave swanson the benefit of the doubt and a reprimand for not taking greater care of the keys and swanson made good the five thousand swanson did not think it was a burglar who had robbed the safe he thought rueff had robbed it but he could not possibly prove that at the time of the robbery rueff was outside the presidio in uniform at a movingpicture show in san francisco a dozen people saw him there besides rueff held an excellent record he was a silent clerklike young man better at paper work than campaigning but even as a soldier he had never come upon the books and he had seen service in two campaigns and was supposed to cherish ambitions toward a commission but as he kept much to himself his fellow noncoms could only guess that on his captains account he was loyally distressed over the courtmartial and in his testimony tried to shield swanson by agreeing heartily that through his own carelessness the keys might have fallen into the hands of some one outside the post but his loyalty could not save his superior officer from what was a verdict virtually of not proven it was a most distressing affair and on account of the social prominence of swansons people his own popularity and the name he had made at batangas and in the boxer business was much commented upon not only in the services but by the newspapers all over the united states every one who knew swanson knew the courtmartial was only a matter of form even his enemies ventured only to suggest that overnight he might have borrowed the money meaning to replace it the next morning and the only reason for considering this explanation was that swanson was known to be in debt for he was a persistent gambler just as at pekin he had gambled with death for his number in times of peace he gambled for money it was always his own money from the start swansons own attitude toward the affair was one of blind unreasoning rage in it he saw no necessary routine of discipline only crass ignorant stupidity that any one should suspect him was so preposterous so unintelligent as to be nearly comic and when instantly he demanded a court of inquiry he could not believe it when he was summoned before a courtmartial it sickened wounded deeply affronted him turned him quite savage on his stand his attitude and answers were so insolent that his old friend and classmate captain copley who was acting as his counsel would gladly have kicked him the findings of the courtmartial that neither cleared nor condemned and the reprimand were an intolerable insult to his feelings and in a fit of bitter disgust with the service and every one in it swanson resigned of course the moment he had done so he was sorry swansons thought was that he could no longer associate with any one who could believe him capable of theft it was his idea of showing his own opinion of himself and the army but no one saw it in that light on the contrary people said swanson has been allowed to resign i n the army voluntarily resigning and being allowed to resign lest greater evils befall are two vastly different things and when it was too late no one than swanson saw that more clearly his anger gave way to extreme morbidness he believed that in resigning he had assured every one of his guilt in every friend and stranger he saw a man who doubted him he imagined snubs rebuffs and coldnesses his morbidness fastened upon his mind like a parasite upon a tree and the brain sickened when men and women glanced at his alert wellsetup figure and shoulders that even when he wore cits seemed to support epaulets and smiled approvingly swanson thought they sneered in a week he longed to be back in the army with a homesickness that made every one who belonged to it his enemy he left san francisco where he was known to all and travelled south through texas and then to new orleans and florida he never could recall this period with clearness he remembered changing from one train to another from one hotel to the next nothing impressed itself upon him for what he had lost nothing could give consolation without honor life held no charm and he believed that in the eyes of all men he was a thief a pariah and an outcast he had been in cuba with the army of occupation and of that beautiful island had grown foolishly fond he was familiar with every part of it and he believed in one or another of its pretty ports he could so completely hide himself that no one could intrude upon his misery in the states in the newspapers he seemed to read only of those places where he had seen service of those places and friends and associates he most loved in the little cuban village in which he would bury himself he would cut himself off from all newspapers from all who knew him from those who had been his friends and those who knew his name only to connect it with a scandal on his way from port tampa to cuba the boat stopped at key west and for the hour in which she discharged cargo swanson went ashore and wandered aimlessly the little town reared on a flat island of coral and limestone did not long detain him the main street of shops eatinghouses and saloons the pretty residences with overhanging balconies set among gardens and magnoliatrees were soon explored and he was returning to the boat when the martial music of a band caused him to halt a side street led to a great gateway surmounted by an anchor beyond it swanson saw lawns of wellkept grass regular paths pretty cottages the twostarred flag of an admiral and rising high above these like four eiffel towers the gigantic masts of a wireless he recognized that he was at the entrance to the key west naval station and turned quickly away he walked a few feet the music of the band still in his ears in an hour he would be steaming toward cuba and should he hold to his present purpose in many years this would be the last time he would stand on american soil would see the uniform of his country would hear a military band lull the sun to sleep it would hurt but he wondered if it were not worth the hurt a smart sergeant of marines in passing cast one glance at the man who seemed always to wear epaulets and brought his hand sharply to salute the act determined swanson he had obtained the salute under false pretenses but it had pleased not hurt him he turned back and passed into the gate of the naval station from the gate a grasslined carriage drive led to the waters of the harbor and the wharfs at its extreme end was the bandstand flanked on one side by the cottage of the admiral on the other by a sailloft with ironbarred windows and whitewashed walls upon the turf were pyramids of cannonballs and laid out in rows as though awaiting burial oldtime muzzleloading guns across the harbor the sun was sinking into the coral reefs and the spring air still warm from its caresses was stirred by the music of the band into gentle rhythmic waves the scene was one of peace order and content but as swanson advanced the measure of the music was instantly shattered by a fierce volley of explosions they came so suddenly and sharply as to make him start it was as though from his flank a quickfiring gun in ambush had opened upon him swanson smiled at having been taken unawares for in san francisco he often had heard the roar and rattle of the wireless but never before had he listened to an attack like this from a tiny whiteandgreen cottage squatting among the four giant masts came the roar of a forest fire one could hear the crackle of the flames the crash of the falling treetrunks the air about the cottage was torn into threads beneath the shocks of the electricity the lawn seemed to heave and tremble it was like some giant monster bound and fettered struggling to be free now it growled sullenly now in impotent rage it spat and spluttered now it lashed about with crashing stunning blows it seemed as though the wooden walls of the station could not contain it from the road swanson watched through the open windows of the cottage the electric bolts flash and flare and disappear the thing appealed to his imagination its power its capabilities fascinated him in it he saw a hungry monster reaching out to every corner of the continent and devouring the news of the world feeding upon tales of shipwreck and disaster lingering over some dainty morsel of scandal snatching from ships and cities two thousand miles away the thricetold tale of a conflagration the score of a baseball match the fall of a cabinet the assassination of a king in a sudden access of fierceness as though in an ecstasy over some fresh horror just received it shrieked and chortled and then as suddenly as it had broken forth it sank to silence and from the end of the carriage drive again rose undisturbed the music of the band the musicians were playing to a select audience on benches around the bandstand sat a half dozen nursemaids with knitting in their hands the babycarriages within arms length on the turf older children of the officers were at play and up and down the paths bareheaded girls and matrons and officers in uniform strolled leisurely from the vinecovered cottage of admiral preble set in a garden of flowering plants and bending palmettos came the tinkle of teacups and the ripple of laughter and at a respectful distance seated on the dismantled cannon were marines in khaki and bluejackets in glistening white it was a family group and had not swanson recognized among the little audience others of the passengers from the steamer and natives of the town who like himself had been attracted by the music he would have felt that he intruded he now wished to remain he wanted to carry with him into his exile a memory of the men in uniform of the music and pretty women of the gorgeous crimson sunset but though he wished to remain he did not wish to be recognized from the glances already turned toward him he saw that in this little family gathering the presence of a stranger was an event and he was aware that during the trial the newspapers had made his face conspicuous also it might be that stationed at the post was some officer or enlisted man who had served with him in cuba china or the philippines and who might point him out to others fearing this swanson made a detour and approached the bandstand from the wharf and with his back to a hawserpost seated himself upon the stringpiece he was overcome with an intolerable melancholy from where he sat he could see softened into shadows by the wire screens of the veranda admiral preble and his wife and their guests at tea a month before he would have reported to the admiral as the commandant of the station and paid his respects now he could not do that at least not without inviting a rebuff a month before he need only have shown his card to the admirals orderly and the orderly and the guard and the officers mess and the admiral himself would have turned the post upside down to do him honor but of what avail now was his record in three campaigns of what avail now was his medal of honor they now knew him as swanson who had been courtmartialled who had been allowed to resign who had left the army for the armys good they knew him as a civilian without rank or authority as an exofficer who had robbed his brother officers as an outcast his position as his morbid mind thus distorted it tempted swanson no longer for being in this plight he did not feel that in any way he was to blame but with a flaming anger he still blamed his brother officers of the courtmartial who had not cleared his name and with a clean bill of health restored him to duty those were the men he blamed not rueff the sergeant who he believed had robbed him nor himself who in a passion of wounded pride had resigned and so had given reason for gossip but the men who had not in tones like a buglecall proclaimed his innocence who when they had handed him back his sword had given it grudgingly not with congratulation as he saw it he stood in a perpetual pillory when they had robbed him of his honor they had left him naked and life without honor had lost its flavor he could eat he could drink he could exist he knew that in many corners of the world white arms would reach out to him and men would beckon him to a place at table but he could not cross that little strip of turf between him and the chattering group on the veranda and hand his card to the admirals orderly swanson loved life he loved it so that without help money or affection he could each morning have greeted it with a smile but life without honor he felt a sudden hot nausea of disgust why was he still clinging to what had lost its purpose to what lacked the one thing needful if life be an ill thing he thought i can lay it down the thought was not new to him and during the two past weeks of aimless wandering he had carried with him his service automatic to reassure himself he laid his fingers on its cold smooth surface he would wait he determined until the musicians had finished their concert and the women and children had departed and then then the orderly would find him where he was now seated sunken against the hawserpost with a hole through his heart to his disordered brain his decision appeared quite sane he was sure he never had been more calm and as he prepared himself for death he assured himself that for one of his standard no other choice was possible thoughts of the active past or of what distress in the future his act would bring to others did not disturb him the thing had to be no one lost more heavily than himself and regrets were cowardly he counted the money he had on his person and was pleased to find there was enough to pay for what services others soon must render him in his pockets were letters cards a cigarettecase each of which would tell his identity he had no wish to conceal it for of what he was about to do he was not ashamed it was not his act he would not have died by his own hand to his unbalanced brain the officers of the courtmartial were responsible it was they who had killed him as he saw it they had made his death as inevitable as though they had sentenced him to be shot at sunrise a line from the drums of the fore and aft came back to him often he had quoted it when some one in the service had suffered through the fault of others it was the deathcry of the boy officer devlin the knives of the ghazi had cut him down but it was his own peoples abandoning him in terror that had killed him and so with a sob he flung the line at the retreating backs of his comrades youve killed me you cowards swanson nursing his anger repeated this savagely he wished he could bring it home to those men of the courtmartial he wished he could make them know that his death lay at their door he determined that they should know on one of his visitingcards he pencilled to the officers of my courtmartial youve killed me you cowards he placed the card in the pocket of his waistcoat they would find it just above the place where the bullet would burn the cloth the band was playing auf wiedersehen and the waltz carried with it the sadness that had made people call the man who wrote it the waltz king swanson listened gratefully he was glad that before he went out his last mood had been of regret and gentleness the sting of his anger had departed the music soothed and sobered him it had been a very good world until he had broken the spine of things it had treated him well far better he admitted than he deserved there were many in it who had been kind to whom he was grateful he wished there was some way by which he could let them know that as though in answer to his wish from across the paradeground the wireless again began to crash and crackle but now swanson was at a greater distance from it and the sighing rhythm of the waltz was not interrupted swanson considered to whom he might send a farewell message but as in his mind he passed from one friend to another he saw that to each such a greeting could bring only distress he decided it was the music that had led him astray this was no moment for false sentiment he let his hand close upon the pistol the audience now was dispersing the nursemaids had collected their charges the musicians were taking apart their musicracks and from the steps of the vinecovered veranda admiral preble was bidding the friends of his wife adieu at his side his aide young alert confident with illconcealed impatience awaited their departure swanson found that he resented the aide he resented the manner in which he speeded the parting guests even if there were matters of importance he was anxious to communicate to his chief he need not make it plain to the women folk that they were in the way when a month before he had been adjutant in a like situation he would have shown more selfcommand he disapproved of the aide entirely he resented the fact that he was as young as himself that he was in uniform that he was an aide swanson certainly hoped that when he was in uniform he had not looked so much the conquering hero so selfsatisfied so supercilious with a smile he wondered why at such a moment a man he had never seen before and never would see again should so disturb him in his heart he knew the aide was going forward just where he was leaving off the ribbons on the tunic of the aide the straps on his shoulders told swanson that they had served in the same campaigns that they were of the same relative rank and that when he himself had he remained in the service would have been a brigadiergeneral the aide would command a battleship the possible future of the young sailor filled swanson with honorable envy and bitter regret with all his soul he envied him the right to look his fellow man in the eye his right to die for his country to give his life should it be required of him for ninety million people for a flag swanson saw the two officers dimly with eyes of bitter selfpity he was dying but he was not dying gloriously for a flag he had lost the right to die for it and he was dying because he had lost that right the sun had sunk and the evening had grown chill at the wharf where the steamer lay on which he had arrived but on which he was not to depart the electric cargo lights were already burning but for what swanson had to do there still was light enough from his breastpocket he took the card on which he had written his message to his brother officers read and reread it and replaced it save for the admiral and his aide at the steps of the cottage and a bareheaded bluejacket who was reporting to them and the admirals orderly who was walking toward swanson no one was in sight still seated upon the stringpiece of the wharf swanson so moved that his back was toward the four men the moment seemed propitious almost as though it had been prearranged for with such an audience for his taking off no other person could be blamed there would be no question but that death had been selfinflicted approaching from behind him swanson heard the brisk steps of the orderly drawing rapidly nearer he wondered if the wharf were government property if he were trespassing and if for that reason the man had been sent to order him away he considered bitterly that the government grudged him a place even in which to die well he would not for long be a trespasser his hand slipped into his pocket with his thumb he lowered the safetycatch of the pistol but the hand with the pistol in it did not leave his pocket the steps of the orderly had come to a sudden silence raising his head heavily swanson saw the man with his eyes fixed upon him standing at salute they had first made his life unsupportable swanson thought now they would not let him leave it captain swanson sir asked the orderly swanson did not speak or move the admirals compliments sir snapped the orderly and will the captain please speak with him still swanson did not move he felt that the breakingpoint of his selfcontrol had come this impertinent interruption this thrusting into the last few seconds of his life of a reminder of all that he had lost this futile postponement of his end was cruel unhuman unthinkable the pistol was still in his hand he had but to draw it and press it close and before the marine could leap upon him he would have escaped from behind approaching hurriedly came the sound of impatient footsteps the orderly stiffened to attention the admiral he warned twelve years of discipline twelve years of recognition of authority twelve years of deference to superior officers dragged swansons hand from his pistol and lifted him to his feet as he turned admiral preble the aide and the bareheaded bluejacket were close upon him the admirals face beamed his eyes were young with pleasurable excitement with the eagerness of a boy he waved aside formal greetings my dear swanson he cried i assure you its a most astonishing most curious coincidence see this man he flung out his arm at the bluejacket hes my wireless chief he was wireless operator on the transport that took you to manila when you came in here this afternoon he recognized you half an hour later he picks up a message picks it up two thousand miles from here from san francisco associated press news it concerns you that is not really concerns you but i thought we thoughtas though signalling for help the admiral glanced unhappily at his aidewe thought youd like to know of course to us he added hastily its quite superfluous quite superfluous but the aide coughed apologetically you might read sir he suggested what exactly quite so cried the admiral in the fading light he held close to his eyes a piece of paper san francisco april he read rueff first sergeant shot himself here today leaving written confession theft of regimental funds for which swanson captain lately courtmartialled money found intact in rueffs mattress innocence of swanson never questioned but dissatisfied with findings of courtmartial has left army brother officers making every effort to find him and persuade return the admiral sighed happily and my wife he added with an impressiveness that was intended to show he had at last arrived at the important part of his message says you are to stay to dinner abruptly rudely swanson swung upon his heel and turned his face from the admiral his head was thrown back his arms held rigid at his sides in slow deep breaths like one who had been dragged from drowning he drank in the salt chill air after one glance the four men also turned and in the falling darkness stood staring at nothing and no one spoke the aide was the first to break the silence in a polite tone as though he were continuing a conversation which had not been interrupted he addressed the admiral of course rueffs written confession was not needed he said his shooting himself proved that he was guilty swanson started as though across his naked shoulders the aide had drawn a whip in penitence and gratitude he raised his eyes to the stars high above his head the strands of the wireless swinging from the towering masts like the strings of a giant aeolian harp were swept by the wind from the ocean to swanson the sighing and whispering wires sang in praise and thanksgiving the god of coincidence the god of coincidence is fortunate in possessing innumerable press agents they have made the length of his arm a proverb how at exactly the right moment he extends it across continents and drags two and two together thus causing four to result where but for him sixes and sevens would have obtained they have made known to the readers of all of our best magazines for instance holworthy is leaving for the congo to find a cure for the sleeping sickness and for himself any sickness from which one is warranted never to wake up this is his condition because the

the van sturtevant club he had ceased to visit the grill club a cure for sleeping sickness might have been discovered but two loving hearts never would have been reunited and that story would not have been written or mrs montclair with a suitcase is leaving her home forever to join handsome harry bellairs who is at the corner with a racingcar and all the money of the bank of which he has been cashier as the guilty woman places the farewell letter against the pincushion where her husband will be sure to find it her infant son turns in his sleep and jabs himself with a pin his howl of anguish resembles that of a puppy on a moonlight night the mother recognizes her masters voice she believes her child dying flies to the bedside tears up the letter unpacks the suitcase the next morning at breakfast her husband reading the newspaper exclaims aloud harry bellairs he cries has skipped with the banks money i always told you he was not a man you ought to know his manner to me she says severely always was that of a perfect gentleman again coincidence gets the credit had not the child tossed had not at the critical moment the safety pin proved untrue to the man who invented it that happy family reunion would have been impossible or it might be told this way old man mccurdy the pigiron king forbids his daughter gwendolyn even to think of marrying poor but honest beef walters the baseball pitcher and denies him his house the lovers plan an elopement at midnight beef is to stand at the tradesmans entrance and whistle waiting at the church and down the silent stairs gwendolyn is to steal into his arms at the very same hour the butler has planned with the policeman on fixed post to steal mother mccurdys diamonds and pass them to a brother of the policeman who is to wait at the tradesmans entrance and whistle waiting for the robert e lee this sounds improbable especially that the policeman would allow even his brother to get the diamonds before he did but with the god of coincidence on the job you shall see that it will all come out right beef is first at the door he whistles the butler an english butler with no ear for music shoves into his hands tiaras and sunbursts honest beef hands over the butler to the policeman and the tiaras to mother mccurdy how can i reward you exclaims the grateful woman your daughters hand again the god of coincidence scores and beef walters is credited with an assist and for preventing the robbery mccurdy has the pegpost cop made a captain thus enabling him to wear diamonds of his own and raising him above the need of taking them from others these examples of what the god can do are mere fiction the story that comes now really happened it also is a story of coincidence it shows how this time the long arm was stretched out to make two young people happy it again illustrates that in the instruments he chooses the god of coincidence works in a mysterious way his wonders to perform this time the tool he used was a hat of green felt the story really should be called the man in the green hat at st jamess palace the plenipotentiaries of the allies and of turkey were trying to bring peace to europe in russell square bloomsbury sam lowell was trying to arrange a peace with mrs wroxton his landlady the ultimatum of the allies was adrianople or fight the last words of mrs wroxton were five pounds or move out sam did not have five pounds he was a stranger in london he had lost his position in new york and that very morning had refused to marry the girl he loved polly seward the young woman the sunday papers called the richest girl in america for any man for one day that would seem to be trouble enough but to the sultan of turkey that day brought troubles far more serious and as his losses were sams gain we must follow the troubles of the sultan until with the aid of a green felt hat the god of coincidence turns the misfortunes of the sultan into a fortune for sam sam must wait from the first days of the peace conference it was evident there was a leak the negotiations had been opened under a most solemn oath of secrecy as to the progress of the conference only such information or misinformation if the diplomats considered it betteras was mutually agreed upon by the plenipotentiaries was given to a waiting world but each morning in addition to the official report of the proceedings of the day previous one newspaper the times published an account which differed from that in every other paper and which undoubtedly came from the inside in details it was far more generous than the official report it gave names speeches arguments it described the wordy battles of the diplomats the concessions bluffs bargains after three days the matter became public scandal at first the plenipotentiaries declared the events described in the times were invented each evening in the office of the times but the proceedings of the day following showed the public this was not so some one actually present at the conference was telling tales out of school these tales were cabled to belgrade sofia athens constantinople and hourly from those capitals the plenipotentiaries were assailed by advice abuse and threats the whole world began to take part in their negotiations from every side they were attacked from home by the young turks or the on to constantinople party and from abroad by peace societies religious bodies and chambers of commerce even the armies in the field instead of waiting for the result of their deliberations told them what to do and that unless they did it they would better remain in exile to make matters worse in every stock exchange gambling on the news furnished by the times threatened the financial peace of europe to work under such conditions of publicity was impossible the delegates appealed to their hosts of the british foreign office unless the chiel amang them takin notes was discovered and the leak stopped they declared the conference must end spurred on by questions in parliament by appeals from the great banking world by criticisms not altogether unselfish from the other newspapers the foreign office surrounded st jamess palace and the office of the times with an army of spies every secretary stenographer and attendant at the conference was under surveillance his past record looked into his present comings and goings noted even the plenipotentiaries themselves were watched and employees of the times were secretly urged to sell the government the man who was selling secrets to them but those who were willing to be urged did not know the man those who did know him refused to be bought by a process of elimination suspicion finally rested upon one adolf hertz a young hungarian scholar who spoke and wrote all the mongrel languages of the balkans who for years as a copying clerk and translator had been employed by the foreign office and who now by it had been lent to the conference for the reason that when he lived in budapest he was a correspondent of the times the police in seeking for the leak centred their attention upon hertz but though every moment he was watched and though hertz knew he was watched no present link between him and the times had been establishedand this in spite of the fact that the hours during which it was necessary to keep him under closest observation were few those were the hours between the closing of the conference and midnight when the provincial edition of the times went to press for the remainder of the day so far as the police cared hertz could go to the devil but for those hours except when on his return from the conference he locked himself in his lodgings in jermyn street detectives were always at his elbow it was supposed that it was during this brief period when he was locked in his room that he wrote his report but how later he conveyed it to the times no one could discover in his rooms there was no telephone his doors and windows were openly watched and after leaving his rooms his movements were as they always had been methodical following a routine open to observation his programme was invariably the same each night at seven from his front door he walked west at regent street he stopped to buy an evening paper from the aged newsvender at the corner he then crossed piccadilly circus into coventry street skirted leicester square and at the end of green street entered pavonis italian restaurant there he took his seat always at the same table hung his hat always on the same brass peg ordered the same hungarian wine and read the same evening paper he spoke to no one no one spoke to him when he had finished his coffee and his cigarette he returned to his lodgings and there he remained until he rang for breakfast from the time at which he left his home until his return to it he spoke to only two persons the newsvender to whom he handed a halfpenny the waiter who served him the regular table dhote dinner between whom and hertz nothing passed but three and six for the dinner and sixpence for the waiter himself each evening the moment he moved into the street a plainclothes man fell into step beside him another followed at his heels and from across the street more plainclothes men kept their eyes on every one approaching him in front or from the rear when he bought his evening paper six pairs of eyes watched him place a halfpenny in the hand of the newsvender and during the entire time of his stay in pavonis every mouthful he ate was notedevery direction he gave the waiter was overheard of this surveillance hertz was well aware to have been ignorant of it would have argued him blind and imbecile but he showed no resentment with eyes grave and untroubled he steadily regarded his escort but not by the hastening of a footstep or the acceleration of a gesture did he admit that by his audience he was either distressed or embarrassed that was the situation on the morning when the treaty of london was to be signed and sealed in spite of the publicity given to the conference by the times however what the terms of the treaty might be no one knew if adrianople were surrendered if salonika were given to greece if servia obtained a rightofway to the adriatic peace was assured but should the young turks refuse should austria prove obstinatenot only would the war continue but the powers would be involved and that greater more awful war the war dreaded by all the christian world might turn europe into a slaughterhouse would turkey and austria consent and peace ensue would they refuse and war follow that morning those were the questions on the lips of every man in london save one he was sam lowell and he was asking himself another and more personal question how can i find five pounds and pacify mrs wroxton he had friends in new york who would cable him money to pay his passage home but he did not want to go home he preferred to starve in london than be vulgarly rich anywhere else that was not because he loved london but because above everything in life he loved polly seward and polly seward was in london he had begun to love her on class day of his senior year and after his father died and left him with no one else to care for every day he had loved her more until a month before he had been in the office of wetmore hastings a smart brokers firm in wall street he had obtained the position not because he was of any use to wetmore hastings but because the firm was the one through which his father had gambled the money that would otherwise have gone to sam in giving sam a job the firm thought it was making restitution sam thought it was making the punishment fit the crime for he knew nothing of the ways of wall street and having to learn them bored him extremely he wanted to write stories for the magazines he wanted to bind them in a book and dedicate them to polly and in this wish editors humored him but not so many editors or with such enthusiasm as to warrant his turning his back on wall street that he did later when after a tour of the world that had begun from the san francisco side polly seward and her mother and senator seward reached naples there senator seward bought old italian furniture for his office on the twentyfifth floor of the perfectly new seward building mrs seward tried to buy for polly a prince nearly as old as the furniture and polly bought picture postcards which she sent to sam polly had been absent six months and sams endurance had been so timed as just to last out the halfyear it was not guaranteed to withstand any change of schedule and the two months delay in italy broke his heart it could not run overtime on a starvation diet of postcards so when he received a cable reading address london claridges his heart told him it could no longer waitand he resigned his position and sailed on her trip round the world polly had learned many things she was observant alert intent on asking questions hungering for facts and a charming young woman who seeks facts rather than attention will never lack either but of all the facts polly collected the one of surpassing interest and which gave her the greatest happiness was that she could not live without sam lowell she had suspected this and it was partly to make sure that she had consented to the trip round the world now that she had made sure she could not too soon make up for the days lost sam had spent his money and he either must return to new york and earn more or remain near polly and starve it was an embarrassing choice polly herself made the choice even more difficult one morning when they walked in st jamess park to feed the ducks she said to him sam when are we to be married when for three years a man has been begging a girl to marry him and she consents at the exact moment when without capitulation to all that he holds honorable he cannot marry anybody his position deserves sympathy my dear one exclaimed the unhappy youth you make me the most miserable of men i cant marry im in an awful place if i married you now id be a crook it isnt a question of love in a cottage with bread and cheese if cottages were renting for a dollar a year i couldnt rent one for ten minutes i havent cheese enough to bait a mousetrap its terrible but we have got to wait wait cried polly i thought you had been waiting have i been away too long do you love some one else dont be ridiculous said sam crossly look at me he commanded and tell me whom i love polly did not take time to look but i she protested have so much money its not your money explained sam its your mothers money or your fathers and both of them dislike me they even have told me so your mother wants you to marry that italian and your father having half the money in america naturally wants to marry you to the other half if i were selfish and married you id be all the things they think i am you are selfish cried polly youre thinking of yourself and of what people will say instead of how to make me happy whats the use of money if you cant buy what you want are you suggesting you can buy me demanded sam surely said polly if i cant get you any other way and you may name your own price too when i am making enough to support myself without sponging on you explained sam you can have as many millions as you like but i must first make enough to keep me alive a man who cant do that isnt fit to marry how much demanded polly do you need to keep you alive maybe i could lend it to you sam was entirely serious three thousand a year he said polly exclaimed indignantly i call that extremely extravagant she cried if we wait until you earn three thousand a year we may be dead do you expect to earn that writing stories i can try said sam or i will rob a bank polly smiled upon him appealingly you know how i love your stories she said and i wouldnt hurt your feelings for the world but sam dear i think you had better rob a bank addressing an imaginary audience supposedly of men sam exclaimed isnt that just like a woman she wouldnt care he protested how i got the money polly smiled cheerfully not if i got you she said in extenuation also she addressed an imaginary audience presumably of women thats how i love him she exclaimed and he asks me to wait isnt that just like a man seriously she went on if we just go ahead and get married father would have to help us hed make you a vicepresident or something at this suggestion sam expressed his extreme displeasure the last time i talked to your father he said i was in a position to marry and i told him i wanted to marry you what he said to that was dont be an ass then i told him he was unintelligent and i told him why first because he could not see that a man might want to marry his daughter in spite of her money and second because he couldnt see that her money wouldnt make up to a man for having him for a fatherinlaw did you have to tell him that asked polly some one had to tell him said sam gloomily anyway as a source of revenue father is eliminated i have still one chance in london if that fails i must go home ive been promised a job in new york reporting for a wall street paper and ill write stories on the side ive cabled for money and if the london job falls through i shall sail wednesday wednesday cried polly when you say things like wednesday you make the world so dark you must stay here it has been such a long six months and before you earn three thousand dollars i shall be an old old maid but if you get work here we could see each other every day they were in the sewards sittingroom at claridges sam took up the desk telephone in london he said my one best and only bet is a man named forsythe who helps edit the pall mall ill telephone him now if he can promise me even a shilling a day ill stay on and starve but ill be near you if forsythe fails me i shall sail wednesday the telephone call found forsythe at the pall mall office he would be charmed to advise mr lowell on a matter of business would he that night dine with mr lowell he would and might he suggest that they dine at pavonis he had a special reason for going there and the dinner would cost only three and six thats reason enough sam told him and dont forget said polly when for the fifth time sam rose to go that after your dinner you are to look for me at the duchess of deptfords dance i asked her for a card and you will find it at your lodgings everybody will be there but it is a big placefull of dark corners where we can hide dont hide until i arrive said sam i shall be very late as i shall have to walk after i pay for forsythes dinner and for white gloves for your dance i shall not be in a position to hire a taxi but maybe i shall bring good news maybe forsythe will give me the job if he does we will celebrate in champagne you will let me at least pay for the champagne begged polly no said sam firmly the duchess will furnish that when sam reached his lodgings in russell square which he approached with considerable trepidation he found mrs wroxton awaiting him but her attitude no longer was hostile on the contrary as she handed him a large square envelope decorated with the strawberry leaves of a duke her manner was humble sam opened the envelope and with apparent carelessness stuck it over the fireplace about that back rent he said i have cabled for money and as soon i know said mrs wroxton i read the cable she was reading the card of invitation also theres no hurry sir protested mrs wroxton any of my young gentlemen who is made welcome at deptford house is made welcome here credit mrs wroxton observed sam is better than cash if you have only cash you spend it and nothing remains but with credit you can continue indefinitely toto so you can exclaimed mrs wroxton enthusiastically stay as long as you like mr lowell at pavonis sam found forsythe already seated and with evident interest observing the scene of gayety before him the place was new to sam and after the darkness and snow of the streets it appeared both cheerful and resplendent it was brilliantly lighted a ceiling of gay panels picked out with gold and red plush sofas backed against walls hung with mirrors and faced by rows of marbletopped tables gave it an air of the continent sam surrendered his hat and coat to the waiter the hat was a soft alpine one of green felt the waiter hung it where sam could see it on one of many hooks that encircled a gilded pillar after two courses had been served forsythe said i hope you dont object to this place i had a special reason for wishing to be here on this particular night i wanted to be in at the death whose death asked sam is the dinner as bad as that forsythe leaned back against the mirror behind them and bringing his shoulder close to sams spoke in a whisper as you know he said today the delegates sign the treaty of london it still must receive the signatures of the sultan and the three kings and they will sign it but until they do what the terms of the treaty are no one can find out ill bet the times finds out said sam thats it returned forsythe hertz the man who is supposed to be selling the secrets of the conference to the times dines here tonight is his last chance if tonight he can slip the times a copy of the treaty of london without being caught and the times has the courage to publish it it will be the biggest newspaper sensation of modern times and it will either cause a financial panic all over europe or prevent one the man they suspect is facing us dont look now but in a minute you will see him sitting alone at a table on the right of the middle pillar the people at the tables nearest him even the women are detectives his waiter is in the employ of scotland yard the maitre dhotel whom you will see always hovering round his table is a police agent lent by bulgaria for the allies are even more anxious to stop the leak than we are we are interested only as their hosts with them it is a matter of national life or death a week ago one of our own inspectors tipped me off to what is going on and every night since then ive dined here hoping to see something suspicious have you asked sam only this whispered forsythe on four different nights ive recognized men i know are on the staff of the times and on the other nights men i dont know may have been here but after all that proves nothing for this place is a resort of newspaper writers and editors and the times mens being here may have been only a coincidence and hertz asked sam what does he do the englishman exclaimed with irritation just what you see him doing now he protested he eats his dinner look at him he commanded of all in the room hes the least concerned sam looked and saw the suspected adolf hertz dangling a mass of macaroni on the end of his fork sam watched him until it disappeared maybe thats a signal suggested sam maybe everything he does is part of a cipher code he gives the signals and the times men read them and write them down a man would have a fine chance to write anything down in this room said forsythe but maybe persisted sam when he makes those strange movements with his lips he is talking to a confederate who can read the lip language the confederate writes it down at the office and fantastic and extremely improbable commented forsythe but nevertheless the fact remains the fellow does communicate with some one from the times and the police are positive he does it here and that he is doing it now the problem that so greatly disturbed his friend would have more deeply interested sam had the solving of his own trouble been less imperative that alone filled his mind and when the coffee was served and the cigars lit without beating about the bush sam asked forsythe bluntly if on his paper a rising and impecunious genius could find a place with even less beating about the bush forsythe assured him he could not the answer was final and the disappointment was so keen that sam soon begged his friend to excuse him paid his bill and rose to depart better wait urged forsythe youll find nothing so good out at a musichall this is houdini getting out of his handcuffs before an audience entirely composed of policemen sam shook his head gloomily i have a few handcuffs of my own to get rid of he said and it makes me poor company he bade his friend good night and picking his way among the tables moved toward the pillar on which the waiter had hung his hat the pillar was the one beside which hertz was sitting and as sam approached the man he satisfied his curiosity by a long look under the glance hertz lowered his eyes and fixed them upon his newspaper sam retrieved his hat and left the restaurant his mind immediately was overcast he remembered his disappointment and that the parting between himself and polly was now inevitable without considering his direction he turned toward charing cross road but he was not long allowed to meditate undisturbed he had only crossed the little street that runs beside the restaurant and passed into the shadow of the national gallery when at the base of the irving memorial from each side he was fiercely attacked a young man of eminently respectable appearance kicked his legs from under him and another of equally impeccable exterior made an honest effort to knock off his head sam plunged heavily to the sidewalk as he sprawled forward his hat fell under him and in his struggle to rise was hidden by the skirts of his greatcoat that also he had fallen heavily upon his hat with both knees sam did not know the strange actions of his assailants enlightened him to his surprise instead of continuing their assault or attempting a raid upon his pockets he found them engaged solely in tugging at the hat and so preoccupied were they in this that though still on his knees sam was able to land some lusty blows before a rush of feet caused the young men to leap to their own and pursued by several burly forms disappear in the heart of the traffic sam rose and stood unsteadily he found himself surrounded by all of those who but a moment before he had left contentedly dining at pavonis in an excited circle waiters and patrons of the restaurant both men and women stood in the falling snow bareheaded coatless and cloakless staring at him forsythe pushed them aside and took sam by the arm what happened demanded sam you ought to know protested forsythe you started it the moment you left the restaurant two men grabbed their hats and jumped after you a dozen other men without waiting for hats jumped after them the rest of us got out just as the two men and the detectives dived into the traffic a big man with an air of authority drew sam to one side did they take anything from you sir he asked ive nothing they could take said sam and they didnt try to find out they just knocked me down forsythe turned to the big man this gentleman is a friend of mine inspector he said he is a stranger in town and was at pavonis only by accident we might need his testimony suggested the official sam gave his card to the inspector and then sought refuge in a taxicab for the second time he bade his friend good night and when next we dine he called to him in parting choose a restaurant where the detective service is quicker three hours later brushed and repaired by mrs wroxton and again resplendent sam sat in a secluded corner of deptford house and bade polly a long farewell it was especially long owing to the unusual number of interruptions for it was evident that polly had many friends in london and that not to know the richest one in america and her absurd mother and the pompous selfsatisfied father argued oneself nobody but finally the duchess carried polly off to sup with her and as the duchess did not include sam in her invitation at least not in such a way that any one could notice it sam said goodnight but not before he had arranged a meeting with polly for eleven that same morning if it was clear the meeting was to be at the duck pond in st jamess park if it snowed at the national gallery in front of the age of innocence after robbing the duchess of three suppers sam descended to the hall and from an attendant received his coat and hat which latter the attendant offered him with the inside of the hat showing sam saw in it the trademark of a foreign maker thats not my hat said sam the man expressed polite disbelief i found it rolled up in the pocket of your greatcoat sir he protested the words reminded sam that on arriving at deptford house he had twisted the hat into a roll and stuffed it into his overcoat pocket quite right said sam but it was not his hat and with some hope of still recovering his property he made way for other departing guests and at one side waited for some clew to the person he believed was now wearing his hat sam examined the one in his hand just showing above the inside band was something white thinking it might be the card of the owner sam removed it it was not a card but a long sheet of thin paper covered with typewriting and many times folded sam read the opening paragraph then he backed suddenly toward a great chair of gold and velvet and fell into it he was conscious the attendants in pink stockings were regarding him askance that as they waited in the drafty hall for cars and taxis the noble lords in stars and ribbons the noble ladies in tiaras and showing muchfurlined galoshes were discussing his strange appearance they might well believe the youth was ill they might easily have considered him intoxicated outside rose the voices of servants and police calling the carriages inside other servants echoed them the duchess of sutherlands car they chanted mrs trevor hills carriage the french ambassadors carriage baron haussmanns car like one emerging from a trance sam sprang upright a little fat man with mild blue eyes and curly red hair was shyly and with murmured apologies pushing toward the exit before he gained it sam had wriggled a way to his elbow baron haussmann he stammered i must speak to you its a matter of gravest importance send away your car he begged and give me five minutes the eyes of the little fat man opened wide in surprise almost in alarm he stared at sam reprovingly impossible he murmured i i do not know you this is a letter of introduction said sam into the unwilling fingers of the banker he thrust the folded paper bending over him he whispered in his ear that said sam is the treaty of london the alarm of baron haussmann increased to a panic impossible he gasped and with reproach he repeated i do not know you sir i do not know you at that moment towering above the crush appeared the tall figure of senator seward the rich man of the new world and the rich man of europe knew each other only by sight but upon seeing sam in earnest converse with the great banker the senator believed that without appearing to seek it he might through sam effect a meeting with a hearty slap on the shoulder he greeted his fellow countryman halloo sam he cried genially you walking home with me sam did not even turn his head no he snapped im busy go way crimson the senator disappeared baron haussmann regarded the young stranger with amazed interest you know him he protested he called you sam know him cried sam impatiently ive got to know him hes going to be my fatherinlaw the fingers of the rich man clutched the folded paper as the claws of a parrot cling to the bars of his cage he let his sable coat slip into the hands of a servant he turned back toward the marble staircase come he commanded sam led him to the secluded corner polly and he had left vacant and told his story so it is evident concluded sam that each night some one in the service of the times dined at pavonis and that his hat was the same sort of hat as the one worn by hertz and each night inside the lining of his hat hertz hid the report of that days proceedings and when the times man left the restaurant he exchanged hats with hertz but tonight i got hertzs hat and with it the treaty in perplexity the blue eyes of the little great man frowned it is a remarkable story he said you mean you dont believe me retorted sam if i had financial standing if i had credit if i were not a strangeryou would not hesitate baron haussmann neither agreed nor contradicted he made a polite and deprecatory gesture still in doubt he stared at the piece of white paper still deep in thought he twisted and creased between his fingers the treaty of london returning with the duchess from supper polly caught sight of sam and with a happy laugh ran toward him seeing he was not alone she halted and waved her hand dont forget she called at eleven she made a sweet and lovely picture sam rose and bowed ill be there at ten he answered with his mild blue eyes the baron followed polly until she had disappeared then he turned and smiled at sam permit me he said to offer you my felicitations your young lady is very beautiful and very good sam bowed his head if she trusts you murmured the baron i think i can trust you too how wonderful is credit exclaimed sam i was just saying so to my landlady if you have only cash you spend it and nothing remains but with credit you can how much interrupted the banker do you want for this sam returned briskly to the business of the moment to be your partner he said to get half of what you make out of it the astonished eyes of the baron were large with wonder again he reproved sam what i shall make out of it he demanded incredulously do you know how much i shall make out of it i cannot even guess said sam but i want half the baron smiled tolerantly and how he asked could you possibly know what i give you is really half in his turn sam made a deprecatory gesture your credit said sam is good that morning after the walk in st jamess park when sam returned with polly to claridges they encountered her father in the hall mindful of the affront of the night before he greeted sam only with a scowl senator cried sam happily you must be the first to hear the news polly and i are going into partnership we are to be married this time senator seward did not trouble himself even to tell sam he was an ass he merely grinned cynically is that all your news he demanded with sarcasm no said sam i am going into partnership with baron haussmann too the buried treasure of cobre young everett at last was a minister plenipotentiary in london as third secretary he had splashed around in the rain to find the ambassadors carriage in rome as a second secretary he had served as a clearinghouse for the embassys visitingcards and in madrid as first secretary he had acted as interpreter for a minister who though valuable as a national chairman had much to learn of even his own language but although surrounded by all the wonders and delights of europe although he walked talked wined and dined with statesmen and court beauties everett was not happy he was never his own master always he answered the button pressed by the man higher up always over him loomed his chief always for his diligence and zeal his chief received credit as his majestys naval attache put it sympathetically better be a topside man on a sampan than first luff on the dreadnought dont be another mans right hand be your own right hand accordingly when the state department offered to make him minister to the republic of amapala everett gladly deserted the fleshpots of europe and on muleback over trails in the living rock through mountain torrents that had never known the shadow of a bridge through swamp and jungle rode sunburnt and saddlesore into his inheritance when giving him his farewell instructions the secretary of state had not attempted to deceive him of all the smaller republics of central america he frankly told him amapala is the least desirable least civilized least acceptable it offers an ambitious young diplomat no chance but once a minister always a minister having lifted you out of the secretary class we cant demote you your days of deciphering cablegrams are over and if you dont die of fever of boredom or brandy call us up in a year or two and we will see what we can do everett regarded the secretary blankly has the department no interest in amapala he begged is there nothing you want there there is one thing we very much want returned the secretary but we cant get it we want a treaty to extradite criminals the young minister laughed confidently why he exclaimed that should be easy the secretary smiled you have our full permission to get it he said this department he explained under three administrations has instructed four ministers to arrange such a treaty the bankers association wants it the merchants protective alliance wants it amapala is the only place within striking distance of our country where a fugitive is safe it is the only place where a dishonest cashier swindler or felon can find refuge sometimes it seems almost as though when a man planned a crime he timed it exactly so as to catch the boat for amapala and once there we cant lay our hands on him and whats more we cant lay our hands on the money he takes with him i have no right to make a promise said the great man but the day that treaty is signed you can sail for a legation in europe do i make myself clear so clear sir cried everett laughing that if i dont arrange that treaty i will remain in amapala until i do four of your predecessors remarked the secretary made exactly the same promise but none of them got us the treaty probably none of them remained in amapala either retorted everett two did corrected the secretary as you ride into camaguay you see their tombstones everett found the nineday muleride from the coast to the capital arduous but full of interest after a week at his post he appreciated that until he left it and made the return journey nothing of equal interest was again likely to occur for life in camaguay the capital of amapala proved to be one long dreamless slumber in the morning each of the inhabitants engaged in a struggle to get awake after the second breakfast he ceased struggling and for a siesta sank into his hammock after dinner at nine oclock he was prepared to sleep in earnest and went to bed the official life as explained to everett by garland the american consul was equally monotonous when president mendoza was not in the mountains deerhunting or suppressing a revolution each sunday he invited the american minister to dine at the palace in return his excellency expected once a week to be invited to breakfast with the minister he preferred that the activities of that gentleman should go no further life in the diplomatic circle was even less strenuous everett was the doyen of the diplomatic corps because he was the only diplomat all other countries were represented by consuls who were commission merchants and shopkeepers they were delighted at having among them a minister plenipotentiary when he took pity on them and invited them to tea which invitations he delivered in person to each consul at the door of each shop the entire diplomatic corps as the consuls were pleased to describe themselves put up the shutters put on their official fulldress uniforms and arrived in a body the first week at his post everett spent in reading the archives of the legation they were most discouraging he found that for the sixteen years prior to his arrival the only events reported to the department by his predecessors were revolutions and the refusals of successive presidents to consent to a treaty of extradition on that point all amapalans were in accord though overnight the government changed hands though presidents gave way to dictators and dictators to military governors the national policy of amapala continued to be no extradition the ill success of those who had preceded him appalled everett he had promised himself by a brilliant assault to secure the treaty and claim the legation in europe but the record of sixteen years of failure caused him to alter his strategy instead of an attack he prepared for a siege he unpacked his books placed the portrait of his own president over the office desk and proceeded to make friends with his fellow exiles of the foreign colony in camaguay some fifty were americans and from the rest of the world they were as hopelessly separated as the crew of a lightship from the pacific they were cut off by the cordilleras from the caribbean by a nineday muleride to the north and south jungle forests swamplands and mountains hemmed them in of the fifty americans onehalf were constantly on the trail riding to the coast to visit their plantations or into the mountains to inspect their mines when everett arrived of those absent the two most important were chester ward and colonel goddard indeed so important were these gentlemen that everett was made to understand that until they approved his recognition as the american minister was in a manner temporary chester ward or chet as the exiles referred to him was one of the richest men in amapala and was engaged in exploring the ruins of the lost city of cobre which was a onehour ride from the capital ward possessed the exclusive right to excavate that buried city and had held it against all comers the offers of american universities of archaeological and geographical societies that also wished to dig up the ancient city and decipher the hieroglyphs on her walls were met with a curt rebuff that work the government of amapala would reply was in the trained hands of senor chester ward in his chosen effort the government would not disturb him nor would it permit others coming in at the eleventh hour to rob him of his glory this everett learned from the consul garland ward and colonel goddard the consul explained are two of five countrymen of ours who run the american colony and some say run the government the others are mellen who has the asphalt monopoly jackson who is building the railroads and major feiberger of the san jose silvermines they hold monopolies and pay president mendoza ten per cent of the earnings and on the side help him run the country of the five the amapalans love goddard best because hes not trying to rob them instead he wants to boost amapala his ideas are perfectly impracticable but he doesnt know that and neither do they hes a kind of colonel mulberry sellers and a southerner not the professional sort that fight elevatorboys because theyre colored and let off rebel yells in rathskellers when a hungarian band plays dixie but the sort you read about and so seldom see he was once state treasurer of alabama whats he doing down here asked the minister never the same thing two months together the consul told him railroads mines rubber he says all amapala needs is developing as men who can see a joke even when it is against themselves the two exiles smiled ruefully thats all it needs said everett for a moment the consul regarded him thoughtfully i might as well tell you he said youll learn it soon enough anyway that the men who will keep you from getting your treaty are these five especially old man goddard and ward everett exclaimed indignantly why should they interfere because explained the consul they are fugitives from justice and they dont want to go home ward is wanted for forgery or some polite crime i dont know which and colonel goddard for appropriating the state funds of alabama ward knew what he was doing and made a lot out of it hes still rich no ones weeping over him goddards case is different he was imposed on and made a catspaw when he was state treasurer the men who appointed him came to him one night and said they must have some of the states funds to show a bank examiner in the morning they appealed to him on the ground of friendship as the men whod given him his job they would return the money the next evening goddard believed they would they didnt and when some one called for a showdown the colonel was shy about fifty thousand dollars of the states money he lost his head took the boat out of mobile to porto cortez and hid here hes been here twenty years and all the amapalans love him hes the adopted father of their country theyre so afraid hell be taken back and punished that theyll never consent to an extradition treaty even if the other americans mellen jackson and feiberger werent paying them big money not to consent president mendoza himself told me that as long as colonel goddard honored his country by remaining in it he was his guest and he would never agree to extradition i could as soon he said sign his deathwarrant everett grinned dismally thats rather nice of them he said but its hard on me but he demanded why ward what has he done for amapala is it because of cobre because of his services as an archaeologist the consul glanced around the patio and dragged his chair nearer to everett this is my own dope he whispered it may be wrong anyway its only for your private information he waited until with a smile everett agreed to secrecy chet ward protested the consul is no more an archaeologist than i am he talks well about cobre and he ought to because every word he speaks is cribbed straight from hauptmanns monograph published in and he has dug up something at cobre something worth a darned sight more than stone monkeys and carved altars but his explorations are a bluff theyre a blind to cover up what hes really after what i think hes found as though wishing to be urged the young man paused and everett nodded for him to continue he was wondering whether life in amapala might not turn out to be more interesting than at first it had appeared or whether garland was not a most charming liar ward visits the ruins every month continued garland but he takes with him only two muledrivers to cook and look after the packtrain and he doesnt let even the drivers inside the ruins he remains at cobre three or four days and to make a show fills his saddlebags with broken tiles and copper ornaments he turns them over to the government and it dumps them in the back yard of the palace you cant persuade me that he holds his concession with that junk hes found something else at cobre and he shares it with mendoza and i believe its gold the minister smiled delightedly what kind of gold maybe in the rough said the consul but i prefer to think its treasure the place is full of secret chambers tombs and passageways cut through the rock deep under the surface i believe ward has stumbled on some vault where the priests used to hide their loot i believe hes getting it out bit by bit and going shares with mendoza if that were so ventured everett why wouldnt mendoza take it all because ward explained the consul is the only one who knows where it is the ruins cover two square miles you might search for years they tried to follow and spy on him but ward was too clever for them he turned back at once if they dont take what he gives they get nothing so they protect him from real explorers and from extradition the whole thing is unfair a real archaeologist turned up here a month ago he had letters from the smithsonian institute and several big officials at washington but do you suppose they would let him so much as smell of cobre not they not even when i spoke for him as consul then he appealed to ward and ward turned him down hard you were arriving so hes hung on here hoping you may have more influence his name is peabody hes a professor but hes young and full of get there and he knows more about the ruins of cobre now than ward does after having them all to himself for two years hes good people and i hope youll help him everett shook his head doubtfully if the government has given the concession to him he pointed out no matter who ward may be or what its motives were for giving it to him i cant ask it to break its promise as an american citizen ward is as much entitled to my help officially as professor peabody whatever his standing wards a forger protested garland a fugitive from justice and peabody is a scholar and a gentleman im not keen about dead cities myself this one were in now is dead enough for me but if civilization is demanding to know what cobre was like eight hundred years ago civilization is entitled to find out and peabody seems the man for the job its a shame to turn him down for a gang of grafters tell him to come and talk to me said the minister he rode over to the ruins of copan last week explained garland where the harvard expedition is but hes coming back tomorrow on purpose to see you the consul had started toward the door when he suddenly returned and theres some one else coming to see you he said some one he added anxiously you want to treat right thats monica ward shes chester wards sister and you mustnt get her mixed up with anything i told you about her brother shes coming to ask you to help start a red cross society she was a volunteer nurse in the hospital in the last two revolutions and what she saw makes her want to be sure she wont see it again shes taught the native ladies the first aid drill and they expect you to be honorary president of the society youd better accept shaking his head garland smiled pityingly upon the new minister youve got a swell chance to get your treaty he declared monica is another one who will prevent it everett sighed patiently what he demanded might her particular crime be murder shoplifting treason if her brother had to leave this country interrupted garland shed leave with him and the people dont want that her pull is the same as old man goddards everybody loves him and everybody loves her i love her exclaimed the consul cheerfully the president loves her the sisters in the hospital the chaingang in the street the washerwomen in the river the palace guard everybody in this fleabitten godforsaken country loves monica ward and when you meet her you will too garland had again reached the door to the outer hall before everett called him back if it is not a leading question asked the minister what little indiscretion in your life brought you to amapala garland grinned appreciatively i know they sound a queer lot he assented but when you get to know em you like em my own trouble he added was a horse i never could see why they made such a fuss about him he was lame when i took him disregarding garlands pleasantry for some time his excellency sat with his hands clasped behind his head frowning up from the open patio into the hot cloudless sky on the ridge of his tiled roof a foul buzzard blinked at him from redrimmed eyes across the yellow wall a lizard ran for shelter at his elbow a macaw compassing the circle of its tin prison muttered dreadful oaths outside as the washerwomen beat their linen clubs upon the flat rocks of the river the hot stale air was spanked with sharp reports in camaguay theirs was the only industry the only sign of cleanliness and recognizing that another shirt had been thrashed into subjection and rags everett winced no less visibly did his own thoughts cause him to wince garland he had forgotten and he was sunk deep in selfpity his thoughts were of london with its world politics its splendid traditions its great and gracious ladies of paris in the spring sunshine when he cantered through the bois of madrid with its pomp and royalty and the gray walls of its galleries proclaiming murillo and velasquez these things he had forsaken because he believed he was ambitious and behold into what a culdesac his ambition had led him a comicopera country that was not comic but dead and buried from the world a savage people unread unenlightened unclean and for society of his countrymen pitiful derelicts in hiding from the law in his soul he rebelled in words he exploded bitterly this is one hell of a hole garland cried the diplomat his jaws and his eyes hardened im going back to europe and the only way i can go is to get that treaty i was sent here to get it those were my orders and ill get it if i have to bribe them out of my own pocket if i have to outbid mr ward and send him and your good colonel goddard and all the rest of the crew to the jails where they belong garland heard him without emotion from long residence near the equator he diagnosed the outbreak as a case of tropic choler aggravated by nostalgia and fleas ill bet you dont he said ill bet you your passagemoney home shouted everett against my passagemoney to europe done said garland how much time do you want two years the diplomat exclaimed mockingly two months i win now said the consul ill go home and pack the next morning his clerk told everett that in the outer office monica ward awaited him overnight everett had developed a prejudice against miss ward what garland had said in her favor had only driven him the wrong way her universal popularity he disliked he argued that to gain popularity one must concede and capitulate he felt that the sister of an acknowledged crook no matter how innocent she might be were she a sensitive woman would wish to efface herself and he had found that as a rule women who worked in hospitals and organized societies bored him he did not admire the militant executive sister he pictured miss ward as probably pretty but with the coquettish effrontery of the village belle and with the pushing goodfellow manners of the new school he was prepared either to have her slap him on the back or from behind tilted eyeglasses make eyes at him he was sure she wore eyeglasses and was large plump and junoesque with reluctance he entered the outer office he saw all in white a girl so young that she was hardly more than a child but with the tall slim figure of a boy her face was lovely as the face of a violet and her eyes were as shy but shy not through lack of confidence in everett nor in any human being but in herself they seemed to say i am a very unworthy somewhat frightened young person but you who are so big and generous will overlook that and you are going to be my friend indeed i see you are my friend everett stood quite still he nodded gloomily garland was right he exclaimed i do the young lady was plainly distressed do what she stammered some day i will tell you said the young man yes he added without shame i am afraid i will he bowed her into the inner office i am sorry apologized monica but i am come to ask a favor two favors one of you and one of the american minister everett drew his armchair from his desk and waved monica into it i was sent here he said to do exactly what you want the last words the president addressed to me were on arriving at your post report to miss monica ward fearfully monica perched herself on the edge of the armchair as though for protection she clasped the broad table before her the favor i want she hastily assured him is not for myself i am sorry said everett for it is already granted you are very good protested monica no replied everett i am only powerful i represent ninetyfive million americans and they are all entirely at your service so is the army and navy monica smiled and shook her head the awe she felt was due an american minister was rapidly disappearing and in mr everett himself her confidence was increasing the other ministers plenipotentiary she had seen at camaguay had been old with beards like mountaingoats and had worn linen dusters they always were very red in the face and very damp monica decided mr everett also was old she was sure he must be at least thirtyfive but in his silk pongee and pipeclayed tennisshoes he was a refreshing spectacle just to look at him turned one quite cool we have a very fine line of battleships this morning at guantanamo urged everett if you want one ill cable for it monica laughed softly it was good to hear nonsense spoken the amapalans had never learned it and her brother said just what he meant and no more our sailors were here once monica volunteered she wanted mr everett to know he was not entirely cut off from the world during the revolution she explained we were so glad to see them they made us all feel nearer home they set up our flag in the plaza and the colorguard let me photograph it with them guarding it and when they marched away the archbishop stood on the cathedral steps and blessed them and we rode out along the trail to where it comes to the jungle and then we waved goodby and they cheered us we all cried for a moment quite unconsciously monica gave an imitation of how they all cried it made the appeal of the violet eyes even more disturbing dont you love our sailors begged monica fearful of hurting the feelings of others she added hastily and of course our marines too everett assured her if there was one thing that meant more to him than all else it was an american bluejacket and next to him an american leatherneck it took a long time to arrange the details of the red cross society in spite of his reputation for brilliancy it seemed to monica mr everett had a mind that plodded for his benefit it was necessary several times to repeat the most simple proposition she was sure his inability to fasten his attention on her league of mercy was because his brain was occupied with problems of state it made her feel selfish and guilty when his visitor decided that to explain further was but to waste his valuable time and had made her third effort to go everett went with her he suggested that she take him to the hospital and introduce him to the sisters he wanted to talk to them about the red cross league it was a charming walk every one lifted his hat to monica the beggars the cabdrivers the barefooted policemen and the social lights of camaguay on the sidewalks in front of the cafes rose and bowed it is like walking with royalty exclaimed everett while at the hospital he talked to the mother superior his eyes followed monica as she moved from cot to cot he noted how the younger sisters fluttered happily around her like bridesmaids around a bride and how as she passed the eyes of those in the cots followed her jealously and after she had spoken with them smiled in content she is good the mother superior was saying and her brother too is very good everett had forgotten the brother with a start he lifted his eyes and found the mother superior regarding him he is very good she repeated for us he built this wing of the hospital it was his money we should be very sorry if any harm came to mr ward without his help we would starve she smiled and with a gesture signified the sick i mean they would starve they would die of disease and fever the woman fixed upon him grave inscrutable eyes will your excellency remember she said it was less of a question than a command where the church can forgive she paused like a real diplomat everett sought refuge in mere words the church is allpowerful mother he said her power to forgive is her strongest weapon i have no such power it lies beyond my authority i am just a messengerboy carrying the wishes of the government of one country to the government of another the face of the mother superior remained grave but undisturbed then as regards our mr ward she said the wishes of your government are again she paused again it was less of a question than a command with interest everett gazed at the whitewashed ceiling i have not yet he said communicated them to any one that night after dinner in the patio he reported to garland the words of the mother superior that was my dream prophet concluded everett you who can read this land of lotuseaters interpret what does it mean it only means what ive been telling you said the consul it means that if youre going after that treaty youve only got to fight the catholic church thats all it means later in the evening garland said i saw you this morning crossing the plaza with monica when i told you everybody in this town loved her was i right absolutely assented everett but why didnt you tell me she was a flapper i dont know what a flapper is promptly retorted garland and if i did i wouldnt call monica one a flapper is a very charming person protested everett i used the term in its most complimentary sense it means a girl between fourteen and eighteen its english slang and in england at the present the flapper is very popular she is driving her sophisticated elder sister who has been out two or three seasons and the predatory married woman to the wall to men of my years the flapper is really at the dangerous age in his bamboo chair garland tossed violently and snorted i sized you up he cried as a man of the finest perceptions i was wrong you dont appreciate monica dangerous you might as well say gods sunshine is dangerous or a beautiful flower is dangerous everett shook his head at the other man reproachfully did you ever hear of a sunstroke he demanded dont you know if you smell certain beautiful flowers you die cant you grasp any other kind of danger than being run down by a trolleycar is the danger of losing ones peace of mind nothing of being unfaithful to duty nothing is garland raised his arms dont shoot he begged i apologize you do appreciate monica you have your consuls permission to walk with her again the next day young professor peabody called and presented his letters he was a forceful young man to whom the delays of diplomacy did not appeal and one apparently accustomed to riding off whatever came in his way he seemed to consider any one who opposed him or who even disagreed with his conclusions as offering a personal affront with indignation he launched into his grievance these people he declared are dogs in the manger and ward is the worst of the lot he knows no more of archaeology than a congressman the mans a faker he showed me a spearhead of obsidian and called it flint and he said the aztecs borrowed from the mayas and that the toltecs were a myth and he got the aztec solar calendar mixed with the ahau hes as ignorant as that i cant believe it exclaimed everett you may laugh protested the professor but the ruins of cobre hold secrets the students of two continents are trying to solve they hide the history of a lost race and i submit its not proper one man should keep that knowledge from the world certainly not for a few gold armlets everett raised his eyes what makes you say that he demanded ive been kicking my heels in this town for a month peabody told him and ive talked to the people here and to the harvard expedition at copan and everybody tells me this fellow has found treasure the archaeologist exclaimed with indignation whats gold he snorted compared to the discovery of a lost race i applaud your point of view everett assured him i am to see the president tomorrow and i will lay the matter before him ill ask him to give you a look in to urge his treaty of extradition was the reason for the audience with the president and with all the courtesy that a bad case demanded mendoza protested against it he pointed out that governments entered into treaties only when the ensuing benefits were mutual for amapala in a treaty of extradition he saw no benefit amapala was not so far advanced as to produce defaulting bank presidents getrichquick promoters counterfeiters and thieving cashiers her fugitives were revolutionists who had fought and lost and every one was glad to have them go and no one wanted them back or suggested the president suppose i am turned out by a revolution and i seek asylum in your country my enemies desire my life they would ask for my extradition if the offense were political everett corrected my government would surrender no one but my enemies would charge me with murder explained the president remember castro and by the terms of the treaty your government would be forced to surrender me and i am shot against the wall the president shrugged his shoulders that treaty would not be nice for me consider the matter as a patriot said the diplomat is it good that the criminals of my country should make their home in yours when you are so fortunate as to have no dishonest men of your own why import ours we dont seek the individual we want to punish him only as a warning to others and we want the money he takes with him often it is the savings of the very poor the president frowned it was apparent that both the subject and everett bored him i name no names exclaimed mendoza but to those who come here we owe the little railroads we possess they develop our mines and our coffee plantations in time they will make this country very modern very rich and some you call criminals we have learned to love their past does not concern us we shut our ears we do not spy they have come to us as to a sanctuary and so long as they claim the right of sanctuary i will not violate it as everett emerged from the cool dark halls of the palace into the glare of the plaza he was scowling and he acknowledged the salute of the palace guard as though those gentlemen had offered him an insult garland was waiting in front of a cafe and greeted him with a mocking grin congratulations he shouted i have still twentytwo days said everett the aristocracy of camaguay invited the new minister to formal dinners of eighteen courses and to picnics less formal these latter everett greatly enjoyed because while monica ward was too young to attend the state dinners she was exactly the proper age for the allday excursions to the waterfalls the coffee plantations and the asphalt lakes the native belles of camaguay took no pleasure in riding farther afield than the military paradeground climbing a trail so steep that you viewed the sky between the ears of your pony or where with both hands you forced a way through hanging vines and creepers did not appeal but to monica with the seat and balance of a cowboy riding astride with her leg straight and the ball of her foot just feeling the stirrup these expeditions were the happiest moments in her exile so were they to everett and that on the trail one could ride only in single file was a most poignant regret in the column the place of honor was next to whoever rode at the head but everett relinquished this position in favor of monica by this manoeuvre she always was in his sight and he could call upon her to act as his guide and to explain what lay on either hand his delight and wonder in her grew daily he found that her mind leaped instantly and with gratitude to whatever was most fair just out of reach of her ponys hoofs he pressed his own pony forward and she pointed out to him what in the tropic abundance about them she found most beautiful sometimes it was the tumbling waters of a cataract sometimes high in the topmost branches of a ceibatree a gorgeous orchid sometimes a shaft of sunshine as rigid as a searchlight piercing the shadow of the jungle at first she would turn in the saddle and call to him but as each day they grew to know each other better she need only point with her whiphand and he would answer yes and each knew the other understood as a body the exiles resented everett they knew his purpose in regard to the treaty and for them he always must be the enemy even though as a man they might like him they could not forget that his presence threatened their peace and safety chester ward treated him with impeccable politeness but although his house was the showplace of camaguay he never invited the american minister to cross the threshold on account of monica everett regretted this and tried to keep the relations of her brother and himself outwardly pleasant but ward made it difficult to no one was his manner effusive and for monica only he seemed to hold any real feeling the two were alone in the world he was her only relative and to the orphan he had been father and mother when she was a child he had bought her toys and dolls now had the sisters permitted he would have dressed her in imported frocks and with jewels killed her loveliness he seemed to understand how to spend his money as little as did the gossips of camaguay understand from whence it came that monica knew why her brother lived in camaguay everett was uncertain she did not complain of living there but she was not at rest and constantly she was asking everett of foreign lands as everett was homesick for them he was most eloquent i should like to see them for myself said monica but until my brothers work here is finished we must wait and i am young and after a few years europe will be just as old when my brother leaves amapala he promises to take me wherever i ask to go to london to paris to rome so i read and read of them books of history books about painting books about the cathedrals but the more i read the more i want to go at once and that is disloyal disloyal asked everett to my brother explained monica he does so much for me i should think only of his work that is all that really counts for the world is waiting to learn what he has discovered it is like having a brother go in search of the north pole you are proud of what he is doing but you want him back to keep him to yourself is that selfish everett was a trained diplomat but with his opinion of chester ward he could not think of the answer instead he was thinking of monica in europe of taking her through the churches and galleries which she had seen only in black and white he imagined himself at her side facing the altar of some great cathedral or some painting in the louvre and watching her face lighten and the tears come to her eyes as they did now when things that were beautiful hurt her or he imagined her rid of her halfmourning and accompanying him through a cyclonic diplomatic career that carried them to japan china persia to berlin paris and london in these imaginings monica appeared in pongee and a sunhat riding an elephant in pearls and satin receiving royalty in tweed knickerbockers and a woollen jersey coasting around the hairpin curve at saint moritz of course he recognized that except as his wife monica could not accompany him to all these strange lands and high diplomatic posts and of course that was ridiculous he had made up his mind for the success of what he called his career that he was too young to marry but he was sure should he propose to marry monica every one would say he was too old and there was another consideration what of the brother would his government send him to a foreign post when his wife was the sister of a man they had just sent to the penitentiary he could hear them say in london we know your first secretary but who is mrs everett and the american visitor would explain she is the sister of inky dink the forger he is bookkeeping in sing sing certainly it would be a handicap he tried to persuade himself that monica so entirely filled his thoughts because in camaguay there was no one else it was a case of propinquity her loneliness and the fact that she lay under a shadow for which she was not to blame appealed to his chivalry so he told himself in thinking of monica except as a charming companion he was an ass and then arguing that in calling himself an ass he had shown his saneness and impartiality he felt justified in seeing her daily one morning garland came to the legation to tell everett that peabody was in danger of bringing about international complications by having himself thrust into the cartel if he qualifies for this local jail said garland you will have a lot of trouble setting him free youd better warn him its easier to keep out than to get out what has he been doing asked the minister poaching on wards ruins said the consul he certainly is a hustler he pretends to go to copan but really goes to cobre ward had him followed and threatened to have him arrested peabody claims any tourist has a right to visit the ruins so long as he does no excavating ward accused him of exploring the place by night and taking photographs by flashlight of the hieroglyphs hes put an armed guard at the ruins and he told peabody they are to shoot on sight so peabody went to mendoza and said if anybody took a shot at him hed bring warships down here and blow amapala off the map a militant archaeologist said everett is something new peabody is too enthusiastic he and his hieroglyphs are becoming a bore he sent for peabody and told him unless he curbed his spirit his minister could not promise to keep him out of a very damp and dirty dungeon i am too enthusiastic peabody admitted but to me this fellow ward is like a red flag to the bull his private graft is holding up the whole scientific world he wont let us learn the truth and hes too ignorant to learn it himself why he told me cobre dated from when palacio wrote of it to philip the second not knowing that in that very letter palacio states that he found cobre in ruins is it right a man as ignorant everett interrupted by levelling his finger you he commanded keep out of those ruins my dear professor he continued reproachfully you are a student a man of peace dont try to wage war on these amapalans theyre lawless theyre unscrupulous so is ward besides you are in the wrong and if they turn ugly your minister cannot help you he shook his head and smiled doubtfully i cant understand he exclaimed why youre so keen its only a heap of broken pottery sometimes i wonder if your interest in cobre is that only of the archaeologist what other interest demanded peabody doesnt wards buried treasure appeal at all asked the minister i mean of course to your imagination it does to mine the young professor laughed tolerantly buried treasure he exclaimed if ward has found treasure and i think he has hes welcome to it what we want is what you call the broken pottery it means nothing to you but to men like myself who live eight hundred years behind the times it is much more precious than gold a few moments later professor peabody took his leave and it was not until he had turned the corner of the calle morazan that he halted and like a man emerging from water drew a deep breath gee muttered the distinguished archeologist that was a close call one or two women had loved everett and after five weeks in which almost daily he had seen monica he knew she cared for him this discovery made him entirely happy and filled him with dismay it was a complication he had not foreseen it left him at the parting of two ways one of which he must choose for his career he was willing to renounce marriage but now that monica loved him even though he had consciously not tried to make her love him had he the right to renounce it for her also he knew that the difference between monica and his career lay in the fact that he loved monica and was in love with his career which should he surrender of this he thought long and deeply until one night without thinking at all he chose colonel goddard had given a dance and as all invited were americans the etiquette was less formal than at the gatherings of the amapalans for one thing the minister and monica were able to sit on the veranda overlooking the garden without his having to fight a duel in the morning it was not the moonlight or the music or the palms that made everett speak it was simply the knowledge that it was written that it had to be and he heard himself without prelude or introduction talking easily and assuredly of the life they would lead as man and wife from this dream monica woke him the violet eyes were smiling at him through tears when you came said the girl and i loved you i thought that was the greatest happiness now that i know you love me i ask nothing more and i can bear it everett felt as though an icy finger had moved swiftly down his spine he pretended not to understand bear what he demanded roughly that i cannot marry you said the girl even had you not asked me in loving you i would have been happy now that i know you thought of me as your wife i am proud i am grateful and the obstacle everett laughed scornfully there is no obstacle monica shook her head unafraid she looked into his eyes her own filled with her love for him dont make it harder she said my brother is hiding from the law what he did i dont know when it happened i was at the convent and he did not send for me until he had reached amapala i never asked why we came but were i to marry you with your name and your position every one else would ask and the scandal would follow you wherever you went it would follow it would put an end to your career his career now that monica urged it as her rival seemed to everett particularly trivial i dont know what your brother did either he said his sins are on his own head theyre not on yours nor on mine i dont judge him neither do i intend to let him spoil my happiness now that i have found you i will never let you go sadly monica shook her head and smiled when you leave here she said for some new post you wont forget me but youll be grateful that i let you go alone that i was not a drag on you when you go back to your great people and your proud and beautiful princesses all this will seem a strange dream and you will be glad you are awake and free the idea of marrying you monica said everett is not new it did not occur to me only since we moved out here into the moonlight since i first saw you ive thought of you and only of you ive thought of you with me in every corner of the globe as my wife my sweetheart my partner riding through jungles as we ride here sitting opposite me at our own table putting the proud and beautiful princesses at their ease and in all places at all moments you make all other women tawdry and absurd and i dont think you are the most wonderful person i ever met because i love you but i love you because you are the most wonderful person i ever met i am young said monica but since i began to love you i am very old and i see clearly that it cannot be dear heart cried everett that is quite morbid what the devil do i care what your brother has done i am not marrying your brother for a long time leaning forward with her elbows on her knees and her face buried in her hands the girl sat silent it was as though she were praying everett knew it was not of him but of her brother she was thinking and his heart ached for her for him to cut the brother out of his life was not difficult what it meant to her he could guess when the girl raised her eyes they were eloquent with distress he has been so good to me she said always so gentle he has been mother and father to me he is the first person i can remember when i was a child he put me to bed he dressed me and comforted me when we became rich there was nothing he did not wish to give me i cannot leave him he needs me more than ever i needed him i am all he has and there is this besides were i to marry of all the men in the world it would be harder for him if i married you for if you succeed in what you came here to do the law will punish him and he will know it was through you he was punished and even between you and me there always would be that knowledge that feeling that is not fair cried everett i am not an individual fighting less fortunate individuals i am an insignificant wheel in a great machine you must not blame me because i with an exclamation the girl reproached him because you do your duty she protested is that fair to me if for my sake or my brother you failed in your duty if you were less vigilant less eager even though we suffer i could not love you everett sighed happily as long as you love me he said neither your brother nor any one else can keep us apart my brother said the girl as though she were pronouncing a sentence always will keep us apart and i will always love you it was a week before he again saw her and then the feeling he had read in her eyes was gone or rigorously concealed now her manner was that of a friend of a young girl addressing a man older than herself one to whom she looked up with respect and liking but with no sign of any feeling deeper or more intimate it upset everett completely when he pleaded with her she asked do you think it is easy for me but she protested i know i am doing right i am doing it to make you happy you are succeeding everett assured her in making us both damned miserable for everett in the second month of his stay in amapala events began to move quickly following the example of two of his predecessors the secretary of state of the united states was about to make a grand tour of central america he came on a mission of peace and brotherly love to foster confidence and goodwill and it was secretly hoped that in the wake of his escort of battleships trade would follow fast there would be salutes and visits of ceremony speeches banquets reviews but in these rejoicings amapala would have no part for so everett was informed by cable unless previous to the visit of the secretary amapala fell into line with her sister republics and signed a treaty of extradition from the itinerary of the great man amapala would find herself pointedly excluded it would be a humiliation in the eyes of her sister republics it would place her outside the pale everett saw that in his hands his friend the secretary had placed a powerful weapon and lost no time in using it he caught the president alone sitting late at his dinner surrounded by bottles and read to him the secretarys ultimatum general mendoza did not at once surrender before he threw over the men who fed him the golden eggs that made him rich and for whom he had sworn never to violate the right of sanctuary he first for fully half an hour raged and swore during that time while everett sat anxiously expectant the president paced and repaced the length of the dininghall when to relight his cigar or to gulp brandy from a tumbler he halted at the table his great bulk loomed large in the flickering candleflames and when he continued his march he would disappear into the shadows and only his scabbard clanking on the stone floor told of his presence at last he halted and shrugged his shoulders so that the tassels of his epaulets tossed like wheat you drive a hard bargain sir he said and i have no choice tomorrow bring the treaty and i will sign everett at once produced it and a fountain pen i should like to cable tonight he urged that you have signed they are holding back the public announcement of the secretarys route until hearing from your excellency this is only tentative he pointed out the senate must ratify but our senate will ratify it and when you sign now it is a thing accomplished over the place at which everett pointed the pen scratched harshly and then throwing it from him the president sat in silence with eyes inflamed by anger and brandy he regarded the treaty venomously as though loath to let it go his hands played with it as a cat plays with the mouse between her paws watching him breathlessly everett feared the end was not yet he felt a depressing premonition that if ever the treaty were to reach washington he best had snatch it and run even as he waited the end came an orderly appearing suddenly in the light of the candles announced the arrival in the room adjoining of the colonel goddard and senor mellen they desired an immediate audience their business with the president was most urgent whether from washington their agents had warned them whether in camaguay they had deciphered the cablegram from the state department everett could only guess but he was certain the cause of their visit was the treaty that mendoza also believed this was most evident into the darkness from which the two exiles might emerge he peered guiltily with an oath he tore the treaty in half crushing the pieces of paper into a ball he threw it at everetts feet his voice rose to a shriek it was apparent he intended his words to carry to the men outside like an actor on a stage he waved his arms that is my answer he shouted tell your secretary the choice he offers is an insult it is blackmail we will not sign his treaty we do not desire his visit to our country thrilled by his own bravado his voice rose higher nor he shouted do we desire the presence of his representative your usefulness is at an end you will receive your passports in the morning as he might discharge a cook he waved everett away his hand trembling with excitement closed around the neck of the brandybottle everett stooped and secured the treaty on his return to washington torn and rumpled as it was it would be his justification it was his exhibit a as he approached the legation he saw drawn up in front of it three ponies ready saddled for an instant he wondered if mendoza intended further to insult him if he planned that night to send him under guard to the coast he determined hotly sooner than submit to such an indignity he would fortify the legation and defend himself but no such heroics were required of him as he reached the door garland with an exclamation of relief hailed him and monica stepping from the shadow laid an appealing hand upon his sleeve my brother she exclaimed the guard at cobre has just sent word that they found peabody prowling in the ruins and fired on him he fired back and he is still there hiding my brother and others have gone to take him i dont know what may happen if he resists chester is armed and he is furious he is beside himself he would not listen to me but he must listen to you will you go the girl begged and speak to him speak to him i mean she added as the american minister everett already had his foot in the stirrup im the american minister only until tomorrow he said ive got my walkingpapers but ill do all i can to stop this tonight garland he asked will you take miss ward home and then follow me if i do not go with you said monica i will go alone her tone was final with a clatter of hoofs that woke alarmed echoes in the sleeping streets the three horses galloped abreast toward cobre in an hour they left the main trail and at a walk picked their way to where the blocks of stone broken columns and crumbling temples of the halfburied city checked the jungle the moon made it possible to move in safety and at different distances the lights of torches told them the manhunt still was in progress thank god breathed monica we are in time everett gave the ponies in care of one of the guards he turned to garland catch up with those lights ahead of us he said and we will join this party to the right if you find ward tell him i forbid him taking the law into his own hands tell him i will protect his interests if you meet peabody make him give up his gun and see that the others dont harm him everett and the girl did not overtake the lights they had seen flashing below them before they were within hailing distance that searching party had disappeared and still farther away other torches beckoned stumbling and falling now in pursuit of one willothewisp now of another they scrambled forward but always the lights eluded them from their exertions and the moist heat they were breathless and their bodies dripped with water panting they halted at the entrance of what once had been a tomb from its black interior came a damp mist above them alarmed by their intrusion the vampire bats whirled blindly in circles monica who by day possessed some slight knowledge of the ruins had in the moonlight lost all sense of direction were lost said monica in a low tone unconsciously both were speaking in whispers i thought we were following what used to be the main thoroughfare of the city but i have never seen this place before from what i have read i think we must be among the tombs of the kings she was silenced by everett placing one hand quickly on her arm and with the other pointing in the uncertain moonlight she saw moving cautiously away from them and unconscious of their presence a white ghostlike figure peabody whispered everett call him commanded monica the others might hear objected everett we must overtake him if were with him when they meet they wouldnt dare with a gasp of astonishment his words ceased like a ghost the ghostlike figure had vanished he walked through that rock cried monica everett caught her by the wrist come he commanded over the face of the rock into which peabody had dived as into water hung a curtain of vines everett tore it apart concealed by the vines was the narrow mouth to a tunnel and from it they heard rapidly lessening in the distance the patter of footsteps will you wait demanded everett or come with me with a shudder of distaste monica answered by seizing his hand with his free arm everett swept aside the vines and monica following they entered the tunnel it was a passageway cleanly cut through the solid rock and sufficiently wide to permit of their moving freely at the farther end at a distance of a hundred yards it opened into a great vault also hollowed from the rock and as they saw to their surprise brilliantly lighted for an instant in black silhouette the figure of peabody blocked the entrance to this vault and then turning to the right again vanished monica felt an untimely desire to laugh now that they were on the track of peabody she no longer feared the outcome of the adventure in the presence of the american minister and of herself there would be no violence and as they trailed the archaeologist through the tunnel she was reminded of alice and her pursuit of the white rabbit this thought and her sense of relief that the danger was over caused her to laugh aloud they had gained the farther end of the tunnel and the entrance to the vault when at once her amusement turned to wonder for the vault showed every evidence of use and of recent occupation in brackets and burning brightly were lamps of modern make on the stone floor stood a canvas cot saddlebags campchairs and in the centre of the vault a collapsible table on this were bottles filled with chemicals trays and presses such as are used in developing photographs and apparently hung there to dry swinging from strings the proofs of many negatives loyal to her brother monica exclaimed indignantly at the proofs she pointed an accusing finger look she whispered this is peabodys darkroom where he develops the flashlights he takes of the hieroglyphs chester has a right to be furious impulsively she would have pushed past everett but with an exclamation he sprang in front of her no he commanded come away he had fallen into a sudden panic his tone spoke of some catastrophe imminent and overwhelming monica followed the direction of his eyes they were staring in fear at the proofs the girl leaned forward and now saw them clearly each was a united states treasury note for five hundred dollars around the turn of the tunnel approaching the vault apparently from another passage they heard hurrying footsteps and then close to them from the vault itself the voice of professor peabody it was harsh sharp peremptory hands up it commanded drop that gun as though halted by a precipice the footsteps fell into instant silence there was a pause and then the ring of steel upon the stone floor there was another pause and monica heard the voice of her brother broken as though with running it still retained its level accent its note of insolence so it said i have caught you monica struggled toward the lighted vault but around her everett threw his arm come away he begged monica fought against the terror of something unknown she could not understand they had come only to prevent a meeting between her brother and peabody and now that they had met everett was endeavoring to escape it was incomprehensible and the money in the vault the yellow bills hanging from a cobweb of strings why should they terrify her what did they threaten dully and from a distance monica heard the voice of peabody no he answered i have caught you and ive had a hell of a time doing it monica tried to call out to assure her brother of her presence but as though in a nightmare she could make no sound fingers of fear gripped at her throat to struggle was no longer possible the voice of peabody continued six months ago we traced these bills to new orleans so we guessed the plant was in central america we knew only one man who could make them when i found you were in amapala and they said you had struck buried treasure the rest was easy monica heard the voice of her brother answer with a laugh easy he mocked theres no extradition you cant touch me youre lucky if you get out of here alive ive only to raise my voice and ill kill you this was danger monica could understand freed from the nightmare of doubt with a cry she ran forward she saw peabody his back against a wall a levelled automatic in his hand her brother at the entrance to a tunnel like the one from which she had just appeared his arms were raised above his head at his feet lay a revolver for an instant with disbelief he stared at monica and then as though assured that it was she his eyes dilated in them were fear and horror so genuine was the agony in the face of the counterfeiter that everett who had followed turned his own away but the eyes of the brother and sister remained fixed upon each other hers appealingly his with despair he tried to speak but the words did not come when he did break the silence his tone was singularly wistful most tenderly kind did you hear he asked monica slowly bowed her head with the same note of gentleness her brother persisted did you understand between them stretched the cobweb of strings hung with yellow certificates each calling for five hundred dollars payable in gold stirred by the night air from the open tunnels they fluttered and flaunted against the sight of them monica closed her eyes heavily as though with a great physical effort again she bowed her head the eyes of her brother searched about him wildly they rested on the mouth of the tunnel with his lowered arm he pointed who is that he cried instinctively the others turned it was for an instant the instant sufficed monica saw her brother throw himself upon the floor felt herself flung aside as everett and the detective leaped upon him saw her brother press his hands against his heart the two men dragging at his arms the cavelike room was shaken with a report an acrid smoke assailed her nostrils the men ceased struggling her brother lay still monica sprang toward the body but a black wave rose and submerged her as she fainted to save herself she threw out her arms and as she fell she dragged down with her the buried treasure of cobre stretched upon the stone floor beside her brother she lay motionless beneath her and wrapped about and covering her as the leaves covered the babes in the wood was a vast cobweb of yellow bills each for five hundred dollars payable in gold a month later the harbor of porto cortez in honduras was shaken with the roar of cannon in comparison the roaring of all the cannon of all the revolutions that that distressful country ever had known were like firecrackers under a barrel faithful to his itinerary the secretary of state of the united states was paying his formal visit to honduras and the president of that republic waiting upon the fruit companys wharf to greet him was receiving the salute of the american battleships back of him on the wharf his own barefooted artillerymen in their turn were saluting excitedly and spasmodically the distinguished visitor as an honor he had at last learned to accept without putting a finger in each ear the secretary of state smiled with gracious calm less calm was the president of honduras he knew something the secretary did not know he knew that at any moment a gun of his saluting battery might turn turtle or blow into the harbor himself his cabinet and the larger part of his standing army made fast to the wharf on the side opposite to the one at which the secretary had landed was one of the fruit companys steamers she was on her way north and porto cortez was a port of call that her passengers might not intrude upon the ceremonies her side of the wharf was roped off and guarded by the standing army but from her decks and from behind the ropes the passengers with a battery of cameras were perpetuating the historic scene among them close to the ropes viewing the ceremony with the cynical eye of one who in europe had seen kings and emperors meet upon the field of the cloth of gold was everett he made no effort to bring himself to the attention of his former chief but when the introductions were over the secretary of state turned his eyes to his fellow countrymen crowding the rails of the american steamer they greeted him with cheers the great man raised his hat and his eyes fell upon everett the secretary advanced quickly his hand extended brushing to one side the standing army what are you doing here he demanded on my way home sir said everett i couldnt leave sooner there were personal reasons but i cabled the department my resignation the day mendoza gave me my walkingpapers you may remember everett added dryly the department accepted by cable the great man showed embarrassment it was most unfortunate he sympathized we wanted that treaty and while no doubt you made every effort he became aware of the fact that everetts attention was not exclusively his own following the direction of the young mans eyes the secretary saw on the deck just above them leaning upon the rail a girl in deep mourning she was very beautiful her face was as lovely as a violet and as shy to the secretary a beautiful woman was always a beautiful woman but he had read the papers who had not he was sure there must be some mistake this could not be the sister of a criminal the woman for whom everett had smashed his career the secretary masked his astonishment but not his admiration mrs everett he asked his very tone conveyed congratulations yes said the exdiplomat some day i shall be glad to present you the secretary did not wait for an introduction raising his eyes to the ships rail he made a deep and courtly bow with a gesture worthy of dartagnan his high hat swept the wharf the members of his staff the officers from the warships the president of honduras and the members of his staff endeavored to imitate his act of homage and in confusion mrs everett blushed becomingly when i return to washington said the secretary hastily come and see me you are too valuable to lose your career again everett was looking at his wife her distress at having been so suddenly drawn into the limelight amused him and he was smiling then as though aware of the secretarys meaning he laughed my dear sir he protested his tone suggested he was about to add mind your own business or go to the devil instead he said im not worrying about my career my career has just begun the boy scout a rule of the boy scouts is every day to do some one a good turn not because the copybooks tell you it deserves another but in spite of that pleasing possibility if you are a true scout until you have performed your act of kindness your day is dark you are as unhappy as is the grownup who has begun his day without shaving or reading the new york sun but as soon as you have proved yourself you may with a clear conscience look the world in the face and untie the knot in your kerchief jimmie reeder untied the accusing knot in his scarf at just ten minutes past eight on a hot august morning after he had given one dime to his sister sadie with that she could either witness the firstrun films at the palace or by dividing her fortune patronize two of the nickel shows on lenox avenue the choice jimmie left to her he was setting out for the annual encampment of the boy scouts at hunters island and in the excitement of that adventure even the movies ceased to thrill but sadie also could be unselfish with a heroism of a campfire maiden she made a gesture which might have been interpreted to mean she was returning the money i cant jimmie she gasped i cant take it off you you saved it and you ought to get the fun of it i havent saved it yet said jimmie im going to cut it out of the railroad fare im going to get off at city island instead of at pelham manor and walk the difference thats ten cents cheaper sadie exclaimed with admiration an you carryin that heavy grip aw thats nothin said the man of the family goodby mother so long sadie to ward off further expressions of gratitude he hurriedly advised sadie to take in the curse of cain rather than the mohawks last stand and fled down the front steps he wore his khaki uniform on his shoulders was his knapsack from his hands swung his suitcase and between his heavy stockings and his shorts his kneecaps unkissed by the sun as yet unscathed by blackberry vines showed as white and fragile as the wrists of a girl as he moved toward the l station at the corner sadie and his mother waved to him in the street boys too small to be scouts hailed him enviously even the policeman glancing over the newspapers on the newsstand nodded approval you a scout jimmie he asked no retorted jimmie for was not he also in uniform im santa claus out filling christmas stockings the patrolman also possessed a ready wit then get yourself a pair he advised if a dog was to see your legs jimmie escaped the insult by fleeing up the steps of the elevated an hour later with his valise in one hand and staff in the other he was tramping up the boston post road and breathing heavily the day was cruelly hot before his eyes over an interminable stretch of asphalt the heat waves danced and flickered already the knapsack on his shoulders pressed upon him like an old man of the sea the linen in the valise had turned to pig iron his pipestem legs were wabbling his eyes smarted with salt sweat and the fingers supporting the valise belonged to some other boy and were giving that boy much pain but as the motorcars flashed past with raucous warnings or that those who rode might better see the boy with bare knees passed at half speed jimmie stiffened his shoulders and stepped jauntily forward even when the joyriders mocked with oh you scout he smiled at them he was willing to admit to those who rode that the laugh was on the one who walked and he regretted oh so bitterly having left the train he was indignant that for his one good turn a day he had not selected one less strenuous that for instance he had not assisted a frightened old lady through the traffic to refuse the dime she might have offered as all true scouts refuse all tips would have been easier than to earn it by walking five miles with the sun at ninetynine degrees and carrying excess baggage twenty times james shifted the valise to the other hand twenty times he let it drop and sat upon it and then as again he took up his burden the good samaritan drew near he drew near in a low gray racingcar at the rate of forty miles an hour and within a hundred feet of jimmie suddenly stopped and backed toward him the good samaritan was a young man with white hair he wore a suit of blue a golf cap the hands that held the wheel were disguised in large yellow gloves he brought the car to a halt and surveyed the dripping figure in the road with tired and uncurious eyes you a boy scout he asked with alacrity for the twentyfirst time jimmie dropped the valise forced his cramped fingers into straight lines and saluted the young man in the car nodded toward the seat beside him get in he commanded when james sat panting happily at his elbow the old young man to jimmies disappointment did not continue to shatter the speed limit instead he seemed inclined for conversation and the car growling indignantly crawled i never saw a boy scout before announced the old young man tell me about it first tell me what you do when youre not scouting jimmie explained volubly when not in uniform he was an office boy and from peddlers and beggars guarded the gates of carroll and hastings stockbrokers he spoke the names of his employers with awe it was a firm distinguished conservative and long established the whitehaired young man seemed to nod in assent do you know them demanded jimmie suspiciously are you a customer of ours i know them said the young man they are customers of mine jimmie wondered in what way carroll and hastings were customers of the whitehaired young man judging him by his outer garments jimmie guessed he was a fifth avenue tailor he might be even a haberdasher jimmie continued he lived he explained with his mother at one hundred and fortysixth street sadie his sister attended the public school he helped support them both and he now was about to enjoy a wellearned vacation camping out on hunters island where he would cook his own meals and if the mosquitoes permitted sleep in a tent and you like that demanded the young man you call that fun sure protested jimmie dont you go camping out i go camping out said the good samaritan whenever i leave new york jimmie had not for three years lived in wall street not to understand that the young man spoke in metaphor you dont look objected the young man critically as though you were built for the strenuous life jimmie glanced guiltily at his white knees you ought ter see me two weeks from now he protested i get all sunburnt and hardhard as anything the young man was incredulous you were near getting sunstruck when i picked you up he laughed if youre going to hunters island why didnt you go to pelham manor thats right assented jimmie eagerly but i wanted to save the ten cents sos to send sadie to the movies so i walked the young man looked his embarrassment i beg your pardon he murmured but jimmie did not hear him from the back of the car he was dragging excitedly at the hated suitcase stop he commanded i got ter get out i got ter walk the young man showed his surprise walk he exclaimed what is it a bet jimmie dropped the valise and followed it into the roadway it took some time to explain to the young man first he had to be told about the scout law and the one good turn a day and that it must involve some personal sacrifice and as jimmie pointed out changing from a slow suburban train to a racingcar could not be listed as a sacrifice he had not earned the money jimmie argued he had only avoided paying it to the railroad if he did not walk he would be obtaining the gratitude of sadie by a falsehood therefore he must walk not at all protested the young man youve got it wrong what good will it do your sister to have you sunstruck i think you are sunstruck youre crazy with the heat you get in here and well talk it over as we go along hastily jimmie backed away id rather walk he said the young man shifted his legs irritably then howll this suit you he called well declare that first one good turn a failure and start afresh do me a good turn jimmie halted in his tracks and looked back suspiciously im going to hunters island inn called the young man and ive lost my way you get in here and guide me thatll be doing me a good turn on either side of the road blotting out the landscape giant hands picked out in electriclight bulbs pointed the way to hunters island inn jimmie grinned and nodded toward them much obliged he called i got ter walk turning his back upon temptation he waddled forward into the flickering heat waves the young man did not attempt to pursue at the side of the road under the shade of a giant elm he had brought the car to a halt and with his arms crossed upon the wheel sat motionless following with frowning eyes the retreating figure of jimmie but the narrowchested and knockkneed boy staggering over the sunbaked asphalt no longer concerned him it was not jimmie but the code preached by jimmie and not only preached but before his eyes put into practice that interested him the young man with white hair had been running away from temptation at forty miles an hour he had been running away from the temptation to do a fellow mortal a good turn that morning to the appeal of a drowning caesar to help me cassius or i sink he had answered sink that answer he had no wish to reconsider that he might not reconsider he had sought to escape it was his experience that a sixtyhorsepower racingmachine is a jealous mistress for retrospective sentimental or philanthropic thoughts she grants no leave of absence but he had not escaped jimmie had halted him tripped him by the heels and set him again to thinking within the halfhour that followed those who rolled past saw at the side of the road a car with her engine running and leaning upon the wheel as unconscious of his surroundings as though he sat at his own fireplace a young man who frowned and stared at nothing the halfhour passed and the young man swung his car back toward the city but at the first roadhouse that showed a blueandwhite telephone sign he left it and into the iron box at the end of the bar dropped a nickel he wished to communicate with mr carroll of carroll and hastings and when he learned mr carroll had just issued orders that he must not be disturbed the young man gave his name the effect upon the barkeeper was instantaneous with the aggrieved air of one who feels he is the victim of a jest he laughed scornfully what are you putting over he demanded the young man smiled reassuringly he had begun to speak and though apparently engaged with the beerglass he was polishing the barkeeper listened down in wall street the senior member of carroll and hastings also listened he was alone in the most private of all his private offices and when interrupted had been engaged in what of all undertakings is the most momentous on the desk before him lay letters to his lawyer to the coroner to his wife and hidden by a mass of papers but within reach of his hand was an automatic pistol the promise it offered of swift release had made the writing of the letters simple had given him a feeling of complete detachment had released him at least in thought from all responsibilities and when at his elbow the telephone coughed discreetly it was as though some one had called him from a world from which already he had made his exit mechanically through mere habit he lifted the receiver the voice over the telephone came in brisk staccato sentences that letter i sent this morning forget it tear it up ive been thinking and im going to take a chance ive decided to back you boys and i know youll make good im speaking from a roadhouse in the bronx going straight from here to the bank so you can begin to draw against us within an hour and hello will three millions see you through from wall street there came no answer but from the hands of the barkeeper a glass crashed to the floor the young man regarded the barkeeper with puzzled eyes he doesnt answer he exclaimed he must have hung up he must have fainted said the barkeeper the whitehaired one pushed a bill across the counter to pay for breakage he said and disappeared down pelham parkway throughout the day with the bill for evidence pasted against the mirror the barkeeper told and retold the wondrous tale he stood just where youre standing now he related blowing in milliondollar bills like youd blow suds off a beer if id knowed it was him id have hit him once and hid him in the cellar for the reward whod i think he was i thought he was a wiretapper working a con game mr carroll had not hung up but when in the bronx the beerglass crashed in wall street the receiver had slipped from the hand of the man who held it and the man himself had fallen forward his desk hit him in the face and woke him woke him to the wonderful fact that he still lived that at forty he had been born again that before him stretched many more years in which as the young man with the white hair had pointed out he still could make good the afternoon was far advanced when the staff of carroll and hastings were allowed to depart and even late as was the hour two of them were asked to remain into the most private of the private offices carroll invited gaskell the head clerk in the main office hastings had asked young thorne the bond clerk to be seated until the senior partner has finished with gaskell young thorne must remain seated gaskell said mr carroll if we had listened to you if wed run this place as it was when father was alive this never would have happened it hasnt happened but weve had our lesson and after this were going slow and going straight and we dont need you to tell us how to do that we want you to go away on a months vacation when i thought we were going under i planned to send the children on a sea voyage with the governess so they wouldnt see the newspapers but now that i can look them in the eye again i need them i cant let them go so if youd like to take your wife on an ocean trip to nova scotia and quebec here are the cabins i reserved for the kids they call it the royal suite whatever that is and the trip lasts a month the boat sails tomorrow morning dont sleep too late or you may miss her the head clerk was secreting the tickets in the inside pocket of his waistcoat his fingers trembled and when he laughed his voice trembled miss the boat the head clerk exclaimed if she gets away from millie and me shes got to start now well go on board tonight a halfhour later millie was on her knees packing a trunk and her husband was telephoning to the drugstore for a spongebag and a cure for seasickness owing to the joy in her heart and to the fact that she was on her knees millie was alternately weeping into the trunktray and offering up incoherent prayers of thanksgiving suddenly she sank back upon the floor john she cried doesnt it seem sinful to sail away in a royal suite and leave this beautiful flat empty over the telephone john was having trouble with the drug clerk no he explained im not seasick now the medicine i want is to be taken later i know im speaking from the pavonia but the pavonia isnt a ship its an apartmenthouse he turned to millie we cant be in two places at the same time he suggested but think insisted millie of all the poor people stifling tonight in this heat trying to sleep on the roofs and fireescapes and our flat so cool and big and pretty and no one in it john nodded his head proudly i know its big he said but it isnt big enough to hold all the people who are sleeping tonight on the roofs and in the parks i was thinking of your brother and grace said millie theyve been married only two weeks now and theyre in a stuffy hall bedroom and eating with all the other boarders think what our flat would mean to them to be by themselves with eight rooms and their own kitchen and bath and our new refrigerator and the gramophone it would be heaven it would be a real honeymoon abandoning the drug clerk john lifted millie in his arms and kissed her for next to his wife nearest his heart was the younger brother the younger brother and grace were sitting on the stoop of the boardinghouse on the upper steps in their shirtsleeves were the other boarders so the bride and bridegroom spoke in whispers the air of the cross street was stale and stagnant from it rose exhalations of rotting fruit the gases of an open subway the smoke of passing taxicabs but between the street and the hall bedroom with its odors of a gasstove and a kitchen the choice was difficult weve got to cool off somehow the young husband was saying or you wont sleep shall we treat ourselves to icecream sodas or a trip on the weehawken ferryboat the ferryboat begged the girl where we can get away from all these people a taxicab with a trunk in front whirled into the street kicked itself to a stop and the head clerk and millie spilled out upon the pavement they talked so fast and the younger brother and grace talked so fast that the boarders although they listened intently could make nothing of it they distinguished only the concluding sentences why dont you drive down to the wharf with us they heard the elder brother ask and see our royal suite but the younger brother laughed him to scorn whats your royal suite he mocked to our royal palace an hour later had the boarders listened outside the flat of the head clerk they would have heard issuing from his bathroom the cooling murmur of running water and from his gramophone the jubilant notes of alexanders ragtime band when in his private office carroll was making a present of the royal suite to the head clerk in the main office hastings the junior partner was addressing champ thorne the bond clerk he addressed him familiarly and affectionately as champ this was due partly to the fact that twentysix years before thorne had been christened champneys and to the coincidence that he had captained the football eleven of one of the big three to the championship champ said mr hastings last month when you asked me to raise your salary the reason i didnt do it was not because you didnt deserve it but because i believed if we gave you a raise youd immediately get married the shoulders of the exfootball captain rose aggressively he snorted with indignation and why should i not get married he demanded youre a fine one to talk youre the most offensively happy married man i ever met perhaps i know i am happy better than you do reproved the junior partner but i know also that it takes money to support a wife you raise me to a hundred a week urged champ and ill make it support a wife whether it supports me or not a month ago continued hastings we could have promised you a hundred but we didnt know how long we could pay it we didnt want you to rush off and marry some fine girl some fine girl muttered mr thorne the finest girl the finer the girl hastings pointed out the harder it would have been for you if we had failed and you had lost your job the eyes of the young man opened with sympathy and concern is it as bad as that he murmured hastings sighed happily it was he said but this morning the young man of wall street did us a good turn saved us saved our creditors saved our homes saved our honor were going to start fresh and pay our debts and we agreed the first debt we paid would be the small one we owe you youve brought us more than weve given and if youll stay with us were going to see your fifty and raise it a hundred what do you say young mr thorne leaped to his feet what he said was wheren hells my hat but by the time he had found the hat and the door he mended his manners i say thank you a thousand times he shouted over his shoulder excuse me but ive got to go ive got to break the news to he did not explain to whom he was going to break the news but hastings must have guessed for again he sighed happily and then a little hysterically laughed aloud several months had passed since he had laughed aloud in his anxiety to break the news champ thorne almost broke his neck in his excitement he could not remember whether the red flash meant the elevator was going down or coming up and sooner than wait to find out he started to race down eighteen flights of stairs when fortunately the elevatordoor swung open you get five dollars he announced to the elevator man if you drop to the street without a stop beat the speed limit act like the building is on fire and youre trying to save me before the roof falls senator barnes and his entire family which was his daughter barbara were at the ritzcarlton they were in town in august because there was a meeting of the directors of the brazil and cuyaba rubber company of which company senator barnes was president it was a secret meeting those directors who were keeping cool at the edge of the ocean had been summoned by telegraph those who were steaming across the ocean by wireless up from the equator had drifted the threat of a scandal sickening grim terrible as yet it burned beneath the surface giving out only an odor but an odor as rank as burning rubber itself at any moment it might break into flame for the directors was it the better wisdom to let the scandal smoulder and take a chance or to be the first to give the alarm the first to lead the way to the horror and stamp it out it was to decide this that in the heat of august the directors and the president had foregathered champ thorne knew nothing of this he knew only that by a miracle barbara barnes was in town that at last he was in a position to ask her to marry him that she would certainly say she would that was all he cared to know a year before he had issued his declaration of independence before he could marry he told her he must be able to support a wife on what he earned without her having to accept money from her father and until he received a minimum wage of five thousand dollars they must wait what is the matter with my fathers money barbara had demanded thorne had evaded the direct question there is too much of it he said do you object to the way he makes it insisted barbara because rubber is most useful you put it in golf balls and auto tires and galoshes there is nothing so perfectly respectable as galoshes and what is there tainted about a raincoat thorne shook his head unhappily its not the finished product to which i refer he stammered its the way they get the raw material they get it out of trees said barbara then she exclaimed with enlightenment oh she cried you are thinking of the congo there it is terrible that is slavery but there are no slaves on the amazon the natives are free and the work is easy they just tap the trees the way the farmers gather sugar in vermont father has told me about it often thorne had made no comment he could abuse a friend if the friend were among those present but denouncing any one he disliked as heartily as he disliked senator barnes was a public service he preferred to leave to others and he knew besides that if the father she loved and the man she loved distrusted each other barbara would not rest until she learned the reason why one day in a newspaper barbara read of the puju mayo atrocities of the indian slaves in the jungles and backwaters of the amazon who are offered up as sacrifices to red rubber she carried the paper to her father what it said her father told her was untrue and if it were true it was the first he had heard of it senator barnes loved the good things of life but the thing he loved most was his daughter the thing he valued the highest was her good opinion so when for the first time she looked at him in doubt he assured her he at once would order an investigation but of course he added it will be many months before our agents can report on the amazon news travels very slowly in the eyes of his daughter the doubt still lingered i am afraid she said that that is true that was six months before the directors of the brazil and cuyaba rubber company were summoned to meet their president at his rooms in the ritzcarlton they were due to arrive in half an hour and while senator barnes awaited their coming barbara came to him in her eyes was a light that helped to tell the great news it gave him a sharp jealous pang he wanted at once to play a part in her happiness to make her grateful to him not alone to this stranger who was taking her away so fearful was he that she would shut him out of her life that had she asked for half his kingdom he would have parted with it and besides giving my consent said the rubber king for which no one seems to have asked what can i give my little girl to make her remember her old father some diamonds to put on her head or pearls to hang around her neck or does she want a vacant lot on fifth avenue the lovely hands of barbara rested upon his shoulders her lovely face was raised to his her lovely eyes were appealing and a little frightened what would one of those things cost asked barbara the question was eminently practical it came within the scope of the senators understanding after all he was not to be cast into outer darkness his smile was complacent he answered airily anything you like he said a million dollars the fingers closed upon his shoulders the eyes still frightened still searched his in appeal then for my weddingpresent said the girl i want you to take that million dollars and send an expedition to the amazon and i will choose the men men unafraid men not afraid of fever or sudden death not afraid to tell the truth even to you and all the world will know and they i mean you will set those people free senator barnes received the directors with an embarrassment which he concealed under a manner of just indignation my mind is made up he told them existing conditions cannot continue and to that end at my own expense i am sending an expedition across south america it will investigate punish and establish reforms i suggest on account of this damned heat we do now adjourn that night over on long island carroll told his wife all or nearly all he did not tell her about the automatic pistol and together on tiptoe they crept to the nursery and looked down at their sleeping children when she rose from her knees the mother said but how can i thank him by him she meant the young man of wall street you never can thank him said carroll thats the worst of it but after a long silence the mother said i will send him a photograph of the children do you think he will understand down at seabright hastings and his wife walked in the sunken garden the moon was so bright that the roses still held their color i would like to thank him said the young wife she meant the young man of wall street but for him we would have lost this her eyes caressed the garden the fruittrees the house with wide hospitable verandas tomorrow i will send him some of these roses said the young wife will he understand that they mean our home at a scandalously late hour in a scandalous spirit of independence champ thorne and barbara were driving around central park in a taxicab how strangely the lord moves his wonders to perform misquoted barbara had not the young man of wall street saved mr hastings mr hastings could not have raised your salary you would not have asked me to marry you and had you not asked me to marry you father would not have given me a weddingpresent and and said champ taking up the tale thousands of slaves would still be buried in the jungles hidden away from their wives and children and the light of the sun and their fellow men they still would be dying of fever starvation tortures he took her hand in both of his and held her fingertips against his lips and they will never know he whispered when their freedom comes that they owe it all to you on hunters island jimmie reeder and his bunkie sam sturges each on his canvas cot tossed and twisted the heat the moonlight and the mosquitoes would not let them even think of sleep that was bully said jimmie what you did today about saving that dog if it hadnt been for you hed ha drownded he would not said sammy with punctilious regard for the truth it wasnt deep enough well the scoutmaster ought to know argued jimmie he said it was the best one good turn of the day modestly sam shifted the limelight so that it fell upon his bunkie ill bet he declared loyally your one good turn was a better one jimmie yawned and then laughed scornfully me he scoffed i didnt do nothing i sent my sister to the movies somewhere in france marie gessler known as marie chaumontel jeanne davrechy the countess daurillac was german her father who served through the francoprussian war was a german spy it was from her mother she learned to speak french sufficiently well to satisfy even an academician and among parisians to pass as one both her parents were dead before they departed knowing they could leave their daughter nothing save their debts they had had her trained as a nurse but when they were gone marie in the berlin hospitals played politics intrigued indiscriminately misused the appealing violet eyes there was a scandal several scandals at the age of twentyfive she was dismissed from the municipal hospital and as nowsave for the violet eyes she was without resources as a compagnon de voyage with a german doctor she travelled to monte carlo there she abandoned the doctor for henri ravignac a captain in the french aviation corps who when his leave ended escorted her to paris the duties of captain ravignac kept him in barracks near the aviation field but marie he established in his apartments on the boulevard haussmann one day he brought from the barracks a roll of blueprints and as he was locking them in a drawer said the germans would pay through the nose for those the remark was indiscreet but then marie had told him she was french and any one would have believed her the next morning the same spirit of adventure that had exiled her from the berlin hospitals carried her with the blueprints to the german embassy there greatly shocked they first wrote down her name and address and then indignant at her proposition ordered her out but the day following a strange young german who was not at all indignant but on the contrary quite charming called upon marie for the blueprints he offered her a very large sum and that same hour with them and marie departed for berlin marie did not need the money nor did the argument that she was serving her country greatly impress her it was rather that she loved intrigue and so she became a spy henri ravignac the man she had robbed of the blueprints was tried by courtmartial the charge was treason but charles ravignac his younger brother promised to prove that the guilty one was the girl and to that end obtained leave of absence and spent much time and money at the trial he was able to show the record of marie in berlin and monte carlo that she was the daughter of a german secret agent that on the afternoon the prints disappeared marie with an agent of the german embassy had left paris for berlin in consequence of this the charge of selling military secrets was altered to one of gross neglect and henri ravignac was sentenced to two years in the military prison at tours but he was of an ancient and noble family and when they came to take him from his cell in the cherchemidi he was dead charles his brother disappeared it was said he also had killed himself that he had been appointed a military attache in south america that to revenge his brother he had entered the secret service but whatever became of him no one knew all that was certain was that thanks to the act of marie gessler on the rolls of the french army the ancient and noble name of ravignac no longer appeared in her chosen profession marie gessler found nothing discreditable of herself her opinion was not high and her opinion of men was lower for her smiles she had watched several sacrifice honor duty loyalty and she held them and their kind in contempt to lie to cajole to rob men of secrets they thought important and of secrets the importance of which they did not even guess was to her merely an intricate and exciting game she played it very well so well that in the service her advance was rapid on important missions she was sent to russia through the balkans even to the united states there with credentials as an army nurse she inspected our military hospitals and unobtrusively asked many innocent questions when she begged to be allowed to work in her beloved paris they told her when war came they intended to plant her inside that city and that until then the less paris knew of her the better but just before the great war broke to report on which way italy might jump she was sent to rome and it was not until september she was recalled the telegram informed her that her aunt elizabeth was ill and that at once she must return to berlin this she learned from the code book wrapped under the cover of her thermos bottle meant that she was to report to the general commanding the german forces at soissons from italy she passed through switzerland and after leaving basle on military trains was rushed north to luxemburg and then west to laon she was accompanied by her companion bertha an elderly and respectable even distinguishedlooking female in the secret service her number was their passes from the war office described them as nurses of the german red cross only the intelligence department knew their real mission with her also as her chauffeur was a young italian soldier of fortune paul anfossi he had served in the belgian congo in the french foreign legion in algiers and spoke all the european languages in rome where as a wireless operator he was serving a commercial company in selling marie copies of messages he had memorized marie had found him useful and when war came she obtained for him from the wilhelmstrasse the number from laon in one of the automobiles of the general staff the three spies were driven first to soissons and then along the road to meaux and paris to the village of neufchelles they arrived at midnight and in a chateau of one of the champagne princes found the colonel commanding the intelligence bureau he accepted their credentials destroyed them and replaced them with a laissezpasser signed by the mayor of laon that dignitary the colonel explained to citizens of laon fleeing to paris and the coast had issued many passes but as now between laon and paris there were three german armies the refugees had been turned back and their passes confiscated from among them said the officer we have selected one for you it is issued to the wife of count daurillac a captain of reserves and her aunt madame benet it asks for those ladies and their chauffeur briand a safeconduct through the french military lines if it gets you into paris you will destroy it and assume another name the count daurillac is now with his regiment in that city if he learned of the presence there of his wife he would seek her and that would not be good for you so if you reach paris you will become a belgian refugee you are highborn and rich your chateau has been destroyed but you have money you will give liberally to the red cross you will volunteer to nurse in the hospitals with your sad story of ill treatment by us with your high birth and your knowledge of nursing which you acquired of course only as an amateur you should not find it difficult to join the ladies of france or the american ambulance what you learn from the wounded english and french officers and the french doctors you will send us through the usual channels when do i start asked the woman for a few days explained the officer you remain in this chateau you will keep us informed of what is going forward after we withdraw withdraw it was more of an exclamation than a question marie was too well trained to ask questions we are taking up a new position said the officer on the aisne the woman incredulous stared and we do not enter paris you do returned the officer that is all that concerns you we will join you later in the spring meanwhile for the winter we intrench ourselves along the aisne in a chimney of this chateau we have set up a wireless outfit we are leaving it intact the chauffeur briand who you must explain to the french you brought with you from laon and who has been long in your service will transmit whatever you discover we wish especially to know of any movement toward our left if they attack in front from soissons we are prepared but of any attempt to cross the oise and take us in flank you must warn us the officer rose and hung upon himself his fieldglasses mapcases and sidearms we leave you now he said when the french arrive you will tell them your reason for halting at this chateau was that the owner monsieur iverney and his family are friends of your husband you found us here and we detained you and so long as you can use the wireless make excuses to remain if they offer to send you on to paris tell them your aunt is too ill to travel but they will find the wireless said the woman they are sure to use the towers for observation and they will find it in that case said the officer you will suggest to them that we fled in such haste we had no time to dismantle it of course you had no knowledge that it existed or as a loyal french woman you would have at once told them to emphasize his next words the officer pointed at her under no circumstances he continued must you be suspected if they should take briand in the act should they have even the least doubt concerning him you must repudiate him entirely if necessary to keep your own skirts clear it would be your duty yourself to denounce him as a spy your first orders said the woman were to tell them briand had been long in my service that i brought him from my home in laon he might be in your service for years returned the colonel and you not know he was a german agent if to save myself i inform upon him said marie of course you know you will lose him the officer shrugged his shoulders a wireless operator he retorted we can replace but for you and for the service you are to render in paris we have no substitute you must not be found out you are invaluable the spy inclined her head i thank you she said the officer sputtered indignantly it is not a compliment he exclaimed it is an order you must not be found out withdrawn some two hundred yards from the paris road the chateau stood upon a wooded hill except directly in front trees of great height surrounded it the tips of their branches brushed the windows interlacing they continued until they overhung the wall of the estate where it ran with the road the wall gave way to a lofty gate and iron fence through which those passing could see a stretch of noble turf as wide as a polofield borders of flowers disappearing under the shadows of the trees and the chateau itself with its terrace its many windows its highpitched sloping roof broken by towers and turrets through the remainder of the night there came from the road to those in the chateau the roar and rumbling of the army in retreat it moved without panic disorder or haste but unceasingly not for an instant was there a breathingspell and when the sun rose the three spies the two women and the chauffeur who in the great chateau were now alone could see as well as hear the gray column of steel rolling past below them the spies knew that the gray column had reached claye had stood within fifteen miles of paris and then upon paris had turned its back they knew also that the reverberations from the direction of meaux that each moment grew more loud and savage were the french seventyfives whipping the gray column forward of what they felt the germans did not speak in silence they looked at each other and in the eyes of marie was bitterness and resolve toward noon marie met anfossi in the great drawingroom that stretched the length of the terrace and from the windows of which through the park gates they could see the paris road this that is passing now said marie is the last of our rearguard go to your tower she ordered and send word that except for stragglers and the wounded our column has just passed through neufchelies and that any moment we expect the french she raised her hand impressively from now she warned we speak french we think french we are french anfossi or briand as now he called himself addressed her in that language his tone was bitter pardon my lesemajesty he said but this chief of your intelligence department is a dummer mensch he is throwing away a valuable life marie exclaimed in dismay she placed her hand upon his arm and the violet eyes filled with concern not yours she protested absolutely returned the italian i can send nothing by this knapsack wireless that they will not learn from others from airmen uhlans the peasants in the fields and certainly i will be caught dead i am dead but alive and in paris the opportunities are unending from the french legion etranger i have my honorable discharge i am an expert wireless operator and in their signal corps i can easily find a place imagine me then on the eiffel tower from the air i snatch news from all of france from the channel the north sea you and i could work together as in rome but here between the lines with a pass from a village sousprefet it is ridiculous i am not afraid to die but to die because some one else is stupid that is hard marie clasped his hand in both of hers you must not speak of death she cried you know i must carry out my orders that i must force you to take this risk and you know that thought of harm to you tortures me quickly the young man disengaged his hand the woman exclaimed with anger why do you doubt me she cried briand protested vehemently i do not doubt you my affection then in a whisper that carried with it the feeling of a caress marie added softly my love the young man protested miserably you make it very hard mademoiselle he cried you are my superior officer i am your servant who am i that i should share with others the woman interrupted eagerly ah you are jealous she cried is that why you are so cruel but when i tell you i love you and only you can you not feel it is the truth the young man frowned unhappily my duty mademoiselle he stammered with an exclamation of anger marie left him as the door slammed behind her the young man drew a deep breath on his face was the expression of ineffable relief in the hall marie met her elderly companion bertha now her aunt madame benet i heard you quarrelling bertha protested it is most indiscreet it is not in the part of the countess daurillac that she makes love to her chauffeur marie laughed noiselessly and drew her farther down the hall he is imbecile she exclaimed he will kill me with his solemn face and his conceit i make love to him yes that he may work the more willingly but he will have none of it he is jealous of the others madame benet frowned he resents the others she corrected i do not blame him he is a gentleman and the others demanded marie were they not of the most noble families of rome i am old and i am ugly said bertha but to me anfossi is always as considerate as he is to you who are so beautiful an italian gentleman returned marie does not serve in belgian congo unless it is the choice of that or the marble quarries i do not know what his past may be sighed madame benet nor do i ask he is only a number as you and i are only numbers and i beg you to let us work in harmony at such a time your loveaffairs threaten our safety you must wait marie laughed insolently with the du barry she protested i can boast that i wait for no man no replied the older woman you pursue him marie would have answered sharply but on the instant her interest was diverted for one week by day and night she had lived in a world peopled only by german soldiers beside her in the railroad carriage on the station platforms at the windows of the trains that passed the one in which she rode at the grade crossings on the bridges in the roads that paralleled the tracks choking the streets of the villages and spread over the fields of grain she had seen only the graygreen uniforms even her professional eye no longer distinguished regiment from regiment dragoon from grenadier uhlan from hussar or landsturm stripes insignia numerals badges of rank had lost their meaning those who wore them no longer were individuals they were not even human during the three last days the automobile like a motorboat fighting the tide had crept through a graygreen river of men stained as though from the banks by mud and yellow clay and for hours while the car was blocked and in fury the engine raced and purred the graygreen river had rolled past her slowly but as inevitably as lava down the slope of a volcano bearing on its surface faces with staring eyes thousands and thousands of eyes some fierce and bloodshot others filled with weariness homesickness pain at night she still saw them the white faces under the sweat and dust the eyes dumb inarticulate asking the answer she had been suffocated by german soldiers by the mass of them engulfed and smothered she had stifled in a land inhabited only by graygreen ghosts and suddenly as though a miracle had been wrought she saw upon the lawn riding toward her a man in scarlet blue and silver one man riding alone approaching with confidence but alert his reins fallen his hands nursing his carbine his eyes searched the shadows of the trees the empty windows even the sunswept sky his was the new face at the door the new step on the floor and the spy knew had she beheld an army corps it would have been no more significant no more menacing than the solitary chasseur a cheval scouting in advance of the enemy we are saved exclaimed marie with irony go quickly she commanded to the bedroom on the second floor that opens upon the staircase so that you can see all who pass you are too ill to travel they must find you in bed and you said bertha i cried marie rapturously hasten to welcome our preserver the preserver was a peasant lad under the white dust his cheeks were burned a brownred his eyes honest and blue through much staring at the skies and at horizon lines were puckered and encircled with tiny wrinkles responsibility had made him older than his years and in speech brief with the beautiful lady who with tears of joy ran to greet him and who in an ecstasy of happiness pressed her cheek against the nose of his horse he was unimpressed he returned to her her papers and gravely echoed her answers to his questions this chateau he repeated was occupied by their general staff they have left no wounded here you saw the last of them pass a halfhour since he gathered up his reins marie shrieked in alarm you will not leave us she cried for the first time the young man permitted himself to smile others arrive soon he said he touched his shako wheeled his horse in the direction from which he had come and a minute later marie heard the hoofs echoing through the empty village when they came the others were more sympathetic even in times of war a beautiful woman is still a beautiful woman and the staff officers who moved into the quarters so lately occupied by the enemy found in the presence of the countess daurillac nothing to distress them in the absence of her dear friend madame iverney the chatelaine of the chateau she acted as their hostess her chauffeur showed the company cooks the way to the kitchen the larder and the charcoalbox she herself in the hands of general andre placed the keys of the famous winecellar and to the surgeon that the wounded might be freshly bandaged intrusted those of the linencloset after the indignities she had suffered while detained by les boches her delight and relief at again finding herself under the protection of her own people would have touched a heart of stone and the hearts of the staff were not of stone it was with regret they gave the countess permission to continue on her way at this she exclaimed with gratitude she assured them were her aunt able to travel she would immediately depart in paris she will be more comfortable than here said the kind surgeon he was a reservist and in times of peace a fashionable physician and as much at his ease in a boudoir as in a field hospital perhaps if i saw madam benet at the suggestion the countess was overjoyed but they found madame benet in a state of complete collapse the conduct of the germans had brought about a nervous breakdown though the bridges are destroyed at meaux urged the surgeon even with a detour you can be in paris in four hours i think it is worth the effort but the mere thought of the journey threw madame benet into hysterics she asked only to rest she begged for an opiate to make her sleep she begged also that they would leave the door open so that when she dreamed she was still in the hands of the germans and woke in terror the sound of the dear french voices and the sight of the beloved french uniforms might reassure her she played her part well concerning her marie felt not the least anxiety but toward briand the chauffeur the new arrivals were less easily satisfied the general sent his adjutant for the countess when the adjutant had closed the door general andre began abruptly the chauffeur briand he asked you know him you can vouch for him but certainly protested marie he is an italian as though with sudden enlightenment marie laughed it was as if now in the suspicion of the officer she saw a certain reasonableness briand was so long in the foreign legion in algiers she explained where my husband found him that we have come to think of him as french as much french as ourselves i assure you the general and his adjutant were regarding each other questioningly perhaps i should tell the countess began the general that we have learned the signal from the adjutant was so slight so swift that marie barely intercepted it the lips of the general shut together like the leaves of a book to show the interview was at an end he reached for a pen i thank you he said of course prompted the adjutant madame daurillac understands the man must not know we inquired concerning him general andre frowned at marie certainly not he commanded the honest fellow must not know that even for a moment he was doubted marie raised the violet eyes reprovingly i trust she said with reproach i too well understand the feelings of a french soldier to let him know his loyalty is questioned with a murmur of appreciation the officers bowed and with a gesture of gracious pardon marie left them outside in the hall with none but orderlies to observe like a cloak the graciousness fell from her she was drawn two ways in her work anfossi was valuable but anfossi suspected was less than of no value he became a menace a deathwarrant general andre had said we have learned and the adjutant had halted him what had he learned to know that marie would have given much still one important fact comforted her anfossi alone was suspected had there been concerning herself the slightest doubt they certainly would not have allowed her to guess her companion was under surveillance they would not have asked one who was herself suspected to vouch for the innocence of a fellow conspirator marie found the course to follow difficult with anfossi under suspicion his usefulness was for the moment at an end and to accept the chance offered her to continue on to paris seemed most wise on the other hand if concerning anfossi she had succeeded in allaying their doubts the results most to be desired could be attained only by remaining where they were their position inside the lines was of the greatest strategic value the rooms of the servants were under the roof and that briand should sleep in one of them was natural that to reach or leave his room he should constantly be ascending or descending the stairs also was natural the fieldwireless outfit or as he had disdainfully described it the knapsack wireless was situated not in the bedroom he had selected for himself but in one adjoining at other times this was occupied by the maid of madame iverney to summon her maid madame iverney from her apartment on the second floor had but to press a button and it was in the apartment of madame iverney and on the bed of that lady that madame benet now reclined when through the open door she saw an officer or soldier mount the stairs she pressed the button that rang a bell in the room of the maid in this way long before whoever was ascending the stairs could reach the top floor warning of his approach came to anfossi it gave him time to replace the dustboard over the fireplace in which the wireless was concealed and to escape into his own bedroom the arrangement was ideal and already information picked up in the halls below by marie had been conveyed to anfossi to relay in a french cipher to the german general staff at rheims marie made an alert and charming hostess to all who saw her it was evident that her mind was intent only upon the comfort of her guests throughout the day many came and went but each she made welcome to each as he departed she called bonne chance efficient tireless tactful she was everywhere in the diningroom in the kitchen in the bedrooms for the wounded finding mattresses to spread in the gorgeous salons of the champagne prince for the soldierchauffeurs carrying wine into the courtyard where the automobiles panted and growled and the arriving and departing shrieked for right of way at all times an alluring person now the one woman in a tumult of men her smart frock covered by an apron her head and arms bare undismayed by the sight of the wounded or by the distant rumble of the guns the countess daurillac was an inspiring and beautiful picture the eyes of the officers young and old informed her of that fact one of which already she was well aware by the morning of the next day she was accepted as the owner of the chateau and though continually she reminded the staff she was present only as the friend of her schoolmate madame iverney they deferred to her as to a hostess many of them she already saluted by name and to those who with messages were constantly motoring to and from the front at soissons she was particularly kind overnight the legend of her charm of her devotion to the soldiers of all ranks had spread from soissons to meaux and from meaux to paris it was noon of that day when from the window of the second story marie saw an armored automobile sweep into the courtyard it was driven by an officer young and appallingly goodlooking and as was obvious by the way he spun his car one who held in contempt both the law of gravity and death that he was some one of importance seemed evident before he could alight the adjutant had raced to meet him with her eye for detail marie observed that the young officer instead of imparting information received it he must she guessed have just arrived from paris and his brother officer either was telling him the news or giving him his orders whichever it might be in what was told him the new arrival was greatly interested one instant in indignation his gauntleted fist beat upon the steeringwheel the next he smiled with pleasure to interpret this pantomime was difficult and the better to inform herself marie descended the stairs as she reached the lower hall the two officers entered to the spy the man last to arrive was always the one of greatest importance and marie assured herself that through her friend the adjutant to meet with this one would prove easy but the chauffeurcommander of the armored car made it most difficult at sight of marie much to her alarm as though greeting a dear friend he snatched his kepi from his head and sprang toward her the major he cried told me you were here that you are madame daurillac his eyes spoke his admiration in delight he beamed upon her i might have known it he murmured with the confidence of one who is sure he brings good news he laughed happily and i he cried am pierrot who the devil pierrot might be the spy could not guess she knew only that she wished by a german shell pierrot and his car had been blown to tiny fragments was it a trap she asked herself or was the handsome youth really some one the countess daurillac should know but as from his introducing himself it was evident he could not know that lady very well marie took courage and smiled which pierrot she parried pierre thierry cried the youth to the relief of marie he turned upon the adjutant and to him explained who pierre thierry might be paul daurillac he said is my dearest friend when he married this charming lady i was stationed in algiers and but for the war i might never have met her to marie with his hand on his heart in a most charming manner he bowed his admiration he made no effort to conceal and so he said i know why there is war the adjutant smiled indulgently and departed on his duties leaving them alone the handsome eyes of captain thierry were raised to the violet eyes of marie they appraised her boldly and as boldly expressed their approval in burlesque the young man exclaimed indignantly paul deceived me he cried he told me he had married the most beautiful woman in laon he has married the most beautiful woman in france to marie this was not impertinence but gallantry this was a language she understood and this was the type of man because he was the least difficult to manage she held most in contempt but about you paul did not deceive me she retorted in apparent confusion her eyes refused to meet his he told me pierrot was a most dangerous man she continued hurriedly with wifely solicitude she asked concerning paul she explained that for a week she had been a prisoner in the chateau and since the mobilization of her husband save that he was with his regiment in paris she had heard nothing captain thierry was able to give her later news only the day previous on the boulevards he had met count daurillac he was at the grand hotel and as thierry was at once motoring back to paris he would give paul news of their meeting he hoped he might tell him that soon his wife also would be in paris marie explained that only the illness of her aunt prevented her from that same day joining her husband her manner became serious and what other news have you she asked here on the firingline we know less of what is going forward than you in paris so pierre thierry told her all he knew they were preparing despatches he was at once to carry back to the general staff and for the moment his time was his own how could he better employ it than in talking of the war with a patriotic and charming french woman in consequence marie acquired a mass of facts gossip and guesses from these she mentally selected such information as to her employers across the aisne would be of vital interest and to rid herself of thierry and on the fourth floor seek anfossi was now her only wish but in attempting this by the return of the adjutant she was delayed to thierry the adjutant gave a sealed envelope thirtyone boulevard des invalides he said with a smile he turned to marie and you will accompany him i exclaimed marie she was sick with sudden terror but the tolerant smile of the adjutant reassured her the count your husband he explained has learned of your detention here by the enemy and he has besieged the general staff to have you convoyed safely to paris the adjutant glanced at a field telegram he held open in his hand he asks he continued that you be permitted to return in the car of his friend captain thierry and that on arriving you join him at the grand hotel thierry exclaimed with delight but how charming he cried tonight you must both dine with me at la rues he saluted his superior officer some petrol sir he said and i am ready to marie he added the car will be at the steps in five minutes he turned and left them the thoughts of marie snatching at an excuse for delay raced madly the danger of meeting the count daurillac her supposed husband did not alarm her the grand hotel has many exits and even before they reached it for leaving the car she could invent an excuse that the gallant thierry would not suspect but what now concerned her was how before she was whisked away to paris she could convey to anfossi the information she had gathered from thierry first of a woman overcome with delight at being reunited with her husband she gave an excellent imitation then she exclaimed in distress but my aunt madame benet she cried i cannot leave her the sisters of st francis said the adjutant arrive within an hour to nurse the wounded they will care also for your aunt marie concealed her chagrin then i will at once prepare to go she said the adjutant handed her a slip of paper your laissezpasser to paris he said you leave in five minutes madame as temporary hostess of the chateau marie was free to visit any part of it and as she passed her door a signal from madame benet told her that anfossi was on the fourth floor that he was at work and that the coast was clear softly in the felt slippers she always wore as she explained in order not to disturb the wounded she mounted the staircase in her hand she carried the housekeepers keys and as an excuse it was her plan to return with an armful of linen for the arriving sisters but marie never reached the top of the stairs when her eyes rose to the level of the fourth floor she came to a sudden halt at what she saw terror gripped her bound her hand and foot and turned her blood to ice at her post for an instant madame benet had slept and an officer of the staff led by curiosity chance or suspicion had unobserved and unannounced mounted to the fourth floor when marie saw him he was in front of the room that held the wireless his back was toward her but she saw that he was holding the door to the room ajar that his eye was pressed to the opening and that through it he had pushed the muzzle of his automatic what would be the fate of anfossi marie knew nor did she for an instant consider it her thoughts were of her own safety that she might live not that she might still serve the wilhelmstrasse the kaiser or the fatherland but that she might live in a moment anfossi would be denounced the chateau would ring with the alarm and though she knew anfossi would not betray her by others she might be accused to avert suspicion from herself she saw only one way open she must be the first to denounce anfossi like a deer she leaped down the marble stairs and in a panic she had no need to assume burst into the presence of the staff gentlemen she gasped my servant the chauffeur briand is a spy there is a german wireless in the chateau he is using it i have seen him with exclamations the officers rose to their feet general andre alone remained seated general andre was a veteran of many colonial wars cochinchina algiers morocco the great war when it came found him on duty in the intelligence department his aquiline nose bristling white eyebrows and flashing restless eyes gave him his nickname of laigle in amazement the flashing eyes were now turned upon marie he glared at her as though he thought she suddenly had flown mad a german wireless he protested it is impossible i was on the fourth floor panted marie collecting linen for the sisters in the room next to the linencloset i heard a strange buzzing sound i opened the door softly i saw briand with his back to me seated by an instrument there were receivers clamped to his ears my god the disgrace the disgrace to my husband and to me who vouched for him to you apparently in an agony of remorse the fingers of the woman laced and interlaced i cannot forgive myself the officers moved toward the door but general andre halted them still in a tone of incredulity he demanded when did you see this marie knew the question was coming knew she must explain how she saw briand and yet did not see the staff officer who with his prisoner might now at any instant appear she must make it plain she had discovered the spy and left the upper part of the house before the officer had visited it when that was she could not know but the chance was that he had preceded her by only a few minutes when did you see this repeated the general but just now cried marie not ten minutes since why did you not come to me at once i was afraid replied marie if i moved i was afraid he might hear me and he knowing i would expose him would kill meand so escape you there was an eager whisper of approval for silence general andre slapped his hand upon the table then continued marie i understood with the receivers on his ears he could not have heard me open the door nor could he hear me leave and i ran to my aunt the thought that we had harbored such an animal sickened me and i was weak enough to feel faint but only for an instant then i came here she moved swiftly to the door let me show you the room she begged you can take him in the act her eyes wild with the excitement of the chase swept the circle will you come she begged unconscious of the crisis he interrupted the orderly on duty opened the door captain thierrys compliments he recited mechanically and is he to delay longer for madame daurillac with a sharp gesture general andre waved marie toward the door without rising he inclined his head adieu madame he said we act at once upon your information i thank you as she crossed from the hall to the terrace the ears of the spy were assaulted by a sudden tumult of voices they were raised in threats and curses looking back she saw anfossi descending the stairs his hands were held above his head behind him with his automatic the staff officer she had surprised on the fourth floor was driving him forward above the clinched fists of the soldiers that ran to meet him the eyes of anfossi were turned toward her his face was expressionless his eyes neither accused nor reproached and with the joy of one who has looked upon and then escaped the guillotine marie ran down the steps to the waiting automobile with a pretty cry of pleasure she leaped into the seat beside thierry gayly she threw out her arms to paris she commanded the handsome eyes of thierry eloquent with admiration looked back into hers he stooped threw in the clutch and the great gray car with the machine gun and its crew of privates guarding the rear plunged through the park to paris echoed thierry in the order in which marie had last seen them anfossi and the staff officer entered the room of general andre and upon the soldiers in the hall the door was shut the face of the staff officer was grave but his voice could not conceal his elation my general he reported i found this man in the act of giving information to the enemy there is a wireless general andre rose slowly he looked neither at the officer nor at his prisoner with frowning eyes he stared down at the maps upon his table i know he interrupted some one has already told me he paused and then as though recalling his manners but still without raising his eyes he added you have done well sir in silence the officers of the staff stood motionless with surprise they noted that as yet neither in anger nor curiosity had general andre glanced at the prisoner but of the presence of the general the spy was most acutely conscious he stood erect his arms still raised but his body strained forward and on the averted eyes of the general his own were fixed in an agony of supplication they asked a question at last as though against his wish toward the spy the general turned his head and their eyes met and still general andre was silent then the arms of the spy like those of a runner who has finished his race and breasts the tape exhausted fell to his sides in a voice low and vibrant he spoke his question it has been so long sir he pleaded may i not come home general andre turned to the astonished group surrounding him his voice was hushed like that of one who speaks across an open grave gentlemen he began my children he added a german spy a woman involved in a scandal your brother in arms henri ravignac his honor he thought was concerned and without honor he refused to live to prove him guiltless his younger brother charles asked leave to seek out the woman who had betrayed henri and by us was detailed on secret service he gave up home family friends he lived in exile in poverty at all times in danger of a swift and ignoble death in the war office we know him as one who has given to his country services she cannot hope to reward for she cannot return to him the years he has lost she cannot return to him his brother but she can and will clear the name of henri ravignac and upon his brother charles bestow promotion and honors the general turned and embraced the spy my children he said welcome your brother he has come home before the car had reached the fortifications marie gessler had arranged her plan of escape she had departed from the chateau without even a handbag and she would say that before the shops closed she must make purchases le printemps lay in their way and she asked that when they reached it for a moment she might alight captain thierry readily gave permission from the department store it would be most easy to disappear and in anticipation marie smiled covertly nor was the picture of captain thierry impatiently waiting outside unamusing but before le printemps was approached the car turned sharply down a narrow street on one side along its entire length ran a high gray wall grim and forbidding in it was a green gate studded with iron bolts before this the automobile drew suddenly to a halt the crew of the armored car tumbled off the rear seat and one of them beat upon the green gate marie felt a hand of ice clutch at her throat but she controlled herself and what is this she cried gayly at her side captain thierry was smiling down at her but his smile was hateful it is the prison of st lazare he said it is not becoming he added sternly that the name of the countess daurillac should be made common as the paris road fighting for her life marie thrust herself against him her arm that throughout the journey had rested on the back of the drivingseat caressed his shoulders her lips and the violet eyes were close to his why should you care she whispered fiercely you have me let the count daurillac look after the honor of his wife himself the charming thierry laughed at her mockingly he means to he said i am the count daurillac the deserter in salonika the american consul the standard oil man and the war correspondents formed the american colony the correspondents were waiting to go to the front incidentally as we waited the front was coming rapidly toward us there was uncle jim the veteran of many wars and of all the correspondents in experience the oldest and in spirit the youngest and there was the kid and the artist the kid jeered at us and proudly described himself as the only boy reporter who jumped from a city hall assignment to cover a european war i dont know strategy he would boast neither does the man at home he wants human interest stuff and i give him what he wants i write exclusively for the subway guard and the farmers in the wheat belt when you fellows write about the situation they dont understand it neither do you neither does venizelos or the king i dont understand it myself so i write my people hearttoheart talks about refugees and wounded and what kind of ploughs the servian peasants use and that st paul wrote his letters to the thessalonians from the same hotel where i write mine and i tell em to pronounce salonika eeka and not put the accent on the on this morning at the refugee camp i found all the little servians of the frothingham unit in american boy scout uniforms thats my meat thats home week stuff you fellows write for the editorial page and nobody reads it i write for the man that turns first to mutt and jeff and then looks to see where they are running the new charlie chaplin release when that man has to choose between our military correspondent and the city hall reporter he chooses me the third man was john our special artist john could write a news story too but it was the cartoons that had made him famous they were not comic page but front page cartoons and before making up their minds what they thought people waited to see what their artist thought so it was fortunate his thoughts were as brave and clean as they were clever he was the original little brother to the poor he was always giving away money when we caught him he would prevaricate he would say the man was a college chum that he had borrowed the money from him and that this was the first chance he had had to pay it back the kid suggested it was strange that so many of his college chums should at the same moment turn up dead broke in salonika and that half of them should be women john smiled disarmingly it was a large college he explained and coeducational there were other americans red cross doctors and nurses just escaped through the snow from the bulgars and hyphenated americans who said they had taken out their first papers they thought hyphenated citizens were so popular with us that we would pay their passage to new york in salonika they were transients they had no local standing they had no local lyingdown place either or place to eat or to wash although they did not look as though that worried them or place to change their clothes or clothes to change it was because we had clothes to change and a hotel bedroom instead of a bench in a cafe that we were ranked as residents and from the greek police held a permission to sojourn our american colony was a very close corporation we were only six americans against british french greek and servian soldiers and civilian turks spanish jews armenians persians egyptians albanians and arabs and some twenty more other races that are not listed we had arrived in salonika before the rush and at the hotel hermes on the waterfront had secured a vast room the edge of the stone quay was not forty feet from us the only landing steps directly opposite our balcony everybody who arrived on the greek passenger boats from naples or the piraeus or who had shore leave from a manofwar transport or hospital ship was raked by our cameras there were four windows one for each of us and his work table it was not easy to work what was the use the pictures and stories outside the windows fascinated us but when we sketched them or wrote about them they only proved us inadequate all day long the pinnaces cutters gigs steam launches shoved and bumped against the stone steps marines came ashore for the mail stewards for fruit and fish red cross nurses to shop tiny midshipmen to visit the movies and the sailors and officers of the russian french british italian and greek warships to stretch their legs in the park of the tour blanche or to cramp them under a cafe table sometimes the ambulances blocked the quay and the wounded and frostbitten were lifted into the motorboats and sometimes a squad of marines lined the landing stage and as a coffin under a french or english flag was borne up the stone steps stood at salute so crowded was the harbor that the oars of the boatmen interlocked close to the stone quay stretched along the threemile circle were the fishing smacks beyond them so near that the anchor chains fouled were the passenger ships with gigantic greek flags painted on their sides and beyond them transports from marseilles malta and suvla bay black colliers white hospital ships burning green electric lights redbellied tramps and freighters and hemming them in the grim mousecolored destroyers submarines cruisers dreadnaughts at times like a wall the cold fog rose between us and the harbor and again the curtain would suddenly be ripped asunder and the sun would flash on the brass work of the fleet on the white wings of the aeroplanes on the snowdraped shoulders of mount olympus we often speculated as to how in the early days the gods and goddesses dressed as they were or as they were not survived the snows of mount olympus or was it only their resort for the summer it got about that we had a vast room to ourselves where one might obtain a drink or a sofa for the night or even money to cable for money so we had many strange visitors some half starved half frozen with terrible tales of the albanian trail of the austrian prisoners fallen by the wayside of the mountain passes heaped with dead of the doctors and nurses wading waisthigh in snowdrifts and for food killing the ponies some of our visitors wanted to get their names in the american papers so that the folks at home would know they were still alive others wanted us to keep their names out of the papers hoping the police would think them dead another convinced it was of pressing news value desired us to advertise the fact that he had invented a poisonous gas for use in the trenches with difficulty we prevented him from casting it adrift in our room or he had for sale a secondhand motorcycle or he would accept a position as barkeeper or for five francs would sell a state secret that once made public in a month would end the war it seemed cheap at the price each of us had his scouts to bring him the bazaar rumor the turkish bath rumor the cafe rumor some of our scouts journeyed as far afield as monastir and doiran returning to drip snow on the floor and to tell us tales onehalf of which we refused to believe and the other half the censor refused to pass with each others visitors it was etiquette not to interfere it would have been like tapping a private wire when we found john sketching a giant stranger in a cap and coat of wolf skin we did not seek to know if he were an albanian brigand or a servian prince incognito and when a dark levantine sat close to the kid whispering and the kid banged on his typewriter we did not listen so when i came in one afternoon and found a strange american youth writing at johns table and no one introduced us i took it for granted he had sold the artist an exclusive story and asked no questions but i could not help hearing what they said even though i tried to drown their voices by beating on the kids typewriter i was taking my third lesson and i had printed i amm w writjng this wjth my own lilly wite hands when i heard the kid saying you can beat the game this way let john buy you a ticket to the piraeus if you go from one greek port to another you dont need a vise but if you book from here to italy you must get a permit from the italian consul and our consul and the police the plot is to get out of the war zone isnt it well then my dope is to get out quick and map the rest of your trip when youre safe in athens it was no business of mine but i had to look up the stranger was now pacing the floor i noticed that while his face was almost black with tan his upper lip was quite white i noticed also that he had his hands in the pockets of one of johns blue serge suits and that the pink silk shirt he wore was one that once had belonged to the kid except for the pink shirt in the appearance of the young man there was nothing unusual he was of a familiar type he looked like a young business man from our middle west matteroffact and unimaginative but capable and selfreliant if he had had a fountain pen in his upper waistcoat pocket i would have guessed he was an insurance agent or the publicity man for a new automobile john picked up his hat and said thats good advice give me your steamer ticket fred and ill have them change it he went out but he did not ask fred to go with him uncle jim rose and murmured something about the cafe roma and tea but neither did he invite fred to go with him instead he told him to make himself at home and if he wanted anything the waiter would bring it from the cafe downstairs then the kid as though he also was uncomfortable at being left alone with us hurried to the door going to get you a suitcase he explained back in five minutes the stranger made no answer probably he did not hear him not a hundred feet from our windows three greek steamers were huddled together and the eyes of the american were fixed on them the one for which john had gone to buy him a new ticket lay nearest she was to sail in two hours impatiently in short quick steps the stranger paced the length of the room but when he turned and so could see the harbor he walked slowly devouring it with his eyes for some time in silence he repeated this manoeuvre and then the complaints of the typewriter disturbed him he halted and observed my struggles under his scornful eye in my embarrassment i frequently hit the right letter you a newspaper man too he asked i boasted i was but begged not to be judged by my typewriting i got some great stories to write when i get back to gods country he announced i was a reporter for two years in kansas city before the war and now im going back to lecture and write i got enough material to keep me at work for five years all kinds of stuff specials fiction stories personal experiences maybe a novel i regarded him with envy for the correspondents in the greatest of all wars the pickings had been meagre you are to be congratulated i said he brushed aside my congratulations for what he demanded i didnt go after the stories they came to me the things i saw i had to see couldnt get away from them ive been with the british serving in the r a m c been hospital steward stretcher bearer ambulance driver ive been sixteen months at the front and all the time on the firingline i was in the retreat from mons with french on the marne at ypres all through the winter fighting along the canal on the gallipoli peninsula and just lately in servia ive seen more of this war than any soldier because sometimes they give the soldier a rest they never give the medical corps a rest the only rest i got was when i was wounded he seemed no worse for his wounds so again i tendered congratulations this time he accepted them the recollection of the things he had seen things incredible terrible unique in human experience had stirred him he talked on not boastfully but in a tone rather of awe and disbelief as though assuring himself that it was really he to whom such things had happened i dont believe theres any kind of fighting i havent seen he declared handtohand fighting with bayonets grenades gun butts ive seen em on their knees in the mud choking each other beating each other with their bare fists ive seen every kind of airship bomb shell poison gas every kind of wound seen whole villages turned into a brickyard in twenty minutes in servia seen bodies of women frozen to death bodies of babies starved to death seen men in belgium swinging from trees along the yzer for three months i saw the bodies of men id known sticking out of the mud or hung up on the barb wire with the crows picking them ive seen some of the nerviest stunts that ever were pulled off in history ive seen real heroes time and time again ive seen a man throw away his life for his officer or for a chap he didnt know just as though it was a cigarette butt ive seen the women nurses of our corps steer a car into a village and yank out a wounded man while shells were breaking under the wheels and the houses were pitching into the streets he stopped and laughed consciously understand he warned me im not talking about myself only of things ive seen the things im going to put in my book it ought to be a pretty good bookwhat my envy had been washed clean in admiration it will make a wonderful book i agreed are you going to syndicate it first young mr hamlin frowned importantly i was thinking he said of asking john for letters to the magazine editors so theyll know im not faking that ive really been through it all letters from john would help a lot then he asked anxiously they would wouldnt they i reassured him remembering the kids gibes at john and his numerous dependents i said you another college chum of johns the young man answered my question quite seriously no he said john graduated before i entered but we belong to the same fraternity it was the luckiest chance in the world my finding him here there was a monthold copy of the balkan news blowing around camp and his name was in the list of arrivals the moment i found he was in salonika i asked for twelve hours leave and came down in an ambulance i made straight for john gave him the grip and put it up to him to help me i dont understand i said i thought you were sailing on the adriaticus the young man was again pacing the floor he halted and faced the harbor you bet im sailing on the adriaticus he said he looked out at that vessel at the blue peter flying from her foremast and grinned in just two hours it was stupid of me but i still was unenlightened but your twelve hours leave i asked the young man laughed they can take my twelve hours leave he said deliberately and feed it to the chickens im beating it what dyou mean youre beating it what do you suppose i mean he demanded what do you suppose im doing out of uniform what do you suppose im lying low in the room for sos i wont catch cold if youre leaving the army without a discharge and without permission i said i suppose you know its desertion mr hamlin laughed easily its not my army he said im an american its your desertion i suggested the door opened and closed noiselessly and billy entering placed a new travelling bag on the floor he must have heard my last words for he looked inquiringly at each of us but he did not speak and walking to the window stood with his hands in his pockets staring out at the harbor his presence seemed to encourage the young man who knows im deserting he demanded no ones ever seen me in salonika before and in these cits i can get on board all right and then they cant touch me what do the folks at home care how i left the british army theyll be so darned glad to get me back alive that they wont ask if i walked out or was kicked out i should worry its none of my business i began but i was interrupted in his restless pacings the young man turned quickly as you say he remarked icily it is none of your business its none of your business whether i get shot as a deserter or go home or you can go to the devil for all i care i assured him i wasnt considering you at all i was only sorry that ill never be able to read your book for a moment mr hamlin remained silent then he burst forth with a jeer no british firing squad he boasted will ever stand me up maybe not i agreed but you will never write that book again there was silence and this time it was broken by the kid he turned from the window and looked toward hamlin thats right he said he sat down on the edge of the table and at the deserter pointed his forefinger son he said this war is some war its the biggest war in history and folks will be talking about nothing else for the next ninety years folks that never were nearer it than bay city mich but you wont talk about it and youve been all through it youve been to hell and back again compared with what you know about hell dante is in the same class with dr cook but you wont be able to talk about this war or lecture or write a book about it i wont demanded hamlin and why wont i because of what youre doing now said billy because youre queering yourself now youve got everything the kid was very much in earnest his tone was intimate kind and friendly youve seen everything done everything wed give our eyeteeth to see what youve seen and to write the things you can write youve got a record now thatll last you until youre dead and your grandchildren are deadand then some when you talk the table will have to sit up and listen you can say i was there i was in it i saw i know when this war is over youll have everything out of it thats worth gettingall the experiences all the inside knowledge all the nosebag news youll have wounds honors medals money reputation and youre throwing all that away mr hamlin interrupted savagely to hell with their medals he said they can take their medals and hang em on christmas trees i dont owe the british army anything it owes me ive done my bit ive earned what ive got and theres no one can take it away from me you can said the kid before hamlin could reply the door opened and john came in followed by uncle jim the older man was looking very grave and john very unhappy hamlin turned quickly to john i thought these men were friends of yours he began and americans theyre fine americans theyre as full of human kindness and red blood as a kippered herring john looked inquiringly at the kid he wants to hang himself explained billy and because we tried to cut him down hes sore they talked to me protested hamlin as though i was a yellow dog as though i was a quitter im no quitter but if im ready to quit whos got a better right im not an englishman but there are several million englishmen havent done as much for england in this was as i have what do you fellows know about it you write about it about the brave lads in the trenches but what do you know about the trenches what youve seen from automobiles thats all thats where you get off ive lived in the trenches for fifteen months froze in em starved in em risked my life in em and ive saved other lives too by hauling men out of the trenches and thats no airy persiflage either he ran to the wardrobe where johns clothes hung and from the bottom of it dragged a khaki uniform it was still so caked with mud and snow that when he flung it on the floor it splashed like a wet bathing suit how would you like to wear one of those he demanded stinking with lice and sweat and blood the blood of other men the men youve helped off the field and your own blood as though committing harakiri he slashed his hand across his stomach and then drew it up from his waist to his chin im scraped with shrapnel from there to there said mr hamlin and another time i got a ball in the shoulder that would have been a blighty for a fighting man theyre always giving them leave but all i got was six weeks at havre in hospital then it was the dardanelles and sunstroke and sand sleeping in sand eating sand sand in your boots sand in your teeth hiding in holes in the sand like a dirty prairie dog and then off to servia and the next act opens in the snow and the mud cold god how cold it was and most of us in sun helmets as though the cold still gnawed at his bones he shivered it isnt the danger he protested it isnt that im getting away from to hell with the danger its just the plain discomfort of it its the never being your own master never being clean never being warm again he shivered and rubbed one hand against the other there were no bridges over the streams he went on and we had to break the ice and wade in and then sleep in the open with the khaki frozen to us there was no firewood not enough to warm a pot of tea there were no wounded all our casualties were frost bite and pneumonia when we take them out of the blankets their toes fall off weve been in camp for a month now near doiran and its worse there than on the march its a frozen swamp you cant sleep for the cold cant eat the only ration we get is bully beef and our insides are frozen so damn tight we cant digest it the cold gets into your blood gets into your brains it wont let you think or else you think crazy things it makes you afraid he shook himself like a man coming out of a bad dream so im through he said in turn he scowled at each of us as though defying us to contradict him thats why im quitting he added because ive done my bit because im damn well fed up on it he kicked viciously at the waterlogged uniform on the floor any one who wants my job can have it he walked to the window turned his back on us and fixed his eyes hungrily on the adriaticus there was a long pause for guidance we looked at john but he was staring down at the desk blotter scratching on it marks that he did not see finally where angels feared to tread the kid rushed in thats certainly a hard luck story he said but he added cheerfully its nothing to the hard luck youll strike when you cant tell why you left the army hamlin turned with an exclamation but billy held up his hand now wait he begged we havent time to get mussy at six oclock your leave is up and the troop train starts back to camp and mr hamlin interrupted sharply and the adriaticus starts at five billy did not heed him youve got two hours to change your mind he said thats better than being sorry you didnt the rest of your life mr hamlin threw back his head and laughed it was a most unpleasant laugh youre a fine body of men he jeered america must be proud of you if we werent americans explained billy patiently we wouldnt give a damn whether you deserted or not youre drowning and you dont know it and were throwing you a rope try to see it that way well cut out the fact that you took an oath and that youre breaking it thats up to you well get down to results when you reach home if you cant tell why you left the army the folks will darned soon guess and that will queer everything youve done when you come to sell your stuff it will queer you with the editors queer you with the publishers if they know you broke your word to the british army how can they know youre keeping faith with them how can they believe anything you tell them every story you write every statement of yours will make a noise like a fake you wont come into court with clean hands youll be licked before you start of course youre for the allies well all the germans at home will fear that and when you want to lecture on your fifteen months at the british front theyll look up your record and what will they do to you this is what theyll do to you when youve shown em your moving pictures and say does any gentleman in the audience want to ask a question a german agent will get up and say yes i want to ask a question is it true that you deserted from the british army and that if you return to it they will shoot you i was scared i expected the lean and muscular mr hamlin to fall on billy and fling him where he had flung the soggy uniform but instead he remained motionless his arms pressed across his chest his eyes filled with anger and distress returned to the adriaticus im sorry muttered the kid john rose and motioned to the door and guiltily and only too gladly we escaped john followed us into the hall let me talk to him he whispered the boat sails in an hour please dont come back until shes gone we went to the moving picture palace next door but i doubt if the thoughts of any of us were on the pictures for after an hour when from across the quay there came the longdrawn warning of a steamers whistle we nudged each other and rose and went out not a hundred yards from us the propeller blades of the adriaticus were slowly churning and the rowboats were falling away from her sides goodbye mr hamlin called billy you had everything and you chucked it away i can spell your finish its check for yours but when we entered our room in the centre of it under the bunch of electric lights stood the deserter he wore the waterlogged uniform the sun helmet was on his head good man shouted billy he advanced eagerly holding out his hand mr hamlin brushed past him at the door he turned and glared at us even at john he was not a good loser i hope youre satisfied he snarled he pointed at the four beds in a row i felt guiltily conscious of them at the moment they appeared so unnecessarily clean and warm and soft the silk coverlets at the foot of each struck me as being disgracefully effeminate they made me ashamed i hope said mr hamlin speaking slowly and picking his words when you turn into those beds tonight youll think of me in the mud i hope when youre having your fivecourse dinner and your champagne youll remember my bully beef i hope when a shell or mr pneumonia gets me youll write a nice little sob story about the brave lads in the trenches he looked at us standing like schoolboys sheepish embarrassed and silent and then threw open the door i hope he added you all choke with an unconvincing imitation of the college chum manner john cleared his throat and said dont forget fred if theres anything i can do hamlin stood in the doorway smiling at us theres something you can all do he said yes asked john heartily you can all go to hell said mr hamlin we heard the door slam and his hobnailed boots pounding down the stairs no one spoke instead in unhappy silence we stood staring at the floor where the uniform had lain was a pool of mud and melted snow and the darker stains of stale blood
