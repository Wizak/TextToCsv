with my children at my knees to coze over a snug bottle of claret after dinner with a friend like you to share it to see the young folks at the breakfasttable of a morning and to kiss them and so off to business with a cheerful heart this was my scheme in marrying had it pleased heaven to prosper my plan when i was a boy and came from school and college i used to see mr bonnington my fatherinlaw with his young ones clustering round about him so happy to be with him so eager to wait on him all down on their little knees round my mother before breakfast or jumping up on his after dinner it was

touchit dont laugh at mr bonnington he is as good a fellow as ever breathed between you and me as my half brothers and sisters increased and multiplied year after year i used to feel rather lonely rather bowled out you understand but i saw them so happy that i longed to have a home of my own when my mother proposed arabella for me for she and lady kicklebury were immense friends at one time i was glad enough to give up clubs and bachelorhood and to settle down as a married man my mother acted for the best my poor wifes character my mother used to say changed after marriage i was not as happy as i hoped to be but i tried for it george i am not so comfortable now as i might be a house without a mistress with two mothersinlaw reigning over it one worldly and aristocratic another what

his wife at this very moment touchit what a woman that was eh julia that departed angel what a temper she had before her departure miss p but the wind was tempered to the lamb if she was angry the lamb was so very lamblike and meek and fleecy touchit and what a desperate flirt the departed angel was i knew half a dozen fellows before her marriage whom she threw over because milliken was so rich miss p she was consistent at least and did not change after marriage as some ladies do but flirted as you call it just as much as before at paris young mr verney the attache was never out of the house at rome mr beard the artist was always drawing pictures of her at naples when poor mr m went away to look after his affairs at st petersburg little count posilippo was for ever coming to learn english
