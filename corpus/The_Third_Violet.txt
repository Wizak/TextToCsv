 the third violet by stephen crane author of the red badge of courage the little regiment and maggie new york d appleton and company copyright by d appleton and company copyright by stephen crane the third violet chapter i the engine bellowed its way up the slanting winding valley grey crags and trees with roots fastened cleverly to the steeps looked down at the struggles of the black monster when the train finally released its passengers they burst forth with the enthusiasm of escaping convicts a great bustle ensued on the platform of the little mountain station the idlers and philosophers from the village were present to examine the consignment of people from the city these latter loaded with bundles and children thronged at the stage drivers the stage drivers thronged at the people from the city hawker with his clothes case his paintbox his easel climbed awkwardly down the steps of the car the easel swung uncontrolled and knocked against the head of a little boy who was disembarking backward with fine caution hello little man said hawker did it hurt the child regarded him in silence and with sudden interest as if hawker had called his attention to a phenomenon the young painter was politely waiting until the little boy should conclude his examination but a voice behind him cried roger go on down a nursemaid was conducting a little girl where she would probably be struck by the other end of the easel the boy resumed his cautious descent the stage drivers made such great noise as a collection that as individuals their identities were lost with a highly important air as a man proud of being so busy the baggageman of the train was thundering trunks at the other employees on the platform hawker prowling through the crowd heard a voice near his shoulder say do you know where is the stage for hemlock inn hawker turned and found a young woman regarding him a wave of astonishment whirled into his hair and he turned his eyes quickly for fear that she would think that he had looked at her he said yes certainly i think i can find it at the same time he was crying to himself wouldnt i like to paint her though what a glance oh murder the the the distance in her eyes he went fiercely from one driver to another that obdurate stage for hemlock inn must appear at once finally he perceived a man who grinned expectantly at him oh said hawker you drive the stage for hemlock inn the man admitted it hawker said here is the stage the young woman smiled the driver inserted hawker and his luggage far into the end of the vehicle he sat there crooked forward so that his eyes should see the first coming of the girl into the frame of light at the other end of the stage presently she appeared there she was bringing the little boy the little girl the nursemaid and another young woman who was at once to be known as the mother of the two children the girl indicated the stage with a small gesture of triumph when they were all seated uncomfortably in the huge covered vehicle the little boy gave hawker a glance of recognition it hurted then but its all right now he informed him cheerfully did it replied hawker im sorry oh i didnt mind it much continued the little boy swinging his long redleather leggings bravely to and fro i dont cry when im hurt anyhow he cast a meaning look at his tiny sister whose soft lips set defensively the driver climbed into his seat and after a scrutiny of the group in the gloom of the stage he chirped to his horses they began a slow and thoughtful trotting dust streamed out behind the vehicle in front the green hills were still and serene in the evening air a beam of gold struck them aslant and on the sky was lemon and pink information of the suns sinking the driver knew many people along the road and from time to time he conversed with them in yells the two children were opposite hawker they sat very correctly mucilaged to their seats but their large eyes were always upon hawker calmly valuing him do you think it nice to be in the country i do said the boy i like it very well answered hawker i shall go fishing and hunting and everything maybe i shall shoot a bears i hope you may did you ever shoot a bears no well i didnt too but maybe i will mister hollanden he said hed look around for one where i live roger interrupted the mother from her seat at hawkers side perhaps every one is not interested in your conversation the boy seemed embarrassed at this interruption for he leaned back in silence with an apologetic look at hawker presently the stage began to climb the hills and the two children were obliged to take grip upon the cushions for fear of being precipitated upon the nursemaid fate had arranged it so that hawker could not observe the girl with the the the distance in her eyes without leaning forward and discovering to her his interest secretly and impiously he wriggled in his seat and as the bumping stage swung its passengers this way and that way he obtained fleeting glances of a cheek an arm or a shoulder the drivers conversation tone to his passengers was also a yell train was an hour late tnight he said addressing the interior itll be nine oclock before we git t th inn an itll be perty dark travellin hawker waited decently but at last he said will it yes no moon he turned to face hawker and roared youre ol jim hawkers son haint yeh yes i thort id seen yeh

cents but i ses t th ol man taint no use goldern em theyll walk ruthern put up fifty cents yep ony a quarter in the shadows hawkers expression seemed assassinlike he glanced furtively down the stage she was apparently deep in talk with the mother of the children chapter ii when hawker pushed at the old gate it hesitated because of a broken hinge a dog barked with loud ferocity and came headlong over the grass hello stanley old man cried hawker the ardour for battle was instantly smitten from the dog and his barking swallowed in a gurgle of delight he was a large orange and white setter and he partly expressed his emotion by twisting his body into a fantastic curve and then dancing over the ground with his head and his tail very near to each other he gave vent to little sobs in a wild attempt to vocally describe his gladness well e was a dreat dod said hawker and the setter overwhelmed contorted himself wonderfully there were lights in the kitchen and at the first barking of the dog the door had been thrown open hawker saw his two sisters shading their eyes and peering down the yellow stream presently they shouted here he is they flung themselves out and upon him why will why will they panted were awful glad to see you in a whirlwind of ejaculation and unanswerable interrogation they grappled the clothes case the paintbox the easel and dragged him toward the house he saw his old mother seated in a rockingchair by the table she had laid aside her paper and was adjusting her glasses as she scanned the darkness hello mother cried hawker as he entered his eyes were bright the old mother reached her arms to his neck she murmured soft and halfarticulate words meanwhile the dog writhed from one to another he raised his muzzle high to express his delight he was always fully convinced that he was taking a principal part in this ceremony of welcome and that everybody was heeding him have you had your supper asked the old mother as soon as she recovered herself the girls clamoured sentences at him pas out in the barn will what made you so late he said maybe hed go up to the crossroads to see if he could see the stage maybe hes gone what made you so late and oh we got a new buggy the old mother repeated anxiously have you had your supper no said hawker but the three women sprang to their feet well well git you something right away they bustled about the kitchen and dove from time to time into the cellar they called to each other in happy voices steps sounded on the line of stones that led from the door toward the barn and a shout came from the darkness well william home again hey hawkers grey father came stamping genially into the room i thought maybe you got lost i was comin to hunt you he said grinning as they stood with gripped hands what made you so late while hawker confronted the supper the family sat about and contemplated him with shining eyes his sisters noted his tie and propounded some questions concerning it his mother watched to make sure that he should consume a notable quantity of the preserved cherries he used to be so fond of em when he was little she said oh will cried the younger sister do you remember lil johnson yeh shes married married las june is the boys room all ready mother asked the father we fixed it this mornin she said and do you remember jeff decker shouted the elder sister well hes dead yep drowned pickerel fishin poor feller well how are you gitting along william asked the father sell many pictures an occasional one saw your illustrations in the may number of perkinsons the old man

you never noticed my new rocker said the old mother pointing i set it right where i thought youd see it and you never took no notice aint it nice father bought it at monticello for my birthday i thought youd notice it first thing when hawker had retired for the night he raised a sash and sat by the window smoking the odour of the woods and the fields came sweetly to his nostrils the crickets chanted their hymn of the night on the black brow of the mountain he could see two long rows of twinkling dots which marked the position of hemlock inn chapter iii hawker had a writing friend named hollanden in new york hollanden had announced his resolution to spend the summer at hemlock inn i dont like to see the world progressing he had said i shall go to sullivan county for a time in the morning hawker took his painting equipment and after manoeuvring in the fields until he had proved to himself that he had no desire to go toward the inn he went toward it the time was only nine oclock and he knew that he could not hope to see hollanden before eleven as it was only through rumour that hollanden was aware that there was a sunrise and an early morning hawker encamped in front of some fields of vivid yellow stubble on which trees made olive shadows and which was overhung by a chinablue sky and sundry little white clouds he fiddled away perfunctorily at it a spectator would have believed probably that he was sketching the pines on the hill where shone the red porches of hemlock inn finally a whiteflannel young man walked into the landscape hawker waved a brush hi hollie get out of the colourscheme at this cry the whiteflannel young man looked down at his feet apprehensively finally he came forward grinning why hello hawker old boy glad to find you here he perched on a boulder and began to study hawkers canvas and the vivid yellow stubble with the olive shadows he wheeled his eyes from one to the other say hawker he said suddenly why dont you marry miss fanhall hawker had a brush in his mouth but he took it quickly out and said marry miss fanhall who the devil is miss fanhall hollanden clasped both hands about his knee and looked thoughtfully away oh shes a girl she is said hawker yes she came to the inn last night with her sisterinlaw and a small tribe of young fanhalls theres six of them i think two said hawker a boy and a girl how do you oh you must have come up with them of course why then you saw her was that her asked hawker listlessly was that her cried hollanden with indignation was that her oh said hawker hollanden mused again shes got lots of money he said loads of it and i think she would be fool enough to have sympathy for you in your work they are a tremendously wealthy crowd although they treat it simply it would be a good thing for you i believe yes i am sure she could be fool enough to have sympathy for you in your work and now if you werent such a hopeless chump oh shut up hollie said the painter for a time hollanden did as he was bid but at last he talked again cant think why they came up here must be her sisterinlaws health something like that she great heavens said hawker you speak of nothing else well you saw her didnt you demanded hollanden what can you expect then from a man of my sense you you old stick you it was quite dark protested the painter quite dark repeated hollanden in a wrathful voice what if it was well that is bound to make a difference in a mans opinion you know no it isnt it was light down at the railroad station anyhow if you had any sand thunder but i did get up early this morning say do you play tennis after a fashion said hawker why oh nothing replied hollanden sadly only they are wearing me out at the game i had to get up and play before breakfast this morning with the worcester girls and there is a lot more mad players who will be down on me before long its a terrible thing to be a tennis player why you used to put yourself out so little for people remarked hawker yes but up there hollanden jerked his thumb in the direction of the inn they think im so amiable well ill come up and help you out do hollanden laughed you and miss fanhall can team it against the littlest worcester girl and me he regarded the landscape and meditated hawker struggled for a grip on the thought of the stubble that colour of hair and eyes always knocks me kerplunk observed hollanden softly hawker looked up irascibly what colour hair and eyes he demanded i believe youre crazy what colour hair and eyes repeated hollanden with a savage gesture youve got no more appreciation than a post they are good enough for me muttered hawker turning again to his work he scowled first at the canvas and then at the stubble seems to me you had best take care of yourself instead of planning for me he said me cried hollanden me take care of myself my boy ive got a past of sorrow and gloom i youre nothing but a kid said hawker glaring at the other man oh of course said hollanden wagging his head with midnight wisdom oh of course well hollie said hawker with sudden affability i didnt mean to be unpleasant but then you are rather ridiculous you know sitting up there and howling about the colour of hair and eyes im not ridiculous yes you are you know hollie the writer waved his hand despairingly and you rode in the train with her and in the stage i didnt see her in the train said hawker oh then you saw her in the stage haha you old thief i sat up here and you sat down there and lied he jumped from his perch and belaboured hawkers shoulders stop that said the painter oh you old thief you lied to me you lied hold on bless my life here she comes now chapter iv one day hollanden said there are fortytwo people at hemlock inn i think fifteen are middleaged ladies of the most aggressive respectability they have come here for no discernible purpose save to get where they can see people and be displeased at them they sit in a large group on that porch and take measurements of character as importantly as if they constituted the jury of heaven when i arrived at hemlock inn i at once cast my eye searchingly about me perceiving this assemblage i cried there they are barely waiting to change my clothes i made for this formidable body and endeavoured to conciliate it almost every day i sit down among them and lie like a machine privately i believe they should be hanged but publicly i glisten with admiration do you know there is one of em who i know has not moved from the inn in eight days and this morning i said to her these long walks in the clear mountain air are doing you a world of good and i keep continually saying your frankness is so charming because of the great law of universal balance i know that this illustrious corps will believe good of themselves with exactly the same readiness that they will believe ill of others so i ply them with it in consequence the worst they ever say of me is isnt that mr hollanden a peculiar man and you know my boy thats not so bad for a literary person after some thought he added good people too good wives good mothers and everything of that kind you know but conservative very conservative hate anything radical can not endure it were that way themselves once you know they hit the mark too sometimes such general volleyings cant fail to hit everything may the devil fly away with them hawker regarded the group nervously and at last propounded a great question say i wonder where they all are recruited when you come to think that almost every summer hotel certainly said hollanden almost every summer hotel ive studied the question and have nearly established the fact that almost every summer hotel is furnished with a full corps of to be sure said hawker and if you search for them in the winter you can find barely a sign of them until you examine the boarding houses and then you observe certainly said hollanden of course by the way he added you havent got any obviously loose screws in your character have you no said hawker after consideration only general poverty thats all of course of course said hollanden but thats bad theyll get on to you sure particularly since you come up here to see miss fanhall so much hawker glinted his eyes at his friend youve got a deuced open way of speaking he observed deuced open is it cried hollanden it isnt near so open as your devotion to miss fanhall which is as plain as a red petticoat hung on a hedge hawkers face gloomed and he said well it might be plain to you you infernal cat but that doesnt prove that all those old hens can see it i tell you that if they look twice at you they cant fail to see it and its bad too very bad whats the matter with you havent you ever been in love before none of your business replied hawker hollanden thought upon this point for a time well he admitted finally thats true in a general way but i hate to see you managing your affairs so stupidly rage flamed into hawkers face and he cried passionately i tell you it is none of your business he suddenly confronted the other man hollanden surveyed this outburst with a critical eye and then slapped his knee with emphasis you certainly have got it a million times worse than i thought why you you youre heels over head what if i am said hawker with a gesture of defiance and despair hollanden saw a dramatic situation in the distance and with a bright smile he studied it say he exclaimed suppose she should not go to the picnic tomorrow she said this morning she did not know if she could go somebody was expected from new york i think wouldnt it break you up though eh youre so devlish clever said hawker with sullen irony hollanden was still regarding the distant dramatic situation and rivals too the woods must be crowded with them a girl like that you know and then all that money say your rivals must number enough to make a brigade of militia imagine them swarming around but then it doesnt matter so much he went on cheerfully youve got a good play there you must appreciate them to her you understand appreciate them kindly like a man in a watchtower you must laugh at them only about once a week and then very tolerantly you understand and kindly and and appreciatively youre a colossal ass hollie said hawker you yes yes i know replied the other peacefully a colossal ass of course after looking into the distance again he murmured im worried about that picnic i wish i knew she was going by heavens as a matter of fact she must be made to go what have you got to do with it cried the painter in another sudden outburst there there said hollanden waving his hand you fool only a spectator i assure you hawker seemed overcome then with a deep dislike of himself oh well you know hollie this sort of thing he broke off and gazed at the trees this sort of thing it how asked hollanden confound you for a meddling gabbling idiot cried hawker suddenly hollanden replied what did you do with that violet she dropped at the side of the tennis court yesterday chapter v mrs fanhall with the two children the worcester girls and hollanden clambered down the rocky path miss fanhall and hawker had remained on top of the ledge hollanden showed much zeal in conducting his contingent to the foot of the falls through the trees they could see the cataract a great shimmering white thing booming and thundering until all the leaves gently shuddered i wonder where miss fanhall and mr hawker have gone said the younger miss worcester i wonder where theyve gone millicent said hollander looking at her fondly you always had such great thought for others well i wonder where theyve gone at the foot of the falls where the mist arose in silver clouds and the green water swept into the pool miss worcester the elder seated on the moss exclaimed oh mr hollanden what makes all literary men so peculiar and all that just because i said that i could have made better digestive organs than providence if it is true that he made mine replied hollanden with reproach here roger he cried as he dragged the child away from the brink dont fall in there or you wont be the fullback at yale in as you have planned im sure i dont know how to answer you miss worcester ive inquired of innumerable literary men and none of em know i may say i have chased that problem for years i might give you my personal history and see if that would throw any light on the subject he looked about him with chin high until his glance had noted the two vague figures at the top of the cliff i might give you my personal history mrs fanhall looked at him curiously and the elder worcester girl cried oh do after another scanning of the figures at the top of the cliff hollanden established himself in an oratorical pose on a great weatherbeaten stone well you must understand i started my career my career you understand with a determination to be a prophet and although i have ended in being an acrobat a trained bear of the magazines and a juggler of comic paragraphs there was once carved upon my lips a smile which made many people detest me for it hung before them like a banshee whenever they tried to be satisfied with themselves i was informed from time to time that i was making no great holes in the universal plan and i came to know that one person in every two thousand of the people i saw had heard of me and that four out of five of these had forgotten it and then one in every two of those who remembered that they had heard of me regarded the fact that i wrote as a great impertinence i admitted these things and in defence merely builded a maxim that stated that each wise man in this world is concealed amid some twenty thousand fools if you have eyes for mathematics this conclusion should interest you meanwhile i created a gigantic dignity and when men saw this dignity and heard that i was a literary man they respected me i concluded that the simple campaign of existence for me was to delude the populace or as much of it as would look at me i did i do and now i can make myself quite happy concocting sneers about it others may do as they please but as for me he concluded ferociously i shall never disclose to anybody that an acrobat a trained bear of the magazines a juggler of comic paragraphs is not a priceless pearl of art and philosophy i dont believe a word of it is true said miss worcester what do you expect of autobiography demanded hollanden with asperity well anyhow hollie exclaimed the younger sister you didnt explain a thing about how literary men came to be so peculiar and thats what you started out to do you know well said hollanden crossly you must never expect a man to do what he starts to do millicent and besides he went on with the gleam of a sudden idea in his eyes literary men are not peculiar anyhow the elder worcester girl looked angrily at him indeed not you of course but the others they are all asses said hollanden genially the elder worcester girl reflected i believe you try to make us think and then just tangle us up purposely the younger worcester girl reflected you are an absurd old thing you know hollie hollanden climbed offendedly from the great weatherbeaten stone well i shall go and see that the men have not spilled the luncheon while breaking their necks over these rocks would you like to have it spread here mrs fanhall never mind consulting the girls i assure you i shall spend a great deal of energy and temper in bullying them into doing just as they please why when i was in brussels oh come now hollie you never were in brussels you know said the younger worcester girl what of that millicent demanded hollanden this is autobiography well i dont care hollie you tell such whoppers with a gesture of despair he again started away whereupon the worcester girls shouted in chorus oh i say hollie come back dont be angry we didnt mean to tease you hollie really we didnt well if you didnt said hollanden why did you the elder worcester girl was gazing fixedly at the top of the cliff oh there they are i wonder why they dont come down chapter vi stanley the setter walked to the edge of the precipice and looking over at the falls wagged his tail in friendly greeting he was braced warily so that if this howling white animal should reach up a hand for him he could flee in time the girl stared dreamily at the redstained crags that projected from the pines of the hill across the stream hawker lazily aimed bits of moss at the oblivious dog and missed him it must be fine to have something to think of beyond just living said the girl to the crags i suppose you mean art said hawker yes of course it must be finer at any rate than the ordinary thing he mused for a time yes it is it must be he said but then id rather just lie here the girl seemed aggrieved oh no you wouldnt you couldnt stop its dreadful to talk like that isnt it i always thought that painters were of course they should be maybe they are i dont know sometimes i am but not today well i should think you ought to be so much more contented than just ordinary people now i you he cried you are not just ordinary people well but when i try to recall what i have thought about in my life i cant remember you know thats what i mean you shouldnt talk that way he told her but why do you insist that life should be so highly absorbing for me you have everything you wish for he answered in a voice of deep gloom certainly not i am a woman but a woman to have everything she wishes for would have to be providence there are some things that are not in the world well what are they he asked of her thats just it she said nodding her head no one knows thats what makes the trouble well you are very unreasonable what you are very unreasonable if i were you an heiress the girl flushed and turned upon him angrily well he glowered back at her you are you know you cant deny it she looked at the redstained crags at last she said you seemed really contemptuous well i assure you that i do not feel contemptuous on the contrary i am filled with admiration thank heaven i am a man of the world whenever i meet heiresses i always have the deepest admiration as he said this he wore a brave hangdog expression the girl surveyed him coldly from his chin to his eyebrows you have a handsome audacity too he lay back in the long grass and contemplated the clouds you should have been a chinese soldier of fortune she said he threw another little clod at stanley and struck him on the head you are the most scientifically unbearable person in the world she said stanley came back to see his master and to assure himself that the clump on the head was not intended as a sign of serious displeasure hawker took the dogs long ears and tried to tie them into a knot and i dont see why you so delight in making people detest you she continued having failed to make a knot of the dogs ears hawker leaned back and surveyed his failure admiringly well i dont he said you do no i dont yes you do you just say the most terrible things as if you positively enjoyed saying them well what did i say now what did i say why you said that you always had the most extraordinary admiration for heiresses whenever you met them well whats wrong with that sentiment he said you cant find fault with that it is utterly detestable not at all he answered sullenly i consider it a tribute a graceful tribute miss fanhall arose and went forward to the edge of the cliff she became absorbed in the falls far below her a bough of a hemlock drooped to the water and each swirling mad wave caught it and made it nod nod nod her back was half turned toward hawker after a time stanley the dog discovered some ants scurrying in the moss and he at once began to watch them and wag his tail isnt it curious observed hawker how an animal as large as a dog will sometimes be so entertained by the very smallest things stanley pawed gently at the moss and then thrust his head forward to see what the ants did under the circumstances in the hunting season continued hawker having waited a moment this dog knows nothing on earth but his master and the partridges he is lost to all other sound and movement he moves through the woods like a steel machine and when he scents the bird ah it is beautiful shouldnt you like to see him then some of the ants had perhaps made warlike motions and stanley was pretending that this was a reason for excitement he reared aback and made grumbling noises in his throat after another pause hawker went on and now see the precious old fool he is deeply interested in the movements of the little ants and as childish and ridiculous over them as if they were highly important there you old blockhead let them alone stanley could not be induced to end his investigations and he told his master that the ants were the most thrilling and dramatic animals of his experience oh by the way said hawker at last as his glance caught upon the crags across the river did you ever hear the legend of those rocks yonder over there where i am pointing where im pointing did you ever hear it what yes no well i shall tell it to you he settled comfortably in the long grass chapter vii once upon a time there was a beautiful indian maiden of course and she was of course beloved by a youth from another tribe who was very handsome and stalwart and a mighty hunter of course but the maidens father was of course a stern old chief and when the question of his daughters marriage came up he of course declared that the maiden should be wedded only to a warrior of her tribe and of course when the young man heard this he said that in such case he would of course fling himself headlong from that crag the old chief was of course obdurate and of course the youth did of course as he had said and of course the maiden wept after hawker had waited for some time he said with severity you seem to have no great appreciation of folklore the girl suddenly bent her head listen she said theyre calling dont you hear hollies voice they went to another place and looking down over the shimmering treetops they saw hollanden waving his arms its luncheon said hawker look how frantic he is the path required that hawker should assist the girl very often his eyes shone at her whenever he held forth his hand to help her down a blessed steep place she seemed rather pensive the route to luncheon was very long suddenly he took a seat on an old tree and said oh i dont know why it is whenever im with you i i have no wits nor good nature nor anything its the worst luck he had left her standing on a boulder where she was provisionally helpless hurry she said theyre waiting for us stanley the setter had been sliding down cautiously behind them he now stood wagging his tail and waiting for the way to be cleared hawker leaned his head on his hand and pondered dejectedly its the worst luck hurry she said theyre waiting for us at luncheon the girl was for the most part silent hawker was superhumanly amiable somehow he gained the impression that they all quite fancied him and it followed that being clever was very easy hollanden listened and approved him with a benign countenance there was a little boat fastened to the willows at the edge of the black pool after the spread hollanden navigated various parties around to where they could hear the great hollow roar of the falls beating against the sheer rocks stanley swam after sticks at the request of little roger once hollanden succeeded in making the others so engrossed in being amused that hawker and miss fanhall were left alone staring at the white bubbles that floated solemnly on the black water after hawker had stared at them a sufficient time he said well you are an heiress you know in return she chose to smile radiantly turning toward him she said if you will be good now always perhaps ill forgive you they drove home in the sombre shadows of the hills with stanley padding along under the wagon the worcester girls tried to induce hollanden to sing and in consequence there was quarrelling until the blinking lights of the inn appeared above them as if a great lantern hung there hollanden conveyed his friend some distance on the way home from the inn to the farm good time at the picnic said the writer yes picnics are mainly places where the jam gets on the dead leaves and from thence to your trousers but this was a good little picnic he glanced at hawker but you dont look as if you had such a swell time hawker waved his hand tragically yes no i dont know whats wrong with you asked hollanden i tell you what it is hollie said the painter darkly whenever im with that girl im such a blockhead im not so stupid hollie you know im not but when im with her i cant be clever to save my life hollanden pulled contentedly at his pipe maybe she dont notice it notice it muttered hawker scornfully of course she notices it in conversation with her i tell you i am as interesting as an iron dog his voice changed as he cried i dont know why it is i dont know why it is blowing a huge cloud of smoke into the air hollanden studied it thoughtfully hits some fellows that way he said and of course it must be deuced annoying strange thing but now under those circumstances im very glib very glib i assure you i dont care what you are answered hawker all those confounded affairs of yours they were not no said hollanden stolidly puffing of course not i understand that but look here billie he added with sudden brightness maybe you are not a blockhead after all you are on the inside you know and you cant see from there besides you cant tell what a woman will think you cant tell what a woman will think no said hawker grimly and you suppose that is my only chance oh dont be such a chump said hollanden in a tone of vast exasperation they strode for some time in silence the mystic pines swaying over the narrow road made talk sibilantly to the wind stanley the setter took it upon himself to discover some menacing presence in the woods he walked on his toes and with his eyes glinting sideways he swore half under his breath and work too burst out hawker at last i came up here this season to work and i havent done a thing that ought not be shot at dont you find that your love sets fire to your genius asked hollanden gravely no im hanged if i do hollanden sighed then with an air of relief i was afraid that a popular impression was true he said but its all right you would rather sit still and moon wouldnt you moon blast you i couldnt moon to save my life oh well i didnt mean moon exactly chapter viii the blue night of the lake was embroidered with black tree forms silver drops sprinkled from the lifted oars somewhere in the gloom of the shore there was a dog who from time to time raised his sad voice to the stars but still the life of the studios began the girl hawker scoffed there were six of us mainly we smoked sometimes we played hearts and at other times poker on credit you know credit and when we had the materials and got something to do we worked did you ever see these beautiful red and green designs that surround the common tomato can yes well he said proudly i have made them whenever you come upon tomatoes remember that they might once have been encompassed in my design when first i came back from paris i began to paint but nobody wanted me to paint later i got into green corn and asparagus truly yes indeed it is true but still the life of the studios there were six of us fate ordained that only one in the crowd could have money at one time the other five lived off him and despised themselves we despised ourselves five times as long as we had admiration and was this just because you had no money it was because we had no money in new york said hawker well after a while something happened oh no it didnt something impended always but it never happened in a case like that ones own people must be such a blessing the sympathy ones own people said hawker yes she said ones own people and more intimate friends the appreciation the appreciation said hawker yes indeed he seemed so illtempered that she became silent the boat floated through the shadows of the trees and out to where the water was like a blue crystal the dog on the shore thrashed about in the reeds and waded in the shallows mourning his unhappy state in an occasional cry hawker stood up and sternly shouted thereafter silence was among the reeds the moon slipped sharply through the little clouds the girl said i liked that last picture of yours what at the last exhibition you know you had that one with the cows and things in the snow and and a haystack yes he said of course did you like it really i thought it about my best and you really remembered it oh he cried hollanden perhaps recalled it to you why no she said i remembered it of course well what made you remember it he demanded as if he had cause to be indignant why i just remembered it because i liked it and because well the people with me said said it was about the best thing in the exhibit and they talked about it a good deal and then i remember that hollie had spoken of you and then i i never mind he said after a moment he added the confounded picture was no good anyhow the girl started what makes you speak so of it it was good of course i dont know i cant talk about pictures but she said in distress everybody said it was fine it wasnt any good he persisted with dogged shakes of the head from off in the darkness they heard the sound of hollandens oars splashing in the water sometimes there was squealing by the worcester girls and at other times loud arguments on points of navigation oh said the girl suddenly mr oglethorpe is coming tomorrow mr oglethorpe said hawker is he yes she gazed off at the water hes an old friend of ours he is always so good and roger and little helen simply adore him he was my brothers chum in college and they were quite inseparable until herberts death he always brings me violets but i know you will like him i shall expect to said hawker im so glad he is coming what time does that morning stage get here about eleven said hawker he wrote that he would come then i hope he wont disappoint us undoubtedly he will be here said hawker the wind swept from the ridge top where some great bare pines stood in the moonlight a loon called in its strange unearthly note from the lakeshore as hawker turned the boat toward the dock the flashing rays from the boat fell upon the head of the girl in the rear seat and he rowed very slowly the girl was looking away somewhere with a mystic shining glance she leaned her chin in her hand hawker facing her merely paddled subconsciously he seemed greatly impressed and expectant at last she spoke very slowly i wish i knew mr oglethorpe was not going to disappoint us hawker said why no i imagine not well he is a trifle uncertain in matters of time the children and all of us shall be anxious i know you will like him chapter ix eh said hollanden oglethorpe oglethorpe why hes that friend of the fanhalls yes of course i know him deuced good fellow too what about him oh nothing only hes coming here tomorrow answered hawker what kind of a fellow did you say he was deuced good fellow what are you so say by the nine mad blacksmiths of donawhiroo hes your rival why of course glory but i must be thickheaded tonight hawker said wheres your tobacco yonder in that jar got a pipe yes how do you know hes my rival know it why hasnt he been say this is getting thrilling hollanden sprang to his feet and filling a pipe flung himself into the chair and began to rock himself madly to and fro he puffed clouds of smoke hawker stood with his face in shadow at last he said in tones of deep weariness well i think id better be going home and turning in hold on hollanden exclaimed turning his eyes from a prolonged stare at the ceiling dont go yet why man this is just the time when say who would ever think of jem oglethorpes turning up to harrie you just at this time too oh cried hawker suddenly filled with rage you remind me of an accursed duffer why cant you tell me something about the man instead of sitting there and gibbering those crazy things at the ceiling by the piper oh shut up tell me something about oglethorpe cant you i want to hear about him quit all that other business why jem oglethorpe he why say hes one of the best fellows going if he were only an ass if he were only an ass now you could feel easy in your mind but he isnt no indeed why blast him there isnt a man that knows him who doesnt like jem oglethorpe excepting the chumps the window of the little room was open and the voices of the pines could be heard as they sang of their long sorrow hawker pulled a chair close and stared out into the darkness the people on the porch of the inn were frequently calling goodnight goodnight hawker said and of course hes got train loads of money you bet he has he can pave streets with it lordie but this is a situation a heavy scowl settled upon hawkers brow and he kicked at the dressing case say hollie look here sometimes i think you regard me as a bug and like to see me wriggle but oh dont be a fool said hollanden glaring through the smoke under the circumstances you are privileged to rave and ramp around like a wounded lunatic but for heavens sake dont swoop down on me like that especially when im when im doing all i can for you doing all you can for me nobody asked you to you talk as if i were an infant there thats right blaze up like a fire balloon just because i said that will you a man in your condition why confound you you are an infant hawker seemed again overwhelmed in a great dislike of himself oh well of course hollie it he waved his hand a man feels like like certainly he does said hollanden thats all right old man and look now hollie heres this oglethorpe may the devil fly away with him well here he is coming along when i thought maybe after a while you know i might stand some show and you are acquainted with him so give me a line on him well i should advise you to blow your advice i want to hear about oglethorpe well in the first place he is a rattling good fellow as i told you before and this is what makes it so oh hang what it makes it go on he is a rattling good fellow and he has stacks of money of course in this case his having money doesnt affect the situation much miss fanhall say can you keep to the thread of the story you infernal literary man well hes popular he dont talk money ever and if hes wicked hes not sufficiently proud of it to be perpetually describing his sins and then he is not so hideously brilliant either thats great credit to a man in these days and then he well take it altogether i should say jem oglethorpe was a smashing good fellow i wonder how long he is going to stay murmured hawker during this conversation his pipe had often died out it was out at this time he lit another match hollanden had watched the fingers of his friend as the match was scratched youre nervous billie he said hawker straightened in his chair no im not i saw your fingers tremble when you lit that match oh you lie hollanden mused again hes popular with women too he said ultimately and often a woman will like a man and hunt his scalp just because she knows other women like him and want his scalp yes but not hold on you were going to say that she was not like other women werent you not exactly that but well we will have all that understood after a period of silence hawker said i must be going as the painter walked toward the door hollanden cried to him heavens of all pictures of a weary pilgrim his voice was very compassionate hawker wheeled and an oath spun through the smoke clouds chapter x wheres mr hawker this morning asked the younger miss worcester i thought he was coming up to play tennis i dont know confound him i dont see why he didnt come said hollanden looking across the shining valley he frowned questioningly at the landscape i wonder where in the mischief he is the worcester girls began also to stare at the great gleaming stretch of green and gold didnt he tell you he was coming they demanded he didnt say a word about it answered hollanden i supposed of course he was coming we will have to postpone the mкlйe later he met miss fanhall you look as if you were going for a walk i am she said swinging her parasol to meet the stage have you seen mr hawker today no he said he is not coming up this morning he is in a great fret about that field of stubble and i suppose he is down there sketching the life out of it these artists they take such a fiendish interest in their work i dare say we wont see much of him until he has finished it where did you say you were going to walk to meet the stage oh well i wont have to play tennis for an hour and if you insist of course as they strolled slowly in the shade of the trees hollanden began isnt that hawker an illbred old thing no he is not then after a time she said why oh he gets so absorbed in a beastly smudge of paint that i really suppose he cares nothing for anything else in the world men who are really artists i dont believe they are capable of deep human affections so much of them is occupied by art theres not much left over you see i dont believe it at all she exclaimed you dont eh cried hollanden scornfully well let me tell you young woman there is a great deal of truth in it now theres hawker as good a fellow as ever lived too in a way and yet hes an artist why look how he treats look how he treats that poor setter dog why hes as kind to him as he can be she declared and i tell you he is not cried hollanden he is hollie you you are unspeakable when you get in these moods there thats just you in an argument im not in a mood at all now look the dog loves him with simple unquestioning devotion that fairly brings tears to ones eyes yes she said and he why hes as cold and stern he isnt he isnt holly you are awfly unfair no im not i am simply a liberal observer and hawker with his people too he went on darkly you cant tell you dont know anything about it but i tell you that what i have seen proves my assertion that the artistic mind has no space left for the human affections and as for the dog i thought you were his friend hollie whose no not the dogs and yet you really hollie there is something unnatural in you you are so stupidly keen in looking at people that you do not possess common loyalty to your friends it is because you are a writer i suppose that has to explain so many things some of your traits are very disagreeable there there plaintively cried hollanden this is only about the treatment of a dog mind you goodness what an oration it wasnt about the treatment of a dog it was about your treatment of your friends well he said sagely it only goes to show that there is nothing impersonal in the mind of a woman i undertook to discuss broadly oh hollie at any rate it was rather below you to do such scoffing at me well i didnt mean not all of it hollie well i didnt mean what i said about the dog and all that either you didnt she turned toward him largeeyed no not a single word of it well what did you say it for then she demanded indignantly i said it answered hollanden placidly just to tease you he looked abstractedly up to the trees presently she said slowly just to tease me at this time hollanden wore an unmistakable air of having a desire to turn up his coat collar oh come now he began nervously george hollanden said the voice at his shoulder you are not only disagreeable but you are hopelessly ridiculous i i wish you would never speak to me again oh come now grace dont dont look theres the stage coming isnt it no the stage is not coming i wish i wish you were at the bottom of the sea george hollanden and and mr hawker too there oh bless my soul and all about an infernal dog wailed hollanden look honest now theres the stage see it see it it isnt there at all she said gradually he seemed to recover his courage what made you so tremendously angry i dont see why after consideration she said decisively well because thats why i teased you he rejoined well because because go on he told her finally you are doing very well he waited patiently well she said it is dreadful to defend somebody so so excitedly and then have it turned out just a tease i dont know what he would think who would think why he what could he think now what could he think why said hollanden waxing eloquent he couldnt under any circumstances think think anything at all now could he she made no reply could he she was apparently reflecting under any circumstances persisted hollanden he couldnt think anything at all now could he no she said well why are you angry at me then chapter xi john said the old mother from the profound mufflings of the pillow and quilts what said the old man he was tugging at his right boot and his tone was very irascible i think williams changed a good deal well what if he has replied the father in another burst of illtemper he was then tugging at his left boot yes im afraid hes changed a good deal said the muffled voice from the bed hes got a good many fine friends now john folks what put on a good many airs and he dont care for his home like he did oh well i dont guess hes changed very much said the old man cheerfully he was now free of both boots she raised herself on an elbow and looked out with a troubled face john i think he likes that girl what girl said he what girl why that awful handsome girl you see around of course do you think he likes er im afraid so im afraid so murmured the mother mournfully oh well said the old man without alarm or grief or pleasure in his tone he turned the lamps wick very low and carried the lamp to the head of the stairs where he perched it on the step when he returned he said shes mighty goodlookin well that aint everything she snapped how do we know she aint proud and selfish and everything how do you know she is returned the old man and she may just be leading him on do him good then said he with impregnable serenity next time hell know better well im worried about it she said as she sank back on the pillow again i think williams changed a good deal he dont seem to care about us like he did oh go to sleep said the father drowsily she was silent for a time and then she said john what do you think i better speak to him about that girl no she grew silent again but at last she demanded why not cause its none of your business go to sleep will you and presently he did but the old mother lay blinking wildeyed into the darkness in the morning hawker did not appear at the early breakfast eaten when the blue glow of dawn shed its ghostly lights upon the valley the old mother placed various dishes on the back part of the stove at ten oclock he came downstairs his mother was sweeping busily in the parlour at the time but she saw him and ran to the back part of the stove she slid the various dishes on to the table did you oversleep she asked yes i dont feel very well this morning he said he pulled his chair close to the table and sat there staring she renewed her sweeping in the parlour when she returned he sat still staring undeviatingly at nothing why dont you eat your breakfast she said anxiously i tell you mother i dont feel very well this morning he answered quite sharply well she said meekly drink some coffee and youll feel better afterward he took his painting machinery and left the house his younger sister was at the well she looked at him with a little smile and a little sneer going up to the inn this morning she said i dont see how that concerns you mary he rejoined with dignity oh my she said airily but since you are so interested i dont mind telling you that im not going up to the inn this morning his sister fixed him with her eye she aint mad at you is she will i dont know what you mean mary he glared hatefully at her and strode away stanley saw him going through the fields and leaped a fence jubilantly in pursuit in a wood the light sifted through the foliage and burned with a peculiar reddish lustre on the masses of dead leaves he frowned at it for a while from different points presently he erected his easel and began to paint after a a time he threw down his brush and swore stanley who had been solemnly staring at the scene as if he too was sketching it looked up in surprise in wandering aimlessly through the fields and the forest hawker once found himself near the road to hemlock inn he shied away from it quickly as if it were a great snake while most of the family were at supper mary the younger sister came charging breathlessly into the kitchen ma sister she cried i know why why will didnt go to the inn today theres another fellow come another fellow who where what do you mean exclaimed her mother and her sister why another fellow up at the inn she shouted triumphant in her information another fellow come up on the stage this morning and she went out driving with him this afternoon well exclaimed her mother and her sister yep and hes an awful goodlooking fellow too and she oh my she looked as if she thought the world and all of him well exclaimed her mother and her sister again sho said the old man you wimen leave william alone and quit your gabbling the three women made a combined assault upon him well we aint ahurting him are we pa you neednt be so snifty i guess we aint ahurting him much well said the old man and to this argument he added sho they kept him out of the subsequent consultations chapter xii the next day as little roger was going toward the tennis court a large orange and white setter ran effusively from around the corner of the inn and greeted him miss fanhall the worcester girls hollanden and oglethorpe faced to the front like soldiers hollanden cried why billie hawker must be coming hawker at that moment appeared coming toward them with a smile which was not overconfident little roger went off to perform some festivities of his own on the brown carpet under a clump of pines the dog to join him felt obliged to circle widely about the tennis court he was much afraid of this tennis court with its tiny round things that sometimes hit him when near it he usually slunk along at a little sheep trot and with an eye of wariness upon it at her first opportunity the younger worcester girl said you didnt come up yesterday mr hawker hollanden seemed to think that miss fanhall turned her head as if she wished to hear the explanation of the painters absence so he engaged her in swift and fierce conversation no said hawker i was resolved to finish a sketch of a stubble field which i began a good many days ago you see i was going to do such a great lot of work this summer and ive done hardly a thing i really ought to compel myself to do some you know there said hollanden with a victorious nod just what i told you you didnt tell us anything of the kind retorted the worcester girls with one voice a middleaged woman came upon the porch of the inn and after scanning for a moment the group at the tennis court she hurriedly withdrew presently she appeared again accompanied by five more middleaged women you see she said to the others it is as i said he has come back the five surveyed the group at the tennis court and then said so he has i knew he would well i declare did you ever their voices were pitched at low keys and they moved with care but their smiles were broad and full of a strange glee i wonder how he feels said one in subtle ecstasy another laughed you know how you would feel my dear if you were him and saw yourself suddenly cut out by a man who was so hopelessly superior to you why oglethorpes a thousand times better looking and then think of his wealth and social position one whispered dramatically they say he never came up here at all yesterday another replied no more he did thats what weve been talking about stayed down at the farm all day poor fellow do you really think she cares for oglethorpe care for him why of course she does why when they came up the path yesterday morning i never saw a girls face so bright i asked my husband how much of the chambers street bank stock oglethorpe owned and he said that if oglethorpe took his money out there wouldnt be enough left to buy a pie the youngest woman in the corps said well i dont care i think it is too bad i dont see anything so much in that mr oglethorpe the others at once patronized her oh you dont my dear well let me tell you that bank stock waves in the air like a banner you would see it if you were her well she dont have to care for his money oh no of course she dont have to but they are just the ones that do my dear they are just the ones that do well its a shame oh of course its a shame the woman who had assembled the corps said to one at her side oh the commonest kind of people my dear the commonest kind the father is a regular farmer you know he drives oxen such language you can really hear him miles away bellowing at those oxen and the girls are shy halfwild things oh you have no idea i saw one of them yesterday when we were out driving she dodged as we came along for i suppose she was ashamed of her frock poor child and the mother well i wish you could see her a little old driedup thing we saw her carrying a pail of water from the well and oh she bent and staggered dreadfully poor thing and the gate to their front yard it has a broken hinge you know of course thats an awful bad sign when people let their front gate hang on one hinge you know what that means after gazing again at the group at the court the youngest member of the corps said well hes a good tennis player anyhow the others smiled indulgently oh yes my dear hes a good tennis player chapter xiii one day hollanden said in greeting to hawker well hes gone who asked hawker why oglethorpe of course who did you think i meant how did i know said hawker angrily well retorted hollanden your chief interest was in his movements i thought why of course not hang you why should i be interested in his movements well you werent then does that suit you after a period of silence hawker asked what did he what made him go who why oglethorpe how was i to know you meant him well he went because some important business affairs in new york demanded it he said but he is coming back again in a week they had rather a late interview on the porch last evening indeed said hawker stiffly yes and he went away this morning looking particularly elated arent you glad i dont see how it concerns me said hawker with still greater stiffness in a walk to the lake that afternoon hawker and miss fanhall found themselves side by side and silent the girl contemplated the distant purple hills as if hawker were not at her side and silent hawker frowned at the roadway stanley the setter scouted the fields in a genial gallop at last the girl turned to him seems to me she said seems to me you are dreadfully quiet this afternoon i am thinking about my wretched field of stubble he answered still frowning her parasol swung about until the girl was looking up at his inscrutable profile is it then so important that you havent time to talk to me she asked with an air of what might have been timidity a smile swept the scowl from his face no indeed he said instantly nothing is so important as that she seemed aggrieved then hum you didnt look so she told him well i didnt mean to look any other way he said contritely you know what a bear i am sometimes hollanden says it is a fixed scowl from trying to see uproarious pinks yellows and blues a little brook a brawling ruffianly little brook swaggered from side to side down the glade swirling in white leaps over the great dark rocks and shouting challenge to the hillsides hollanden and the worcester girls had halted in a place of ferns and wet moss their voices could be heard quarrelling above the clamour of the stream stanley the setter had sousled himself in a pool and then gone and rolled in the dust of the road he blissfully lolled there with his coat now resembling an old door mat dont you think jem is a wonderfully good fellow said the girl to the painter why yes of course said hawker well he is she retorted suddenly defensive of course he repeated loudly she said well i dont think you like him as well as i like him certainly not said hawker you dont she looked at him in a kind of astonishment certainly not said hawker again and very irritably how in the wide world do you expect me to like him as well as you like him i dont mean as well she explained oh said hawker but i mean you dont like him the way i do at all the way i expected you to like him i thought men of a certain pattern always fancied their kind of men wherever they met them dont you know and i was so sure you and jem would be friends oh cried hawker presently he added but he isnt my kind of a man at all he is jem is one of the best fellows in the world again hawker cried oh they paused and looked down at the brook stanley sprawled panting in the dust and watched them hawker leaned against a hemlock he sighed and frowned and then finally coughed with great resolution i suppose of course that i am unjust to him i care for you myself you understand and so it becomes he paused for a moment because he heard a rustling of her skirts as if she had moved suddenly then he continued and so it becomes difficult for me to be fair to him i am not able to see him with a true eye he bitterly addressed the trees on the opposite side of the glen oh i care for you of course you might have expected it he turned from the trees and strode toward the roadway the uninformed and disreputable stanley arose and wagged his tail as if the girl had cried out at a calamity hawker said again well you might have expected it chapter xiv at the lake hollanden went pickerel fishing lost his hook in a gaunt gray stump and earned much distinction by his skill in discovering words to express his emotion without resorting to the list ordinarily used in such cases the younger miss worcester ruined a new pair of boots and stanley sat on the bank and howled the song of the forsaken at the conclusion of the festivities hollanden said billie you ought to take the boat back why had i you borrowed it well i borrowed it and it was a lot of trouble and now you ought to take it back ultimately hawker said oh lets both go on this journey hawker made a long speech to his friend and at the end of it he exclaimed and now do you think she cares so much for oglethorpe why she as good as told me that he was only a very great friend hollanden wagged his head dubiously what a woman says doesnt amount to shucks its the way she says it thats what counts besides he cried in a brilliant afterthought she wouldnt tell you anyhow you fool youre an encouraging brute said hawker with a rueful grin later the worcester girls seized upon hollanden and piled him high with ferns and mosses they dragged the long gray lichens from the chins of venerable pines and ran with them to hollanden and dashed them into his arms oh hurry up hollie they cried because with his great load he frequently fell behind them in the march he once positively refused to carry these things another step some distance farther on the road he positively refused to carry this old truck another step when almost to the inn he positively refused to carry this senseless rubbish another step the worcester girls had such vivid contempt for his expressed unwillingness that they neglected to tell him of any appreciation they might have had for his noble struggle as hawker and miss fanhall proceeded slowly they heard a voice ringing through the foliage whoa haw gitap blast you haw haw drat your hides will you haw gitap gee whoa hawker said the others are a good ways ahead hadnt we better hurry a little the girl obediently mended her pace whoa haw gitap shouted the voice in the distance git over there red git over gee gitap and these cries pursued the man and the maid at last hawker said thats my father where she asked looking bewildered back there driving those oxen the voice shouted whoa gitap gee red git over there now will you ill trim the shin offn you in a minute whoa haw haw whoa gitap hawker repeated yes thats my father oh is it she said lets wait for him all right said hawker sullenly presently a team of oxen waddled into view around the curve of the road they swung their heads slowly from side to side bent under the yoke and looked out at the world with their great eyes in which was a mystic note of their humble submissive toilsome lives an old wagon creaked after them and erect upon it was the tall and tattered figure of the farmer swinging his whip and yelling whoa haw there gitap the lash flicked and flew over the broad backs of the animals hello father said hawker whoa back whoa why hello william what you doing here oh just taking a walk miss fanhall this is my father father how d you do the old man balanced himself with care and then raised his straw hat from his head with a quick gesture and with what was perhaps a slightly apologetic air as if he feared that he was rather overdoing the ceremonial part the girl later became very intent upon the oxen arent they nice old things she said as she stood looking into the faces of the team but what makes their eyes so very sad i dunno said the old man she was apparently unable to resist a desire to pat the nose of the nearest ox and for that purpose she stretched forth a cautious hand but the ox moved restlessly at the moment and the girl put her hand apprehensively behind herself and backed away the old man on the wagon grinned they wont hurt you he told her they wont bite will they she asked casting a glance of inquiry at the old man and then turning her eyes again upon the fascinating animals no said the old man still grinning just as gentle as kittens she approached them circuitously sure she said sure replied the old man he climbed from the wagon and came to the heads of the oxen with him as an ally she finally succeeded in patting the nose of the nearest ox arent they solemn kind old fellows dont you get to think a great deal of them well theyre kind of aggravating beasts sometimes he said but theyre a good yoke a good yoke they can haul with anything in this region it doesnt make them so terribly tired does it she said hopefully they are such strong animals nooo he said i dunno i never thought much about it with their heads close together they became so absorbed in their conversation that they seemed to forget the painter he sat on a log and watched them ultimately the girl said wont you give us a ride sure said the old man come on and ill help you up he assisted her very painstakingly to the old board that usually served him as a seat and he clambered to a place beside her come on william he called the painter climbed into the wagon and stood behind his father putting his hand on the old mans shoulder to preserve his balance which is the near ox asked the girl with a serious frown gitap haw that one there said the old man and this one is the off ox yep well suppose you sat here where i do would this one be the near ox and that one the off ox then nope be just same then the near ox isnt always the nearest one to a person at all that ox there is always the near ox yep always cause when you drive em afoot you always walk on the left side well i never knew that before after studying them in silence for a while she said do you think they are happy i dunno said the old man i never thought as the wagon creaked on they gravely discussed this problem contemplating profoundly the backs of the animals hawker gazed in silence at the meditating two before him under the wagon stanley the setter walked slowly wagging his tail in placid contentment and ruminating upon his experiences at last the old man said cheerfully shall i take you around by the inn hawker started and seemed to wince at the question perhaps he was about to interrupt but the girl cried oh will you take us right to the door oh that will be awfully good of you why began hawker you dont want you dont want to ride to the inn on an on an ox wagon do you why of course i do she retorted directing a withering glance at him well he protested let er be william interrupted the old man let er do what she wants to i guess everybody in th world aint even got an ox wagon to ride in have they no indeed she returned while withering hawker again gee gee whoa haw gitap haw whoa back after these two attacks hawker became silent gee gee gee there blast scuse me gee whoa gitap all the boarders of the inn were upon its porches waiting for the dinner gong there was a surge toward the railing as a middleaged woman passed the word along her middleaged friends that miss fanhall accompanied by mr hawker had arrived on the ox cart of mr hawkers father whoa ha gitap said the old man in more subdued tones whoa there red whoa now whoa hawker helped the girl to alight and she paused for a moment conversing with the old man about the oxen then she ran smiling up the steps to meet the worcester girls oh such a lovely time those dear old oxen you should have been with us chapter xv oh miss fanhall what is it mrs truscot that was a great prank of yours last night my dear we all enjoyed the joke so much prank yes your riding on the ox cart with that old farmer and that young mr whatshisname you know we all thought it delicious ah my dear after all dont be offended if we had your peoples wealth and position we might do that sort of unconventional thing too but ah my dear we cant we cant isnt the young painter a charming man out on the porch hollanden was haranguing his friends he heard a step and glanced over his shoulder to see who was about to interrupt him he suddenly ceased his oration and said hello whats the matter with grace the heads turned promptly as the girl came toward them it could be seen that her cheeks were very pink and her eyes were flashing general wrath and defiance the worcester girls burst into eager interrogation oh nothing she replied at first but later she added in an undertone that wretched mrs truscot what did she say whispered the younger worcester girl why she said oh nothing both hollanden and hawker were industriously reflecting later in the morning hawker said privately to the girl i know what mrs truscot talked to you about she turned upon him belligerently you do yes he answered with meekness it was undoubtedly some reference to your ride upon the ox wagon she hesitated a moment and then said well with still greater meekness he said i am very sorry are you indeed she inquired loftily sorry for what sorry that i rode upon your fathers ox wagon or sorry that mrs truscot was rude to me about it well in some ways it was my fault was it i suppose you intend to apologize for your fathers owning an ox wagon dont you no but well i am going to ride in the ox wagon whenever i choose your father i know will always be glad to have me and if it so shocks you there is not the slightest necessity of your coming with us they glowered at each other and he said you have twisted the question with the usual ability of your sex she pondered as if seeking some particularly destructive retort she ended by saying bluntly did you know that we were going home next week a flush came suddenly to his face no going home who you why of course and then with an indolent air she continued i meant to have told you before this but somehow it quite escaped me he stammered are are you honestly she nodded why of course cant stay here forever you know they were then silent for a long time at last hawker said do you remember what i told you yesterday no what was it he cried indignantly you know very well what i told you i do not no he sneered of course not you never take the trouble to remember such things of course not of course not you are a very ridiculous person she vouchsafed after eying him coldly he arose abruptly i believe i am by heavens i believe i am he cried in a fury she laughed you are more ridiculous now than i have yet seen you after a pause he said magnificently well miss fanhall you will doubtless find mr hollandens conversation to have a much greater interest than that of such a ridiculous person hollanden approached them with the blithesome step of an untroubled man hello you two people why dont you oh ahem hold on billie where are you going i began hawker oh hollie cried the girl impetuously do tell me how to do that slam thing you know ive tried it so often but i dont believe i hold my racket right and you do it so beautifully oh that said hollanden its not so very difficult ill show it to you you dont want to know this minute do you yes she answered well come over to the court then come ahead billie no said hawker without looking at his friend i cant this morning hollie ive got to go to work goodbye he comprehended them both in a swift bow and stalked away hollanden turned quickly to the girl what was the matter with billie what was he grinding his teeth for what was the matter with him why nothing was there she asked in surprise why he was grinding his teeth until he sounded like a stone crusher said hollanden in a severe tone what was the matter with him how should i know she retorted youve been saying something to him i i didnt say a thing yes you did hollie dont be absurd hollanden debated with himself for a time and then observed oh well i always said he was an uglytempered fellow the girl flashed him a little glance and now i am sure of it as uglytempered a fellow as ever lived i believe you said the girl then she added all men are i declare i think you to be the most incomprehensible creatures one never knows what to expect of you and you explode and go into rages and make yourselves utterly detestable over the most trivial matters and at the most unexpected times you are all mad i think i cried hollanden wildly what in the mischief have i done chapter xvi look here said hollanden at length i thought you were so wonderfully anxious to learn that stroke well i am she said come on then as they walked toward the tennis court he seemed to be plunged into mournful thought in his eyes was a singular expression which perhaps denoted the woe of the optimist pushed suddenly from its height he sighed oh well i suppose all women even the best of them are that way what way she said my dear child he answered in a benevolent manner you have disappointed me because i have discovered that you resemble the rest of your sex ah she remarked maintaining a noncommittal attitude yes continued hollanden with a sad but kindly smile even you grace were not above fooling with the affections of a poor country swain until he dont know his ear from the tooth he had pulled two years ago she laughed he would be furious if he heard you call him a country swain who would said hollanden why the country swain of course she rejoined hollanden seemed plunged in mournful reflection again well its a shame grace anyhow he observed wagging his head dolefully its a howling wicked shame hollie you have no brains at all she said despite your opinion no he replied ironically not a bit well you havent you know hollie at any rate he said in an angry voice i have some comprehension and sympathy for the feelings of others have you she asked how do you mean hollie do you mean you have feeling for them in their various sorrows or do you mean that you understand their minds hollanden ponderously began there have been people who have not questioned my ability to oh then you mean that you both feel for them in their sorrows and comprehend the machinery of their minds well let me tell you that in regard to the last thing you are wrong you know nothing of anyones mind you know less about human nature than anybody i have met hollanden looked at her in artless astonishment he said now i wonder what made you say that this interrogation did not seem to be addressed to her but was evidently a statement to himself of a problem he meditated for some moments eventually he said i suppose you mean that i do not understand you why do you suppose i mean that thats what a person usually means when he or she charges another with not understanding the entire world well at any rate it is not what i mean at all she said i mean that you habitually blunder about other peoples affairs in the belief i imagine that you are a great philanthropist when you are only making an extraordinary exhibition of yourself the dev began hollanden afterward he said now i wonder what in blue thunder you mean this time mean this time my meaning is very plain hollie i supposed the words were clear enough yes he said thoughtfully your words were clear enough but then you were of course referring back to some event or series of events in which i had the singular ill fortune to displease you maybe you dont know yourself and spoke only from the emotion generated by the event or series of events in which as i have said i had the singular ill fortune to displease you how awfly clever she said but i cant recall the event or series of events at all he continued musing with a scholarly air and disregarding her mockery i cant remember a thing about it to be sure it might have been that time when i think it very stupid of you to hunt for a meaning when i believe i made everything so perfectly clear she said wrathfully well you yourself might not be aware of what you really meant he answered sagely women often do that sort of thing you know women often speak from motives which if brought face to face with them they wouldnt be able to distinguish from any other thing which they had never before seen hollie if there is a disgusting person in the world it is he who pretends to know so much concerning a womans mind well thats because they who know or pretend to know so much about a womans mind are invariably satirical you understand said hollanden cheerfully a dog ran frantically across the lawn his nose high in the air and his countenance expressing vast perturbation and alarm why billie forgot to whistle for his dog when he started for home said hollanden come here old man well e was a nice dog the girl also gave invitation but the setter would not heed them he spun wildly about the lawn until he seemed to strike his masters trail and then with his nose near to the ground went down the road at an eager gallop they stood and watched him stanleys a nice dog said hollanden indeed he is replied the girl fervently presently hollanden remarked well dont lets fight any more particularly since we cant decide what were fighting about i cant discover the reason and you dont know it so i do know it i told you very plainly well all right now this is the way to work that slam you give the ball a sort of a lift see underhanded and with your arm crooked and stiff here you smash this other ball into the net hi look out if you hit it that way youll knock it over the hotel let the ball drop nearer to the ground oh heavens not on the ground well its hard to do it from the serve anyhow ill go over to the other court and bat you some easy ones afterward when they were going toward the inn the girl suddenly began to laugh what are you giggling at said hollanden i was thinking how furious he would be if he heard you call him a country swain she rejoined who asked hollanden chapter xvii oglethorpe contended that the men who made the most money from books were the best authors hollanden contended that they were the worst oglethorpe said that such a question should be left to the people hollanden said that the people habitually made wrong decisions on questions that were left to them that is the most odiously aristocratic belief said oglethorpe no said hollanden i like the people but considered generally they are a collection of ingenious blockheads but they read your books said oglethorpe grinning that is through a mistake replied hollanden as the discussion grew in size it incited the close attention of the worcester girls but miss fanhall did not seem to hear it hawker too was staring into the darkness with a gloomy and preoccupied air are you sorry that this is your last evening at hemlock inn said the painter at last in a low tone why yes certainly said the girl under the sloping porch of the inn the vague orange light from the parlours drifted to the black wall of the night i shall miss you said the painter oh i dare say said the girl hollanden was lecturing at length and wonderfully in the mystic spaces of the night the pines could be heard in their weird monotone as they softly smote branch and branch as if moving in some solemn and sorrowful dance this has been quite the most delightful summer of my experience said the painter i have found it very pleasant said the girl from time to time hawker glanced furtively at oglethorpe hollanden and the worcester girl this glance expressed no desire for their wellbeing i shall miss you he said to the girl again his manner was rather desperate she made no reply and after leaning toward her he subsided with an air of defeat eventually he remarked it will be very lonely here again i dare say i shall return to new york myself in a few weeks i hope you will call she said i shall be delighted he answered stiffly and with a dissatisfied look at her oh mr hawker cried the younger worcester girl suddenly emerging from the cloud of argument which hollanden and oglethorpe kept in the air wont it be sad to lose grace indeed i dont know what we shall do shant we miss her dreadfully yes said hawker we shall of course miss her dreadfully yes wont it be frightful said the elder worcester girl i cant imagine what we will do without her and hollie is only going to spend ten more days oh dear mamma i believe will insist on staying the entire summer it was papas orders you know and i really think she is going to obey them he said he wanted her to have one period of rest at any rate she is such a busy woman in town you know here said hollanden wheeling to them suddenly you all look as if you were badgering hawker and he looks badgered what are you saying to him why answered the younger worcester girl we were only saying to him how lonely it would be without grace oh said hollanden as the evening grew old the mother of the worcester girls joined the group this was a sign that the girls were not to long delay the vanishing time she sat almost upon the edge of her chair as if she expected to be called upon at any moment to arise and bow goodnight and she repaid hollandens eloquent attention with the placid and absentminded smiles of the chaperon who waits once the younger worcester girl shrugged her shoulders and turned to say mamma you make me nervous her mother merely smiled in a still more placid and absentminded manner oglethorpe arose to drag his chair nearer to the railing and when he stood the worcester mother moved and looked around expectantly but oglethorpe took seat again hawker kept an anxious eye upon her presently miss fanhall arose why you are not going in already are you said hawker and hollanden and oglethorpe the worcester mother moved toward the door followed by her daughters who were protesting in muffled tones hollanden pitched violently upon oglethorpe well at any rate he said he picked the thread of a past argument with great agility hawker said to the girl i i i shall miss you dreadfully she turned to look at him and smiled shall you she said in a low voice yes he said thereafter he stood before her awkwardly and in silence she scrutinized the boards of the floor suddenly she drew a violet from a cluster of them upon her gown and thrust it out to him as she turned toward the approaching oglethorpe goodnight mr hawker said the latter i am very glad to have met you im sure hope to see you in town goodnight he stood near when the girl said to hawker goodbye you have given us such a charming summer we shall be delighted to see you in town you must come some time when the children can see you too goodbye goodbye replied hawker eagerly and feverishly trying to interpret the inscrutable feminine face before him i shall come at my first opportunity goodbye goodbye down at the farmhouse in the black quiet of the night a dog lay curled on the doormat of a sudden the tail of this dog began to thump thump on the boards it began as a lazy movement but it passed into a state of gentle enthusiasm and then into one of curiously loud and joyful celebration at last the gate clicked the dog uncurled and went to the edge of the steps to greet his master he gave adoring tremulous welcome with his clear eyes shining in the darkness well stan old boy said hawker stooping to stroke the dogs head after his master had entered the house the dog went forward and sniffed at something that lay on the top step apparently it did not interest him greatly for he returned in a moment to the doormat but he was again obliged to uncurl himself for his master came out of the house with a lighted lamp and made search of the doormat the steps and the walk swearing meanwhile in an undertone the dog wagged his tail and sleepily watched this ceremony when his master had again entered the house the dog went forward and sniffed at the top step but the thing that had lain there was gone chapter xviii it was evident at breakfast that hawkers sisters had achieved information whats the matter with you this morning asked one you look as if you hadnt slep well there is nothing the matter with me he rejoined looking glumly at his plate well you look kind of broke up how i look is of no consequence i tell you there is nothing the matter with me oh said his sister she exchanged meaning glances with the other feminine members of the family presently the other sister observed i heard she was going home today who said hawker with a challenge in his tone why that new york girl miss whatshername replied the sister with an undaunted smile did you indeed well perhaps she is oh you dont know for sure i spose hawker arose from the table and taking his hat went away mary said the mother in the sepulchral tone of belated but conscientious reproof well i dont care he neednt be so grand i didnt go to tease him i dont care well you ought to care said the old man suddenly theres no sense in you wimen folks pestering the boy all the time let him alone with his own business cant you well aint we leaving him alone no you aint cept when he aint here i dont wonder the boy grabs his hat and skips out when you git to going well what did we say to him now tell us what we said to him that was so dreadful aw thunder an lightnin cried the old man with a sudden great snarl they seemed to know by this ejaculation that he had emerged in an instant from that place where man endures and they ended the discussion the old man continued his breakfast during his walk that morning hawker visited a certain cascade a certain lake and some roads paths groves nooks later in the day he made a sketch choosing an hour when the atmosphere was of a dark blue like powder smoke in the shade of trees and the western sky was burning in strips of red he painted with a wild face like a man who is killing after supper he and his father strolled under the apple boughs in the orchard and smoked once he gestured wearily oh i guess ill go back to new york in a few days um replied his father calmly all right william several days later hawker accosted his father in the barnyard i suppose you think sometimes i dont care so much about you and the folks and the old place any more but i do um said the old man when you goin where asked hawker flushing back to new york why i hadnt thought much about oh next week i guess well do as you like william you know how glad me an mother and the girls are to have you come home with us whenever you can come you know that but you must do as you think best and if you ought to go back to new york now william why do as you think best well my work said hawker from time to time the mother made wondering speech to the sisters how much nicer william is now hes just as good as he can be there for a while he was so cross and out of sorts i dont see what could have come over him but now hes just as good as he can be hollanden told him come up to the inn more you fool i was up there yesterday yesterday what of that ive seen the time when the farm couldnt hold you for two hours during the day go to blazes millicent got a letter from grace fanhall the other day that so yes she did grace wrote say does that shadow look pure purple to you certainly it does or i wouldnt paint it so duffer what did she write well if that shadow is pure purple my eyes are liars it looks a kind of slate colour to me lord if what you fellows say in your pictures is true the whole earth must be blazing and burning and glowing and hawker went into a rage oh you dont know anything about colour hollie for heavens sake shut up or ill smash you with the easel well i was going to tell you what grace wrote in her letter she said go on gimme time cant you she said that town was stupid and that she wished she was back at hemlock inn oh is that all is that all i wonder what you expected well and she asked to be recalled to you yes thanks and thats all gad for such a devoted man as you were your enthusiasm and interest is stupendous the father said to the mother well williams going back to new york next week is he why he aint said nothing to me about it well he is anyhow i declare what do you spose hes going back before september for john how do i know well its funny john i bet i bet hes going back sos he can see that girl he says its his work chapter xix wrinkles had been peering into the little drygoods box that acted as a cupboard there are only two eggs and half a loaf of bread left he announced brutally heavens said warwickson from where he lay smoking on the bed he spoke in a dismal voice this tone it is said had earned him his popular name of great grief from different points of the compass wrinkles looked at the little cupboard with a tremendous scowl as if he intended thus to frighten the eggs into becoming more than two and the bread into becoming a loaf plague take it he exclaimed oh shut up wrinkles said grief from the bed wrinkles sat down with an air austere and virtuous well what are we going to do he demanded of the others grief after swearing said there thats right now youre happy the holy office of the inquisition blast your buttons wrinkles you always try to keep us from starving peacefully it is two hours before dinner anyhow and well but what are you going to do persisted wrinkles pennoyer with his head afar down had been busily scratching at a penandink drawing he looked up from his board to utter a plaintive optimism the monthly amazement will pay me tomorrow they ought to ive waited over three months now im going down there tomorrow and perhaps ill get it his friends listened with airs of tolerance oh no doubt penny old man but at last wrinkles giggled pityingly over on the bed grief croaked deep down in his throat nothing was said for a long time thereafter the crash of the new york streets came faintly to this room occasionally one could hear the tramp of feet in the intricate corridors of the begrimed building which squatted slumbering and old between two exalted commercial structures which would have had to bend afar down to perceive it the northward march of the citys progress had happened not to overturn this aged structure and it huddled there lost and forgotten while the cloudveering towers strode on meanwhile the first shadows of dusk came in at the blurred windows of the room pennoyer threw down his pen and tossed his drawing over on the wonderful heap of stuff that hid the table its too dark to work he lit a pipe and walked about stretching his shoulders like a man whose labour was valuable when the dusk came fully the youths grew apparently sad the solemnity of the gloom seemed to make them ponder light the gas wrinkles said grief fretfully the flood of orange light showed clearly the dull walls lined with sketches the tousled bed in one corner the masses of boxes and trunks in another a little dead stove and the wonderful table moreover there were winecoloured draperies flung in some places and on a shelf high up there were plaster casts with dust in the creases a long stovepipe wandered off in the wrong direction and then turned impulsively toward a hole in the wall there were some elaborate cobwebs on the ceiling well lets eat said grief eat said wrinkles with a jeer i told you there was only two eggs and a little bread left how are we going to eat again brought face to face with this problem and at the hour for dinner pennoyer and grief thought profoundly thunder and turf grief finally announced as the result of his deliberations well if billie hawker was only home began pennoyer but he isnt objected wrinkles and that settles that grief and pennoyer thought more ultimately grief said oh well lets eat what weve got the others at once agreed to this suggestion as if it had been in their minds later there came a quick step in the passage and a confident little thunder upon the door wrinkles arranging the tin pail on the gas stove pennoyer engaged in slicing the bread and great grief affixing the rubber tube to the gas stove yelled come in the door opened and miss florinda oconnor the model dashed into the room like a gale of obstreperous autumn leaves why hello splutter they cried oh boys ive come to dine with you it was like a squall striking a fleet of yachts grief spoke first yes you have he said incredulously why certainly i have whats the matter they grinned well old lady responded grief youve hit us at the wrong time we are in fact all out of everything no dinner to mention and whats more we havent got a sou what again cried florinda yes again youd better dine home tonight but ill ill stake you said the girl eagerly oh you poor old idiots its a shame say ill stake you certainly not said pennoyer sternly what are you talking about splutter demanded wrinkles in an angry voice no that wont go down said grief in a resolute yet wistful tone florinda divested herself of her hat jacket and gloves and put them where she pleased got coffee havent you well im not going to stir a step youre a fine lot of birds she added bitterly youve all pulled me out of a whole lot of scrape oh any number of times and now youre broke you go acting like a set of dudes great grief had fixed the coffee to boil on the gas stove but he had to watch it closely for the rubber tube was short and a chair was balanced on a trunk and two bundles of kindling was balanced on the chair and the gas stove was balanced on the kindling coffeemaking was here accounted a feat pennoyer dropped a piece of bread to the floor there ill have to go shy one wrinkles sat playing serenades on his guitar and staring with a frown at the table as if he was applying some strange method of clearing it of its litter florinda assaulted great grief here thats not the way to make coffee what aint why the way youre making it you want to take she explained some way to him which he couldnt understand for heavens sake wrinkles tackle that table dont sit there like a music box said pennoyer grappling the eggs and starting for the gas stove later as they sat around the board wrinkles said with satisfaction well the coffees good anyhow tis good said florinda but it isnt made right ill show you how penny you first oh dry up splutter said grief here take an egg i dont like eggs said florinda take an egg said the three hosts menacingly i tell you i dont like eggs take an egg they said again oh well said florinda ill take one then but you neednt act like such a set of dudes and oh maybe you didnt have much lunch i had such a daisy lunch up at pontiacs studio hes got a lovely studio the three looked to be oppressed grief said sullenly i saw some of his things over in stencils gallery and theyre rotten yes rotten said pennoyer rotten said grief oh well retorted florinda if a man has a swell studio and dresses oh sort of like a willie you know you fellows sit here like owls in a cave and say rotten rotten rotten youre away off pontiacs landscapes landscapes be blowed put any of his work alongside of billie hawkers and see how it looks oh well billie hawkers said florinda oh well at the mention of hawkers name they had all turned to scan her face chapter xx he wrote that he was coming home this week said pennoyer did he asked florinda indifferently yes arent you glad they were still watching her face yes of course im glad why shouldnt i be glad cried the girl with defiance they grinned oh certainly billie hawker is a good fellow splutter you have a particular right to be glad you people make me tired florinda retorted billie hawker doesnt give a rap about me and he never tried to make out that he did no said grief but that isnt saying that you dont care a rap about billie hawker ah florinda it seemed that the girls throat suffered a slight contraction well and what if i do she demanded finally have a cigarette answered grief florinda took a cigarette lit it and perching herself on a divan which was secretly a coal box she smoked fiercely what if i do she again demanded its better than liking one of you dubs anyhow oh splutter you poor little outspoken kid said wrinkle in a sad voice grief searched among the pipes until he found the best one yes splutter dont you know that when you are so frank you defy every law of your sex and wild eyes will take your trail oh you talk through your hat replied florinda billie dont care whether i like him or whether i dont and if he should hear me now he wouldnt be glad or give a hang either way i know that the girl paused and looked at the row of plaster casts still you neednt be throwing it at me all the time we didnt said wrinkles indignantly you threw it at yourself well continued florinda its better than liking one of you dubs anyhow he makes money and there said grief now youve hit it bedad youve reached a point in eulogy where if you move again you will have to go backward of course i dont care anything about a fellows having money no indeed you dont splutter said pennoyer but then you know what i mean a fellow isnt a man and doesnt stand up straight unless he has some money and billie hawker makes enough so that you feel that nobody could walk over him dont you know and there isnt anything jay about him either hes a thoroughbred dont you know after reflection pennoyer said its pretty hard on the rest of us splutter well of course i like him but but what said pennoyer i dont know said florinda purple sanderson lived in this room but he usually dined out at a certain time in his life before he came to be a great artist he had learned the gasfitters trade and when his opinions were not identical with the opinions of the art managers of the greater number of new york publications he went to see a friend who was a plumber and the opinions of this man he was thereafter said to respect he frequented a very neat restaurant on twentythird street it was known that on saturday nights wrinkles grief and pennoyer frequently quarreled with him as florinda ceased speaking purple entered hello there splutter as he was neatly hanging up his coat he said to the others well the rent will be due in four days will it asked pennoyer astounded certainly it will responded purple with the air of a superior financial man my soul said wrinkles oh shut up purple said grief you make me weary coming around here with your chin about rent i was just getting happy well how are we going to pay it thats the point said sanderson wrinkles sank deeper in his chair and played despondently on his guitar grief cast a look of rage at sanderson and then stared at the wall pennoyer said well we might borrow it from billie hawker florinda laughed then oh continued pennoyer hastily if those amazement people pay me when they said they would ill have the money so you will said grief you will have money to burn did the amazement people ever pay you when they said they would you are wonderfully important all of a sudden it seems to me you talk like an artist wrinkles too smiled at pennoyer the eminent magazine people wanted penny to hire models and make a try for them too it would only cost him a stack of blues by the time he has invested all his money he hasnt got and the rent is three weeks overdue he will be able to tell the landlord to wait seven months until the monday morning after the day of publication go ahead penny after a period of silence sanderson in an obstinate manner said well whats to be done the rent has got to be paid wrinkles played more sad music grief frowned deeper pennoyer was evidently searching his mind for a plan florinda took the cigarette from between her lips that she might grin with greater freedom we might throw purple out said grief with an inspired air that would stop all this discussion you said sanderson furiously you cant keep serious a minute if you didnt have us to take care of you you wouldnt even know when they threw you out into the street wouldnt i said grief well look here interposed florinda im going home unless you can be more interesting i am dead sorry about the rent but i cant help it and here sit down hold on splutter they shouted grief turned to sanderson purple you shut up florinda curled again on the divan and lit another cigarette the talk waged about the names of other and more successful painters whose work they usually pronounced rotten chapter xxi pennoyer coming home one morning with two gigantic cakes to accompany the coffee at the breakfast in the den saw a young man bounce from a horse car he gave a shout hello there billie hello hello penny said hawker what are you doing out so early it was somewhat after nine oclock out to get breakfast said pennoyer waving the cakes have a good time old man great do much work no not so much how are all the people oh pretty good come in and see us eat breakfast said pennoyer throwing open the door of the den wrinkles in his shirt was making coffee grief sat in a chair trying to loosen the grasp of sleep why billie hawker bginger they cried hows the wolf boys at the door yet at the door yet hes halfway up the back stairs and coming fast he and the landlord will be here tomorrow mr landlord allow me to present mr f wolf of hunger n j mr wolf mr landlord bad as that said hawker you bet it is easy street is somewhere in heaven for all we know have some breakfast coffee and cake i mean no thanks boys had breakfast wrinkles added to the shirt grief aroused himself and pennoyer brought the coffee cheerfully throwing some drawings from the table to the floor they thus made room for the breakfast and grouped themselves with beaming smiles at the board well billie come back to the old gang again eh how did the country seem do much work not very much a few things hows everybody splutter was in last night looking out of sight seemed glad to hear that you were coming back soon did she penny did anybody call wanting me to do a tenthousanddollar portrait for them no that framemaker though was here with a bill i told him afterward hawker crossed the corridor and threw open the door of his own large studio the great skylight far above his head shed its clear rays upon a scene which appeared to indicate that some one had very recently ceased work here and started for the country a distant closet door was open and the interior showed the effects of a sudden pillage there was an unfinished girl in apple orchard upon the tall dutch easel and sketches and studies were thick upon the floor hawker took a pipe and filled it from his friend the tan and gold jar he cast himself into a chair and taking an envelope from his pocket emptied two violets from it to the palm of his hand and stared long at them upon the walls of the studio various labours of his life in heavy gilt frames contemplated him and the violets at last pennoyer burst impetuously in upon him hi billie come over and whats the matter hawker had hastily placed the violets in the envelope and hurried it to his pocket nothing he answered why i thought said pennoyer i thought you looked rather rattled didnt you have i thought i saw something in your hand nothing i tell you cried hawker er oh i beg your pardon said pennoyer why i was going to tell you that splutter is over in our place and she wants to see you wants to see me what for demanded hawker why dont she come over here then im sure i dont know replied pennoyer she sent me to call you well do you think im going to oh well i suppose she wants to be unpleasant and knows she loses a certain mental position if she comes over here but if she meets me in your place she can be as infernally disagreeable as she thats it ill bet when they entered the den florinda was gazing from the window her back was toward the door at last she turned to them holding herself very straight well billie hawker she said grimly you dont seem very glad to see a fellow why heavens did you think i was going to turn somersaults in the air well you didnt come out when you heard me pass your door said florinda with gloomy resentment hawker appeared to be ruffled and vexed oh great scott he said making a gesture of despair florinda returned to the window in the ensuing conversation she took no part save when there was an opportunity to harry some speech of hawkers which she did in short contemptuous sentences hawker made no reply save to glare in her direction at last he said well i must go over and do some work florinda did not turn from the window well solong boys said hawker ill see you later as the door slammed pennoyer apologetically said billie is a trifle off his feed this morning what about asked grief i dont know but when i went to call him he was sitting deep in his chair staring at some he looked at florinda and became silent staring at what asked florinda turning then from the window pennoyer seemed embarrassed why i dont know nothing i guess i couldnt see very well i was only fooling florinda scanned his face suspiciously staring at what she demanded imperatively nothing i tell you shouted pennoyer florinda looked at him and wavered and debated presently she said softly ah go on penny tell me it wasnt anything at all i say cried pennoyer stoutly i was only giving you a jolly sit down splutter and hit a cigarette she obeyed but she continued to cast the dubious eye at pennoyer once she said to him privately go on penny tell me i know it was something from the way you are acting oh let up splutter for heavens sake tell me beseeched florinda no tell me no please tell me no oh go on no ah what makes you so mean penny you know id tell you if it was the other way about but its none of my business splutter i cant tell you something which is billie hawkers private affair if i did i would be a chump but ill never say you told me go on no please tell me no chapter xxii when florinda had gone grief said well what was it wrinkles looked curiously from his drawingboard pennoyer lit his pipe and held it at the side of his mouth in the manner of a deliberate man at last he said it was two violets you dont say ejaculated wrinkles well im hanged cried grief holding them in his hand and moping over them eh yes responded pennoyer rather that way well im hanged said both grief and wrinkles they grinned in a pleased urchinlike manner say who do you suppose she is somebody he met this summer no doubt would you ever think old billie would get into that sort of a thing well ill be goldurned ultimately wrinkles said well its his own business this was spoken in a tone of duty of course its his own business retorted grief but who would ever think again they grinned when hawker entered the den some minutes later he might have noticed something unusual in the general demeanour say grief will you loan me your whats up he asked for answer they grinned at each other and then grinned at him you look like a lot of chessy cats he told them they grinned on apparently feeling unable to deal with these phenomena he went at last to the door well this is a fine exhibition he said standing with his hand on the knob and regarding them won election bets some good old auntie just died found something new to pawn no well i cant stand this you resemble those fish they discover at deep sea goodbye as he opened the door they cried out hold on billie billie look here say who is she what who is she who is who they laughed and nodded why you know she dont you understand she you talk like a lot of crazy men said hawker i dont know what you mean oh you dont eh you dont oh no how about those violets you were moping over this morning eh old man oh no you dont know what we mean oh no how about those violets eh how about em hawker with flushed and wrathful face looked at pennoyer penny but grief and wrinkles roared an interruption oh ho mr hawker so its true is it its true you are a nice bird you are well you old rascal durn your picture hawker menacing them once with his eyes went away they sat cackling at noon when he met wrinkles in the corridor he said hey wrinkles come here for a minute will you say old man i i what said wrinkles well you know i i of course every man is likely to make an accursed idiot of himself once in a while and i and you what asked wrinkles well we are a kind of a band of hoodlums you know and im just enough idiot to feel that i dont care to hear dont care to hear well her name used you know bless your heart replied wrinkles we havent used her name we dont know her name how could we use it well i know said hawker but you understand what i mean wrinkles yes i understand what you mean said wrinkles with dignity i dont suppose you are any worse of a stuff than common still i didnt know that we were such outlaws of course i have overdone the thing responded hawker hastily but you ought to understand how i mean it wrinkles after wrinkles had thought for a time he said well i guess i do all right that goes upon entering the den wrinkles said you fellows have got to quit guying billie do you hear we cried grief weve got to quit what do you do well i quit too pennoyer said ah ha billie has been jumping on you no he didnt maintained wrinkles but he let me know it was well rather a rather a sacred subject wrinkles blushed when the others snickered in the afternoon as hawker was going slowly down the stairs he was almost impaled upon the feather of a hat which upon the head of a lithe and rather slight girl charged up at him through the gloom hello splutter he cried you are in a hurry that you billie said the girl peering for the hallways of this old building remained always in a dungeonlike darkness yes it is where are you going at such a headlong gait up to see the boys ive got a bottle of wine and some some pickles you know im going to make them let me dine with them tonight coming back billie why no i dont expect to he moved then accidentally in front of the light that sifted through the dull gray panes of a little window oh cracky cried the girl how fine you are billie going to a coronation no said hawker looking seriously over his collar and down at his clothes fact is er well ive got to make a call a call bless us and are you really going to wear those gray gloves youre holding there billie say wait until you get around the corner they wont stand em on this street oh well said hawker depreciating the gloves oh well the girl looked up at him who you going to call on oh said hawker a friend must be somebody most extraordinary you look so dreadfully correct come back billie wont you come back and dine with us why i i dont believe i can oh come on its fun when we all dine together wont you billie well i oh dont be so stupid the girl stamped her foot and flashed her eyes at him angrily well ill see i will if i can i cant tell he left her rather precipitately hawker eventually appeared at a certain austere house where he rang the bell with quite nervous fingers but she was not at home as he went down the steps his eyes were as those of a man whose fortunes have tumbled upon him as he walked down the street he wore in some subtle way the air of a man who has been grievously wronged when he rounded the corner his lips were set strangely as if he were a man seeking revenge chapter xxiii its just right said grief it isnt quite cool enough said wrinkles well i guess i know the proper temperature for claret well i guess you dont if it was buttermilk now you would know but you cant tell anything about claret florinda ultimately decided the question it isnt quite cool enough she said laying her hand on the bottle put it on the window ledge grief hum splutter i thought you knew more than oh shut up interposed the busy pennoyer from a remote corner who is going after the potato salad thats what i want to know who is going wrinkles said grief grief said wrinkles there said pennoyer coming forward and scanning a late work with an eye of satisfaction theres the three glasses and the little tumbler and then grief you will have to drink out of a mug ill be doubledyed black if i will cried grief i wouldnt drink claret out of a mug to save my soul from being pinched you duffer you talk like a bloomin british chump on whom the sun never sets what do you want well theres enough without that whats the matter with you three glasses and the little tumbler yes but if billie hawker comes well let him drink out of the mug then he no he wont said florinda suddenly ill take the mug myself all right splutter rejoined grief meekly ill keep the mug but still i dont see why billie hawker i shall take the mug reiterated florinda firmly but i dont see why let her alone grief said wrinkles she has decided that it is heroic you cant move her now well who is going for the potato salad cried pennoyer again thats what i want to know wrinkles said grief grief said wrinkles do you know remarked florinda raising her head from where she had been toiling over the spaghetti i dont care so much for billie hawker as i did once her sleeves were rolled above the elbows of her wonderful arms and she turned from the stove and poised a fork as if she had been smitten at her task with this inspiration there was a short silence and then wrinkles said politely no no continued florinda i really dont believe i do she suddenly started listen isnt that him coming now the dull trample of a step could be heard in some distant corridor but it died slowly to silence i thought that might be him she said turning to the spaghetti again i hope the old indian comes said pennoyer but i dont believe he will seems to me he must be going to see who asked florinda well you know hollanden and he usually dine together when they are both in town florinda looked at pennoyer i know penny you must have thought i was remarkably clever not to understand all your blundering but i dont care so much really i dont of course not assented pennoyer really i dont of course not listen exclaimed grief who was near the door there he comes now somebody approached whistling an air from traviata which rang loud and clear and low and muffled as the whistler wound among the intricate hallways this air was as much a part of hawker as his coat the spaghetti had arrived at a critical stage florinda gave it her complete attention when hawker opened the door he ceased whistling and said gruffly hello just the man said grief go after the potato salad will you billie theres a good boy wrinkles has refused he cant carry the salad with those gloves interrupted florinda raising her eyes from her work and contemplating them with displeasure hang the gloves cried hawker dragging them from his hands and hurling them at the divan whats the matter with you splutter pennoyer said my what a temper you are in billie i am replied hawker i feel like an apache where do you get this accursed potato salad in second avenue you know where at the old place no i dont snapped hawker why here said florinda ill go she had already rolled down her sleeves and was arraying herself in her hat and jacket no you wont said hawker filled with wrath ill go myself we can both go billie if you are so bent replied the girl in a conciliatory voice well come on then what are you standing there for when these two had departed wrinkles said lordie whats wrong with billie hes been discussing art with some potboiler said grief speaking as if this was the final condition of human misery no sir said pennoyer its something connected with the now celebrated violets out in the corridor florinda said what what makes you so ugly billie why i am not ugly am i yes you are ugly as anything probably he saw a grievance in her eyes for he said well i dont want to be ugly his tone seemed tender the halls were intensely dark and the girl placed her hand on his arm as they rounded a turn in the stairs a straying lock of her hair brushed against his temple oh said florinda in a low voice well get some more claret observed hawker musingly and some cognac for the coffee and some cigarettes do you think of anything more splutter as they came from the shop of the illustrious purveyors of potato salad in second avenue florinda cried anxiously here billie you let me carry that what infernal nonsense said hawker flushing certainly not well protested florinda it might soil your gloves somehow in heavens name what if it does say young woman do you think i am one of these cholly boys no billie but then you know well if you dont take me for some kind of a willie give us peace on this blasted glove business i didnt mean well youve been intimating that ive got the only pair of gray gloves in the universe but you are wrong there are several pairs and these need not be preserved as unique in history theyre not gray theyre they are gray i suppose your distinguished ancestors in ireland did not educate their families in the matter of gloves and so you are not expected to billie you are not expected to believe that people wear gloves only in cold weather and then you expect to see mittens on the stairs in the darkness he suddenly exclaimed here look out or youll fall he reached for her arm but she evaded him later he said again look out girl what makes you stumble around so here give me the bottle of wine i can carry it all right there now can you manage chapter xxiv penny said grief looking across the table at his friend if a man thinks a heap of two violets how much would he think of a thousand violets two into a thousand goes five hundred times you fool said pennoyer i would answer your question if it were not upon a forbidden subject in the distance wrinkles and florinda were making welsh rarebits hold your tongues said hawker barbarians grief said pennoyer if a man loves a woman better than the whole universe how much does he love the whole universe gawd knows said grief piously although it ill befits me to answer your question wrinkles and florinda came with the welsh rarebits very triumphant there said florinda soon as these are finished i must go home it is after eleven oclock pour the ale grief at a later time purple sanderson entered from the world he hung up his hat and cast a look of proper financial dissatisfaction at the remnants of the feast who has been before you breathe purple you graceless scum let me tell you that we will stand no reference to the two violets here said pennoyer what the oh thats all right purple said grief but you were going to say something about the two violets right then werent you now you old bat sanderson grinned expectantly whats the row said he no row at all they told him just an agreement to keep you from chattering obstinately about the two violets what two violets have a rarebit purple advised wrinkles and never mind those maniacs well what is this business about two violets oh its just some dream they gibber at anything i think i know said florinda nodding it is something that concerns billie hawker grief and pennoyer scoffed and wrinkles said you know nothing about it splutter it doesnt concern billie hawker at all well then what is he looking sideways for cried florinda wrinkles reached for his guitar and played a serenade the silver moon is shining dry up said pennoyer then florinda cried again what does he look sideways for pennoyer and grief giggled at the imperturbable hawker who destroyed rarebit in silence its you is it billie said sanderson you are in this twoviolet business i dont know what theyre talking about replied hawker dont you honestly asked florinda well only a little there said florinda nodding again i knew he was in it he isnt in it at all said pennoyer and grief later when the cigarettes had become exhausted hawker volunteered to go after a further supply and as he arose a question seemed to come to the edge of florindas lips and pend there the moment that the door was closed upon him she demanded what is that about the two violets nothing at all answered pennoyer apparently much aggrieved he sat back with an air of being a fortress of reticence oh go on tell me penny i think you are very mean grief you tell me the silver moon is shining oh come my love to me my heart be still wrinkles will you what was it grief oh go ahead and tell me what do you want to know for cried grief vastly exasperated youve got more blamed curiosity it isnt anything at all i keep saying to you well i know it is said florinda sullenly or you would tell me when hawker brought the cigarettes florinda smoked one and then announced well i must go now who is going to take you home splutter oh anyone replied florinda i tell you what said grief well throw some poker hands and the one who wins will have the distinguished honour of conveying miss splutter to her home and mother pennoyer and wrinkles speedily routed the dishes to one end of the table griefs fingers spun the halves of a pack of cards together with the pleased eagerness of a good player the faces grew solemn with the gambling solemnity now you indians said grief dealing a draw you understand and then a showdown florinda leaned forward in her chair until it was poised on two legs the cards of purple sanderson and of hawker were faced toward her sanderson was gravely regarding two pair aces and queens hawker scanned a little pair of sevens they draw dont they she said to grief certainly said grief how many wrink four replied wrinkles plaintively gimme three said pennoyer gimme one said sanderson gimme three said hawker when he picked up his hand again florindas chair was tilted perilously she saw another seven added to the little pair sandersons draw had not assisted him same to the dealer said grief what you got wrink nothing said wrinkles exhibiting it face upward on the table goodbye florinda well ive got two small pair ventured pennoyer hopefully beat em no good said sanderson two pair aces up no good said hawker three sevens beats me said grief billie you are the fortunate man heaven guide you in third avenue florinda had gone to the window who won she asked wheeling about carelessly billie hawker what did he she said in surprise never mind splutter ill win sometime said pennoyer me too cried grief good night old girl said wrinkles they crowded in the doorway hold on to billie remember the two steps going up pennoyer called intelligently into the stygian blackness can you see all right florinda lived in a flat with fireescapes written all over the front of it the street in front was being repaired it had been said by imbecile residents of the vicinity that the paving was never allowed to remain down for a sufficient time to be invalided by the tramping millions but that it was kept perpetually stacked in little mountains through the unceasing vigilance of a virtuous and heroic city government which insisted that everything should be repaired the alderman for the district had sometimes asked indignantly of his fellowmembers why this street had not been repaired and they aroused had at once ordered it to be repaired moreover shopkeepers whose stables were adjacent placed trucks and other vehicles strategically in the darkness into this tangled midnight hawker conducted florinda the great avenue behind them was no more than a level stream of yellow light and the distant merry bells might have been boats floating down it grim loneliness hung over the uncouth shapes in the street which was being repaired billie said the girl suddenly what makes you so mean to me a peaceful citizen emerged from behind a pile of dйbris but he might not have been a peaceful citizen so the girl clung to hawker why im not mean to you am i yes she answered as they stood on the steps of the flat of innumerable fireescapes she slowly turned and looked up at him her face was of a strange pallour in this darkness and her eyes were as when the moon shines in a lake of the hills he returned her glance florinda he cried as if enlightened and gulping suddenly at something in his throat the girl studied the steps and moved from side to side as do the guilty ones in country schoolhouses then she went slowly into the flat there was a little red lamp hanging on a pile of stones to warn people that the street was being repaired chapter xxv ill get my check from the gamin on saturday said grief they bought that string of comics well then well arrange the present funds to last until saturday noon said wrinkles that gives us quite a lot we can have a table dhфte on friday night however the cashier of the gamin office looked under his respectable brass wiring and said very sorry mr er warwickson but our payday is monday come around any time after ten oh it doesnt matter said grief when he plunged into the den his visage flamed with rage dont get my check until monday morning any time after ten he yelled and flung a portfolio of mottled green into the danger zone of the casts thunder said pennoyer sinking at once into a profound despair monday morning any time after ten murmured wrinkles in astonishment and sorrow while grief marched to and fro threatening the furniture pennoyer and wrinkles allowed their under jaws to fall and remained as men smitten between the eyes by the god of calamity singular thing muttered pennoyer at last you get so frightfully hungry as soon as you learn that there are no more meals coming oh well said wrinkles he took up his guitar oh some folks say dat a niggah won steal way down yondeh in d cohnfiel but ah caught two in my cohnfiel way down yondeh in d cohnfiel oh let up said grief as if unwilling to be moved from his despair oh let up said pennoyer as if he disliked the voice and the ballad in his studio hawker sat braced nervously forward on a little stool before his tall dutch easel three sketches lay on the floor near him and he glared at them constantly while painting at the large canvas on the easel he seemed engaged in some kind of a duel his hair dishevelled his eyes gleaming he was in a deadly scuffle in the sketches was the landscape of heavy blue as if seen through powdersmoke and all the skies burned red there was in these notes a sinister quality of hopelessness eloquent of a defeat as if the scene represented the last hour on a field of disastrous battle hawker seemed attacking with this picture something fair and beautiful of his own life a possession of his mind and he did it fiercely mercilessly formidably his arm moved with the energy of a strange wrath he might have been thrusting with a sword there was a knock at the door come in pennoyer entered sheepishly well cried hawker with an echo of savagery in his voice he turned from the canvas precisely as one might emerge from a fight oh he said perceiving pennoyer the glow in his eyes slowly changed what is it penny billie said pennoyer grief was to get his check today but they put him off until monday and so you know er well oh said hawker again when pennoyer had gone hawker sat motionless before his work he stared at the canvas in a meditation so profound that it was probably unconscious of itself the light from above his head slanted more and more toward the east once he arose and lighted a pipe he returned to the easel and stood staring with his hands in his pockets he moved like one in a sleep suddenly the gleam shot into his eyes again he dropped to the stool and grabbed a brush at the end of a certain long tumultuous period he clinched his pipe more firmly in his teeth and puffed strongly the thought might have occurred to him that it was not alight for he looked at it with a vague questioning glance there came another knock at the door go to the devil he shouted without turning his head hollanden crossed the corridor then to the den hi there hollie hello boy just the fellow we want to see come in sit down hit a pipe say who was the girl billie hawker went mad over this summer blazes said hollanden recovering slowly from this onslaught who what how did you indians find it out oh we tumbled they cried in delight we tumbled there said hollanden reproaching himself and i thought you were such a lot of blockheads oh we tumbled they cried again in their ecstasy but who is she thats the point well she was a girl yes go on a new york girl yes a perfectly stunning new york girl yes go ahead a perfectly stunning new york girl of a very wealthy and rather oldfashioned family well ill be shot you dont mean it she is practically seated on top of the matterhorn poor old billie not at all said hollanden composedly it was a common habit of purple sanderson to call attention at night to the resemblance of the den to some little ward in a hospital upon this night when sanderson and grief were buried in slumber pennoyer moved restlessly wrink he called softly into the darkness in the direction of the divan which was secretly a coalbox what said wrinkles in a surly voice his mind had evidently been caught at the threshold of sleep do you think florinda cares much for billie hawker wrinkles fretted through some oaths how in thunder do i know the divan creaked as he turned his face to the wall well muttered pennoyer chapter xxvi the harmony of summer sunlight on leaf and blade of green was not known to the two windows which looked forth at an obviously endless building of brownstone about which there was the poetry of a prison inside great folds of lace swept down in orderly cascades as water trained to fall mathematically the colossal chandelier gleaming like a siamese headdress caught the subtle flashes from unknown places hawker heard a step and the soft swishing of a womans dress he turned toward the door swiftly with a certain dramatic impulsiveness but when she entered the room he said how delighted i am to see you again she had said why mr hawker it was so charming in you to come it did not appear that hawkers tongue could wag to his purpose the girl seemed in her mind to be frantically shuffling her pack of social receipts and finding none of them made to meet this situation finally hawker said that he thought hearts at war was a very good play did you she said in surprise i thought it much like the others well so did i he cried hastily the same figures moving around in the mud of modern confusion i really didnt intend to say that i liked it fact is meeting you rather moved me out of my mental track mental track she said i didnt know clever people had mental tracks i thought it was a privilege of the theologians who told you i was clever he demanded why she said opening her eyes wider nobody hawker smiled and looked upon her with gratitude of course nobody there couldnt be such an idiot i am sure you should be astonished to learn that i believed such an imbecile existed but oh she said but i think you might have spoken less bluntly well she said after wavering for a time you are clever arent you certainly he answered reassuringly well then she retorted with triumph in her tone and this interrogation was apparently to her the final victorious argument at his discomfiture hawker grinned you havent asked news of stanley he said why dont you ask news of stanley oh and how was he the last i saw of him he stood down at the end of the pasture the pasture you know wagging his tail in blissful anticipation of an invitation to come with me and when it finally dawned upon him that he was not to receive it he turned and went back toward the house like a man suddenly stricken with age as the storytellers eloquently say poor old dog and you left him she said reproachfully then she asked do you remember how he amused you playing with the ants at the falls no why he did he pawed at the moss and you sat there laughing i remember it distinctly you remember distinctly why i thought well your back was turned you know your gaze was fixed upon something before you and you were utterly lost to the rest of the world you could not have known if stanley pawed the moss and i laughed so you see you are mistaken as a matter of fact i utterly deny that stanley pawed the moss or that i laughed or that any ants appeared at the falls at all i have always said that you should have been a chinese soldier of fortune she observed musingly your daring and ingenuity would be prized by the chinese there are innumerable tobacco jars in china he said measuring the advantages moreover there is no perspective you dont have to walk two miles to see a friend no he is always there near you so that you cant move a chair without hitting your distant friend you did hollie remain as attentive as ever to the worcester girls yes of course as attentive as ever he dragged me into all manner of tennis games why i thought you loved to play tennis oh well said hawker i did until you left my sister has gone to the park with the children i know she will be vexed when she finds that you have called ultimately hawker said do you remember our ride behind my fathers oxen no she answered i had forgotten it completely did we ride behind your fathers oxen after a moment he said that remark would be prized by the chinese we did and you most graciously professed to enjoy it which earned my deep gratitude and admiration for no one knows better than i he added meekly that it is no great comfort or pleasure to ride behind my fathers oxen she smiled retrospectively do you remember how the people on the porch hurried to the railing chapter xxvii near the door the stout proprietress sat intrenched behind the cashbox in a parisian manner she looked with practical amiability at her guests who dined noisily and with great fire discussing momentous problems furiously making wide maniacal gestures through the cigarette smoke meanwhile the little handful of waiters ran to and fro wildly imperious and importunate cries rang at them from all directions gustave adolphe their faces expressed a settled despair they answered calls commands oaths in a semidistraction fleeting among the tables as if pursued by some dodging animal their breaths came in gasps if they had been convict labourers they could not have surveyed their positions with countenances of more unspeakable injury withal they carried incredible masses of dishes and threaded their ways with skill they served people with such speed and violence that it often resembled a personal assault they struck two blows at a table and left there a knife and fork then came the viands in a volley the clatter of this business was loud and bewilderingly rapid like the gallop of a thousand horses in a remote corner a band of mandolins and guitars played the long sweeping mad melody of a spanish waltz it seemed to go tingling to the hearts of many of the diners their eyes glittered with enthusiasm with abandon with deviltry they swung their heads from side to side in rhythmic movement high in air curled the smoke from the innumerable cigarettes the long black claret bottles were in clusters upon the tables at an end of the hall two men with maudlin grins sang the waltz uproariously but always a trifle belated an unsteady person leaning back in his chair to murmur swift compliments to a woman at another table suddenly sprawled out upon the floor he scrambled to his feet and turning to the escort of the woman heatedly blamed him for the accident they exchanged a series of tense bitter insults which spatted back and forth between them like pellets people arose from their chairs and stretched their necks the musicians stood in a body their faces turned with expressions of keen excitement toward this quarrel but their fingers still twinkling over their instruments sending into the middle of this turmoil the passionate mad spanish music the proprietor of the place came in agitation and plunged headlong into the argument where he thereafter appeared as a frantic creature harried to the point of insanity for they buried him at once in long vociferous threats explanations charges every form of declamation known to their voices the music the noise of the galloping horses the voices of the brawlers gave the whole thing the quality of war there were two men in the cafй who seemed to be tranquil hollanden carefully stacked one lump of sugar upon another in the middle of his saucer and poured cognac over them he touched a match to the cognac and the blue and yellow flames eddied in the saucer i wonder what those two fools are bellowing at he said turning about irritably hanged if i know muttered hawker in reply this place makes me weary anyhow hear the blooming din whats the matter said hollanden you used to say this was the one natural the one truly bohemian resort in the city you swore by it well i dont like it so much any more ho cried hollanden youre getting correct thats it exactly you will become one of these intensely look billie the little one is going to punch him no he isnt they never do said hawker morosely why did you bring me here tonight hollie i i bring you good heavens i came as a concession to you what are you talking about hi the little one is going to punch him sure he gave the scene his undivided attention for a moment then he turned again you will become correct i know you will i have been watching you are about to achieve a respectability that will make a stone saint blush for himself whats the matter with you you act as if you thought falling in love with a girl was a most extraordinary circumstance i wish they would put those people out of course i know that you there the little one has swiped at him at last after a time he resumed his oration of course i know that you are not reformed in the matter of this uproar and this remarkable consumption of bad wine it is not that it is a fact that there are indications that some other citizen was fortunate enough to possess your napkin before you and moreover you are sure that you would hate to be caught by your correct friends with any such consommй in front of you as we had tonight you have got an eye suddenly for all kinds of gilt you are in the way of becoming a most unbearable person oh look the little one and the proprietor are having it now you are in the way of becoming a most unbearable person presently many of your friends will not be fine enough in heavens name why dont they throw him out are you going to howl and gesticulate there all night well said hawker a man would be a fool if he did like this dinner certainly but what an immaterial part in the glory of this joint is the dinner who cares about dinner no one comes here to eat thats what you always claimed well there at last they are throwing him out i hope he lands on his head really you know billie it is such a fine thing being in love that one is sure to be detestable to the rest of the world and that is the reason they created a proverb to the other effect you want to look out you talk like a blasted old granny said hawker havent changed at all this place is all right only you are gone interrupted hollanden in a sad voice it is very plain you are gone chapter xxviii the proprietor of the place having pushed to the street the little man who may have been the most vehement came again and resumed the discussion with the remainder of the men of war many of these had volunteered and they were very enduring yes you are gone said hollanden with the sobriety of graves in his voice you are gone hi he cried there is lucian pontiac hi pontiac sit down here a man with a tangle of hair and with that about his mouth which showed that he had spent many years in manufacturing a proper modesty with which to bear his greatness came toward them smiling hello pontiac said hollanden heres another great painter do you know mr hawker mr william hawker mr pontiac mr hawker delighted said pontiac although i have not known you personally i can assure you that i have long been a great admirer of your abilities the proprietor of the place and the men of war had at length agreed to come to an amicable understanding they drank liquors while each firmly but now silently upheld his dignity charming place said pontiac so thoroughly parisian in spirit and from time to time mr hawker i use one of your models must say she has the best arm and wrist in the universe stunning figure stunning you mean florinda said hawker yes thats the name very fine girl lunches with me from time to time and chatters so volubly thats how i learned you posed her occasionally if the models didnt gossip we would never know what painters were addicted to profanity now that old thorndike he told me you swore like a drillsergeant if the model winked a finger at the critical time very fine girl florinda and honest too honest as the devil very curious thing of course honesty among the girl models is very common very common quite universal thing you know but then it always strikes me as being very curious very curious ive been much attracted by your girl florinda my girl said hawker well she always speaks of you in a proprietary way you know and then she considers that she owes you some kind of obedience and allegiance and devotion i remember last week i said to her you can go now come again friday but she said i dont think i can come on friday billie hawker is home now and he may want me then said i the devil take billie hawker he hasnt engaged you for friday has he well then i engage you now but she shook her head no she couldnt come on friday billie hawker was home and he might want her any day well then said i you have my permission to do as you please since you are resolved upon it anyway go to your billie hawker did you need her on friday no said hawker well then the minx i shall scold her stunning figure stunning it was only last week that old charley master said to me mournfully there are no more good models great scott not a one youre way off my boy i said there is one good model and then i named your girl i mean the girl who claims to be yours poor little beggar said hollanden who said pontiac florinda answered hollanden i suppose pontiac interrupted oh of course it is too bad everything is too bad my dear sir nothing is so much to be regretted as the universe but this florinda is such a sturdy young soul the world is against her but bless your heart she is equal to the battle she is strong in the manner of a little child why you dont know her she i know her very well well perhaps you do but for my part i think you dont appreciate her formidable character and stunning figure stunning damn it said hawker to his coffee cup which he had accidentally overturned well resumed pontiac she is a stunning model and i think mr hawker you are to be envied eh said hawker i wish i could inspire my models with such obedience and devotion then i would not be obliged to rail at them for being late and have to badger them for not showing up at all she has a beautiful figure beautiful chapter xxix when hawker went again to the house of the great window he looked first at the colossal chandelier and perceiving that it had not moved he smiled in a certain friendly and familiar way it must be a fine thing said the girl dreamily i always feel envious of that sort of life what sort of life why i dont know exactly but there must be a great deal of freedom about it i went to a studio tea once and a studio tea merciful heavens go on yes a studio tea dont you like them to be sure we didnt know whether the man could paint very well and i suppose you think it is an imposition for anyone who is not a great painter to give a tea go on well he had the dearest little japanese servants and some of the cups came from algiers and some from turkey and some from whats the matter go on im not interrupting you well thats all excepting that everything was charming in colour and i thought what a lazy beautiful life the man must lead lounging in such a studio smoking monogrammed cigarettes and remarking how badly all the other men painted very fascinating but oh you are going to ask if he could draw im sure i dont know but the tea that he gave was charming i was on the verge of telling you something about artist life but if you have seen a lot of draperies and drunk from a cup of algiers you know all about it you then were going to make it something very terrible and tell how young painters struggled and all that no not exactly but listen i suppose there is an aristocracy who whether they paint well or paint ill certainly do give charming teas as you say and all other kinds of charming affairs too but when i hear people talk as if that was the whole life it makes my hair rise you know because i am sure that as they get to know me better and better they will see how i fall short of that kind of an existence and i shall probably take a great tumble in their estimation they might even conclude that i can not paint which would be very unfair because i can paint you know well proceed to arrange my point of view so that you shant tumble in my estimation when i discover that you dont lounge in a studio smoke monogrammed cigarettes and remark how badly the other men paint thats it thats precisely what i wish to do begin well in the first place in the first place what well i started to study when i was very poor you understand look here im telling you these things because i want you to know somehow it isnt that im not ashamed of it well i began very poor and i as a matter of fact i well i earned myself over half the money for my studying and the other half i bullied and badgered and beat out of my poor old dad i worked pretty hard in paris and i returned here expecting to become a great painter at once i didnt though in fact i had my worst moments then it lasted for some years of course the faith and endurance of my father were by this time worn to a shadow this time when i needed him the most however things got a little better and a little better until i found that by working quite hard i could make what was to me a fair income thats where i am now too why are you so ashamed of this story the poverty poverty isnt anything to be ashamed of great heavens have you the temerity to get off that old nonsensical remark poverty is everything to be ashamed of did you ever see a person not ashamed of his poverty certainly not of course when a man gets very rich he will brag so loudly of the poverty of his youth that one would never suppose that he was once ashamed of it but he was well anyhow you shouldnt be ashamed of the story you have just told me why not do you refuse to allow me the great right of being like other men i think it was brave you know brave nonsense those things are not brave impression to that effect created by the men who have been through the mill for the greater glory of the men who have been through the mill i dont like to hear you talk that way it sounds wicked you know well it certainly wasnt heroic i can remember distinctly that there was not one heroic moment no but it was it was it was what well somehow i like it you know chapter xxx theres three of them said grief in a hoarse whisper four i tell you said wrinkles in a low excited tone four breathed pennoyer with decision they held fierce pantomimic argument from the corridor came sounds of rustling dresses and rapid feminine conversation grief had kept his ear to the panel of the door his hand was stretched back warning the others to silence presently he turned his head and whispered three four whispered pennoyer and wrinkles hollie is there too whispered grief billie is unlocking the door now theyre going in hear them cry out oh isnt it lovely jinks he began a noiseless dance about the room jinks dont i wish i had a big studio and a little reputation wouldnt i have my swell friends come to see me and wouldnt i entertain em he adopted a descriptive manner and with his forefinger indicated various spaces of the wall here is a little thing i did in brittany peasant woman in sabots this brown spot here is the peasant woman and those two white things are the sabots peasant woman in sabots dont you see women in brittany of course all wear sabots you understand convenience of the painters i see you are looking at that little thing i did in morocco ah you admire it well not so bad not so bad arab smoking pipe squatting in doorway this long streak here is the pipe clever you say oh thanks you are too kind well all arabs do that you know sole occupation convenience of the painters now this little thing here i did in venice grand canal you know gondolier leaning on his oar convenience of the painters oh yes american subjects are well enough but hard to find you know hard to find morocco venice brittany holland all oblige with colour you know quaint form all that we are so hideously modern over here and besides nobody has painted us much how the devil can i paint america when nobody has done it before me my dear sir are you aware that that would be originality good heavens we are not жsthetic you understand oh yes some good mind comes along and understands a thing and does it and after that it is жsthetic yes of course but then well now here is a little holland thing of mine it the others had evidently not been heeding him shut up said wrinkles suddenly listen grief paused his harangue and they sat in silence their lips apart their eyes from time to time exchanging eloquent messages a dulled melodious babble came from hawkers studio at length pennoyer murmured wistfully i would like to see her wrinkles started noiselessly to his feet well i tell you shes a peach i was going up the steps you know with a loaf of bread under my arm when i chanced to look up the street and saw billie and hollanden coming with four of them three said grief four and i tell you i scattered one of the two with billie was a peach a peach o lord groaned the others enviously billies in luck how do you know said wrinkles billie is a blamed good fellow but that doesnt say she will care for him more likely that she wont they sat again in silence grinning and listening to the murmur of voices there came the sound of a step in the hallway it ceased at a point opposite the door of hawkers studio presently it was heard again florinda entered the den hello she cried who is over in billies place i was just going to knock they motioned at her violently sh they whispered their countenances were very impressive whats the matter with you fellows asked florinda in her ordinary tone whereupon they made gestures of still greater wildness sssh florinda lowered her voice properly who is over there some swells they whispered florinda bent her head presently she gave a little start who is over there her voice became a tone of deep awe she wrinkles and grief exchanged a swift glance pennoyer said gruffly who do you mean why said florinda you know she the the girl that billie likes pennoyer hesitated for a moment and then said wrathfully of course she is who do you suppose oh said florinda she took a seat upon the divan which was privately a coalbox and unbuttoned her jacket at the throat is she is she very handsome wrink wrinkles replied stoutly no grief said lets make a sneak down the hall to the little unoccupied room at the front of the building and look from the window there when they go out we can pipe em off come on they exclaimed accepting this plan with glee wrinkles opened the door and seemed about to glide away when he suddenly turned and shook his head its dead wrong he said ashamed oh go on eagerly whispered the others presently they stole pattering down the corridor grinning exclaiming and cautioning each other at the window pennoyer said now for heavens sake dont let them see you be careful grief youll tumble dont lean on me that way wrink think im a barn door here they come keep back dont let them see you oooh said grief talk about a peach well i should say so florindas fingers tore at wrinkles coat sleeve wrink wrink is that her is that her on the left of billie is that her wrink what yes stop punching me yes i tell you thats her are you deaf chapter xxxi in the evening pennoyer conducted florinda to the flat of many fireescapes after a period of silent tramping through the great golden avenue and the street that was being repaired she said penny you are very good to me why said pennoyer oh because you are you you are very good to me penny well i guess im not killing myself there isnt many fellows like you no no there isnt many fellows like you penny i tell you most everything and you just listen and dont argue with me and tell me im a fool because you know that it because you know that it cant be

do penny go ahead and tell me well go ahead well she is rather handsome you know yes said florinda dejectedly i suppose she is after a time she cleared her throat and remarked indifferently i suppose billie cares a lot for her oh i imagine that he does in a way why of course he does insisted florinda what do you mean by in a way you know very well that billie thinks his eyes of her no i dont yes you do you know you do you are talking in that way just to brace me up you know you are no im not penny said florinda thankfully what makes you so good to me oh i guess im not so astonishingly good to

she is beautiful well then confound it no no no oh yes you do penny go ahead now dont deny it just because you are talking to me own up now penny you do think she is beautiful well said pennoyer in a dull roar of irritation do you florinda walked in silence her eyes upon the yellow flashes which lights sent to the pavement in the end she said yes yes what asked pennoyer sharply yes she yes she is beautiful well then cried pennoyer abruptly closing the discussion florinda announced something as a fact billie thinks his eyes of her how do you know he does dont scold at me penny you you im not scolding at you there what a goose you are splutter dont for heavens sake go to whimpering on the street i didnt say anything to make you feel that way come pull yourself together im not whimpering no of course not but then you look as if you were on the edge of it what a little idiot chapter xxxii when the snow fell upon the clashing life of the city the exiled stones beaten by myriad strange feet were told of the dark silent forests where the flakes swept through the hemlocks and swished softly against the boulders in his studio hawker smoked a pipe clasping his knee with thoughtful interlocked fingers he was gazing sourly at his finished picture once he started to his feet with a cry of vexation looking back over his shoulder he swore an insult into the face of the picture he paced to and fro smoking belligerently and from time to time eying it the helpless thing remained upon the easel facing him hollanden entered and stopped abruptly at sight of the great scowl whats wrong now he said hawker gestured at the picture that dunce of a thing it makes me tired it isnt worth a hang blame it what hollanden strode forward and stood before the painting with legs apart in a properly critical manner what why you said it was your best thing aw said hawker waving his arms its no good i abominate it i didnt get what i wanted i tell you i didnt get what i wanted that he shouted pointing thrustway at it that its vile aw it makes me weary youre in a nice state said hollanden turning to take a critical view of the painter what has got into you now i swear you are more kinds of a chump hawker crooned dismally i cant paint i cant paint for a damn im no good what in thunder was i invented for anyhow hollie youre a fool said hollanden i hope to die if i ever saw such a complete idiot you give me a pain just because she dont it isnt that she has nothing to do with it although i know well enough i know well enough what i know well enough she doesnt care a hang for me it isnt that it is because it is because i cant paint look at that thing over there remember the thought and energy i damn the thing why did you have a row with her asked hollanden perplexed i didnt know no of course you didnt know cried hawker sneering because i had no row it isnt that i tell you but i know well enough he shook his fist vaguely that she dont care an old tomato can for me why should she he demanded with a curious defiance in the name of heaven why should she i dont know said hollanden i dont know im sure but then women have no social logic this is the great blessing of the world there is only one thing which is superior to the multiplicity of social forms and that is a womans mind a young womans mind oh of course sometimes they are logical but let a woman be so once and she will repent of it to the end of her days the safety of the worlds balance lies in womans illogical mind i think go to blazes said hawker i dont care what you think i am sure of one thing and that is that she doesnt care a hang for me i think hollanden continued that society is doing very well in its work of bravely lawing away at nature but there is one immovable thing a womans illogical mind that is our safety thank heaven it go to blazes said hawker again chapter xxxiii as hawker again entered the room of the great windows he glanced in sidelong bitterness at the chandelier when he was seated he looked at it in open defiance and hatred men in the street were shovelling at the snow the noise of their instruments scraping on the stones came plainly to hawkers ears in a harsh chorus and this sound at this time was perhaps to him a miserere i came to tell you he began i came to tell you that perhaps i am going away going away she cried where well i dont know quite you see i am rather indefinite as yet i thought of going for the winter somewhere in the southern states i am decided merely this much you know i am going somewhere but i dont know where way off anyhow we shall be very sorry to lose you she remarked we and i thought he continued that i would come and say adios now for fear that i might leave very suddenly i do that sometimes im afraid you will forget me very soon but i want to tell you that why said the girl in some surprise you speak as if you were going away for all time you surely do not mean to utterly desert new york i think you misunderstand me he said i give this important air to my farewell to you because to me it is a very important event perhaps you recollect that once i told you that i cared for you well i still care for you and so i can only go away somewhere some place way off where where see new york is a very large place she observed yes new york is a very large how good of you to remind me but then you dont understand you cant understand i know i can find no place where i will cease to remember you but then i can find some place where i can cease to remember in a way that i am myself i shall never try to forget you those two violets you know one i found near the tennis court and the other you gave me you remember i shall take them with me here said the girl tugging at her gown for a moment here heres a third one she thrust a violet toward him if you were not so serenely insolent said hawker i would think that you felt sorry for me i dont wish you to feel sorry for me and i dont wish to be melodramatic i know it is all commonplace enough and i didnt mean to act like a tenor please dont pity me i dont she replied she gave the violet a little fling hawker lifted his head suddenly and glowered at her no you dont he at last said slowly you dont moreover there is no reason why you should take the trouble but he paused when the girl leaned and peered over the arm of her chair precisely in the manner of a child at the brink of a fountain theres my violet on the floor she said you treated it quite contemptuously didnt you yes together they stared at the violet finally he stooped and took it in his fingers i feel as if this third one was pelted at me but i shall keep it you are rather a cruel person but heaven guard us that only fastens a mans love the more upon a woman she laughed that is not a very good thing to tell a woman no he said gravely it is not but then i fancy that somebody may have told you previously she stared at him and then said i think you are revenged for my serene insolence great heavens what an armour he cried i suppose after all i did feel a trifle like a tenor when i first came here but you have chilled it all out of me lets talk upon indifferent topics but he started abruptly to his feet no he said let us not talk upon indifferent topics i am not brave i assure you and it it might be too much for me he held out his hand goodbye you are going yes i am going really i didnt think how it would bore you for me to come around here and croak in this fashion and you are not coming back for a long long time not for a long long time he mimicked her tone i have the three violets now you know and you must remember that i took the third one even when you flung it at my head that will remind you how submissive i was in my devotion when you recall the two others it will remind you of what a fool i was dare say you wont miss three violets no she said particularly the one you flung at my head that violet was certainly freely given i didnt fling it at your head she pondered for a time with her eyes upon the floor then she murmured no more freely given than the one i gave you that night that night at the inn so very good of you to tell me so her eyes were still upon the floor do you know said hawker it is very hard to go away and leave an impression in your mind that i am a fool that is very hard now you do think i am a fool dont you she remained silent once she lifted her eyes and gave him a swift look with much indignation in it now you are enraged well what have i done it seemed that some tumult was in her mind for she cried out to him at last in sudden tearfulness oh do go go please i want you to go under this swift change hawker appeared as a man struck from the sky he sprang to his feet took two steps forward and spoke a word which was an explosion of delight and amazement he said what with heroic effort she slowly raised her eyes until alight with anger defiance unhappiness they met his eyes later she told him that he was perfectly ridiculous
