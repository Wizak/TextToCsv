 chapter i thought about being dead i could remember every silly detail of that silly last performance i was dead at the end of it but how could i think about being dead if i had died i thought about that too after i stopped having hysterics there was plenty of time to think call me allen carpentier its the name i wrote under and someone will remember it i was one of the bestknown sciencefiction writers in the world and i had a lot of fans my stories werent the kind that win awards but they entertained and i had written a lot of them the fans all knew me someone ought to remember me it was the fans who killed me at least they let me do it its an old game at sciencefiction conventions the fans try to get their favorite author washedout stinking drunk then they can go home and tell stories about how allen carpentier really tied one on and they were right there to see it they add to the stories until legends are built around what writers do at conventions its all in fun they really like me and i like them i think i do but the fans vote the hugo awards and you have to be popular to win id been nominated five times for awards and never won one and i was out to make friends that year instead of hiding in a back booth with other writers i was at a fan party drinking with a roomful of short ugly kids with pimples tall serious harvard types girls with long stringy hair halfpretty girls halfdressed to show it and damn few people with good manners remember the drinking party in war and peace where one of the characters bets he can sit on a window ledge and drink a whole bottle of rum without touching the sides i made the same bet the convention hotel was a big one and the room was eight stories up i climbed out and sat with my feet dangling against the smooth stone building the smog had blown away and los angeles was beautiful even with the energy shortage there were lights everywhere moving rivers of lights on the freeways blue glows from swimming pools near the hotel a grid of light stretching out as far as i could see somewhere out there were fireworks but i dont know what they were celebrating they handed me the rum youre a real sport allen said a middleaged adolescent he had acne and halitosis but he published one of the biggest sciencefiction newsletters around he wouldnt have known a literary reference if it bit him on the nose hey thats a long way down right beautiful night isnt it arcturus up there see it star with the largest proper motion moved a couple of degrees in the last three thousand years almost races along carpentiers trivial last words a meaningless lecture to people who not only knew it already but had read it in my own work i took the rum and tilted my head back to drink it was like drinking flaming battery acid there was no pleasure in it id regret this tomorrow but the fans began to shout behind me and that made me feel good until i saw why asimov had come in asimov wrote science articles and histories and straight novels and commentaries on the bible and byron and shakespeare and he turned out more material in a year than anyone else writes in a lifetime i used to steal data and ideas from his columns the fans were shouting for him while i risked my neck to give them the biggest performance of all the drunken conventions of allen carpentier with nobody watching the bottle was half empty when my gag reflex cut in and spilled used rum into my nose and sinuses i jackknifed forward to cough it out of my lungs and pitched right on over i dont think anyone saw me fall it was an accident a stupid accident caused by stupid drunkenness and it was all the fans fault anyway they had no business letting me do it and it was an accident i know it was i wasnt feeling that sorry for myself the city was still alive with lights a big roman candle burst with brilliant pinpoints of yellows and greens against the starry skies the view was pleasant as i floated down the side of the hotel it seemed to take a long time to get to the bottom chapter the big surprise was that i could be surprised that i could be anything that i could be i was but i wasnt i thought i could see but there was only a bright uniform metallic color of bronze sometimes there were faint sounds but they didnt mean anything and when i looked down i couldnt see myself when i tried to move nothing happened it felt as if i had moved my muscles sent the right position signals but nothing happened nothing at all i couldnt touch anything not even myself i couldnt feel anything or see anything or sense anything except my own posture i knew when i was sitting or standing or walking or running or doubled up like a contortionist but i felt nothing at all i screamed i could hear the scream and i shouted for help nothing answered dead i had to be dead but dead men dont think about death what do dead men think about dead men dont think i was thinking but i was dead that struck me as funny and set off hysterics and then id get myself under control and go round and round with it again dead this was like nothing any religion had ever taught not that id ever caught any of the religions going around but none had warned of this i certainly wasnt in heaven and it was too lonely to be hell its like this carpentier this is heaven but youre the only one who ever made it hah i couldnt be dead what then frozen frozen thats it theyve made me a corpsicle the convention was in los angeles where the frozendead movement started and where it has the most supporters they must have frozen me put me in a doublewalled coffin with liquid nitrogen all around me and when they tried to revive me the revival didnt work what am i now a brain in a bottle fed by colorcoded tubes why dont they try to talk to me why dont they kill me maybe they still have hopes of waking me hope maybe theres hope after all it was flattering at first to think of teams of specialists working to make me human again the fans theyd realized it was their fault and theyd paid for this how far in the future would i wake up what would it be like even the definition of human might have changed would they have immortality stimulation of psychic power centers in the brain empires of thousands of worlds id written about all of these and my books would still be around id be famous id written about id written stories about future cultures raiding corpsicles for spare parts transplants had that happened to me my body broken up for spares then why was i still alive because they couldnt use my brain then let them throw it out maybe they just couldnt use it yet i couldnt tell how long i was there there was no sense of time passing i screamed a lot i ran nowhere forever to no purpose i couldnt ran out of breath i never reached a wall i wrote novels dozens of them in my head with no way to write them down i relived that last convention party a thousand times i played games with myself i remembered every detail of my life with a brutal honesty id never had before what else could i do all through it i was terrified of going mad and then id fight the terror because that could drive me mad i think i did not go mad but it went on and on and on until i was screaming again get me out of here please anyone someone get me out of here nothing happened of course pull the plug and let me die make it stop get me out of here nothing hey carpentier remember the chill your hero was a corpsicle and theyd let his temperature drop too low his nervous system had become a superconductor nobody knew he way alive in there frozen solid but thinking screaming in his head feeling the awful cold no for the love of god get me out of here i was lying on my left side in a field with dirt under me and warm light all around me i was staring at my navel and i could see it it was the most beautiful sight id ever imagined i was afraid to move my navel and i might pop like a soap bubble it took a long time to get the nerve to lift my head i could see my hands and feet and the rest of me when i moved my fingers i could see them wriggle there wasnt a thing wrong with me it was as if i had never fallen eight stories to be smashed into jelly i was clothed in a loose white gown partly open down the front not very surprising but where was the hospital surely they didnt waken sleepers in the middle of a field they i couldnt see anyone else there was a field of dirt trampled here and there sloping downhill to become a shiny mud flat i raised my head and he was standing behind me a fat man tall but dumpy and chunky enough that at first i didnt notice his height his jaw was massively square and jutted out the first thing i noticed about his face he had wide lips and a high forehead and short blunt powerful fingers he wore a hospital gown something like mine he was beautiful everything was beautiful but my navel magnifique you are well he asked he spoke with an accent mediterranean spanish perhaps or italian he was looking closely at me and he asked again you are well yes i think so where am i he shrugged always they ask that question first where do you think you are i shook my head and grinned for the pleasure of it it was pleasure to move to see myself move to feel my buttocks press against the dirt and know something would oppose my movements it was ecstasy to see myself in the bright light around me i looked up at the sky there wasnt any sky okay there has to be a sky i know that but i saw nothing thick clouds but there was no detail to the clouds just a uniform gray above me even in my sensationstarved condition it was ugly i was in the middle of a field of dirt that stretched a couple of miles to some low brown hills there were people on the hills a lot of them running after something i couldnt make out i sat up to scan the horizon the hills ran up against a high wall that stretched in both directions as far as i could see it seemed straight as a mathematicians line but i sensed the slightest of inward curves just before it vanished into deep gloom there was something wrong with the perspective but i cant describe precisely what just that it didnt seem right the hills and the mud flats formed a wide strip between the wall and a fastmoving river of water black as ink the river was a mile away and didnt seem very wide at that distance i could see it perfectly another perceptual distortion because it was too far away for the details i could make out beyond the river were green fields and white mediterranean villas walled complexes with the squat classical look to them some quite large they werent arranged in any order and the effect was very pleasing i turned back to the wall not very high i thought high enough to be trouble climbing perhaps two or three times my sixfoot height i was hampered by the perspective problem the nearest point of the wall might have been a mile away or ten though ten seemed ridiculous i took a deep breath and didnt like the smells fetid with an acrid tinge decay and sickly sweet perfume to cover the smells of death orange blossoms mingled with hospital smells all subtle enough that i hadnt noticed them before but sickening all the same i wont mention the smells often but they were always there most stinks you get used to and soon dont notice but this had too much in the blend and the blend changed too often youd just get used to one and thered be another beside me on the ground was a small bronze bottle with a classical beaker shape i figured it would hold maybe a quart except for the man standing above me there wasnt another blessed thing never mind where i am i said where have i been i dont remember passing out i was screaming and here i am where was i first you ask where you are then where you were do you think of nothing else you should say he was frowning disapproval as if he didnt like me at all so what the hell was he doing here breaking me out of wherever id been of course yeah thanks you should thank the one who sent me to you who was that you asked him for help i dont remember asking anyone for help but this time id heard him pronounce the capital letter yeah for the love of god i said well the fat meaty lips twitched and his eyes filled with concern when he looked at me it wasnt in distaste but in sympathy very well you will have a great deal to learn first i answer your questions where are you you are dead and you lie on the ground of the vestibule to hell where were you he kicked the bronze bottle with a sandaled foot in there hot diggity damn im in the nut hatch and the head loonys come to talk to me carpentier wakes up a thousand years after his last flight and sloppy landing and already hes in trouble spoons and forks and chopsticks traffic lights the way a man puts his pants on all may have to be relearned law and customs change in a thousand years society may not even recognize carpentier as sane but wake him in a thirtiethcentury loony bin among thirtiethcentury twitchies and now what how can he adjust to anything there were other bottles sitting unattended on the dirt some larger than mine some smaller i dont know why i hadnt noticed them before i picked one up and dropped it quick it burned my fingers and there were faint sounds coming from inside it it sounded like human speech in a foreign language a voice screaming curses that tone couldnt be anything else endless curses screamed why would they put radios in old bronze bottles and scatter them through the loony bin my hypothesis needed more work the people up on the hills were still running theyd looped back to about where id first seen them and whatever it was they chased they hadnt caught it yet do they let the nuts run in circles in futuristic loony bins where had i been where there wasnt any hospital around here no facilities for keeping all at part of a corpsicle nothing but this crazy man and a lot of bronze bottles and people running in circles and and insects of some kind something whined and did a kamikaze into my ear something else stung me on the back of the neck i slapped frantically but there wasnt anything to see it felt good even to hurt myself slapping my rescuer was patiently waiting for me to make some response it wouldnt hurt to humor him until i had more information okay im in the vestibule of hell and i was in a bottle a djinn bottle how long i told him the date on which id fallen from the window he shrugged you will find that time has not the same meaning here as you are accustomed to we have all the time we will ever need eternity lies before us i am unable to tell you how long you were in that beaker but i can assure you it is not important not important i almost went mad in there the realization made me start to shiver and he dropped to his knees beside me all concern to put a hand on my shoulder it is over now god will not allow you back into the bottle i cannot assure you that there will be nothing worse before you leave hell there will be much worse but with faith and hope you will endure it and you will be able to leave thats a lot of comfort it is infinite comfort did you not understand i know a way out at here yeah so do i right over that wall he laughed i listened for a while and it got irritating finally he choked it down to a chuckle im sorry but they all say that too i suppose there is nothing for it but to let you try after all we have plenty of time he laughed again now what would he turn me in if i tried to climb the wall i got up surprised at how good i felt except for the gnats and the smell my imaginary exercises in the bottle look wherever i really spent all that time effectively i was in a bottle right its a convenient figure of speech anyway my exercises in the bottle had paid off i started briskly toward the wall wherever the ground dipped low it became squishy mud ankledeep with small live things in it i tried to stick to the high ground the fat man kept right alongside me there was no chucking him after a while i said if were going to walk together i might as well know your name benito call me benny if you like okay benito benny sounded much too friendly look benito dont you want out of here i hit a nerve he stopped short his wide face a gamut of emotions unlike anything id even seen after a long time he said yes then come over the wall with me i cant you cant youll see he wouldnt say anything else just kept pace with me as i walked on and on and on and on and on the wall was a long way off i was right about the perspective wed been walking for over an hour as far as i could tell and the wall looked no closer we walked until we were exhausted and it was still a long way off i sat down in the mud to slap gnats didnt seem that far how high is that thing anyway must be colossal it is no more than three meters high dont be silly look behind you that was the shock of my life the river was now maybe three miles away instead of one and wed walked for hours but benito nodded we could walk for eternity and never reach the wall and we have eternity no you dont believe me very well convince yourself continue toward the wall continue until even you are certain it can never be reached and then i will tell you how you can escape it took me several hours but i finally believed him the wall was like light speed we could get arbitrarily close but we couldnt ever reach it like light speed or the bottom of a black hole but like nothing else in the universe i knew we werent going out this way and and just where were we chapter i sat in the dirt and slapped gnats while benito explained it again we are dead and in hell this is the vestibule to hell where those who would make no choices in life are condemned neither warm nor cold believers nor blasphemers you see them in the hills they chase a banner they will never catch i remembered then dantes inferno benito nodded his big square jaw heaving like a broaching whale you have read the inferno then good that was the first clue i had to the way out of here we must go down sure all the way something about a lake of ice and a hole in the center of it it had been a long time since i had read dante i couldnt see that remembering a thirteenthcentury book would do me any good to begin with this couldnt possibly be the real hell dantes cosmology had been ludicrous for one thing so where was i how come youre so sure this is the place dante described where else could it be all of the features are here all of the details and id been dead a long time centuries what kind of civilization would build an exact copy of dantes inferno an infernoland was it part of a larger amusement park like frontierland in the disneyland complex or was infernoland all there was to it who was benito a stooge or a revived corpsicle like me the wall how had they managed that trick the wall hadnt moved and i certainly had some kind of local field effect a time slip bent space come on carpentier you wrote the stuff whats the explanation not the way they did it just a plausible way first we must cross the river benito was saying do you believe me now when i tell you that you must not attempt to swim it or even i get wet from it or must you try that too what happens if i just dive in then you will be as you were in the bottle aware and unable to move but it will be very cold and very uncomfortable and you will be there for all eternity knowing you put yourself there i shuddered and slapped a gnat he might be lying i wasnt going to try it a looked very nice across the river and that was where we had to get before we could find dante alighieris escape hole in the center of infernoland the hell with getting to the center let me get to those villas over there and id be happy enough whos on the other side of the river virtuous pagans benito answered those who never knew the word of god but kept the commandments they are not persecuted their fate may be the most cruel of all those in this place because they arent tortured because they think they are happy youll find out let us go and see them how there is a ferryboat once it was a rowing boat but got overcrowded in hell too many arrivals sure and in disneyland id been on a mississippi riverboat big enough for fifty or sixty people to walk around on it chugged around on a little pond it shared with a miniature clipper ship the builders of infernoland had a sense of humors putting a ferryaboat in place of charons old rowboat maybe wed meet some of the paying customers on the ferry i didnt think benito was one he behaved more like a fanatical catholic and what was i nobody had given me any role to play who inhabits infernoland who inhabits the inferno damned souls could that be my job now to play damned soul for the amusement of tourists it wasnt a role i liked very much it took as long to leave the wall as it had to go toward it at least things were consistent there were laws to this place if only i could discover them when we passed the bottle that had been beside me when i woke up we turned left and angled toward the river an old drinking song from sciencefiction conventions kept running through my head if hosen and shoon thou never gavest men every night and all the fire will burn thee to the bare bone and christ receive thy soul was that really where i was in a real hell where justice was meted out to the ungodly scary it would mean that there was a real god and maybe jonah was swallowed by a whale in the mediterranean sea and joshua ben nun really did stop the earths rotation for trivial purposes there was something leaning against a rock at first i couldnt make it out a pink mound with hair trailing down one side we got closer and the mound became fivehundredodd pounds of woman sitting crosslegged in stinking mud a swarm of gnats hummed around her she didnt bother to swat them she looked up at us with lifeless eyes benito took my arm to hurry me on past her but i shook him off she couldnt be quite sane either but she might be able to tell me something straight it was more than he would do and i needed help i squatted down to look into her face she was pathetic hardly in shape to help anyone including herself far back within tunnels of fat were tiny sparks of life dull gray against black hopeless eyes almost lifeless her voice was a husky whisper well i dont know where i am i just got here and i have to know can you help me help you i died and then this happened to me died how else do you get into hell her voice rose to demand attention despite my shocked surprise the full force of her breath washed over in waves what did i do i dont deserve this i dont belong here at all she wailed i was beautiful i could eat like a horse and burn it off in an hour then i woke up here like this her voice dropped to a low confidential murmur were in the hands of infinite power and infinite sadism i shied back another one is there nothing you can do benito asked her sure i can chase banners to keep slim whats the point of that they wont let you do anything meaningful i shuddered it could have been me why would anyone do this to you i think it must have been because tenmillion fat people were cursing me her voice turned venomous fat fat fat people with no willpower and no selfrespect why for doing my job for trying to help people trying to save them from themselves for banning cyclamates thats why it was for their own good she ranted you cant trust people to be moderate about anything some people get sick on cyclamates they have to be helped and this is what i get for helping them were trying to escape want to come with us benito thinks we can get out by going down to the center of this crazy place a little spark of interest flared in her eyes and i held my breath my open mouth had sent me floating down the side of a building when would i learn to keep it closed if she came with us wed never get away what good was she she struggled to get up then collapsed against her rock no thank you right i started to say something else in parting but what if anything went at all right id never see her again i just walked away and she let her head slump back into the mounds of fat that bulged at her neck as we walked away benito asked what are cyclamates i slapped at a gnat the gnats were everywhere stinging us both but benito didnt bother to slap at them sugar substitute for people who want to lose weight he frowned if there is too much to eat surely it would be better to eat less and share with those who have none i looked at his big paunch and said nothing i too am in hell he reminded me ah and they can do what they did to her to you i shuddered we were lucky i take it you did not agree with her policy idiots if theyd fed as much sugar to the control rats as they gave cyclamates to the experimental group theyd have killed the controls first instead they doomed a lot of people to fat there wasnt a good substitute for cyclamate i know one guy who bought up cases and cases of a cyclamate diet drink just before the ban hit he used to give cases of vintage tab as christmas presents they were appreciated too benito said nothing i know a couple who used to drive up to canada every so often just to buy cyclamates it was a stupid policy i looked back over my shoulder at the shapeless pink mound still it seems a little extreme what they did to her it is not just how can you call that just i didnt say anything else but i remembered what shed said were in the hands of infinite power and infinite sadism and just who in hell was benito a paying customer having sport a damned soul like me or one of the paid crew of infernoland he talked like a religious fanatic he seemed to take everything at face value did i dare follow him but what else could i do one thing was certain if he could think that woman had been treated justly he was not much better than a devil himself hey carpentier would an artificial hell have artificial devils i looked at benito more closely he was partly bald there were no horns on his forehead we seemed to be covering a lot of ground as if the effect of too much distance to the wall had been played in reverse suddenly we were part of a crowd all streaming toward the river nobody was pushing them along but they didnt seem friendly and they didnt talk among themselves each one was huddled in toward himself not looking where he was going or she there were a lot of women the ferryboat captain had a long white beard and eyes like burning coals he screamed in rage when anyone was slow getting aboard we were pressed together on deck a mass of us so tightly packed that we couldnt move you again hed turned his burning eyes on benito youve come here before well you wont escape again he swung a long billyclub at benito it hit with a crack that i thought would break my guides skull but it only staggered him more people packed the decks until i couldnt even see finally i felt the boat begin to move by then id have been glad to stay behind but there was no way off the boat two voices whispered intensely near my ear why didnt you stop when i screamed because you startled me into taking my foot off the brake at least ill never have to listen to your backseat driving again but were in hell darling theyll probably put us in a car with no brakes maybe theyll give you a horn youll like that shut up shut up she did and quiet descended no crowd is that quiet it was as if nobody had anything to say to anyone we bumped solid ground all off charon shouted damned souls damned forever you cursed god and now youll pay for it damn god and everyone else piss on you up the people youre mucking bastards all of you get off my foot but i dont belong here whatd i do just tell me damn the lot of you i died a man we pushed and shoved and danced to keep our feet in the swarm at least we were on the other side the crowd was hurrying downhill along a road that ran between thick high walls i hung back hoping benito would go with the rest no such luck the road turned and twisted so we couldnt see what was ahead but that was good because after a while we were alone i tried to climb the wall it was a tough scramble and i kept falling back after the fourth time i sat there below the wall and whimpered would you like help benito asked sure i thought you said the only way out was downhill it is but we have time to explore try again i will lift you he practically threw me over the wall he didnt look that strong i sat on top for a second and looked down at him he seemed to be waiting for me to help him up and now what carpentier fairs fair he helped you yeah but why leave him behind hes trouble but he knows things i dont and he got me out of the bottle did he he says he poured you out of a bottle the size of a fifth of rum leave him i didnt get the chance to decide while i was thinking it over benito began climbing like an alpiner using tiny cracks and bumps i could hardly see pretty soon he got one hand on top of the wall and pulled himself up he wasnt breathing hard and he didnt say anything about my sitting there and watching instead of helping i turned to look at the countryside after all this infernoland seemed to be modeled on dantes a quarter of a century ago the inferno had been a required book for a course in comparative world literature id paid as little attention to the book as i could get away with i remembered almost nothing but certainly the place had not been pleasant gods own torture chamber very medieval vague images came back to me now devils with pitchforks trees that talked and bled giants and centaurs fire snakes but were those from the authentic inferno or were they hangovers from oz books and disney cartoons never mind carpender youre not going any further chapter it was lovely on the other side of the wall i jumped down onto firm ground grassy and pleasant the air was clean as at the top of a mountain with that fresh smell you get only after a hard backpack into remote country the gnats were gone we walked toward the villas lovely things squarebuilt the colors of stone by twilight there were crowds around us men and women and children a lot of children far too many all watching us with big round eyes adults and children alike were curious but none of them said anything they didnt want to be near us either they shrank away as we approached it was embarrassing i thought we must be carrying the smells of the vestibule area the fetid stench of roses and decay wed have to find a place to wash i think im going to like it here i said benito looked at me curiously but he only said pleasant isnt it here there is no punishment the word grated punishment implies authority someone with more power and a moral position superior to yours i couldnt accept that we were in the hands of the builders of infernoland and id learned all about their moral position on the other side of the black river but i didnt flare up at benito lightly i asked these then are the privileged customers of hell yes benito did not smile they never sinned they would have reached heaven if they had known the church and the children unbaptized id heard that about catholic beliefs even in infernoland it seemed a little rough on the kids i thought they got limbo call it limbo if you wish this is the first circle of hell he paused uncertain there are legends that say the children will be born again there were as many children here as there were adults as if the builders had gotten a discount for quantity hmmm could these creatures be androids it could have come down to a matter of economics android infants would be cheaper than android adults smaller fewer reflexes would it be cheaper to build androids than to find and capture human beings i couldnt know not without knowing the source who the builders were or why i was here placed here without my consent or knowledge by an unknown hand if me then why not a thousand others a billion benito wouldnt be much help he didnt seem to question anything he saw robot or human child or adult they didnt seem unhappy except those near us benito whats the matter with them they sense that we do not belong here i come from deeper in hell and the smell of the depths is on my soul but i dont his smile was grim they will not accept you either i wasnt so sure of that if i found a way to clean up and different clothing hmm knock someone on the head steal his toga why not well partly because theyd tear me apart if they caught me and partly because there was no privacy here the villas maybe or i pointed upslope toward what might have been a domed planetarium the nearest building in sight of us whats that he looked i have never seen it before come on he came but reluctantly we might not be permitted entry this is a public building but we are not of the appropriate public we i stopped because a whitebearded patriarch swathed in purplebordered white bedsheets had grasped me roughly by the arm he asked a rude question in gibberish go peddle your papers i informed him he frowned recent english i asked of you why you invade a place not meant for you im taking a survey are you happy here do the arrangements satisfy you he snorted no then asked benito why not leave there is a way out the bearded man looked him over while several passersby stopped to listen he said in what direction does it lie downslope one must travel all the way to the center to know evil is one path to knowing good it was lousy dialogue the bearded man thought so too i do not question your knowledge of the depths of hell he said pointedly i think you lie why would i we plan to leave hell benito was interrupted by raucous laughter a crowd was gathering and it wasnt friendly you can all leave benito seemed deadly serious come with me deeper and deeper into hell learn to hate evil hatred for salvation one of the oldsters asked a curious route to salvation benito seemed to know him yet epictatus that is what you must learn not to hate men but to hate their sins and that you cannot do moderately you know the truth now you know that reason alone is not enough you must ask for grace i slipped out during the sermon they were standing there politely waiting for him to finish what might have been a mob scene had become a formal debate how long would that last benito was pushing them in a direction they wouldnt even consider and they didnt like him at all theyd looked at me the same way candid contempt and the high bitter flavor of mockery they wanted out and they didnt believe there was any way out and they were damned well not going to listen long to a man they thought didnt belong with them benito was preaching hatred and they hated him he should have had more sense like me the dome it couldnt be a planetarium there was no sky here conceivably it was a bathhouse where i could wash off the stench and possibly find an unguarded toga i climbed toward it there were no guards i walked between doric pillars up black marble steps to an expanse of black marble floor half a dozen people were talking in a circle they seemed lost in distance but as far away as i was when they caught sight of me they turned their backs firmly and continued talking the language wasnt familiar at all the place was as empty as anything id seen since i left the area of the bottles six rude sons of bitches and a thing in the center of the black marble floor it might have been a sculpture it might have been a machine a thick silver ring twelve feet tall standing on edge and a control board at its base the console looked operational there were labels in english a switch a joystick and a notch with a knob in it the notch ran the whole length of the console i tried the joystick it went in all six directions left right forward back push down pull up when i used the switch the space within the ring clouded then became starry space it was a planetarium when i pushed on the joystick nothing happened i took a closer look at the markings along the notch they were logarithmic labeled in parsecs second the knob was all the way to the left i moved it hard right and tried the joystick again the universe came up and hit me in the face whoosh stars shot past and around me a sun came at me and exploded into a fraction of a second of intolerable brightness and was gone and i was flat on my back a couple of yards from the console that was some planetarium the halfadozen natives were watching me with some amusement screw em i went back to the console moved the knob down to one parsec second then to a tenth of that tried the joystick this time the motion was just obvious i steered toward a bluewhite star moved the knob to slow as i approached it moved into it the brightness should have burned my eyes out it wasnt even painful odd i went through the center of the star and came out the other side and into space what now find a planet a different star stars were easier to find in this sparkling emptiness but id love to dive into an earthlike world to search out the layers of it to see the glowing nickeliron heart lets see that nottoobrilliant white fleck could be a yellow dwarf i moved the knob a large hand fell heavily on my shoulder i twitched like a man electrocuted i turned and there was the mob scene i thought id left behind me fiftyodd large heavy men surrounding me and benito and the anywhere machine the whitebearded man who spoke english said you are leaving i said dammit why nobody else is using the damn machine ive waited all my life for something like this we do not want you here he said we waited because we hoped a messenger of the gods would come to remove you we might have asked him questions but we have tolerated you too long as for the machine one side of his mouth twitched upward if you can carry it you may take it with you i cursed him i stopped when his wideshouldered friends converged several of them wore armor they moved away in a tight circle with benito and me in the center i whispered benito cant you stop them he looked at me how yeah but if id known what waited below id have fought them chapter even while they marched us toward the wall benito never gave up you may leave this place he shouted hector aeneas you are not cowards to stay where it is pleasant when there is everything to gain elsewhere come with us they ignored him they were compact and tough inside their armor too tough to fight even if they were men which i doubted hector aeneas i knew the names i remembered the abe lincoln robot at disneyland could the armor be part of them with inspection plates where is vergil benito raved he is no longer here is he and the emperor trajan we had our chance said the taller broader one we didnt take it there will be no other have none come here since benito demanded the soldiers barked bitter laughter many is it reasonable to suppose that they will never have the opportunity to leave we had come to the wall well think about it one said now out with you go where you belong the gate slammed shut behind us i went for the wall on the other side i examined it without joy the footholds benito had used would better have fitted a spider benito watched with a wry smile you never give up do you no perseverance is commendable you will need it but you must develop other virtues such as prudence what will happen if you enter the first circle again maybe they wont catch us this time i wont go near anyone until ive changed clothes and taken a bath do not tempt the angels benito said he was quite serious yeah and why not i was expecting devils in infernoland why not angels that messenger they hoped to see they wanted him to come they did yes but we are fugitives allen there were no handholds this time benito wouldnt help i was still trying to climb the wall when a flash flood of people spilled into the far end of the alley as they foamed toward us in dreadful silence i made one last attempt to go up the wall then they swept us up and floated us away we were in a marble palace it was enormous without furniture the walls were covered with frescoes of bulls and dolphins and pretty girls wearing flounced skirts and little jackets that opened in front to show bare breasts the palace was lit with torches in bronze holders along the walls and there wasnt any sign of modern technology at all except for the palace itself it wound on and on chamber after chamber huge staircases with great pillars inscribed in languages i couldnt read it was too big it must have been prestressed concrete or something better i would have liked to stay and look around but we were embedded in the flow of the crowd nobody spoke or paid us any attention i was glad for benitos company crowds of strangers bug me and this one was worse than new york commuters everyone wrapped up in himself we spilled into an enormous room open at the far end i had a good view through the pillars the ground sloped sharply away into the bleakest landscape id ever seen the castle was perched on the side of an enormous bowl a worldsized bowl far down into it were the glimmers of fires and the shadow of smoke i couldnt see far into the smog that hung over everything there was a throne at the far end of the audience chamber an alien occupied it he was vaguely bovine but id have taken him for an oversized man if it hadnt been for his tail tail what is that i demanded minos judge of the dead said benito the builders had mixed some egyptian or cretan mythology with their christianity that or theyd had to warp their landscape to fit a genuine alien i could believe a cropping beast becoming an intelligent biped given time and impetus and perhaps an assist from biological engineers id written stories about that kind of thing could minos be one of the builders people went up to present themselves to the monster i couldnt hear what the girl in the yellow dress was telling it but it grinned and nodded abruptly its tail looped out and wrapped around and around the girl it lifted her the tail stretched like the limbs of plastic man in the old comic book the girl shot between two pillars and dwindled dwindled dwindled to a speck minoss tail must have been tens of miles long at that point it came snaking back through the air while the speck that was the girl sank like a single snowflake my willing suspension of disbelief went all to hell i started to giggle hysterically nobody noticed nobody but benito who watched curiously as i gathered the shreds of my selfcontrol took him by the arm pointed at minos and said he cant do that he was doing it again the tail stretched out between the pillars like an infinite length of snake dropped a man in a postmans uniform into the murky air and came coiling back but there wasnt room even ignoring the moment arm that much weight at the end of that much length should have toppled him and how could such a length of tail flexible tail be strong enough to stay almost straight but ignore that and tell me where there was room for tens of miles of tail coiled inside his body his feet werent anchored i watched until i saw them both move the tail wasnt stored in the floor then are you all right benito asked my vision was graying out my whole body had a buzzing footsasleep feeling i said im going to faint you cant faint here hold fast his hand gripped my shoulder a darkhaired woman quite pretty was encoiled in the tail until she nearly vanished lifted and sent spinning off down the bowl a man in a cabbies uniform was next three loops of tail and out he went into space and another and another there were thousands here wed starve before we reached our turn but i didnt feel hungry and hadnt felt hungry since i left the bottle and that was hours ago also something was wrong with time minos was in no hurry quite the opposite he took plenty of time to deal with each case and there were plenty of cases yet the crowd thinned out much faster than it should have where were they going i never saw anyone leave the room but there had to be other audience chambers people slipping off into side passages there must have been hundreds perhaps thousands of copies of minos ridiculous mummery but the tail carpentier hidden in hyperspace or snaking out of an alternate time track if the builders have that kind of technology how long were you dead ten thousand years a million it was our turn we approached together not many had come up in pairs sodomites huh minos said seventh circle third level or have you got something worse to confess i said i refuse to answer on grounds that my he looked a lot like an angry bull when he frowned and nothing at all like a machine he turned to benito youve been here before why have you left your proper place is that your affair you see i roam freely through hell yes how it has been willed that i may do so you have no right to interfere minos waved at me and this one he has come from the vestibule benito said you will note that he comes of his own accord you may not judge him lawyers minos laughed i have problems with lawyers there are so many places appropriate to that breed where are you two going then down back to the first circle wed spoken simultaneously minos laughed back you will not go are you sure you dont want me to judge you allen carpenter my judgment is just and fair you could choose worse for yourself than justice cease benito commanded i jumped he was a changed man power seemed to gather around him as he struck a pose massive chin jutting out in defiance his face both calm and stern once upon a time he had been used to obedience i am permitted to judge suddenly minos sounded petulant you have already judged me what other power have you and this man is not under your jurisdiction leave us alone to go in peace not back up no down minos laughed he waved toward the steps leading down into the bowl from his throne depart thou art sent he was still laughing as we started down those steps the mocking laughter in our ears until we lost sight of the palace chapter we were all right as long as the steps continued unfortunately they soon trailed away into a broken slope that still dropped at fortyfive degrees or so at the same time a wind began to rise benito and i turned to face the slope and backed down on toes and knees and hands in fact the hurricane in my head was nothing compared to the hurricane we were backing into we moved flat against the slope clutching at the rock and digging into the dirt for footholds benito yelled minos called you carpenter not carpentier id been wondering how the monster knew i was born carpenter i shouted down at benito i added the i to make the name more interesting easier to remember i wrote under carpentier and when i talked to myself it was carpentier i talked to id started that in an effort to memorize the new pronunciation wed backed onto a broad ledge i stayed flat as i looked around someone was dancing to the music of the howling wind he was bones and paunch and long flying hair just graying unevenly at the temples he jumped and danced and flapped his arms like a bird grim determination on his homely face i hollered into the wind hey friend he didnt wait for the question if i could just get off the ground he wailed the guy in the helmets got a dozen hey yeah id been right the first time it was a futuristic loony bin geared for psychodrama on the grand scale let them work out their delusions here and maybe theyd be fit for whatever unimaginable society theyd flunked out of and i had answers to all the questions in that wonderful moment before i followed his eyes upward the air was full of flying people they werent exactly guiding their flight the wind had them here it churned them in a momentary funnel then flung them outward there they came in a straight blast it hit a shoulder of the mountain and churned the trapped beings into eddy currents the people flew like kleenex in a hurricane but they looked like people and they howled like paookakansans caught outside in a flash tornado most of them were flying in manandwoman pairs but yeah there was one guy surrounded by a good dozen girls all in a whirling clump at the top of a rising air column the bony guy on the ledge ran off flapping his arms there were others along the base men and women all trying to fly i had different ideas i gripped the rock hard and stayed flat the carnal benito screamed into the wind those who warped all that mattered in their lives for lust i imagine those at the base of the cliff were unsuccessful lovers we will be in less danger on the next ledge he started crawling benito thats it i cried well fly out of herel he turned in astonishment it was a mistake the wind slipped under his raised shoulders and lifted him and flung him at me i got him by the ankle he nearly tore me loose but i had a handhold in a split rock and i hung on he doubled on his own length and pulled himself down my forearm until he was flat to the ground again thank you he bellowed sokay i wish you could have seen your expression i was rather pleased with myself as if id managed to catch a glass somebodys elbow had knocked off a table good reflexes carpentier well fly out of here i screamed happily into his ear well fly over the wall well build a glider i was stubborn too once perhaps i still am is this really your wish allen damn right well build a glider listen if were light enough to be blown away by the first wind we probably wont need much more than a big kite hey lets get out of this wind and talk it over we crawled the weather changed as we lost altitude it didnt get any better the wind died down we didnt need to clutch at the rocks and we could hear ourselves speak but a freezing drizzle started now that i was thinking glider the loss in altitude bothered me we need a place to build it i said out of the wind we need fabric a lot of fabric and we need wood we probably need tools benito nodded there is a place a great swamp the styx trees grow there as for the fabric and the tools we can cross the styx and get them from the wall how many walls have you got here benito smiled grimly none like this one ahead redhot iron i believed him nothing subtle about infernoland how far down is it were losing altitude with every step a good distance yet benito laughed a glider you may be the first ever to think of that if we can launch from the hill above styx we can use the thermal updraft above the redhot walls ecch he said about the time i stepped backward into freezing slush wed reached another level region i stood up and looked around freezing muck in all directions human beings lay full length in it like halfimmersed logs the rain was turning to sleet cold garbage washed against my ankles behold the lowrent district i said i got a chuckle from benito not yet he said and if i hadnt had the shivers before i got them then he swept his arm about him and said the gluttonous i dont want to know come on lets get through this we waded out into it in the darkness and halfblinded by sleet i managed not to step on any halfburied victims some raised their heads to watch us pass showing us uniform looks of weary despair then sank back after we were gone men and women in about equal numbers they ranged from pleasantly plump to chubby to gross three or four were as bad as the woman in the vestibule i wondered if theyd be pleased to know about her and once i wiped frozen slush from my eyes cursing imaginatively under my breath and when i dropped my hand he was staring at me a longhaired blond man built like an olympic athlete allen carpentier he said sadly so they got you too i looked close and recognized him petri jan petri what are you doing here youre no glutton im the least gluttonous man who ever lived he said bitterly while all of these creeps were swilling down anything that came near their mouths from pig meat to garden snails and you too for that matter allen i was taking care of myself natural foods organic vegetables no meat no chemicals i didnt drink i didnt smoke i didnt he caught himself up i didnt hire you as my lawyer why am i bending your ear youre here too you were one of the pigs werent you yeah he meant the prestigious international gourmand society whose purpose in life was to go out and eat together id joined because i like the company but im not staying this isnt my spot he wiped slush from his face to see me better so where are you going out of this place come along hed be unpleasant company till we got him a bath but i knew he wouldnt slow us down there never was a health nut to match petri he used to run ten miles a day i figured hed be a lot of help building the glider how do you get out of hell so theyd convinced him too we go downhill for a while then well he was shaking his head dont go down ive heard about some of the places downhill redhot coffins and devils and you name it were not going very far were going to build a glider and go over the walls yeah and then where he seemed to think it was funny youll just get yourself in more trouble and for what youre better off if you just take what they give you no matter how unfair it is unfair benito asked petris head snapped around hell yes unfair im no glutton benito shook his head very sadly gluttony is too much attention to things of the earth especially in the matter of diet it is the obsession that matters not the quantity petri stared a moment wearily he said bug off and sank back into the freezing muck as we left him i could hear him muttering to himself at least im not fat like those animals i take care of myself i was annoyed with benito you didnt have to insult him we could use his muscles hey benito heard the panic in my voice yes i was at petris funeral all that attention to his health and then be got caught in the watts riots but they damn sure didnt freeze him they cremated hini freeze him i didnt bother to explain theyd cremated petri burned him to ash and gasses how could he have been revived how could the builders of this infernoland even have found specs for a robot analogue or a cell for cloning or anything cremated is as dead as you can get do the builders have a time camera physical principles unknown but to recreate petri they have to be able to photograph the past so we give them that and the spacewarping fields and the genetic engineering that created minos and freed carpentier from the need to eat or drink or sleep and the weather control and the reduced mass of people in the winds and the engineering technology that built infernoland itself carpentier if theyre that powerful do you really want to fight them of course not i only want out youre very thoughtful said benito watch your step i stopped at the brink of a precipice then i followed benito down a wandering dangerous trail it switchbacked along the face of the cliff and in many places it would have been easy to go over the edge that scared me a lot after all id done it before at least we were going down on our feet and the sleet had stopped things were definitely looking up still there were funny noises from the gloomy area below sounds my mind registered as construction work crash a long pause in which voices screamed orders too distant to make out crash chapter the trail led out onto a flat plain of hard baked clay as we reached the bottom benito stopped me silently with an arm held straight out across my chest i was willing i had heard the rumble and the shouting coming toward us it rolled past us at a good clip a boulder four or five yards across nearly spherical bounding across the cracked adobe surrounded by a shouting mob they were urging it along running alongside and butting the mass with their heads and shoulders a mob of men and women dressed in the finest rags id ever seen there were the remains of evening gowns and slashed velvet restoration clothing academic robes and gernreich original creations all torn and filthy the leader wore striped trousers and swallowtail coat and a ring that would have choked a hippopotamus this time he screamed at the top of his voice this time well get them we can pass now benito said calmly what was that all about crack i looked to my left two nearly identical masses of paleblue translucent stone stood rocking back and forth eighty or ninety humans in decaying opulence lay about the rocks as if theyd been flung in handfuls a few started to get up the leader shook his fist and screamed hoarders misers next time come on men we need a bigger lead time more got up shaking their heads dazedly and two groups attacked the two huge stones and began painfully rolling them in opposite directions the other outfit the one furthest away was dressed differently also in rags but these had never been much to start with hoarders and wasters said benito natural enemies they will try to crash each other with those rocks for all eternity benito id swear those rocks yes skip it im getting so ill believe anything we started across the plain a couple of hundred yards ahead of us was a hedgerow of some kind and sounds filtered through it the misers were rolling their rock back that way getting good distance for another run we followed until they reached the hedges and stopped then they turned to pushing it the other way a primlooking bearded man in the remains of a dark suit from the s shouted toward the other mob you threw away the good in your lives now pay i couldnt stand it any longer i grabbed a wildeyed matron by the shoulder she struggled to get away let me go we have to crush those wasteful ever manage to do it no think you will this time we might yeah sure i saidwhat would happen if you stopped rolling the rock and took a break sha studied my face for signs of idiocy theyd cream us suppose you both stopped she pulled away from me and ran to put her shoulder to the boulder the mob heaved it over a bump she shouted back to me we couldnt trust them even if we could we cant stop minos might might take it away i guessed i thought i knew that color several of them glanced at me suspiciously a couple of the men left the rock to advance on me hey hold on i couldnt steal it by myself i dont want to they relaxed one a man wearing the remains of a peasant smock said many of us hae been here for unco time yon queen artemesia says when first she came there were still facets upont it must hae been a bonny sight he sighed wistfully it must hae been yeah hey carpentier how long would it take to wear all the corners off a twelvefoot diamond i turned back toward benito he was talking to someone on the ground it was a man with both legs crushed the rock must have rolled over him he was still in shock because he wasnt screaming in pain but he would be blood seeped from the jellied mess that had been his legs for pitys sake he said pull me out of the way maybe they wont get me a few times and then ill be able to keep away from them hed had it mind gone with his body it was just as well we ought to be taking him to a hospital but why bother hed had it we are leaving hell benito said first we go down oh no i know what they do to you down there just move me just a little please i wondered where to put him the ledge was hard and flat baked adobe with no cover between the cliff and the hedgerow but we couldnt leave him out here i took him under the arms and dragged him over against the cliff to die in peace i thank you he whispered whats your name allen carpentier he seemed to brighten i had all your books hey did you suddenly i liked this man too bad i dont have my collection i could get your autograph on them i had all of everyones books did you ever hear of my collection allister toomey sure id known many book collectors and theyd all heard of allister toomey to their rage and sorrow toomey had spent a considerable inheritance on books all kinds of books from double fouredges to first editions to pulps and comic books that were just getting to be worth owning much of what he had owned had been unique irreplaceable hed kept them all in a huge barn hed managed to hang onto somehow hed spent everything else on books there was no money left to take care of them they moldered in that barn rats and insects got into them rain dripped through the roof if hed sold a few of them hed have been able to take care of the rest id known a lot of collectors and they all had a tendency to brood over allister toomey i guess i dont have to ask why youre here no i was both a hoarder and a waster i lay between both groups i suppose its fair enough i wish id taken one or another of those offers but what could i sell i nodded and turned away he continued talking to himself now not the complete analog collection not the alice in wonderland it was autographed autographed goodbye allister toomey whod died twice now i waited with benito until the mob swarmed past with their bouncing boulder then we ran across crack we found a hole in the hedgerow and scrambled through there was only a narrow ledge beyond the hedgerow then a cliff thick mists hid the bottom but it was a long way down there didnt look to be any way over it we walked along for miles there were other groups behind the hedgerow all shouting and screaming in various languages then the sounds changed machinery rivet guns hammers ringing the sounds of workmen and their tools tools wed need tools for the glider i began to run ahead a tremendous chunk of the ledge had collapsed and the chasm ran right across from the cliff on the downhill side to the base of the cliff towering above a stream ran through it and it had cut the gorge even deeper far below we could see people working frantically on a dam another group was just as frantically tearing it down at our own level there was a similar contest one group was trying to build a bridge across the gorge and another worked to disassemble it fifty yards in either direction were more bridge builders and destroyers it seemed like a lot of wasted effort i looked to benito but he only shrugged i have never been to this part before i do not think dante came here either the group just in front of us were steelworkers slapping together i beams girders plates anything they could manage fastening it with hot rivets and hammers a small forge blazed away to heat rivets i looked at all the work without comprehension until i saw barbara hannover suddenly it came to me id known barbara a long time she wasnt cruel and she didnt hate people but she loved wildlife more whatever anyone proposed a new bridge a new freeway housing development mine power plant oil well or wheatfield she had a million reasons why you couldnt do it i honestly think shed have let all the kansas wheatfields go back to prairie and buffalo if she could have thought of a way to manage it add to her fanatic streak a harvard law school degree and one of the sharpest brains in the country and it was easy to see why lovers of progress shuddered when she took an interest in what they were doing and naturally she was tearing the bridge down i had an idea and looked closer at the construction workers if barbara was in this part of infernoland pete couldnt be far away and there he was bucking rivets pete and barbara had been married for a while a short while just as she couldnt see a housing tract without wanting eviction writs and bulldozers he couldnt see a nice place on the trail without wanting to improve it with a log cabin id gone hiking with him once the whole fifty miles was one long development plan with ideas for improving the trail building hostels constructing artificial beaver dams putting in handrails where the climb was steep i almost killed him before we got back to the car it makes sense i told benito artistically the way anything else down here makes sense pete and barbara were both fanatics neither of them had noticed me i couldnt see how steelworkbig tools would help anyway but upstream was a wooden trestle bridge with a group just finishing it while another group tried to get at it with saws i looked at the saws and lusted with a saw and nothing else we could build a glider other things would be useful but they were easier to make than a saw would be i had to have one the funny thing was that they used each others tools one guy would be hammering away to put a beam in place and another would be sawing it in half and while they screamed insults at each other they did nothing else the rules in infernoland were more complicated than id have thought or the robots were programmed funny but that sure looked like pete and barbara i waited until a progressive type laid down his saw then started for it too late a thinfaced woman grabbed it and had at the trestlepiece hed been trimming to fit the next time i was quicker when she set the saw aside for an ax i grabbed it there was a drill bit on the ground next to it just a twisted chunk of steel more valuable than its equivalent in diamonds and i got that too youd have thought they were diamonds madam hawkface started for me with the ax and her builder companion was right behind he didnt need an ax he could have made three of me run i shouted benito heard we dashed for the trail leading down into the gorge it was narrow and twisted but it looked safer than what we were leaving id done one thing id got those two crews to cooperate for the first time since infernoland was opened to the public unfortunately what they wanted to cooperate on was tearing me to pieces the trail turned a corner then swooped down the cliff we followed it chapter there was a ledge ten feet below the lip of the cliff and we stopped for a moment to catch our breaths i thought i felt the cliff tremble and asked benito about it it is not any place to stay he warned allen you will find that there is no safe place in hell wherever you stop well you wont like it i can believe that the thing to do was get out of here and the more i thought about it the better the glider looked now i had a saw that i could use to cut frames and ribs and stringers if i could find anything to cut i still wondered what wed use for fabric but some where there had to be a storehouse for the costumes the gowns benito and i wore would do it was a closewoven fabric very tough and it shed most of the dirt and muck wed crawled through i lifted the hem and tested the weave by blowing through it it didnt let much through it would do fine the ledge heaved again i wondered if this were something for our benefit then laughed at myself earthquakes on call the builders were powerful but that powerful we scrambled along the ledge until we were stopped by a waterfall pouring out in front of us the water was black and dirty and it stank like a sewer outfall but the water rushed downward and it had carved a bed in the cliffside there were handholds in the sides of the notch the stream had carved how long would it take a stream to carve that it would depend on what the rock was made of and of course the builders could have carved the notch themselves though it looked natural enough after a while we reached the bottom of the cliff the ground fell away at a steep angle we found a path down it along the stinking stream twisting and turning along lower and lower with steep cliff edges in places it would be an ideal place to launch a glider if we could get one up the slope drag it up here and over to one of the dropoffs and push yeah it looked better all the time but first we had to build the glider and what was i going to build it out of i wanted to see those trees i clutched the saw closer to me benito was staring at me i stared back forgive me he said you hold that tool in a way i have seen before yeah by monks riddled with selfdoubt and clutching a crucifix to reassure themselves their religion is true well need this well need other things too wood and rope for the glider will that do he pointed downward we were almost at the bottom now we faced a stinking swamp thick fog hid most of it with only temporary glimpses through things thrashed around in the filthy water but there were also bushes and trees hung with vines wood vines certainly i could build a glider out of those now all we need is fabric there must be a supply dump in this place or a laundry something benito sighed there is great can we get a lot of those gowns it will not be easy easy i laughed who cares as long as we get out of here benitos determined look was very like a bulldogs very well i will help you get what you need i will help you build your glider i will help you fly it in whatever direction you choose in return you will promise me that if this mad scheme fails you will come with me to the real exit yeah sure sure i wasnt really listening i was too interested in the swamp below us the things bubbling around in there were people some of them just lay there half submerged bubbling out filth and talking nonsense others fought each other for what i couldnt make out they roiled the stinking waters washing up slimy things thick fog hung all around and i had only glimpses of anything more than a few feet away this way benito waded out into the slop he seemed to know what he was doing because it wasnt very deep just to our ankles the goop squished inside my sandals slimy and thoroughly unpleasant every now and again there was solid ground a few inches above the muck we picked our way through lowhanging trees and bushes i fingered the wood and tried my saw on one of the trees to cut off a branch it seemed strong enough and quite springy i hacked off a chunk of vine and it was too tough to break we could we really could build a glider as we got deeper into the swamp there were fewer people but i could hear curses in every language id ever imagined people screaming at each other and the sounds of blows sometimes a filthy shape would try to climb up onto the ground where we walked but others would grab it and pull it back into the mire i shuddered why did they do that the wrathful benito said and the sullen the worst offenders in upper hell he was about to say something else but he ran into something lying on the trail and almost fell it was a man filthy with the muck lying in fetal position his eyes were open and staring at us he glared not at us but at the universe in general hello i said come with us benito added there is a way he didnt sound hopeful and of course there wasnt any response remember there is a way downward accepting everything come on hes catatonic it bothered me benito preaching to a rubberdoll catatonic was my loonybin theory right after all psychodrama on the grand scale then why was i here and jan petri and pete and barbara it was as if the builders had revived everyone who had ever lived then set out to cure the crazy ones did they think i was one of those there was another one on the trail and he wasnt catatonic at all he stood there glaring at us while others thrashed in the muck at either side of him to get past wed have to wade out into that and from the ripples we would not only be over our heads but among the fighters theyd never let us out excuse us benito said pleasantly the trail is wide enough for us to pass if you will step forward two paces bugger off surely you will not stand in our way benito was still very pleasant but there was an edge to his voice took me a hundred years to get up here the figure said you never have been in the muck if its good enough for me its good enough for you he was a big min with powerful arms and he seemed to mean it stand aside benito said he was giving orders now you may come with us if you will and if you can which i doubt but you will not prevent us from going benitos voice still had the ring of authority that had cowed minos and it shook the guy momentarily dont i know you he said he stared at benito im sure i know you well whoever the hell you are get past me the same way i got up here friend you leave us no choice benito said aha i do know you youre ben hey let go hey benito grasped him by the shoulders and lifted him as easily as i would a child i gaped as benito flung him out into the marsh he wasnt even breathing hard come allen yeah sure i followed numbly wondering who benito really was a professional wrestler circus strong man what hed done wasnt impossible id seen it done before but not often and benito didnt look that strong chapter eventually we got through the trees and brush to open water there was a big black tower at the edge i couldnt see anyone in the tower but suddenly there was a light in the top window it flashed rubyred out across the marsh red ruby a laser not magic just a laser signal from an old stone tower far out in the murk over the water there was a flash of light blinking the same color as the signal phlegyas will come for us now benito said you must be careful say nothing you dont have to say and as little of that as possible let me handle him sure why because we are fugitives and we are approaching the ah administrative centers of hell there are demons here guards they can do terrible things to us cant they just id seen enough atrocities already were the builders the crazy ones they seemed to like pain from somewhere behind us there were screams of rage and agony and splashing noises i thought i saw ripples in the open water ahead of us too then something took shape in the gloom ahead something moving toward us it was a boat a big man bearded with a low gold crown on his head stood in the stern with an oar in a sternlock he sculled slowly but that boat moved i almost laughed he certainly wasnt putting out enough effort to get that kind of speed the boat must have a hidden water jet or something i have you again the man crackled ah benito caught again good work he looked at me closely and his grin faded who are you i didnt answer were you sentenced to lower hell phlegyas mind your own business benito said bring the boat to the shore i do not care to wade in your filthy swamp dont like cold eh phlegyas seemed to find that funny well you wont have cold feet long where youre going get in benito get in the other one has to stay here of course i have orders concerning you but not him he looked at me again you dont have a pass from minos no papers you cant come he will come benito said this has been willed where what is willed must be now bring the boat to shore phlegyas shrugged all right all right you have the formula his voice was a nasty whine of complaint its sure been hell here since dante published that book youd be surprised how many try that on me nothing i can do about it either we scrambled onto the boat and sat gingerly i noticed that the boat didnt sink deeper by an inch didnt we weigh anything in that case we could walk on the swamp but that was silly because the swamp rippled and bubbled with people and wed sunk to the ankles in the muck i could smell the stink on my feet every now and then a nose would appear above the water as someone caught a breath then vanished again how many were there in that swamp i could hear screams of rage and agony and pain and cursing in all languages but i couldnt see any details in the halflight and the fog phlegyas sculled rapidly and the boat shot away from the bank the fog enclosed us in a circle of dark water rippled with shouting faces and with the chicken guts and other filth that poured down from the land of the hoarders and the wasters sometimes a filthy claw would reach from the water to clutch at the gunwales and then phlegyas would smash it with a sixfoot pole he kept in a socket ready to hand he sculled easily with one hand you know that formula doesnt work with the real supervisors he said he reached to straighten his crown and gave us a sour look they took the power of decision away from me i made a couple of mistakes just a couple of lousy mistakes and now they think they can do better than me over two thousand years of service here and upstarts have more power than me it isnt fair you know bastards stupid bastards but they wont let you in without a pass you watch and see old man be silent benito said humph phlegyas sculled more rapidly the boat shot through the water now i could make out dim glowing red the fog began to lift and we could feel the heat there were walls ahead of us they had towers and some of them were cherry red the radiated heat was already uncomfortable a low wide mudbank stretched out from the walls to the swamp and i could see a landing dead ahead at the end of a narrow bay we headed toward it a man came out through a doorway in the wall he was old and bent and he hobbled he carried a box about a yard square and an inch deep he shuffied to the waters edge and used a shovel to fill his box with mud then he turned and ran his robe flying out behind him as he darted back into the door hed come so slowly out of it didnt make sense i turned to benito but he only shrugged he didnt know either we passed the entrance to the bay you may let us out at this landing benito said nope phlegyas continued to scull it would be more convenient yep then why dont you do it i demanded because i dont have to phlegyas answered he continued to scull until we reached another landing regulations say ferry terminal to ferry terminal and thats where i go nothing about stops in himuralibimas bay benito frowned but we didnt say anything the boat reached the dock area there was no one to meet us and i wasnt sorry off off phlegyas shouted theres more coming no rest for an old man none at all off off he reached for his cudgel and we scrambled ashore before he could smash us with it as soon as we were off he was sculling away headed for the other shore like a motorboat the city was maybe a quartermile away across hard stinking mud the walls were hot although not as hot here as further away a mile to our left was a tower that glowed cherry red thermals thered be thermals here if a glider could get across the swamp it would take luck and wed have to drag it pretty high up that cliff to make it but it could be done be very careful benito said i will have to deceive the officials do not undeceive them you mean youre gonna lie oh benito thats sinful you could go to hell for telling lies he took it seriously i know it is one reason i am here um but this is in a good cause i thought my deceits were in a good cause he shrugged the commandment is against false witness and by extension against malicious deceit and fraud and perversions of honesty and honor we shall not do that and as you say it is in a good cause or so i hope we tread dangerous ground allen come on i said i started off toward the door i could see ahead of us fat chance id ever make that joke with him again it was getting warmer all the time off to our left near the blazinghot tower were the remains of a big gate torn off its hinges things walked guard duty in front of it they were just far enough away and there was just enough fog and steam that i couldnt see them clearly but the shapes seemed odd twisted out of true i didnt want to ask about them we came to a dutchtype door open at the top and with a counter on the lower half heat poured out through the opening a boredlooking man in a high stiff collar something out of a dickens novel was inside in a little office his face was narrow and pinched and the heat couldnt have improved his disposition he had a desk like a woodcut from the scrooge story a tall thing he stood at there wasnt a chair or a stool in the room we waited at the counter and waited and waited getting warmer and warmer while the clerk fussed with papers on his desk he seemed to be reading every line on an enormous form a dozen pages thick every now and then he used a red pencil to mark something when he continued to turn the pages and scrawl notes without even looking at us i pounded on the counter are we invisible i demanded a moment sir just a moment please were very shorthanded here sir youll have to wait sir he made each sir a curse you would be well advised to attend us benitos voice had that edge to it a note of warning the clerk looked around uneasily he obviously didnt recognize either of us hardly surprising your papers please we have none benito answered oh my oh my one of those days the clerk muttered well if you havent any papers you cant come in the rules are very strict youll have to go back for papers he turned back to his desk and started looking over the files on it we have an errand inside benito said you do not help your record by delaying us the clerk looked back nervously he examined us closely again noting the slime on our gowns and the stench of our sandals that seemed to cheer him what is your station inside he asked no fixed post benito answered i cant help you sir im only recordkeeper for the sixth circle next window please he turned back to his desk we waited benito whistled something monotonous finally the clerk turned back you still here sir i told you next window please it is to the sixth circle that we must go now why didnt you tell me the clerk complained very well he reached into a cabinet and produced what looked like manuscript books and short stubs of pencil if you dont have the proper papers youll have to fill out these forms they were twenty pages long covered with small blanks and there were nine copies not only wasnt there any carbon paper but the blanks were arranged differently on each copy although they all asked for the same information i think we will not bother benito said i flared up what the hell do you want all this for greatgrandmothers blood type why should i fill this out you have to the clerk was getting more and more irritated you can see theyre all blank you can see they have to be filled out right at the top see it says replacement for lost papers application for dty to be submitted in nine copies i cant do anything for you without that information arent there exceptions of course there are exceptions sir one was made over two thousand years ago before my time but they still talk about it he shuddered but you are obviously not him is either of you a living man can either of you summon angels those are in the book too he glanced at a shelf of looseleaf folios above his desk volume sixtyone page eight ninetyfour paragraph seventyseven point eightytwo im glad we changed to the decimal system but most of us didnt like it it says very plainly anyone who can summon angels may pass but if youre applying under that ruling youll have to go to the main gate dont prove you can do it just go to the main gate and theyll take care of you but you will not let us pass benito said not even if i tell you that if you do not you will be in grave trouble i know my duty you will not come through very good you have done well benito said if you had let us in we would have reported it now you have a favorable report coming who is your supervisor the clerk stared at benito mrs playfair formerly a postmistress but oh my said benito i wont be able to help you after all it would do no good to give the report to her the clerk was unsettled why not sir the sir wasnt a curse any longer i am not permitted to say ah you mean he gulped whatever he imagined was going to happen to mrs playfair worried him excessively but what will happen to her people what will become of me benito looked crestfallen you know the rules but ive done everything properly my files are in perfect order oh dear oh dear i told her she shouldnt have let that man in the records room i told her he wasnt properly credentialed i told her it was all her fault i told her my files are in perfect order and they wont even look at them theyll just he was actually wringing his hands as he looked around his office at his desk and files benito frowned it would be a waste to have you in the boiling pitch in the pitch the clerk screamed are you certain your files are in perfect order benito demanded of course they are here you can see for yourself he did something that opened the gate benito and i crowded in benito took down a volume of the rule book and leafed through it keep this up to date do you all revisions in place as they come in where are your unfiled revision sheets there are none the clerk said primly hmm benito lifted the forms on the clerks desk this is not in order he leafed through quickly but i hadnt checked the seventh copy yet the clerk moaned i was doing that when you interrupted me you cant report me for that i was trying to give you service and benito handed the forms back the clerk looked through and extracted a bulky set there was pencil all over the first six pages then the writing medium changed to something darker benito looked at it curiously this is hardly legible he used up his pencil the clerk said volume four page ninetyeight paragraph six states that no applicant can have more than one pencil so i made him fill it out with something else he used blood his own i asked where else would he get blood the clerk turned to benito who is this man in my custody witness not your case dont worry about it he handed back the forms this seems to be in order thank you there was relief all over the clerks face one item was very difficult to read you should be more careful next time yes sir certainly sir are you finished with it benito nodded the clerk took the form copy seven of nine copies and tossed it into a wastebasket in the corner it burst into flames i stared a man had used his own blood to fill that out i glanced at the forms the clerk had handed us sure enough at the top of copy seven it said destroy copy eight went to applicant and copy nine was to be routed to the statistical section what will be the charges against mrs playfair the clerk asked his voice low and confidential benito frowned i understand there are shortages in uniforms and supply but we dont have anything to do with that precisely benito said knowingly comprehension dawned on the clerks face he nodded were going to check that now benito said keep up the good work uh macmurdo vincent macmurdo youll remember certainly benito opened the inner door and held it for me i went through trying not to hurry chapter benito followed and closed the door behind him i slumped against the wall convulsed by silent laughter i jumped away fast the wall was burning hot i smelled scorched cloth another second and id have had a bad burn we were in a corridor that stretched to infinity in both directions it was about ten feet high and wide and there were doors at intervals along it people hurried in both directions paying us no attention and there were all kinds of people men and women in flowing robes in us post office uniforms in colonial costumes in the high collars the dickensian clerk had worn military uniforms chinese mandarin robes modem business suits coveralls with insignia of planets and stars and sunbursts a whirl of scurrying humanity shoving past us as if we werent there nobody was going to notice us for our funny clothing the old man wed seen outside rushed past us almost running he carried a box of fresh mud and poked at it with a stick as he ran we watched as he turned through a door and out of sight someone had stopped beside us and was laughing he wore a roman toga do you speak english i asked certainly he was still laughing who was that i asked the laughter stopped and the man glared he was carrying some kind of wood plank with wax on it there were letters cut in the wax you are new here he demanded from another division benito said quickly he lowered his voice special assignment the roman drew away from us surely you have no interest in himuralibima he is our most honored civil servant benito gave a knowing look i still had a blank stare hammurabis secretary you know invented recordkeeping ah i said hammurabi oh all right hes hammurabis secretary and i am napoleon bonaparte youd think after all these years theyd let him slow down a little but he cant the roman protested theyve offered him retirement but he has to fill out the proper forms and in his case of course theyre in cuneiform and you have noticed how hot it is in here i couldnt stand it i tipped my head back and roared with laughter it rolled out gales of laughter choking me as i thought of that first bureaucrat trying to complete his retirement papers before the mud dried from the heat himuralibimas bay benito merely nodded fitting i am certain you have work signor uh of course the roman said your pardon he pushed past us and walked briskly down the corridor our clerk came out of his office the roman stopped and they talked in whispers allen must you ask unnecessary questions benito demanded im a writer of course i ask questions please do not not in here for the moment we are safe they think he motioned with his eyes i turned my eyes only the roman had stopped someone else and was whispering to him the man hed stopped a young man in s us army uniform nodded pretty soon he stopped someone and both looked clandestinely at us they stopped others theyre telling stories about us i said yes let us hope they are telling the proper ones now we must find the supply center wherever we went we were preceded and followed by whispers people got out of our way too if we wanted to go through a door if we even looked like we wanted to go through a door there was a scramble to hold it open for us they sure are scared of you i said they know who you are which was more than i did i think few of them have seen or heard of me benito answered oh really you know your way around here no i know my way around bureaucracies this one is no different from any other you were a bureaucrat once he hesitated i suppose you might say so exactly what an anguished voice drowned me out we were passing an open door and a womans voice screamed in rage and pain but that form is twentyseven pages long all that for one tool i looked in caught a familiar hawklike proffle turned back and kept walking dont look now i said out of the corner of my mouth the other voice followed us you should keep better track of your handsaw the rules are very clear at the next door there was a long line of naked people fat men pretty girls ugly women studs every form and variety of mankind the reception desk at a streakers convention they were trying to get to a counter where some fat guy handed them clothing while two beanpole women took information down on more forms what was this the supply center for infernoland were these employees or spectators or or what we got in line the only ones with clothing who did a thin guy in a medieval bachelor gown came in went behind the counter and whispered to the supply clerk the clerk summoned his two old biddies and they whispered together finally one of the women came out from behind the counter she wore a coverall of a kind i didnt recognize dark blue with strange insignia what may we do for you she asked she was trying to be pleasant and it was obvious that shed never learned how this man was given the wrong clothing benito said he is wearing the same thing i am in our section we do not give a junior courier the uniform of a supervisor she frowned benito didnt look like he was dressed as a supervisor he looked like an escapee from the violent ward so did i but he only stared back and after a while her eyes dropped what should he wear she said loincloth and there are nine senior men in my section who have loincloths and no gowns it is intolerable oh she didnt know what to make of that she went back and whispered to the other biddy meanwhile the line moved up the clerk looked at papers and then at the fat man at the head of the line he went into the shelving stacks behind the counter and came baok with bright gaudy clothes slashed velvet sleeves and tight trousers they were obviously too small ungood double plus ungood too small wrong period the fat man protested tough shit buddy we all got our troubles next the biddies came over to him and whispered he looked at us uh you sirs can i help you three helped carry the gowns and a fourth brought up the rear with stacks of papers flowing with seals and ribbons benito paid no attention to me he just walked ahead as if he assumed wed all follow which we did we turned a corner and he stopped this will do he said give those things to allen you have your work to do and this is his task certainly sir is there nothing else we can do for you this one wore a policewomans uniform vaguely american though the shield was shaped strangely she talked without using articles when she spoke to her subordinates she used a language i didnt know i was afraid to ask her death date i said this will do benito said we will be met by others you may go thank you sir the sow turned and stalked away followed by the others when she was out of sight benito seemed to wilt his straight posture was gone the high angle of the chin vanished and he slumped then he laughed so nothing changes now we must get out of here before someone tells this story to an internal security agent they think what do they think that were important officials no of course not they know we are only pretending that then what but they cannot be sure we might be important officials but most of them think we are secret police but how do you know there are secret police benito looked very sad allen there have to be you cannot run a bureaucratic state without them come we found a door to the outside and benito surrendered one of the documents hed collected we passed through and were out on the mud flats again a stinking breeze wrapped itself around me deliciously cool and i said ahh far to our right the old man had just filled his box of mud again he ran for the gate writing frantically chapter i was smiling as i turned the robes i held stacked on my head an ungainly load now what benito was staring across the swamp i dont know ah we cannot possibly persuade phlegyas to take us back i fear we must swim he set his own stack of robes down shook out the top robe and used it to tie the rest together swim through that it wasnt the garbage that turned me off it was the bubbling of angry people in and under the water if we met anyone like the guy benito had thrown back into the water if we met half a dozen of them while loaded down with heavy wet stacks of robes wait a minute benito lets try something else lead on then allen i stopped to tie my bundle as benito had tied his then i turned right along himuralibimas bay the choice was deliberate here there were windows and doors along the wall i was wading thighdeep and not liking it but it was the only way to learn what i wanted to know at worst i was postponing our swim at best weve got plenty of time you keep saying so so we do i wonder what you expect to find my foot brushed something soft she was clearly visible beneath two feet of water a longboned black woman with her hair floating like seaweed around a slack face i asked a stupid question is she dead of course said benito she was curled in fetal position she stayed rigid as i rolled her to bring her head above water there was no sign of decay and no sign of life but i felt for a pulse in her neck and found it catatonic and i started to get mad another catatonic of all the dirty things we dont persecute crazy people for crimes what right do the builders have to put crazy people in hell the builders never mind of all the dirty things benito can you handle two bundles for a minute he took my robes on his other shoulder he waited while i reached into the water to adjust the womans position catatonia its a rare enough disorder but almost incurable you can find one or two catatonics in almost any mental hospital they afford opportunity for endless jokes all identical for a catatonic will take any position you put him into and hold the pose indefinitely every intern thinks he is the first to see the possibilities he will lead the resident catatonic to the hospital cafeteria place him just outside the door and leave him there with his thumb to his nose or his middle finger rigidly extended hilarious sometimes he gets a surprise i had to stand on her knees to straighten her legs but finally i got them stretched out in front of her she was still leaning too far back her eyes staring at infinity through a halfinch of scummy water still standing on her knees for leverage i reached beneath the water took her shoulders and pulled her up to sitting position now shed be able to breathe sometimes he gets a surprise your antic intern he will have just finished adjusting the patients hand with thumb properly to nose when the hand becomes a fist and the fist becomes a missile warhead catatonics are hideously strong they have to be to hold one position forever and she was sitting down she lashed straight out and tried to punch a hole through my groin she damned near made it i whooped and doubled over sucking air sucking as it turned out filthy water as i rolled helplessly over into the swamp i tried to uncurl my lungs still wanted to suck water inch by inch i fought my mouth to the surface drew a lungful of sweet stinking air and screamed benito was sloshing toward me i gestured him back if he dropped the robes to help me theyd quadruple in weight he stopped i waited for the pain to ease a little then tried to stand up when i put weight on my legs it felt like shed hit me again i moved toward shore doubled over the womans lower lip was just at the surface of the water she held her arm straight out fist clenched dont make waves i told her sourly as i passed she didnt respond and she still looked dead water streamed from her nose i didnt stop for any more catatonics gradually i was able to straighten up benito followed patiently carrying both bundles both of us wading thighdeep in water i ignored the floating garbage it wasnt getting me any dirtier than i already was the texture of the bottom had changed beneath a film of frictionless mud there were tilted slabs that had sharp corners and tended to slide i stopped benito stopped behind me i said feel that benito didnt get it what should i feel himuralibimas ford thats what no telling how far it goes but it should get us a good distance across the swamp here give me that i took one of the bundles and started into the swamp the footing was chancy the slabs tended to slide but it was better than swimming and i feeling that i had earned the right to brag bragged all along i wondered where the dried mud was going itd shrink a little when the water evaporated but even so that bay is huge where do they dump the slabs after himuralibima gives up maybe id find a mountain of them or maybe they dont want a pile of ruined clay slabs in their working area maybe theyre afraid of getting ticked off for sloppiness so i was right someones been dumping the slabs in the bay every hundred years he has to walk a little further otherwise theyd show above the surface very clever allen thank kew no telling how far it would go but we were a good distance into the swamp and the water was only up to our calves hold your breath and make a wish carpentier or just hold your breath the water could be over your head any second we were nearly across before it ended the slabs dipped and i followed the dip walking on eggs with the stack of robes balanced on my head i was chin deep where the mud turned squishy soft so far so good i found an underwater ridge and followed that going waist deep then higher i was wading ashore with benito behind me when our luck ran out the broadshouldered man who blocked our path was the same who had blocked our path before he shied back when he recognized us and then he saw our situation and grinned i turned back to benito mind if i try this if you think it will help i wrote science fiction remember i ought to be able to explain a complicated idea to a moron i hadnt lowered my voice the broadshouldered man advanced on us saying whos a moron dont worry about it i told him youve got worse problems than that remember the flying lesson his grin was back id like to see old benito try that with his arms full of bedsheets he wont be able to i said keeping my speech slow and distinct hell have to put them down in the swamp pause theyll get all dirty pause imagine what that will do to his temper i watched his eyes it was getting through to him i said why dont you step aside while you think it over some guys would rather talk than fight he said contemptuously he turned and stalked back to his point of high ground part ii chapter things are definitely looking up for allen carpentier i beg your pardon benito was looking out at the marsh at decaying trees embedded in fog weve got a quiet place to work ive made some flint tools and theres everything we need for the glider what more could we want benito sighed and i got back to work the first job was to find a place to loft the glider we were on a little area of high ground no more than thirty yards square and nestled up against the base of the cliff the badtempered character was between us and everyone else he wouldnt let anyone else past and he wasnt about to bother us i could just see his back through the mist first things first i used a log to flatten out an area larger than the glider would be then cut a long springy sapling for a ruler after a while i had a whole collection of saplings of various lengths and thicknesses you draw the rough outlines then spring the batten in this case one of the saplings across the important points that makes a smooth fair curve it was the way the wright brothers designed airplanes and it was the way the douglas gooney bird was designed it wasnt until world war h long after the age of flight was underway that airplanes were designed on drafting tables before that they were done on the loft floors the same way that boats were designed for centuries i dont know how long it took me to get it right i wasnt in any hurry and benito never tried to rush me after a while he even developed some enthusiasm did you ever try to set up ribs and make them keep their shape by tying them with vines when the ribs are whatever you can cut off swamp willows as a lesson in patience the job has few equals eventually it looked liked a glider the wings werent precisely symmetrical and the control surfaces pivoted on wooden bearings with dowels shaped by flint knives and thrust into holes enlarged by flint drill bits the fabric was sewn with vine tendrils shoved through holes poked with a thorn but it looked like a glider i remembered the cargo cults of the south seas the islanders had been sorry to see the airplanes go after world war ii ended native magicians had made mockups of airplanes and landing fields it was sympathetic magic intended to bring back the real airplanes and the great days of cargo and trade i told benito about the cargo cults amusing him greatly and only later realized what had brought them to mind what i was building would never look like more than a crude imitation of an airplane but it would fly i spent as much time making tools as i did working on the sailplane a bow drill take one bow as for shooting arrows get a good curve in it and instead of an arrow take a piece of sapling wrap the bowstring around the piece of sapling attach the drill bit to one end you need a hard block in which the top of the sapling chunk will rotate freely because youve worn a depression in it hold that block in one hand put the drill point where you want it and draw the bow back and forth with the other hand the sapling turns the point turns in about a week you can drill a hole id heard that boatbuilders in asia preferred their bow drills to american electrics they must have been crazy i worked there were no distractions the builders must have altered my body radically i didnt get hungry thirsty horny or sleepy and i never had to go to the bathroom i wondered what i had become what was my power source now a power source with no food intake and no waste outlet if it was beamed power benito and i would be turning ourselves off when we dropped the glider beyond the wall beyond the wall i hadnt thought much about that what would we find outside dante had described a dark wood a wilderness why not a lowgravity world native vegetation allowed to run wild no guarantees carpentier there might be nothing but infernoland itself a tremendous cone built in airless space with a point mass a quantum black hole for instance mounted at the tip to provide gravity in that case we were dead i kept working and eventually there it was the fudgesickle by carpentier and company this is a demo madam the finished model will have many other desirable features such as landing gear and seats for the crew and metal fastenings will that hold together benito didnt seem particularly worried his tone was more one of abstract curiosity i think so we shouldnt put much strain on it but ive noticed we dont weigh what we should infernoland seems to be built on a lower gravity planet than earth yours is the most curious delusion i have yet encountered here well if it will fly we may as well try it the sooner you are done with this idiocy the sooner we can reach the center and escape i could have killed him so the fudgesickle wasnt a thing of beauty it would fly and it was a lot better way out than his i didnt try to kill him for three reasons first hed break my neck second he had been useful as a guide hed gotten me the fabric third i needed his help getting the fudgesickle high enough on that cliff above us for a launching we pulled the glider up the slope and carried it until the land fell away as a steep cliff the swamp bubbled like sludge with sickly lights glowing among the oddshaped bushes and trees if we crash down there well never get out i said can you fly this thing i have flown them benito laughed with real humor what i have done this before we launched the glider from a much higher cliff an austrian soldier came to get me out of a sticky situation he settled himself at the controls something familiar about that story but benito was looking out at the swamp and i didnt ask him he looked awfully big and heavy to be a glider pilot and i had to remember that we didnt weigh what we should i strained against the fuselage and shoved outward it wouldnt have worked if we hadnt been massless or nearly so even then i kept wondering about that it chewed at my soul the way a ragged tooth attracts the tongue how could we have weight and no mass the wrong weight and infernoland disneyland of the damnable how long had they kept me in that bottle clarkes law kept running through my head an old axiom of science fiction any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic in my time it would take magic the supernatural to make that many people not weightless but massless it wasnt even possible in theory to extract the inertia and leave the weight but they could do it the builders the god corporation why it must have cost a lot just how big a paying audience did they have who was watching us now i heaved against the plane and then there was no room for thought the plane dropped like a rock with me hanging onto the tail crawling forward to get into the rear seat benito knew how to fly all right he let us dive just missing the cliff until we had built up speed then he leveled out taking us above the swamp and toward the redhot city dis dante had described it glowing with redhot mosques with demons on the walls to guard it i didnt see any demons id take them on faith if the builders could build minos they could make demons we were about a hundred feet above the swamp and keeping steady altitude there must have been warm air rising from the hellish brew below us then we were over the wall and benito banked sharply left to catch the updraft the plane rose steadily gliding along the gentle curve of the wall benito shouted this wont do any good you know were getting higher arent we i pointed down the swamp had shrunk until i could see the gentle curve of the cliff beyond it cliff and redhot wall were concentric arcs of circles the view to the right went down forever beyond what seemed the biggest maze ever built steam rose in a thick curtain through windtorn rents in the steam i could glimpse factories belching out ugly black dirt a line of electric pylon towers a yellow glow of desert on and on down and down what had it all cost thousands of times as much as disneyland what kind of people would build infernoland and people it with unwilling damned souls if this worked out i would never know we were higher than the cliffs to our left it seemed that we had climbed fast faster than we had any right to but we were nearly weightless and completely massless the plane had only its own structural weight to lift we continued to rise until we were in the hideous gray fog that served infernoland for a sky it stank excrement oil smog sickness slaughterhouses everything hideous there wasnt even the honest smell of sweat and locker rooms well have to turn now benito said we cant stay in the updraft if we cant find it thats right go we banked left then straightened out the fog began to thin we were doing it passing over the rings wed struggled through a wind fall of weightless people bounced us about then let us go we passed over minos palace it was even bigger than id thought there was the wall ahead we were going to make it have at you builders you cant keep a sciencefiction writer in hell even so no hero worth writing about would have left infernoland with so many questions unanswered he would have led a revolution against the builders and never mind the odds the plane would have been for reconnaissance not escape heinlein van vogt doc smith robert howard all the men who wrote of mighty heroes what would they think of me now who cares go carpentier go go the villas of the first circle slid below us and suddenly we were losing altitude again the plane dipped sharply just over the cold river i should have known it would were not high enough i shouted obviously what now take us back to the thermals get up higher we can try it again as you wish he didnt say it wouldnt work he just banked left again and headed us back down into the bowl toward the winds even below the gray fog infernolands lighting was not good gloom and night all the way down infernoland was a vast funnel leading down down down where benito said we had to go and we were flying there suddenly we were in the winds people flew about us like flurries of autumn leaves some together some alone aerial whirlpool ahead which benito avoided and off to the left a straight updraft flailing human shapes rising helplessly toward infernolands invisible roof just before they vanished into the gray stinking fog the air column topped out and they streamed away to both sides there i said i pointed benito shrugged expressively im getting pretty damned tired of your defeatist attitude he banked toward the updraft suddenly we were rising as in an elevator i caught startled faces and some of the whirling victims tried to swim toward us through the air but they were rising faster than we were they couldnt catch us i was glad massless they might be but if i could feel wind roaring past my ears and tugging at my hair then people clinging to the wings would foul the airstream wed all crash we left the updraft and were carried along with the others sure enough we were just at the edge of the fog so that we could hardly see below this was it we were as high as wed been above dis and much closer to the wall now i shouted benito even grinned at me as he turned toward the wall this time wed make it as he banked something bulky hit him in the face and knocked him back into the seat then slipped past and wrapped itself around me i struggled to rip it off and it fought back wed picked up a passenger let me at the controls i used to be a glider pilot the hitchhiker pulled himself off me and scrambled into the other seat benito didnt resist let him fly he said the plane turned sickeningly we had lost altitude i could see over the strangers shoulder cliffside swampland a glowing red line a tailspin and we were beyond the place of the winds headed back into the inner circles of infernoland he pulled us out of the spin nothing subtle about it he just stopped the spin with the ailerons then pulled back on the tailflaps and hung on presently we were flying level again headed toward the swamp the stranger looked back at us showing a lean cheerful face beneath short windtossed hair where to up and out over the wall good thinking but theres a problem he waved toward the cliff we were well below the level of the winds i said there are redhot walls down there good thermals well spiral around them until were high enough then get back into the winds not me we have to there are updrafts in the winds before you interfered we were high enough to get out of this place down is correct benito said not the way you mean he shrugged it is the only way we can go now no question about that we headed out over the swamp again feeling the rising air that was just strong enough to keep us level if we didnt find an updraft wed crash in the swamp the trouble was we were looking for something invisible you cant see a wind you can only see what it does i was looking for heat turbulence or formations that might break a horizontal airstream and send it upwards anything thered been no problem spotting updrafts when the wind was full of actors or draftees or whatever they were ahead through the murk we could see the cherryred glow of the walls of dis it looked a bit like the first sight of a town in the middle of the nevada desert and for a moment i thought of food and coffee and onearmed bandits and girls we were over a hotspot in the swamp a shape rose from the murk and shook a fist at us he had a big bushy afro hairdo he lost interest when another man in a voluminous white gown and high pointed cap rose up to scream at him they were locked in battle when we left them take it easy i told our pilot i think i saw the left wing bend way up when you pulled us out of the spin yeah i saw it too what did you build this thing out of i told him he looked uneasy i asked what kind of gliders are you used to hypersonic eh said benito huh i said the stranger chortled jerome leigh corbett at your service i was a spaceshuttle pilot i had a dozen flights on my record and then you ever have one of those days damned right i said benito laughed and nodded we seemed to have enough altitude to reach the hot walls they were close enough that we couldmake out details through the murk and the red glow corbett seemed to know what he was doing there were ripples in the dark mud below a hand thrust itself upward middle finger extended there was no movement in the cobwebs and slimy moss hanging from the bushes no wind nothing only the ripples in the mud one of those days corbett said first a twenty sixhour hold while we replaced one of the solid boosters that was only irritating we lost one of the three main motors going up then after we made orbit one of the fuel tank clamps jammed either of you know what a space shuttle looks like i said i did benito said he didnt well the tank is big and bulky and cheap we carry the main motors down aboard the dart the winged section but we leave the tank to burn up in the atmosphere if we couldnt get the tank loose there wouldnt have been any point in going down did you sure we fired the orbital motors in bursts until the clamp sprang open and let us loose then we had to use more fuel to get back to our orbit we were supposed to dump cargo and change orbit but there wasnt enough fuel we had to go down benito was looking totally confused it must have been gibberish to him i asked what happened i dont know i spacewalked out and looked at the fuel tank clamp i swear there was nothing wrong but maybe the metal fatigued or maybe the hatch over the clamp lock got twisted anyway we were halfway down and going like a meteor when we got a burnthrough under the nose i heard the maintenance techs they were the cargo i couldnt jettison screaming in the instrument room then the whole nose peeled back in front of me i woke up by that ferryboat the crowd pushed me along to minos and he threw me into the whirlwind and why were you there benito asked corbett grinned being a shuttle pilot carries a lot of prestige the girls liked me we were over the walls of dis now and banked to catch the rising air my seat surged comfortingly against me and the left wing bent in the middle the fudgesickle turned on its side and dropped corbett dropped the nose the wing relieved of pressure straightened out but when he tried to pull up it bent again wed have been better off if the loose section hdd ripped away but it hung on dragging us back corbett did his best he tried to fly with the broken wing the flap raised high on the right wing to compensate we got some lift that way but there wasnt any doubt we were going to crash inside the walls of dis there were tombs dozens hundreds thousands of tombs some glowing red hot others dark the whole landscape was littered with them on the walls themselves were beings they didnt look much like the cute little devils in disney cartoons they raged at us and corbett seeing them dove for speed to get out of their sight the wing folded entirely corbett played the controls like a virtuoso at an organ heading out over the tombs and toward a steamy clear area beyond and below them but we were too low and falling lower into the tombs we dropped into their midst the plane kissed the top of one tomb bounced and smashed nose on against a wall of redhot iron chapter flame roared up around me as if a fuel tank had caught i pulled myself loose and rolled out clawing frantically with my hands as the flames washed over me when i tried to get to my hands and knees my right leg wouldnt work i pulled myself along the ground dragging the useless leg behind me whimpering with fear while the fire raged behind and the air i breathed grew unbearably hot i didnt stop until i was forty feet away my fingernails were torn and my hands cut on the flinty ground i rolled over onto my back to look behind me afraid to look at my leg knowing id have to what had i done to myself someone was screaming i ignored the deep throbbing incoherent pain in my leg to look back at the crashed glider benito had been thrown clear in the crash now he was running back toward the glider corbett was trapped in the wreckage rammed up against the redhot iron tomb screaming like a damned soul i didnt even consider trying to get him out hed be dead in seconds his skin would already have charred away and he was breathing superheated air and smoke how could he scream like that with seared lungs he was a dead man benito hadnt thought of that he ran straight back into the flames i watched in disbelief as he pulled at corbetts arm getting nowhere while fire roared about him benito took flaming wreckage in his hands and heaved it away clawing to get corbett out idiot hed leave me stranded here my leg ruined with no guide and no one to help me i sat up and tried to go to his aid but agony flashed in my leg i had to look down i stared at two splintered ends of redandwhite bone protruding through my thigh bright blood spurted through the torn skin arterial bright impossibly red i couldnt take my eyes away once before id broken a bone id caught a football wrong in high school and a knuckle cracked it had made me sick not just the pain but the thought of that broken thing inside me i could hardly walk to the clinic now i stared at two ends of a broken thighbone while my lifes blood jetted out with each pulse i expected to faint but nothing happened and presently i thought of making a tourniquet before all my blood was gone there was only my robe i gripped the hem in my teeth and pulled with both bands it wouldnt tear and wouldnt tear and bright blood jetted in the air benito i was lying with a broken bone and a terrible wound but i could be saved why was benito wasting his time on a hopeless case a man hed barely met a hitchhiker it wasnt fair corbett was still screaming as benito tore at the wreckage where did the pilot find the strength he should be finished lungs burned out heart stopped but he went on screaming mechanically as if the sounds of pain were being ripped out of him the pilot came lose suddenly and they both went sprawling backward benito got up and dragged the pilot over to me benito was parboiled and hairless his hands blistered and burned corbett was a charred corpse black from end to end with bloodrare steak showing through cracks in the char there were no eyes left in the sockets and still sounds came through the swollen blackened lips i wanted to stop my ears stupid i said stupid stupid stupid in a minute hell be dead anyway he will heal said benito he is dead already heal certainly agony surged in my leg i looked down and couldnt look away i watched in helpless fascination the blood had stopped pumping the bone ends gradually vanished as skin crawled out to cover them it crawled on closing the wound leaving my leg in an odd tented shape without my willing it the leg straightened slowly an old scar id once got fishing slowly reappeared where before there had been bloody jagged bone end the pain turned to a ferocious itch that went away too i was healed corbett had stopped screaming now he only moaned softly i looked afraid to look afraid not to the char was flaking off him in thick patches the skin beneath was bright sunburn red not at all like raw meat his tattoo like my scar came up from underneath his skin like a selfdeveloping photograph he groaned again and opened his eyes there were eyes in the sockets corbett looked at me and smiled weakly cant die again i guess wished i could for a time there it is a pointless and evil wish said benito the dead cannot die no corbett began an inspection of his body i stood up uncertainly benito watched saying nothing i was able to stand i could walk i did i went off a way toward the glowing tomb until the heat was nearly unbearable and i stared at it well have to change our theory wont we carpentier corbetts no robot the builders would have had to put new sunburned skin under the skin to be charred they would have had to plan all this ahead of time they would have to be omniscient and what about your leg carpentier what about your leg biological engineering rapid regeneration that to add to their other powers they can warp space and possibly time they can take the mass from a human body and leave the weight they can put minos tail into where hyperspace theyve got finetuned weather control and infinitely adaptable robots and they can engineer your body carpentier your body in such a way that it heals in minutes and do it without your knowing they gave you that ability getting a little thin isnt it carpentier a neat set of rationalizations but it wont work how are these builders different from god himself what can god do that they cant and back at the edge of my mind i couldnt help remembering the last thing id screamed in the bottle corbett had got up and was peeling saucersized flakes of charred skin from his chest and shoulders hot here he said i nodded and abandoned my reverie it was hot even the tombs that werent glowing were just below red heat here and there flames shot up from open pits it must have been painful for corbett with his new skin i remembered where we were inside the walls of dis how were we to get out again we were surrounded by hot glowing tombs flames fire heat everywhere except in one direction where darkness showed through the red glow we have to get out of here i said to benito well roast to well roast to death we couldnt die cant die twice carpentier of course we must leave benito said recall your promise i helped you with the glider and it did not work now you have no choice we go downward which way for that moment i didnt care i am not sure we may as well go where it is more comfortable he led us off toward the dark it drew us onward promising relief from the heat and the choking air we threaded our way between heated tombs and great vatlike pits with fire dancing from them huge lids that would just cover them lay beside each one the edge of the hot region was the beginning of a white marble maze the heat stopped as if wed gone through an insulated doorway but there was no door i wasnt even surprised it would take more than invisible heat barriers to surprise me now corbett staggered into a corridor and sank down with a happy sigh his back against cool marble he wriggled to get his head clear of the brass fixtures we were in an endlessly sprawling building the corridors were about fifteen feet wide and nearly that high every wall was covered with squarecut marble slabs and rows of brass plates and slender brass what vases i read some of the plates name birth date date of death sometimes an insipid poem these were burial vaults and those brass things were vases and of course there were no flowers in them the corridor stretched on endlessly and there seemed to be branches at frequent intervals millions of tombs more unbelievers i said yes benito answered but i was an unbeliever an agnostic of course why of course i found you in the vestibule said benito but now you know the truth a twosyllable response stuck in my throat the truth was an elusive thing here in infernoland i could talk about advanced technologies until hell froze over and benito would still call them miracles id watched a miracle a compound fracture had healed before my eyes and i was no robot but this place had to be artificial it was a construct a design i knew that all right carpentier an artifact implies an artificer there has to be a designer pick a chief engineer for the builders and call him what good fannish names like ghod ghu roscoe the ceiling no call him big juju question carpentier in what way do big jujus abilities differ from god almightys size this place is the size of a small planet carpentier youve no way of knowing big juju cant build even bigger worlds stars whole universes natural laws he suspends them at will a worldsized funnel as stable as a sphere would be in normal space and and he can raise the dead me corbett who couldnt possibly have been frozen jan petri the healthfood addict cremated carpentier burned to a pile of greasy ashes and a few chunks of bone and now risen so that he can be tortured big juju can create he can destroy he can raise the dead and heal the sick was more ever claimed for christ i looked back at the redhot tombs they still glowed with heat but none of that reached us in these cool marble halls there are people in those tombs benito nodded heretics the word was frightening heretics they believed in the wrong gods or worshiped the right god in the wrong way for that they were raised from the dead so they could be tortured in botboxes iago says it credo in un dio crudel i believe in a cruel god and that you must believe carpentier the ability to make a universe does not presuppose moral superiority we have seen no strong evidence that big jujus moral judgments are better than our own would god torture people i halfremembered sunday school lessons no but also yes it was one reason i was an agnostic how could i worship a god who kept a private dungeon called hell that might be all right for dante alighieri a renaissance italian but carpentier has higher standards than that a voice floated from within my mind a tired voice whispering out of a mound of fat were in the hands of infinite power and infinite sadism we were in the private museum park of big juju weve got to get out of here too right said corbett he paused music i listened there was music playing from somewhere within these marble corridors something chintzysweet a minor work by a major composer played for every melodramatic sweet note in it artificial good cheer in hell it fits i said granted were damned how do we get out which way benito looked around him i have never been in this part before not back out there corbett insisted not unless we have to right weve got time i said and i started laughing it was an awful sound it bounced around in the maze and came back at me from all directions transmuted to racking sobs i tried to stop corbett and benito were staring i tried to tell them i was right just once i was right all that time in the bottle all that guessing and i was right just once immortality when they woke me up they had immortality dammit i was crying corbett took my arm come on then we went inward chapter the corridors branched away endless crosscorridors in an endless corridor and every one of them the same wall after wall of marblesealed caskets each with its empty bronze vases for flowers our footsteps echoed hollowly our sandals hadnt been touched by the flames the sprightly music continued never getting louder and the light never changed neither gloomy nor bright on and on corridor after corridor finally we halted we havent turned i said corbett nodded do a oneeighty and we can get out of here lets halffacetiously i rapped on a bronze nameplate and read off the name and dates a translucent human shape formed before me i stared in horror then shrugged what was a ghost among ghosts pardon me i said can you direct us toward the wall of dis the ghosts voice was faint and reedy wall dis faint laughter they must have added more extensions to the mausoleum i dont remember anything like that in forest lawn very funny this isnt forest lawn the ghost seemed vexed i was supposed to be buried in forest lawn i paid for it before i died it was in my will where am i would you believe hell more faint laughter as if from a great distance certainly not i dont even believe in ghosts and then there was nothing but the wall i jumped when corbett spoke behind me its a risk but are you game to try a crosscorridor i think if we turn left and keep going straight well be headed up again the scenery changed now there were niches with urns in them much closer together we came to a t intersection and turned and returned to the right direction when we could then another t and a y and a big round empty space with corridors off in all directions and a big monument in the very center and we were in the good section of town the sarcophagi were no longer buried in the walls at the ends of short alcoves were huge marble oblongs ornately carved guarded by traditional statuary knights and vague sexless winged beings that were supposed to be angels and might have been faggots reproductions of famous religious statuary original creations all done with enormous competence all in monstrous bad taste sculpted bibles open to john replicas of european cathedrals done in perfect scale bronze toys one alcove was blocked off by a brass gate and enormous lock all the nameplates were of the same family all ornately carved with relief pictures and bronze replicas of their lifes signatures we looked in grinned at each other and went on pride unbelievably ornate monuments purchased at unbelievable price expensive tombs turned prisons i wondered if they matched monuments left behind on earth sure i decided big juju has a sense of fitness fitness in this one case yes fitness the corridors twisted again and again the dead were high walls on all sides of us our footsteps were dull intrusions on music for the proud dead the dead walked among the dead dead dead dead dead word and reality echoed with each step word and reality hammered at my soul dead dead dead presently i sat down against coot marble allen what is the trouble benitos anxious voice was far away come on lets get moving this place gives me the creeps corbett shoved at me with his toe cmon i tried to speak it wasnt worth the effort but finally i heard my own voice saying were dead dead its all over we tried to make lives for ourselves and we didnt make it and were dead oh corbett i wish id died like you the gay sweet music mocked me dead dead dead green light blinked on and off in the corner of my eye it was annoying a disturbance an irritant in the thick cotton closing about me i could see the source without turning my head but it was an effort to move my eyes why bother but the light winked on and off and eventually i looked at the source a neon sign blinking far down at the dead end of a corridor of the dead it echoed my thought so it goes so it goes so it goes off and on endlessly in green neon unreachably far away on another world in another time allen carpentier had been buried like a potato in a closed coffin ceremony the fans had come to the funeral some of them and a few writers had come and afterward theyd gone off to have a drink and talk about new writers carpentier was dead and that was all there was to it i could speculate forever about big jujus moral superiority i could wander forever through hell and so what so it goes so it goes corbetts voice came dimly we may have to leave him i saw this happen to a guy once in the war hes going autistic i have seen it also many times would you leave him here i thought benito was shaking my shoulder so it goes so it goes so it goes what was the blinking neon sign doing in this place a horrible suspicion filtered through the blankets around my brain i pushed benito away and surged to my feet i walked wobbling toward the blinking light so it goes at the end of the corridor was a tremendous squarecut edifice in black marble the epitaph beneath the neon sign was long and wordy couched in words of one syllable and short simple sentences a mans life history a list of books and awards corbett and benito stared when i came back corbett said you look like youre ready to kill somebody i jerked my thumb behind me at first i couldnt speak i was that angry him why him a sciencefiction writer who lied about being a sciencefiction writer because he got more money that way he wrote whole novels in baby talk with sixthgrade drawings in them and thirdgrade science and he knew better how does he rate a monument that size benitos smile was lopsided you envy him that tomb if you must know i was writing better than he ever did before i left high school being dead hasnt hurt your ego said corbett good we thought wed lost you hes got vases bigger than the bottle they put me in you were an agnostic selfish but not viciously so benito said if i judge rightly from the size of his tomb he must have founded his own religion and possibly worshiped himself no they were jokes sort of but he did found at least two not that there ever were any followers or that he even intended there to be one of them had everyone telling comforting lies to everyone else the other was the church of god the fairly competent maybe i should have gone in for something like that why didnt you corbett asked because whats the point of mocking people whove found something to believe in i turned toward the big gaudy edifice thats the point benito shook his head wonderingly i question your sanity he is in there you are out here free to escape i didnt answer but he was right we turned away for a time i could see the green reflection blinking ahead of us so it goes we were lost in endless corridors of the dead benito walked in stolid patience but corbetes face had acquired a grim set look desperation barely held in check i kept my own thoughts to myself but i remembered big jujus ability to distort space and time wed come a long way perhaps there was no way out and what if we did get out of the maze benito said we had all eternity eternity in infernoland or in hell big juju or god it didnt matter the problem was to escape id built a glider once and it had flown get me through the wall get me fabric for the wings and id do it again but id have to do it without benito you promised youd go with him carpentler down to the center out his way you can keep your word or you can break it but if you break it itll be without his help suppose hes crazy or an agent for big juju then youre on your own nuts benito might be able to trick the damned bureaucrats into giving us whatever we wanted i couldnt kid myself id be able to fabric i could get at worst by peeling it off catatonics but how to get through the wall id seen demons on the rim more demons guarded the gate i glanced sideways at benito stolid patience and iron faith in god and the maps of dante alighieri and carpentiers given word if we ever got out of this maze hed go down we could follow or not i felt heat ahead we turned a corner and found a wall of redhot urns the floor seemed to slant uphill corbett whooped this way to the wall his voice sounded out of place in the mausoleum i waited for benito to protest but he said nothing and i wondered if he knew something we didnt we could make quite a safari corbett shouted he was overjoyful at finding a way out just open these urns and pour out the ashes i went further than that once benito told us i attempted to establish a local government didnt work no why there was no answer it became apparent that there wouldnt be one something else to think about we hit a t corridor and were back in cool marble we followed it a short way anxious lest we find ourselves back in the endless tombs it turned left again i rounded the turn ahead of the others and found myself facing red heat i shaded my eyes your papers please i squinted through my fingers i faced a towering wall of redhot iron with a divided door in it there was a counter on the lower closed half of the door and someone behind it halfhidden in the dark interior framed by bright red light he held a stack of papers the bored face showed no sign of recognition it might have been the same clerk or a different one papers come on i havent got all eternity he pushed the stack of papers toward me youll have to make these out before you can go uphill its in the rules i backed around the corner to the questioning looks of the others i said dont ask just turn around we went back the way wed come looking for a right turn presently we found it and your papers please i walked toward the booth but i was studying the gate behind the clerk iron glowing red butit was only waist high we could jump it the counter turned white hot as i approached papers youll have to fill out the forms no exceptions i looked to benito he shrugged and turned away after a moment i followed hating him he wasnt going to help and hed known it all along we had to go downhill chapter the music went with us wherever we went nature themes melodramatic sweetness singing violins but never funeral dirges or somber tones the cheerful music was more depressing than any funeral march gradually i realized we could hear something else as well i dont know if it had been with us the whole time waiting for us to become aware of it or if it began as we threaded our way deeper into hell the sounds came from the tombs groaning whimpers croaks of rage mumbled curses once even gay whistling a tune that jarred against the canned music gradually the clammy air warmed it was our first sign that we were moving out of the maze we followed currents of warming air where the air turned steamy hot we found a doorway unnerving sounds reached us through the doorway screams of agony torn from throats that could contain them no longer blended with animal war cries and the most vicious curses id ever imagined corbett plunged ahead but benito caught him carefully he warned us we looked out and down the ground fell straight away from the doorsill first vertically then angling down to a fortyfivedegree slope the dirt was baked adobe with jagged edges of protruding flint the bottom of the cliff was obscured by steam much like the marsh outside dis but this was hot the steam roiled about leaving occasional clear patches gradually the picture formed we were looking at an enormous discolored lake the shore curved away to either side until steam hid the endpoints men and women stood waist deep in steamy red water and they howled they were packed like a public pool on a kansas summer saturday and they wanted out some tried it but they didnt make it armed men patrolled the shore between us and the scarlet water the guards were dressed for a costume ball in the military garb of all places and all times but they walked like sentries whose officers are watching their eyes were uniformly on the lake and they held weapons ready weapons there was every hand weapon known to history pistols bows scythes crossbows throwingsticks slings pikes and lances ar rifles all held at the ready when someone attempted to leave the lake the sentries fired i saw a woman in black military uniform cut nearly in half by a burst from an automatic rifle she shrieked in agony and waded deeper into the lake where she stood healing healing the implications of our inability to die began to get through to me then one man in a long beard wore a golden crown on his head and clustered crossbow bolts through his chest he was stubborn hed move toward the shore the crossbowmen would fire and hed stagger back the scream hissing through clenched teeth hed pluck the bolts from his chest and throw them contemptuously into the water and wade toward shore again and again and again he was a fool but a brave one i take it the guards wont be on our side i whispered benito shuddered no on the contrary if they catch us we he didnt finish but he didnt have to the guards looked silly in those costumes i knew some of them nazi swastikas and american gis coldstream guards and cameron highlanders blue and gray of the civil war world war i helmets redcoats and the blueandbuff of washingtons continentals fuzzywuzzies and chinese gordons tommies and more roman legion greek hoplite vaguely asiatic uniforms long gowns and wicker shields spears with golden apples on the hilts and more still yellow men in animal fur red and black men in little besides war paint blue men stark naked blue britons in their woad marching beside legionnaires followed by men and women in coveralls carrying tiny machine guns of a variety id never seen and they watched the lake constantly vigilantly they wont see us up here i said now what we must cross the lake said benito there is a place far around where it is only ankle deep elsewhere it rises to above our heads in the deepest parts the damned stand at a depth appropriate to the violence they did on earth that water looks hot it steams it is boiling blood benito laughed without humor what would you expect for the violent a frozen moment stretched endlessly then corbett shouted we cant walk into that no jerry ive been burned before remember well never make it when our ankles are cooked well go to our knees when the legs are cooked well be lying in it yet you see that every man and woman in the lake is standing the calm voice halted corbetts panicky monologue he looked id already seen that benito was right if they could stand their cooked legs must still be operating they also wouldnt stop hurting the guards will not allow us to wander freely in hell benito cautioned us without instructions regarding our sentence they may well force us to the deepest spot and keep us there you have noted that their weapons do not kill but they can disable lets stay here carpentier im starting to like the music they must not notice us we must do as little screaming as possible benito spoke seriously without a trace of humor benito had been in hell so long that suffering was not remarkable to him or even unusual there may be a better way corbett said slowly he pointed allen what do you see an island halfobscured by steam it stood very low in the lake a good mile to our right it was more crowded than the water around it the water that benito said was boiling blood poetic justice infinitely exaggerated as everything was here no doubt the people boiling down there were murderers in life or torturers or kidnappers arsonists perhaps the violent well at least we knew how to get across benito can we cross on the island he stared popeyed his big square jaw thrust forward i had no idea there was an island in acheron dante did not describe it i suppose he mentioned boiling blood of course he also described the ford i used before the ford is heavily guarded and perhaps the island would be better he considered dante did not mention the ship in acheron either ship yes allen a wooden sailing ship sunken on the other side of acheron the decks are just awash with blood i have been aboard it there are grills in the deck and souls beneath the grills slave traders corbett speculated probably said benito but how had benito been aboard was that where he had escaped from or from deeper down i didnt dare ask yet how could we trust him until we knew his crime how could we not slave traders arent our problem corbett said i suppose the best plan would be to circle up here until were just opposite the island then make a run for it we looked at each other and nodded agreement we turned back inside to parallel the shore passing walls of shelves packed with crematory urns i savored the cool damp air i was going to miss it the cliff edge was just beyond that wall why bother carpentier why not stay here no weve got to get out of here minos would track us down eventually and then what we have to escape hey carpentier what makes you think theres a way out i dont want to think about that there has to be a way out benito says there is dante described it a way out for him yes a living man whose guide called on angels there is a way out of hell and were going to find it because we cant die trying because theres nothing else to do but sit for eternity eternity im scared carpentier me too lets talk to the others theyre scared like you talking helps the guards i said they bother me two ways corbett said its boiling that bothers me i dont think ill like being shot full of arrows and bullets i said but worse than that what the blazes are they doing here corbett just laughed they were guarding his look said they did violence they believed justified said benito they fought for what they thought was a higher cause and there arent any soldiers in heaven im sure there are but these enjoyed their work his voice took on a note of sadness they enjoy it still they do not seek to escape its weird theyre serving the builders or big juju or god whatever we call the master of this place if theyre serving god they ought to be in heaven benito shrugged or purgatory perhaps theology is not my specialty the next doorway is just ahead be careful he wouldnt say more but i remembered the uniformed servitors in disneyland id wondered if the guards worked in shifts did they have homes to go to when they got off work did they go home and tell their wives about their day we waited peeking around the doorjamb to watch the share the island was just opposite no more than fifty yards offshore obscured by clouds of steam and no easier to see than it had been from a mile away a band marched past robed and unarmed inquisition priests benito murmured they would call the temporal authorities the soldiers they receded a handful of barbarian women passed arms and shoulders the color of their bronze armor they carried bows and shortswords behind them was another group also women wearing olivedrab fatigues and carrying submachine guns they passed out of sight and the shore was clear run benito ordered we ran there was a tenfoot drop to the steep slope i landed on my feet and kept running in a halfcontrolled fall jagged flint edges tore at my feet when i hit the beach i kept running because i knew id never be able to walk into the boiling lake the wandering clouds of steam wrapped me round hid me from the guardians and i ran toward the chorus of screams the smell was overpowering fresh blood and clotted blood copper bright and polluted foul corbett was ahead of me he splashed into bubbling red fluid and screamed he stood covered to his knees screaming in pain benito plunged in waded through the stuff like a damned robot and gripped corbetts arm to keep him from turning back then i was in it myself i fell into a trench and was instantly waist deep the pain hit me weirdly as if id stuck my finger in a light socket stunning unreal all my senses were scrambled i knew the smell of pain its sight and sound and there was nothing to see or hear but pain i couldnt control my limbs they thrashed and twitched almost spilling me full length into the stuff still jerking like a marionette i turned toward shore nothing could be worth this much pain half a squad of green berets stood there studying us they had friends small men in black pajamas i turned back we were committed now through a gap in the steamy mist i had seen their eyes dull expressionless intent on their task and their task was to let no one leave the blood the island i screamed to the island but i didnt move and neither did the others we stood where we were and screamed the island corbett laughed hysterically laughter and pain and horror we cant use the island i screamed what stupid look he was right i cursed the rolling clouds that had hidden it from view they were shoulder to shoulder over every square inch of the island i never saw a more vicious mob they were armed haphazardly with clubs and crude daggers of what seemed to be splintered bone even as i watched someone trying to climb out of the blood was repelled by halfadozen stab wounds he staggered away howling leaving a foaming red wake benito came up to me still pulling corbett by the arm we must wade around the island i couldnt move suddenly he took my shoulder in his powerful grip and began to plunge through the boiling red towing both of us like children i remembered his strength there was no point in struggling with him i didnt want to i wanted out but my limbs would not obey the pain was paralyzing you could read the agony on benitos face he hurt as we did but he plunged on he shouted deeper down there is a place where souls are not even allowed to cry here there is no law against screaming yeah cheer me up i screamed we halted there were guards on the shore a man in a high peaked hat stared through binoculars we didnt dare move there are two ways to treat constant excruciating agony both involve screaming you may try to suppress the screams and they will force their way through your teeth or you can just let it out similarly you can concentrate on the source of pain and try to minimize it a current of notquiteboiling blood here on the left get into it stand on tiptoe you gain an inch or you can tell yourself it will heal and concentrate on something else there was turmoil on the island people were shouting at one of their number he stood with his feet planted wide and his hands raised high over his head the hands held the haft of a spear a length of wood that might have been a broken oar or a tree sapling and a leafshaped blade poised a few inches above his feet poised to strike but at what hands reached to shake his shoulders and he snarled in an agony different somehow from all the moans around him i tried to hear by now the wordless moaning of the thousands of waders even my own had become a background noise had faded like the sickening smell of boiling blood i caught disjointed phrases kill em kill em before billy if you wont do it let us through idiot you hafta theyll be all around us in a minute the man with the spear bellowed no and the ground seemed to erupt beneath his feet he kicked at whatever was gripping his ankles he kicked himself free and ran for the islands shore others got out of his way then surged to close the gap behind him that portion of the island was heaving as in an earthquake and clubs and knives were rising and falling with horrible rhythm billy splashed knee deep into boiling blood and stopped at once as he sucked air for his first shocked scream three separate hands thrust forward against his back he splashed face down two surging waves washed against the bathers around him he was up in a flash his spear ready for war i was sure hed try to fight his way back onto the island but he didnt he turned and waded away in our direction a foot short of my nose he said friend its not polite to stare sorry what happened back there will they let you back he glared back at his erstwhile neighbors those bastards couldnt stop me he sounded like he was holding his breath as we all did because each of us was trying to talk around a scream it was almost funny that sound i never thought it would hurt so much he said why didnt you stay couldnt take the killing what benito and corbett had crowded close to listen billy studied me his face contorted in agony dont know about the island do you i shook my head the afrika korps had gone but cuirassiers with muskets had replaced them we still dared not move we on the island we killed people just like you in the swimming hole but we all had some excuse some reason we had to kill like me there was a range war going on we wasnt even the ones that started it i said yeah he took it wrong you think maybe we could have stopped it gone along with the amnesty i didnt know what he was talking about and didnt much care his blue eyes had turned killer in that moment i said dont mind me im in hell too that calmed him and changed him he was younger than me and shorter than me and the short amateurish haircut gave him a pleasant boyish look though the hair was plastered down with blood then theres harry vogel he continued he was robbing a liquor store and the owner pulled his mask off hed seen his face so he had to die see and rich and bonny anderson they kidnapped a kid and it would have been okay but he got away got as far as a great big street called a freeway then some kind of machine hit him he looked down then continued talking hurriedly as if that would block the pain bonnys here rich isnt rich got religion hey we got aaron burr on the island and that guy who ran the andersonville prison camp i get the idea if they thought they had to do it they dont get hurt as bad yeah billy looked down a his waist it hurts i think this hurts as much as anything i ever did except die but i wouldnt go back no but he looked back and wasnt sure he said it again no i wont ever kill anyone again thats twice youve well that island aint any common dirt you know its mostly judges and congressmen and lawyers and a few jury members and crooked sheriffs wait wait i remembered the island surging up around him the islands people live people i swear he was enjoying my reaction yeah we have to keep em crippled its what minos does to them for letting known killers loose on the public that was paying them to protect them some was jury members that took bribes and lawyers that fiddled with the evidence and congressmen that passed laws against putting a man in jail if the evidence wasnt got in a special kind of way i dont know that kind of law is all new to me the island was a lot smaller when i came here and they keep coming back to life i was this shocked i had forgotten to hurt friend they sure do and we have to keep persuading them not to move one way or another otherwise theyd just swim away and whered we be waist deep in boiling blood he tried to laugh well i guess id rather boil if they could die itd be okay but they cant let em alone long enough and they try to get up i cant take it anymore i felt benitos hand on my shoulder allen the shore is clear of guards i think we can move corbett was already raising a wake i started after him tottering on stiffened legs on impulse i turned back why not come with us it cant be any worse lower down his eyes sparked with hope maybe youre right chapter we waded through boiling blood going up to our chins before the bottom sloped up again after an eternity we reached the other shore and let ourselves fall each wrapped silently and solipsistically in his own pain we lay in full view on what seemed to be rough white concrete four targets if the guardians wanted us they could have us a long time later corbett found the strength to roll over theyre all along the far shore he reported watching us nazis indians benito said never mind they will not hurt us they do not bother those who wish to go deeper into hell thats a relief said corbett i wasnt so sure but i held my peace i inspected my feet legs buttocks the meat was loose on my bones i should have been dead down there it should have stopped hurting fat chance carpentier and billy who must have hurt just as much as i did was smiling to himself i snarled what are you so damned happy about first off this is the first chance ive had to lie down in a hundred years second i dont have to kill anyone even if they yell at me third i didnt much like the company on that island maybe ill like you better maybe who were you william bonney just a cowhand that got done unto and did some back bonney corbett sat up suddenly hed healed much faster than i had billy the kid friend there are a dozen men on the island that all claim they was billy the kid and you im the real one i could see the wheels going round in corbetts head were we supposed to spend eternity wondering if he were telling the truth corbett said have it your way i was a spaceship pilot what you mean like you been on the moon right benito grunted and surged to his feet then sat down hard with another grunt of pain from the waist down he showed bright red skin very tender looking like corbett hed healed fast but he wasnt in condition to scout i asked benito what are we headed into its for sure we cant go back the wood of the suicides lies ahead a pleasant place comparatively if we can avoid the dogs dogs the wood is punishment for the sin of suicide benito explained each tree holds the soul of one who took his own life they are not dangerous to us but the violent wasters also suffer there and the dogs are their punishment there will not be many of the dog packs it is almost an obsolete sin corbett looked up since when is a sin obsolete customs change in dantes time there were men who would hold a party at which they would burn part of their wealth to show how wealthy they were potlach i cried gesundheit said corbett no dammit listen there was a west coast indian tribe that used to do just what benitos talking about hold a party burn a lot of valuables they used to compete at it i never knew the italians did the same thing they did said benito their punishment is to run through these woods pursued by wild dogs if the dogs catch them they tear them apart billy was sitting up they heal after that i was healing my legs and buttocks still hurt but the flesh was firm and i could move the muscles i watched fascinated as new skin grew before my eyes the dogs and the souls they pursue should be rare benito said and the trees can do us no harm we should find this stretch easy he stood up are we ready my feet were still tender and billy was complaining about his but it didnt sound like wed have to run anywhere corbett and benito were healed we set off deeper into hell it had become an obsession with me anything was better than waiting and if i spent too much time remembering the agony in the lake wed never get started we left concrete for dirt when we topped a gentle rise the ground was suddenly all erosion gullies hard red and yellow clay studded with gravel and gashed by flash floods we had to scramble in and out of them some had water at the bottom water filthy with broken bottles and bottle caps used condoms floating grease occasional bursts of brightly colored dyes chemicals that burned our sandaled feet nothing grew here there were dead stumps of trees and dried brown vines reaching upward like dead old womens fingers strange smells moved on the air incongruous whiffs of automobile exhaust acids burning oil and rubber billy grunted i dont see no trees benito whered you put the damn trees we should have reached the wood long since i do not understand but we must go on we scrambled out of the gully and looked downward we had a vista of hell it looked like hell on earth nothing grew we had to shout above a continual racket in the distance rectangular shadows showed through the gloomy halflight and thick smog buildings factories i said progress has caught up with your woods benito a clattering sounded nearby within a cloud of roiling smoke a woman ran out of the smoke terror on her face hair streaming behind her she wore a torn evening gown with diamond brooch and earrings highheeled shoes with jeweled ornaments she ran holding the skirt high billy shouted and tried to stop her she dodged him and ran on the clattering grew louder and a bulldozer roared out of the smoke a man ran just ahead of the blade the dozer trailed smoke and it was gaining on the fugitive there was no driver billy was in the bottom of the gully curled up his head wrapped in his arms when the monster was past i went down to billy he was muttering to himself and when i touched him he twitched galvanically he leapt to his feet in fighting stance i was never afraid of no man that ever lived he said but i was scared of that what was it bulldozer for moving dirt billy stared into the smog his face wondering you could tear down whole mountainswith things like that we did corbett said theres more than one way to be a violent waster billy frowned hows that pollution this must be the place for people who ruin the environment corbetts face showed his disgust they did this to the earth but who gets chased by them things realestate developers i guess housingtract speculators we shouldnt have too much trouble here corbett looked at us or do we id always been a conservationist myself if big jujus poetic justice ran true to form id be safe enough or would i had i fallen by accident id certainly put myself on that window ledge if a bulldozer buried me here would i become a tree lets go said billy this place gives me the willies we moved off by tacit consent where we going anyway billy asked past this round there is desert benito said a fiery desert too hot for life with flame falling from the sky i know of only one way to cross it and that is the way dante used a stream runs through the desert the overflow from the lake of blood it cools the desert as it moves through it miraculously i said id intended it to be contemptuous but it hadnt come out that way id seen too many miracles all unpleasant benito nodded of course we must find this stream or we cannot cross it runs through the wood comrades we must find the wood he turned left and walked on why this way billy laughed you aint got any idea where that wood is no but we must reach it if we walk far enough it is only a matter of time yeah we had plenty of that and hell was a series of concentric circles god only knew how big around it might take years and so what why not go the other way billy insisted benito shrugged dante always turned left on his way down but we will turn right if you like naw it aint important chapter the noise the smells the desolation continued the damned were here placed by a macabre humor phantom heads rose from oil pools some were pecked incessantly by oilsmeared birds a river ran past like an open sewer and men and women lined the banks mourning the wails were constant in our ears wails and roaring motors and clanking machines we looked into some of the huge buildings and pulled back out fast inside the noise was overwhelming here a sizzling hum of electricity there a scream of metal grinding on metal elsewhere a roar of flame there were more of the damned in those buildings and they were hard at work our way led through one of the immense factories not a head lifted to see us pass incomprehensible widgets passed on an endless belt and men and women screwed on nuts and tightened them and fitted the bottoms and the handles endlessly we followed the endless belt for miles until it went through a wall on the other side more of the damned were taking the widgets apart machinery hummed and conveyors took the parts back to the other side of the wall we left the building to find oil derricks raising and lowering their heads like giant prehistoric birds we crossed a strip mine and benito pointed out that it was laid out very like hell itself a vast series of descending circular terraces but there was nothing at the bottom except stagnant water a towering oilfueled power plant of spidery framework and miles of pipes and valves poured power into a cable thick as my waist transmission towers took the cable downhill i peered along its length but the murk defeated me how did they use electricity in hell but outside the power plant was an athletic man chained to a wheelless bicycle set in concrete in front of the exhaust pipe of the generator black smoke poured around him almost hiding him from view as we watched he began pedaling furiously the hum of the gears rose to a high pitch and the generator inside died there was a moment of quiet the man pedaled with sure strokes faster and faster his feet nearly invisible his head tucked down as if against a wind we gathered around each wondering how long he could keep it up he began to tire the blur of his feet slowed the motors inside coughed and black smoke poured out he choked and turned his head away and saw us dont answer if youd rather not i said but what whim of fate put you here i dont know he howled i was president of the largest and most effective environmental protection organization in the country i fought this he braced himself and pedaled again the hum rose and the generator died billy was completely lost he looked to benito but our guide only shrugged benito accepted everything i knew better this couldnt be justice not even big jujus exaggerated justice this was monstrous corbett had to be guessing when he suddenly asked you opposed thermonuclear power plants tbe guy stopped dead staring as if corbett were a ghost the dynamo lurched into action and surrounded him with thick blue smoke thats it isnt it corbett said gently you stopped the nuclear generators i was just a kid during the power blackouts we had to go to school in the dark because the whole country went on daylight saving time to save power but they werent safe he coughed they werent safe how did you know that benito asked we had scientists in our organization they proved it we turned away now i knew i could quit looking for justice in hell there was only macabre humor why should that man be in the inner circles of hell at worst he belonged far above with the bridge destroyers of the second ledge or in heaven he hadnt created this bleak landscape i couldnt stand it i went back benito shrugged and motioned to the others within the cloud of blue smoke his face was slack with exhaustion it wasnt just the problem of where to bury the waste products he told me there was radioactive gas going into the air he spoke as if continuing a conversation i must have been his only audience in years or decades you got a rotten deal i said i wish i could do something he smiled bravely what else is new and he started to pedal i glared at the nothing sky hating big juju carpentier declares war when i looked down benito was fumbling through saddlebags attached to the stationary bicycle the man cried what are you doing benito took out papers the man snatched at them but benito backed away he read dear jon i could understand your opposition to us last year there was some doubt about the process and you expressed fears all of us felt but now you know better i have no witnesses but you told me you understood dr pittmans demonstration in gods name jon why do you continue i ask you as your sister as a fellow scientist as a human being why he began pedaling again ignoring us you knew i demanded he pedaled faster his head bent i leaned down and put my face close to his you knew i screamed fuck off big juju wins again too much but appropriate as we walked away jon screamed after us id have been nothing if i gave up the movement nothing dont you understand i had to stay as president we plunged on once we caught lungfuls of something unidentifiable we were getting used to that by now this time we wound up at the bottom of an erosion gully kicking and twitching unable to control our muscles nnnerve gggas said corbett we lay there for hours days perhaps eventually the wind shifted and our legs could work again benito and corbett scrambled up the side of the gully came back for billy and me as usual we were the last to heal big jujus biological engineers hadnt done as good a job on us we scrambled to the top beyond the gully we saw trees that was all we could see through the sniffles and the tears and the dark smoky air a sharply bordered forest some distance away we began to run trees real living things or close to it nothing was really alive in this terrible place but trees we ran wearing fierce grins noses lifted as if the air were already sweet closer they were not so inviting gnarled trunks black leaves not mother nature herself could have called them pretty clumsy birds flapped above them the forest ended abruptly at a border of flat ground no not ground i stopped at the edge confused the others ran heedlessly out onto the flat black borderland it was a road blacktop and a white double line down the center i called hey wait a things roared past and drowned my voice too fast to tell what they were but i knew the sound the whip of air followed by a shriek of brakes i screamed run corbett was already running for his life benito and billy stared at me then benito just took my word for it and ran toward me billy looked where i was looking and for him it was already too late they looked like black corvettes s models but they were lowerslung and more rakishlooking theyd stopped and turned and were coming back accelerating hugely leaving opaque black clouds of smoke billy made up his mind to run he turned and they were on him billy flew high hit hard and rolled like a beanbag no bones i started swearing the cars roared away two of them did the third turned hard right off the road it rolled over once and landed upright and came for us bouncing and rattling but accelerating its headlights came on blindingly i stopped swearing and looked for cover what are they benito screamed cars no drivers corbett told him i saw empty race cars they must guard the forest i looked for cover something to hide behind or even a jumble of broken rock too rough for a car nothing the black demon bore down on us there i pointed and ran it was an oil slick depth unknown and it would bloody well have to do i ran straight into the pool my foot landed on something that jerked away and sent me sprawling when i pulled my face out of the oil another black dripping face looked back at me sorry i said thats okay we all got our own problems here said the stranger and he sank beneath the oil benito was waist deep and wading deeper corbett hesitated at the edge looked disgusted looked behind him squealed and dived sideways i ducked under the glare of headlights was branded on my closed eyes a wave of oil splashed over me i lifted my head and there it was a rakish black sports car hubcapdeep in the oil pool its motor was a demonsnarl its wheels spun frantically it found some traction from somewhere it edged backward found more traction and surged out of the pool just as corbett went over the door in a flying dive the horn screamed in rage the car backed then turned in a tight circle i think it was trying to roll over it never made it the motor died the killer car rolled to a gentle stop corbett stood up in the drivers seat grinning all over his face the keys dangled from his hand benito and i waded out streaming oil corbett had the hood of the murder car up and was inspecting the motor i used to race a little he said i can probably drive this what do you say shall we cross the desert in comfort you look it over i told him benito and i went to see about billy he lay twisted as no living man could be we straightened him out his body was mushy and limp so was one side of his head the good eye opened and looked at us benito bent over billy and took one of his hands between his own i dont know if you can hear me he said i want you to know that you will heal it will hurt but you will heal i beckoned benito out of billys hearing i asked should we take him with us i think so he will be of no help until he heals but what of that he should be safe enough in an automobile he can ride in the passenger seat we rejoined corbett at the car i dont know the make he told us its got a big mill but the tuning is lousy you saw how much smoke it was pouring out ive been checking the brakes and they look good the question said benito is whether it will obey the steering wheel and other controls we saw it driving itself yeah corbett frowned studying the car as one would search the face of a prisoner of war would he give information would it be the truth the tops down we can always jump clear he said no point in taking chances though why dont you two get under cover and ill take her for a spin there wasnt any cover we stood at the far edge of the oil pool ready to jump as corbett turned the ignition key he drove the car around for a while trying it on rough and smooth terrain he brought it back and prudently took the key before he got out seems okay ill stay in low gear the whole trip that way nothing can happen fast if the gearshift starts moving by itself ill give a yell theres one more problem i said four of us two seats benito shall we ride on the fenders i have no better suggestion the change was gradual the air got hotter then there were no more oil pools the dead ground gave way to hot dead sand and corbett worried aloud about the tires a minute later hed forgotten the tires he was too busy slapping away fat flakes of burning matter chapter it snowed fire great burning flakes fell slowly from the dead gray sky and settled on us we slapped frantically billy was slumped like a corpse while fireflakes dropped to his skin and clung i could reach his head by stretching backward along the fender and i pulled a saucersized chunk from his face his one good eye thanked me we rolled across a burning sandy waste the fireflakes vanished when they touched ground but not when they touched flesh another evil miracle the car weaved drunkenly then shifted into second and picked up speed i called back to corbett did you do that yeah you want to be out here forever not really the sand was flat enough for higher speed provided we could control the car billy grunted in soft protest i could imagine his fear hed never seen a car before or gone faster than a horse could run fire bored into my back where id exposed it stretching to help billy again i slapped it off and wished for a cadillac cadillacs belong in hell theres something about the car that rots the drivers brain every time some damn fool has almost gotten me wrecked by running a red light or jumping lanes or parking where no car ought to be said idiot has been driving a cadillac there had to be cadillacs in hell and if wed captured one of those wed be riding in airconditioned comfort instead of riding a fender and slapping fireflakes clusters of souls danced frenetically on the blazing sand some stopped amazed to watch us pass a couple of times corbett tooted the horn at them he was cursed for his trouble but he wasnt mocking them there was nothing he could do i called across the low hood to benito who are they benito was busy tearing burning gunk out of his hair they sinned against nature he yelled back what does that mean unnatural love man for man woman for woman man for sheep woman for vibrator poor bastards i wondered about the gay couple whod owned the house next door to mine quiet neighbors friendly middleaged people like any married couple without children were they here i turned my head and hunched up so that the fireflakes hit the side of my face instead of the front i couldnt slap fast enough the windshield gave billy some protection now that we were moving the fire burned holes in my skin youll heal carpentier youll heal if we ever get out of here but what about them they danced they slapped at themselves they ran in circles they screamed at us to stop and cursed us when we didnt with an insane jealousy that i understood perfectly theyd be here forever this just for being queer but it was no surprise to me that gods justice and mine didnt agree i thought about my neighbors and shuddered credo in un dia crudel the industrial section of hell was only a yellow tinge to the sky behind us ahead was nothing but more desert we must be about halfway across i thought suddenly the car surged forward with the bit in its teeth corbett froze in panic the motor screamed in inhuman fury as the car accelerated in a second wed be moving too fast to stop i tucked my head in my arms and rolled off the fender look i wasnt running out on my buddies the car was going to crash and theyd have a better chance if one of us could move right it was what i was thinking anyway the motor choked off while i was still in the air i hit rolling i came up screaming and dancing the other souls hadnt been dancing for joy either the pain was as bad as the boiling blood the car rolled to a stop and i ran for it yelling and swearing at the fireflakes suddenly a girl was running alongside me shed have been pretty once now her hair was raggedly scorched and her body was covered with burns can you take me out of here she screamed well be lucky to get out ourselves theres no room i kept running until i reached the car the girl stayed right with me please ill do anything if youll take me out of here anything thats nice corbett told her to me he said were in big trouble the gas pedal just damned well floored itself i had to turn off the ignition couldnt you couldnt i what pull the pedal up with my toes allen this car is haunted it hates us whats wrong the girl asked she got no answer it was hard to think with the fire settling on me i danced around the car shouting wed better think of something in a minute or two well be under a pyramid of people the damned were running toward us from all directions raise the bonnet benito commanded corbett see to billy i got the hood up we looked inside and benito said now corbett move the accelerator something wiggled behind the engine allen you saw that moves the petrol feed you must control it with your fingers it was a hell of an awkward position sprawled across the fender with my head and hands under the hood the motor was as hot as the sand i couldnt avoid touching it but i pulled at the widget and cried okay i got it corbett go go like a bat the crowd was very near and they couldnt all hang on benito motioned to the girl and she took the fender in front of me the car roared and surged into a converging circle most of them dodged for their lives one went under the wheels another a big athletic type with long black hair halfway down his back and a scraggly beard got the edge of the right door and swung up on the trunk lid a smallboned blond man had come with him frank the companion called frank dont leave me sorry gene nothing i can do no room for both of us frank the car gunned ahead as corbett got it under control again a thin voice followed us frank i went to hell for you frank had managed to crawl up to get an arm around corbetts neck he squeezed all right buddy turn this thing around were going to havana fine whatever you say said corbett frank grinned and slacked off his grip on corbett but he didnt let go now we had frank on the trunk billy in the passenger seat groaning a little still unable to move benito on the left front fender me in the motor compartment trying to stay clear of the hot engine my legs dangling out to the right and the girl forward on the right front fender her feet on the bumper corbett had his problems driving he had to lean way out to the left to see around the open hood billy was able to scream now for gods sake brush the fire off him frank corbett yelled screw that screw god too get moving we moved corbett yelled and i slacked off on tha gas to let him shift to second that was fast enough the car fought the hot metal tugged against my fingers like something alive but i could control the speed at least we werent hitting any bumps heeehaaah frank screamed in joy bettern the last chicken run ill make you guys honorary hells angels were tough you know toughest bunch in the world you know hick sheriff was so seared of us he called the state fuzz we run for it i had the lead come around a curve and the whole road was fall of fuzzmobiles i got two fuzz smearing myself your friend back there i shouted gene we did some swinging times man had a whole stable of em boys girls but the only one they let me keep here was gene maybe ill miss him he didnt look back could you get that fire off my leg i asked the girl naw enough trouble holding on here you said youd do anything i clenched my teeth in agony there was fire on both legs now and i couldnt slap i couldnt let go of the spring and i had to hold on with the other hand the car was still fighting me get that fire off or well throw you off awright awright you dont have to get nasty she slapped a couple of times and got the worst away who are you benito asked doreen lancer she yelled above the roaring motor gogo dancer one night some bastard raped me and strangled me at least he tried to rape me she laughed bitterly he didnt seem to know how to go about it so what the hell are you doing here frank demanded dont know i liked it every which way most of the types i meet here are fags im no goddamn fag frank yelled do not blaspheme benito told him predictably i guess fuck off talk to me that way and ill twist this bastards neck off the car lurched as he choked corbett no doreen screamed well crash this is our only way out leave him alone look dont hurt him and when we get out we can really swing right i laughed i couldnt help it whats so funny she demanded its not a romantic situation i bellowed i wasnt even sure there could be sex in hell and i hadnt found any opportunity to try or inclination either i bellowed again when she slapped my testicles it hurt as much as it had when i was alive i pulled the accelerator widget out tugging with all my strength letting the car slow im sorry she yelled i was getting the fire off i swear thats all i was doing im sorry hey you wanna be a threesome with frank and me i let the car speed up again we had to get out of here but id never had an offer i liked less i can see something ahead corbett shouted were getting to the edge about time frank said we rolled on just remember pretty boy im in charge here he added and corbett grunted in pain frank must have emphasized his words the horizon was sharp ahead i could barely see over the motor corbett saw it too kill the power he yelled brakes screeched and he twisted the wheel hard i climbed out of the motor the fireflakes were thicker here than in the middle of the desert we ran hopping frank still had corbett by the neck this the way out of here what are you trying to pull there was a sheer drop ahead of us it was gloomy down there i couldnt see the bottom several hundred feet anyway now what i asked benito the quick way would be to jump he was dead serious jump and wait to heal then go on the girl backed away staring at him youre crazy crazy i should have known better than to trust guys like you all the promises you make she didnt finish but ran back into the desert crying thats done it frank yelled youre sure as hell going over that cliff all right because im going to throw you he had corbett by the neck and he dragged him toward the cliff edge first you then your loudmouth friend then the fat one and then hed forgotten billy we all had it was a mistake for frank billy launched himself from the car without warning he landed on franks back and seized the long hair with one hand pulled the head back and wrapped his arm around franks neck his knee gouged into the hells angels back bowing him into an arc friend i dont think i like you i yelled billy are you all right yeah you werent moving been able to move awhile now didnt seem like a good idea to let this creep know it jerry coulda crashed this thing if we were fightin while it was movin i thought about the selfcontrol it would take to sit still under a rain of sticky fire whatll i do with the gila monster benito leggo i was only kidding frank yelled you guys got no business giving me false hopes it was all your fault he stopped talking because billys arm had closed his throat do not harm him benito said quietly yeah billy let him go friend youre not tough you dont know what tough is now get away from us the paleblue eyes seemed infinitely deep and cold even in this place of fire you may come with us if you like benito told frank although i do not think you are ready with your attitude you might well find a worse place than you have now still you are welcome to join us go to hell frank screamed he thought that was funny go to hell go to hell he ran away into the desert laughing screaming trying to keep both feet off the hot sand at once benito looked at us waiting ill jump if you say so billy said looks bad though i can tell you being crushed flat aint no fun i gulped i will too i wondered if i meant it there may be a better way benito said we must find the stream corbett can you drive we turned left i had the whole fender to sprawl on now the car seemed more docile too but i wasnt going to trust it i didnt really have to i was getting good at manipulating the gas widget we came to a horde of people dressed in the finery of all ages velvet robes flare pants alligator shoes corbett shouted at me stopping he turned off the key before i could do anything and the car rolled to a halt fireflakes fell on us now what corbett was out of the car and looking at a beefy man in gaudy tunic crimson sash and black gloveleather boots there was a big leather wallet hung on a golden chain around his neck and he stared into it not looking up the fireflakes had burned holes in his tunic and scorched his hair corbett stood in front of him when the burly man didnt look up corbett stooped over so that his face was in line with the wallet give me my money corbett shouted you son of a bitch you owe me but ive had this problem see my girl is corbett began i dont want to hear any stories i just want my money arrgh a big fireflake settled on the crown of his head he tried to brush it off hang tough corbett said he came back to the car chuckling long harry there loaned me some cash once six for five every week i nodded there were lots of others there crying into their purses the rain of fire seemed heavier here lets get going i didnt like corbett gloating over them but if anybody deserved to be here it was them loan shark is as low a form of life as there is we didnt drive so fast that we couldnt talk funny thing about harry corbett said he had to give up the loan shark business had a customer with a hit man for a friend took his buddy lem to see harry but harry wouldnt listen just kept saying give me my money so lem had a talk with harry lem billy asked he sounded puzzled yeah i dont know what he told harry but just after that all of harrys customers were off the hook just had to pay what theyd got in the first place lem billy said little guy about my size big scar over his left eye yeah corbett said you know him kind of they used to let him onto the island for a day one day a year the rest of the time he was out in the blood i always did wonder why we are coming to the stream benito said the fire does not fall there chapter the river was narrow but fast its roar was different somehow from that of water and it was still bright scarlet the air was thick with the smell of blood nonetheless we walked down and bathed our halfbroiled feet in it afterward we walked the cool mud of the bank with our sandals off until we reached the waterfall there we watched endless tons of blood falling into the darkness i said now what benito scowled in indecision it is a risk the monster geryon carried dante and vergil into lower hell but they wereon a holy errand we are not i have known geryon he is not worthy of trust the password i remembered this has been willed where what is willed must be yes shall we try it bettern jumping billy looked at benito it is aint it what can he do to us eat us summon minos lets try it said corbett weve gotten this far without anyone doing that are we agreed then good now we must summon geryon we need a signal something to get his attention dante flung a rope into the abyss a signd said corbett does it have to be subtle i should not think that subtlety would be necessary we wouldnt want geryon to think were crude would we some delicate change in the environment just noticeable enough to attract his attention let me see corbett walked back to the car and switched on the ignition he went around to the back and unscrewed the gas cap a fireflake fell past his nose he blew on it guiding it into the gas tank the tank lit with a whoosh hurriedly corbett reached into the car and shifted it into first gear we stood well back and watched it roll over the edge subtlety is all said corbett the car fell like a battlefield flare it passed and illuminated a compact body already rising through the murk he knew we were here corbett was flat on his belly with his face over the cliffs edge we didnt need a signal he will not come without a signal said benito the car was a towering flame at the base of the cliff lighted from below geryon was a compact shadow with a slender twisting tail he floated up to us his features growing clear he hovered at our height smiled reassuringly at us with a startlingly human face then slid forward onto the rock ledge leaving his tail hanging free in space geryon was as big as a rowboat and wingless his hind feet were webbed built for swimming his almost human head was hairless the mouth wide the chin broad and strong the nose very wide and flat with large nostrils the head sloped back to round shoulders without benefit of neck his arms were human enough the size of my own on geryon they were disproportionately small something was funny about the hand the fingers were short and thick designed for ripping i could see him as an airbreathing aquatic beast that had developed human intelligence i wondered about his nose it was big enough to feed him air fast hooded to keep water out reasonable but different from the cetacean design his pelt had the look of medieval tapestry golden knots and figures on a bluegray background lovely a trifle flashy and adequate camouflage if he was used to hovering just beneath sunlit water altogether he was a believable alien excluding his ability to fly i didnt like that bad enough if infernoland had been built by humans what if it had been built by interstellar conquerors for their own amusement geryons voice was deep with a queer buzzing quality hello benito three of them isnt that a bit much benito was brusque he didnt like geryon this has been willed where what is willed must be in any case you must have noticed how the damned flow in like a river in flood havent i just swamping you are they i think the end of the world must be near hell is getting full said the alien well we who serve gods will in hell have precious little of free will eh benito climb aboard you i hope you all can hang on he had spoken jovially with no bitterness and only the merest trace of mockery my foot kicked something rigid as i tried to board geryons reasonably flat back i looked down it wasnt easy to see but there was metal belted about geryons belly machinery covered with material the same color as his gaudy pelt antigravity i settled behind the monsters head billys arms closed about my waist corbett was behind him and benito last braving the twin stings in the forked tail geryon grinned at me over his shoulder and pushed back from the edge billys arms tightened convulsively i saw that his eyes were closed tight his teeth clenched my view of hell was darkness and firelit smokes the fires tracing concentric arcs geryon tilted to one side and dropped in a slow spiral the scarlet waterfall dashed itself to foam and spray on the rocks billy was squeezing the breath from me but i didnt complain i heard whimpering noises being squeezed from him we touched down i said your first flight billy yeah were down you can let go yeah he unlocked his arms in stages and climbed down on shaky legs i followed geryon floated up a few feet and hovered hey benito he called his voice was full of artificial camaraderie more menacing than threats why is it benito that the people you travel with dont ever come back the monster lifted toward the sky chortling carefully casual corbett asked benito youve been here before i have rescued others benito answered how many six one at a time no matter how many come with me at first no more than one at a time ever seems to reach the exit point perhaps this time we will be more fortunate what happens to the others i asked why did you come back corbett demanded wed both spoken at once and benito chose to answer neither of us have you seen the exit corbett asked benitos voice was colorlessly grim yes and gone beyond it no but it follows dantes route which leads to purgatory i came back to find others in need of guidance do you object allen carpentier should i have left you in the bottle hey hey hey billy was dancing with impatience if were going lets go whats all the jawing about benito nodded and led us off downslope we felt exposed on level ground and geryon couldnt be the only flying thing he hadnt reported us but that was no guarantee that something else wouldnt we moved swiftly across what seemed to be solid rock always downhill further into murk and gloom until we came to a cliff edge there was a ditch in front of us seventy or eighty feet deep and perhaps twice that wide it was divided in the middle by a low wall of rock just off to our left was a passageway in the dividing rock wall the divider was low enough that we could see over it lower than the height of a normal man and the ditch was full masses of humanity moved in a standard traffic pattern all hurrying along not quite running leftbound on the far side rightward on the near side they moved fast they moved fast because there were beings with whips urging them along it took a moment for that to register okay carpentier youre in hell and there are demons in hell there were things on the redhot wall that might have been demons if you could have seen them clearly through the fog theres geryon certainly a monster of course big juju can make demons but i hadnt wanted to believe it now i was looking at them they were blackskinned rather than the red id expected and they were at least ten feet tall they had horns and tails and were uglier than i could have imagined they used whips twice as long as themselves they screamed at the laggards along with you big morris theres no ass to sell here git along little dogie git along git along wails and groans rose from the pit and screams of pain and rage snapl crack chunks of flesh flew from the backs of those who slowed down who whispered corbett he ran out of voice and had to try again who are they he was frightened and why not i was scared out of my mind the demons were looking up at us but they went back to their tasks gleefully lashing the crowd i recognized one of the runners he was a famous movie directorproducer idolized by millions when i was younger he was on the near side but as he reached the passageway in the dividing wall the demon stationed there lashed him until he went through and joined those scurrying in the other direction id never met him but i knew who he was and i knew who these people must be benito confirmed my suspicions panderers on this side seducers on the other come we must find a bridge he turned left and we followed uncertainly i was a seducer corbett said uncertainly i remembered the convention atmosphere and what happened the night before i died me too benito snorted did you ever have a woman against her will no or make her drunk or drug her well did pot count nobody who didnt know what to expect never had to corbett said matteroffactly or use threats of force dont be silly corbett resented the implication i told you it wasnt necessary the italian does not properly translate as your english seducer which is hardly more than casual fornication benito said seriously i think perhaps the better word is rape now we could see the bridge ahead of us a stone arch it looked very old jerry a voice called from the pit jerry come on down jerry you belong here it stopped corbett cold he looked down into the pit julia come on down jerry share everything with me you taught me how jerry how can a girl be a rapist i demanded she was or had been quite pretty but now her face was distorted by pain and exhaustion the demons were watching her stand there as she panted and shouted up to corbett and they didnt interfere deceit fraud said benito those who induce others to what they know is wrong as well as those who force their will on others i turned to corbett and shut up carpentier none of your business closed my mouth you taught me everything jerry she was calling i could still love you come down with me where else can you go now out down to the center and out corbett screamed to her the demons howled maniac laughter the girl laughed with them oh jerry do you believe that dont you know that the deeper you go the worse it is and you cant ever go back and you cant get out its worse down there jerry wait till you see whos below us here you have me jerry stay where you belong theres no escape down there dont you know whats carved on the gates of hell jerry all hope abandon im not afraid of whats below corbett was getting hysterical i never did any of the things they punish you down there for she laughed again the only perfect man who ever lived are you sure jerry then why do they let you go there and what makes you think youll get justice anyway come down with me before its too late to hyeeee the demons had called time on her crack snap the whips sounded like popcorn popping julia sprinted screaming with the rest the flesh of my back rippled i wanted to shut my ears come benito took corbetts arm come do not let her seduce you again uh corbett looked at benito as if hed only just met him it did happen that way now you mention it or did it maybe i do belong in that pit if you do you will be there for the moment you are not ergo come along we walked in silence each wrapped in his own thoughts what if the girl was right were we plunging deeper and deeper never to return what was below us had i committed any of the appropriate cnmes benito whats ahead his dry lecture voice couldnt mask the screaming as we walked the rim no more not again wait im in the wrong place it was just one book just one i needed the money you big ugly sonofabitch you crack of the ten bolgias canyons of this circle of hell this is the only divided one each canyon is crossed by a bridge except that all the bridges are down across the sixth canyon we must descend into it it will be no problem benito how in gods name can you ignore those screams corbett demanded they have no more than they deserve benito said simply either he hadnt the empathy of a turtle or or what now we will have trouble at the fifth bolgia it is the pit of grafters and the demons are on the rim not down in the canyon ugh id forgotten most of the inferno but i could never have forgotten that image a troop an army of devils illmannered and sadistic a military organization of ugly hate theyd almost got dante despite his safeconduct whats after this circle we had reached an arching bridge of rough stone it had no handrails and was about ten feet wide a slender arch above that pit of screaming runners it sloped up so steeply that i dropped to all fours to climb jerry come down jerry it was the girl again corbett stiffened whats next i prompted benito after the ten canyons what will we find very little benito answered the great ice plain where traitors are punished those who betrayed their blood kin or their benefactors not me corbett said he seemed to feel better and then we cross to the very center there is a hole we crawl through it past the center of the world and find ourselves climbing up again and i can believe as much of that as i like certainly why should you not believe it benito was genuinely puzzled its nonsense said corbett wed be in freefall by the time we got there jerry corbett shuddered the voice floated upward again dont be a fool jerry its bad down there at the center and they never let you out did i really put her there corbett wondered maybe i have betrayed a benefactor she was kind to me and come on no womans worth what theyre gettin billy said we stick together i never let a buddy down in my life and im goin down to the center now come on corbett lost some of his tension if youre really billy the kid thats right at least thats what the movies showed he began moving again over the arch of the bridge and downward benito your deseription is still nonsense not only would there be freefall at the center of the earth but this isnt earth to begin with a cavity this size under the earth can you imagine the pressures and wed get seismograph readings on it with every earthquake no we have to be somewhere else sure i said infernoland somebody built it following dante but the geographys been the same as the inferno all the way so far so what do we care if its an artifact it is an artifact benito said in the sense that god designed and built it okay said corbett i was never a good atheist not a churchman either still benito ive seen designs for bigger structures than this bigger than earth for that matter our real problem is did dante really see this place himself and can we trust his reports that was a good question but i had a better one how far could we trust benito he had never mentioned earlier trips just how did benito get back uphill after those trips how did he earn this privilege of running free through hell geryon had said we when speaking of both himself and benito we who serve gods will in hell benito was an unlikely angel and geryon an untrustworthy witness i reminded myself but this was the devils realm and benito wandered at whim all right carpentier just what is the punishment for a soul who defies gods final command god or big juju i had plenty of evidence that he was vindictive he put me in the vestibule and i violated my sentence minos warned me is this the final retribution against carpentier to go even deeper into hell with no way back to find my own level and have it worse than he condemned me to or suppose this really is infernoland a bigger and more powerful builders playground why would the geryontype engineers have built anything but the inferno they clearly enjoyed seeing humans suffer would they get a similar kick from human pleasure all the professors told me the inferno was by far the most interesting of the three books of the divine comedy benito was talking again i have always assumed that dante made his trek in a vision when he woke he had forgotten many of the details he filled them in with research in theology and dogma and philosophy and natural history and with his own whims and prejudices and special hatreds but the basic vision was sound and true be careful here the bridge dropped steeply at the end the inner rim of the trench was twenty feet lower than the outer we went down backward the lip of another pit was a hundred yards away a cacaphony of sound rose from it we stopped for a moment for instance benito said dantes work gives the impression that he met large numbers of italians sounds perfectly reasonable to me said corbett we tried to laugh but this wasnt a place for laughing benito merely continued as if he hadnt heard improbable numbers of italians large numbers of famous ancients he met writers poets politicians but no hottentots eskimos askaris or american indians this seems unlikely then you dont trust dante after all jerry that was not my point i said benito weve met an embarrassing sufficiency of americans billy laughed plenty on the island too benito was startled its true and hilda kroft and i met germans and man tends to notice his own folks said billy lets get moving we angled toward a bridge spanning the next ditch benito still looked disturbed why that disturbed me the smell stopped us joltingly at the second pit it was like being dropped into a sewer we didnt even try to look over the edge whos down there billy asked flatterers benito said shortly and turned toward the bridge we followed i dont get it corbett said in every place of power throughout all time the rulers have been surrounded by flatterers in many places flattery has been the path to power and wealth in others it is only a good living yet everywhere the flatterers tend to push aside the men of real wisdom flattery is so much safer than telling unpleasant truths not in america said corbett this i doubt said benito but you should know best never buttered up the boss i sure have said billy i felt uncomfortable what was i doing at the moment i died but flattering the fans i glanced over at corbett and he looked no better flattery wed all tried it what did they do to flatterers we clustered at the bridge approach and stood looking at it the smell was thick as putty i could feel it clinging to me and i squirmed corbett said how are we going to cross that fast i said dont breathe i didnt move i hadnt worked up the nerve come on pals billy hit the bridge at a dead run as he went over the arch and disappeared from view we heard him yell the other side of the bridge would be steep i hoped hed rolled to the end and not over the edge i wasnt ready to dive in after him and i didnt hear anyone else volunteer billy i shouted there was no answer hes all right corbett said his voice was hollowly reassuring sure he is we looked at each other we took deep breaths we scrambled up the arch and when we could stand we ran was billy down there i made the mistake of looking from the top of the arch down into a river of shit chestdeep a respectable crowd waded through it disgust can freeze you as solid as fear at my side corbett stopped to look where i was looking he made a retching sound took my arm and tried to pull me on i couldnt move id recognized someone i knew i called down george heads turned up they were disguised by what was smeared across their faces but that was george all right i tried to remember his last name and couldnt but he knew me he shrank away with his sticky arms hiding his sticky head benito had come back up the bridge billy is safe he spoke with the pinched voice of a man holding his breath who was that an old friend an advertising man wrote fiction in his spare time not very good stories but he wasnt a bad guy how did he get here immoderate flattery there is no other way to reach this pit allen jerome there is no profit in standing here you cannot enjoy the view immoderate flattery it fit in a way big jujus way most advertising is immoderate praise of a product or its users but like every other torture id seen in hell it was just too damned much i wanted to tell george what that hed been wronged that id get justice for him no matter what it took that i couldnt save him and i couldnt save myself and everything was useless because we were in the hands either of a cruel god or heartless aliens i dont know but id remembered one of his own ads and i shouted it down to him it was not to mock him only to get his attention you deserve to belong to the xanadu country club the response was an explosion of voices smeared stinking heads rose mocking voices called the wethead is dead arent you glad you use dial dont you wish everybody did im glenda fly me hazel it turned blue always have always will and we three who peered into the moat we saw where the shit came from another macabre joke every one of them had been fitted with a second anus it became apparent only when they tried to speak corbett bent double heaving a ghost trying to expel emptiness from the ghost of his belly i tried to help him but he backed away fast he didnt want to be touched the convulsions went on and on i tried to turn away from the edge but it was too late george screamed up at me in agony allen why im sorry i should have left him alone benito spoke in an actors voice calm but carrying there is a way out of hell he got insults and laughter but a few listened you must climb the pit cooperate if you must it will be hard but you can do it if you try long enough then you must move inward the route to heaven is at the center of hell smeared faces turned away george stayed to answer his laugh had tears in it me in heaven with shit dribbling down my chin id rather stay here another called listen when you get there tell him tell god we will praise him day and night i have written a new hymn to his name tell him benito turned sadly away i looked for corbett and found him at the outer end of the bridge he was crying and hiccoughing and trying to run i shouted corbett wrong way he turned no chance i dont belong here im supposed to be in the winds youll never get up the cliff i will somehow i will i belong up there not down here with he flapped his arms helplessly corbett had no word for these thoroughly damned souls with whom corbett would not associate he went away from us billy was waiting at the inner end of the bridge he watched us come down then wheres jerry benito shook his head pride he was too proud to stay part iii chapter the third gully was narrower and cleaner from the edge it looked empty so that i wondered if there were a sin nobody would commit or one nobody thought of but lights danced dimly down there from the arch it was clearer i made out long rows of holes cut into the stone the holes had raised stone rims most of them were occupied each by a pair of human feet sticking straight up into the air the feet danced flames burned on their soles another obsolete sin said benito selling holy offices simony billy said huh i translated for him those guys would take money to make you a priest there were signs by some of the holes wharton school of theology earn your thd in just ten weeks write registrar for application and another meditation the new way to inner peace and serenity meet the greatest guru of all time registration fee billy was aghast god does that to them just for that they stole what belongs to god benito said there are popes in those baptismal fonts and many others the denomination does not seem important what matters is the sale of the gifts of god why would aliens care about that well carpentier benito i dont like it here billy said i patted his shoulder me neither lets get out i felt the urge to run at least i was safe from this pit we all were wed never had heavenly gifts to sell the bridge over the fourth gully was just ahead and i glanced into it from the top intending to run on past the strange sight held me the damned flowed beneath us and their heads had been turned back to front most of them were women fortune tellers benito said before i could ask they tried to see the future by magic and now they were not even allowed to watch where they were going i shivered thinking that a sciencefiction writer might well end up here but no id never used magic only logic and it hadnt kept me out of hell why arent all the scientists and economic prognosticators here i asked they try to foresee the future most of these appealed to satan for aid he gave it to them or not it is the appeal that weighs against them he turned to move on then i recognized one of the damned a little elderly lady very prim and proper shed been a teacher in my nephews school now she walked with her head tamed backward and tears ran down her spine and between her buttocks i screamed the damned looked up at me mrs herrnstein why i shouted she looked away then she stopped and looked up face and back turned toward us shed always been thin and id never thought of her as particularly feminine certainly she wasnt feminine now i belong here mr carpentier she called please leave i dont want to be watched you belong here i could not see mrs herrnstein with a crystal ball yes whenever i had a pupil who had difficulty learning to read i used i was a bad teacher mr carpentier you were a good teacher you taught hal more in a year than he learned in five i was a good teacher with good pupils but i could not be bothered with the ones who werent so bright if they had trouble learning to read i said they had dyslexia are you here because of bad diagnoses this was monstrous dyslexia is not a diagnosis mr carpentier it is a prediction it is a prediction that says that this child can never learn to read and with that prediction on his record why strangely enough none of them ever do unless they happen on a teacher who doesnt believe in educationese witchcraft but it was witchcraft mr carpentier please go now she walked on crying uncontrollably her face toward us as she walked away i watched until she was out of sight she does not belong here i insisted then perhaps she will not be here long benito answered dispassionately yet you will note that she did not agree with your judgment then shes wrong too why do you feel so competent to judge everyone allen get it through your thick head that its big juju im judging it is god you are judging he thundered all right its god im judging if he can judge me i claim the right to judge him billy seemed horrified by what i was saying i was sorry for that but benito laughed and said how will you implement your judgment against god himself the only possible answer to that was a feeble one maybe but i used it by withholding my worship benito do you realize that the god you worship keeps a private torture chamber hardly private private or public the god allen carpentier worships will have to meet higher standards than that benito didnt speak for a moment then he said we must hope our shouting was not heard look ahead from our position at the top of the arch we had a good view of the rims of the next gully on both sides of the gap horned black demons moved they were larger than men a little smaller than the demons in the first ditch but like them they had horns and tails and their skin was black ebony very different from a black mans skin they carried pitchforks certainly said benito i couldnt help grinning a little pitchforks id forgotten that detail had walt disneys cartoonists ever realized why their devils carried pitchforks they must not see us benito said none of us are safe from them they guard the pit of the grafters of those who stole from positions of trust billy shuddered reckon theyd like me he said guess i took a few things from my bosses in my day not much but some not me freelance writers dont have bosses i said then i remembered the advance from omniverse publishing nine years before i died somehow the novel had never jelled and lets play it safe here carpentier demons wouldnt understand the publishing business there was cover at the bottom of the bridge it was all a jumble of boulders we waited our chance then sprinted down the bridge while none of the demons were nearby we were hidden before another group came past we huddled together between the rocks too bad the bridges are staggered i whispered we could have gone right across the next bridge was thirty or forty yards to the left with a troop of twentyodd demons between for us this is the second most dangerous place in hell whispered benito we must reach the next bridge without being seen cross at a dead run and do not stop at the next pit run straight into it there are no bridges in any case and we could not reach one if any existed the demons are on both sides of the pit billy shifted restlessly dont like running from nothing we must benito said simply he pointed a demon strode past a roughly human form nine feet tall equipped with horns and hooves and a twitching tail a capriform humanoid how glib carpentier capriform humanoid demon why play games with yourself the demon was carrying a human being carrying him like a bowling ball his claws inserted deep into the mans back the man writhed and struggled the demon didnt seem to notice he called to three of the others how many new yorkers this week they joined him in front of our rock one twitched his tail up to his mouth teeth like butcher knives gnawed at the end twelve make it thirteen and its still thursday on earth if hideous wins the pool again ill rip his face off you could forget to report this one why not the first demon lifted his human burden to study it he hardly counts anyway he stole a few hundred bucks from a friend who needed an eye operation he addressed the man you wont tell on us will you no i swear said the man his voice was choked with agony and you wont show your head above the pitch because if we see any sign of you the demon hefted his pitchfork suggestively well pull you out and tear you in little pieces and scatter you widely it hurts a lot i wont tell said the man good said the demon holding him and he flung him the man dropped below the rim with a mournful howl that ended in a sound half splash half thud whats down there billy whispered i answered boiling pitch whatd he do graft i kept wanting to try to save him benito said i would not save him if i could the demons passed on like the warriors around the lake of blood they looked always into the pit always away from us if we were careful we could move one at a time flitting from rock to rock to gotcha a demon shouted and i had a heart attack right out there between two inadequate boulders all they had to do was come and collect me but they werent looking they were clumped at the rim jabbing down a human form came up dripping gobbets of black pitch and trying to wriggle free of the tines of two pitchforks i heard boss tweed aint it we been checking with some of those dead men thatre supposed to have voted your ticket hold him crazyred the man lurched free of one pitchfork but the other held him fast they beached him they began to play with him i touched billys shoulder dont look we can get a good way while theyre busy we crawled like snakes by the time the shade of tweed had stopped screaming we were opposite the bridge i looked back once and had to close my eyes the demons had opened him up and spread him out like a frog in biology class but unlike the frog he was still trying to get away benito crouched like a sprinter ready yeah right we ran i heard a great bass roar of rage i didnt look back but as i went over the arch last in line i saw that the demons on the far side of the gully were running to meet us one was going to make it i stopped only for an instant then i plunged down the arch behind benito but billy had doubled his speed the demon reached the end of the bridge off balance and skidding come to poppa he roared and swung his pitchfork around he was a nanosecond late billy shot past the tines and ran up the demon and swarmed over the huge head the demon bellowed and tried to reverse eighteen feet of iron pitchfork benito slammed shoulderfirst into his knee the demon halfturned and i hit the other knee sideways both huge legs went out from under the demon left him blind and falling half a ton of demon slammed into the rock billy rolled away the demon moaned and tried to gather his knees to his chest now run cried benito billy a troop of demons was almost on us i raced for the next pit stopped at the edge where was billy billy had retrieved the demons pitchfork and was raising it for the kill i yelled never mind that and then it was just too late billy yelled triumph and brought the pitchfork down hard he raised it for another thrust and they had him i jumped into space alongside benito threeinch fingernails clicked shut behind my neck chapter the side of the gully was rough rock falling almost sheer i glimpsed it in freefall and when i saw that there were no handholds i simply gave up a couple of seconds later i lay broken at the bottom staring up at the nonsky in the sea of pain i couldnt tell what was broken and what was only braised but i remembered that youre not supposed to move an accident victim i didnt try to move rustling near me benito over here are you hurt yes me too we are out of their path i think we need only wait to heal whose path i was afraid to turn my head but i turned my eyes i found myself looking up along the fluted robe of a lifesized golden statue no information there i said what about billy poor billy his urge to violence betrayed him dont be so damned philosophical weve got to get him out of their hands how well first we wait to heal i guess where would they put him in the pitch with the tammany types look up along the edge of the gully something like an endless length of rope was falling in loops across the sky it dropped very slowly as if almost weightless as it came near i saw that it was thicker than rope and there was a tuft on the end where had i seen something like that recently above our heads it hesitated then descended like a blind worm for seconds it was hidden behind the rock slope then it began to rise and the end was coiled around something that moved billy minos i said its his tail yes before we could move billy would be back on the island in the river of blood or in the river itself hed left the island of his own free will he was beyond our reach i sighed and turned my eyes from the tiny struggling figure and the infinite sprawl of minos tail and the statue had moved it had gone past me about one yard i turned my head regardless of consequence my neck wasnt broken and there were two bare human feet beneath the hem of the golden robe one moved a good six inches as i watched benito there are men in those things and women too said benito religious hypocrites he stood up carefully testing to see if anything had healed apparently it had he tried to help me up but pain yelped in my ribs i sat down against the slope to wait some more golden robes moved past like snails there were men and women in those golden idols but i saw only bare feet and shadowed faces within enormous hoods one stopped and turned with the same excruciating slowness that characterized his walk and said are you lost benito said we werent i asked are you why no i think this is my proper place his accent was thick and hard to identify i have been here long enough to be convinced that god thinks so too how long is that over a thousand years have passed on earth im told thats a little hard to swallow i said the english language isnt that old i know said the priest we teach each other i learned this language from one who came here recently an amie semple macpherson there is little else to do as we wander this endless channel and you may imagine that it is easier to teach each other than to search for some companion who speaks our own language why i asked dont you stop and sit down the tired gray eyes studied me from within the golden cowl i could fall on you but it may be that you do not know what you say if i stop this robe grows hot it is too hot now it grows hot slowly and it grows cool slowly now goodbye he began to turn away benito said we could walk along with you that would please me he finished his turn and took one lurching footstep i got up the ruined ribs only twinged how heavy is that robe i asked i never weighed it they tell me it is gilded lead perhaps a ton what did you do does it matter i was young i had not been a priest for many years but the end of the thousand years since christ was born were drawing to a close people began to fear the end of the world i urged them to give away their property to the church we became very wealthy you could have given it back afterwards we did not did all of you end up here the whole order no some truly thought the world would end some believed a wealthy church could serve souls better but i never believed the second coming could be predicted and i enjoyed the wealth i do you need to know more it was a good thing to be in the church in those days benito tapped my shoulder and pointed there is our way out the rubble from the bridge it had been a bridge high and arching like those wed crossed before now it was a sloping pile of shattered rock i looked at it curiously but it didnt seem different from any other rock id seen and i could see that normal laws of material strength didnt hold down here it wasnt a surprise what happened to it i wondered earthquake i am told that all hell shook at the moment of christs death said the expriest so says dante benito added afterwards he came to hell and threw down the great gate in the wall of dis he must have been mad about something i suppose being crucified could do that to you i would be less flippant allen look around you before i could answer benito had started climbing the ruined bridge it was still a ridiculous picture christ was supposed to be gentle using a whip on the temple moneychangers was one thing behaving like a comicbook hero was something else i tried to imagine the bleeding wounded nearnaked figure ripping those tremendous iron gates from their hinges while the halo flamed angrily about his head then gave it up and climbed up after benito i tested each foothold but some of the slabs slid down anyway near the top the rockslide ended and we climbed by fingerholds and toeholds there it was that i had to repress a sudden violent urge to giggle benito wouldnt have appreciated it but no wonder christ was so upset some clerk must have tried to hand him form dty the seventh pit was enormous i stood at the end of the bridge and marveled at the thin fairyspan arching across carbon steel wouldnt have taken the stress yet it was made of stone without mortar like the fallen bridge behind us another miracle and so what we started across it was dark down there what i could see had a vaguely reptilian flavor to it constant slow slitherings and sudden flurries of violent motion benito pulled at my arm why do you dawdle allen whats down there thieves theft is the most profitable of sins and very popular tell me allen do you expect to see anything that pleases you he had me there i didnt but im a writer ive got ten mens curiosity whats the hurry are we in danger here i remind you that we are fugitives i stared in astonishment geryon could have stopped us minos could have stopped us they didnt the demons behind us would have oh very well allen the real danger is at the next pit we must cross that quickly okay and i looked down again reptilian yeah there were men and women down there and lizards ranging in size from chihuahua to great dane and snakes whose range was even greater i watched a tiny scarlet lizard leap from a crack in a rock to bite a man on the neck the man burned like flash paper dazzling me when i looked again he was congealing from a cloud of smoke benito was watching me not them let him wait the land was strewn with rocks of all sizes a stout grayhaired woman came toward us running a tortuous path her eyes fixed on her path it didnt help somehow she stepped between tworocks and fell sprawling yelling in despair the python that had been following her caught up as she tried to run on the ruined foot it climbed her leg and bit her on the navel woman and snake they lay immobile they began to change allen i made a shushing gesture they were changing the snake sprouting arms and legs and head hair the woman melting into a smooth limbless shape presently there was nothing left of the woman the slender man who had been a snake stood up smiling thanks gladys he said and walked away he stole her shape i said ill be buggered he stole her shape she will grow it back in life she was probably a buyer of stolen goods what do you call it a fence yeah wow are you ready yeah i turned and followed him wow he stole her shape how does a sciencefiction writer explain that a computerdrawn hologram could be it was pretty dark down there but i didnt believe it the bridge dipped we climbed down benito turned left on the ledge between the seventh and eighth pits benito was clearly uneasy interesting things were happening in the darkness on my left but i looked into the darkness on my right for the danger benito expected it looked like a swarm of fireflies or like a freeway seen from an airplane or this aye night this aye night every night and all fire and sleet and candlelight and christ receive thy soul sleet id found in the circle of gluttons and fire on the desert here at last was the candlelight huge candle flames moving in darkness from the next bridge it was no clearer benito kept trying to hurry me along you will not see anything here are you so fond of hell that you would linger slender flames moved down there in the yellowandblack murk and stopped and clustered beneath us i said who are they dante calls this the bolgia of the evil counselors that doesnt tell me a lot and i still dont know what youre afraid of a voice answered from below a voice with little of the human in it it thrummed like a harp it was coming from the tip of one of the huge flames he is afraid of his own homecoming i looked at benito he nodded not looking at me come down one of the flames called to benito it was eerily compelling that thrumming voice the tip of the flame wavered turned to me throw him down you if youre an american thats mussolini benito mussolini jolted i turned to benito he shrugged mussolini another voice thrummed from the pit you are american i know your accent do you understand thats mussolini throw the bastard down here where he belongs who are you does it matter i approved the firebombing of dresden a british voice spoke from the flames and i led the mission we may belong here yank but so does that eytie swine benito was backing away when i went toward him he turned and ran i caught him at the edge of the next pit and tripped him he fell heavily to the ground and i sat on him he was no match for me mussolini i shouted i pulled you out of a jinn bottle he protested and led me here deeper into hell i knew it all along mussolini what better choice for the devils agent to wander through hell corrupting souls already half corrupted hitler was probably loose too if wed run across him id have guessed earlier i remembered all my suspicions and all the unexplained things that had happened on the trip down no wonder he could give orders well i knew who he was now and i knew where he belonged we were at the edge of the ninth pit but i took him by the heels and dragged him back to the eighth he thrashed like a fish he clutched at rocks and pulled a couple out of the ground for all the good that did him the pit flamed beneath us with the crowd gathered to welcome benito home i rolled him over the edge he gave a low cry as he dropped before he struck bottom he burst into flame his was very bright brighter than most around him i turned and went on chapter i walked until i had to stop until the ground dropped away at my feet there i stood like a machine whose program has ran out after all where would i go now i was utterly alone with nobody to tell me about the geography of hell or warn me of the dangers or make me go deeper into horror after horror when all i wanted to do was stop mussolini benito mussolini il duce of italy he hadnt even tried to deny it what an idiot id been why hadnt i recognized him with that massive square jaw and high forehead i remembered reading about him in history books benito mussolini had escaped from his castle prison in a glider flown by hitlers commando skorzeny one of the most romantic figures of that war no wonder benito could fly a glider mussolini the fascist he invented fascism killer and leader of killers thug ally of adolf hitler back to the anonymous flame mussolini evil genius behind the italian king down you go benito who poured me from a bottle i stood there a long time before i realized what i was seeing in the ninth pit the damned staggered and lurched slipping in bloody mud leaving more blood to make the path more slippery for those behind they seemed dazed survivors of some lost battle one showed no obvious wounds except for his erect posture and painfully stiff walk i stared at his face where a macabre joke had been played it was pale and lean and calm no one would have guessed that he was in pain but the eyes burned with hate the mustache was in an unfamiliar style straight but twice the width of his mouth and the sharp white canine teeth protruding over his lower lip would have had anyone over the age of six shouting vampire well ahead of him was a sturdy fat man with a striking bearded face and blood running from a cut throat the face was familiar i studied him trying to remember where id seen that face he stared back then he roared in fury wrapped in a shakespearean accent varlet who might you be that stare so arrogantly at england huh i shook myself carp carpenter come down woodworker and i will have your eyes nailed shut i realized i had been staring rudely at people who had trouble enough without that more of big jujus victims sorry does it help if i tell you the wounds will heal i could see the shock rippling down the line and suddenly they were all screaming curses and waving their fists one man threatened with his severed arm held like a club dolt ass who mocks us what did i say you cannot be such a fool england cried we are nearly healed now we reach the point in the circle where he stopped looking ahead forgetting me entirely i see him now he said in a voice without life or hope i looked the bridge was ahead of them and under it was a kingsized version of all the other demons wed passed twenty feet tall carrying a slender sword he grinned showing teeth nearly a foot long i had to cross the bridge anyway i walked toward the demon he was killing them they marched toward him hanging back when they could until others pushed ahead and he killed them he picked a man up and sliced him from the crotch to the throat set him down and let him walk on empathic pain lashed through me and a line from a joke ran crazily through my head about a cowboy whod been thrown onto a barbed wire fence hed shown texas courage hed remounted the horse and gone on of course he had to let the stirrups out a little the fat man looked sick and scared his face clicked suddenly into place a painting very famous henry the eighth i kept walking i was crossing the bridge when henry reached the demon the sword was not a sword i saw now it was an overdeveloped fingernail on an overdeveloped middle finger as thick as a strong mans thigh it flicked like a rapier and severed henrys head and the demon handed henry his head and henry walked on the sharp horn tip of the sword flicked suddenly up before my face i stopped who may you be privileged one who run so free through hell i got my throat working allen carpenter where away carpenter i dont know inward with all the feelings that had been burnt out of me one was left curiosity whatever benito had planned for me it lay downward inward the dead had stopped to wait with understandable patience for the demon to finish his conversation i waved downward who are they the demon seemed in no hurry sowers of discord people who advocated hatred started wars refused to end wars you know the opposite of the peacemakers this is a special collection religious schizmatics generally founded their own churches for their own purposes you want political types or lawyers who talked people into divorces they didnt want and lawsuits they didnt need youve got to go to another part of the pit oh the demon looked fondly at englands receding back henry there wanted a divorce the church wouldnt give him one so he made himself a church that would clever on the evidence not very the demon stooped to pick up the man with the fu manchu mustache and the vampire teeth dracula here didnt found any churches he dracula i thought he was dammit he was just a legend there are legends about him in his homeland transylvania mothers still frighten their children with his name dracula was just a title means dragon his real name was vlad they called him vlad tepes vlad the impaler he spent his whole life torturing and killing turks in the name of christ otherwise hed be uphill eyelash deep in boiling blood about half the people he killed were his own subjects by the way small wonder vlad the impaler walked funny a wooden stake was sticking two feet out of his anus the demon didnt need his sword he just pushed the stake up until it didnt show set the man down and let him walk on walking funny the demon picked up another johann here was the only man god would reveal the exact time of doomsday to he could save a small party of the chosen chosen by him that is all you had to do was turn all your property over to him the demon grinned enormously and you carpenter did you ever create a church of your very own oh boy the swords bloody tip swung away and back rapierquick i ducked and ran i fell flat on the bridge as the sword flashed again the demon couldnt quite get at me at that angle but the arch of the bridge dipped low there at the end i rose to sprint position poised took off at the base of the arch the sword flicked toward me at knee height i jumped it and kept running right across and into the space above the next pit the side was steep i hit once and bounced and hit the bottom very hard there was no unconsciousness in hell there was only pain and the awful strain of trying to draw a breath deep down behind the pain a tiny voice was saying you dont need to breathe carpentier youre dead but i wanted to breathe i needed to breathe and not a sip of air could i draw eventually the air did come in sips then gulps i tried to straighten out it felt as if i were breaking my own back maybe my back was broken but the sword would have been worse could i feel my feet yes okay your spines intact just lie here awhile it will heal sure we always healed hey carpentier why was it benito always healed before you did why shouldnt he he was one of the paid staff then why did he get hurt at all a womans voice said whatve you got uh i still couldnt get more coherent than that whatve you got she repeated patiently i moved my head around slowly it was dark and gloomy i became aware of hideous screeching sounds moans screams of pain and rage snarling dogs the cacaphony of hell she was sitting against the slopingside of the trench naked her body marked with pustules and the scars of older eruptions of the skin she didnt seem more able to move than i was but the pain in my back was easing i said broken back probably whatve you got everything syphilis gonorrhea yaws trench mouth everything you can think of uh huh i know what youve been doing she wailed but i didnt thats why its so unfair my eyes were getting accustomed to the gloom that hung thick down here in the pit there were others lying about the floor and the sides of the gully most of them looked deathly ill across from me was a man scrabbling among thousands of pills there must have been every variety of medication ever invented or imagined tablets capsules of many hues bottles of liquids tiny pills and pills that would choke a horse he groaned in pain as he held up a pill and squinted at it finally he decided he flung the pill back into the bathtub of them next to him he sat for a moment then he moaned pressing his hands hard against his belly its eating me alive he screamed he scrabbled for another pill this time he gulped it without looking at it it didnt seem to help because he screamed even louder and went back to his inspection routine i looked a question at the girl she shrugged he sold cancer cures they only worked if you didnt go to a doctor somewhere in that pile there may be a pill that cures him what about the rest some dont do anything some make it worse i shuddered then froze as something came howling past on all fours foam dripping from its jaws id thought it was an animal but it wasnt it was a man counterfeiters counterfeiters always get rabies said the woman if they bite you it takes a long time to heal and i couldnt move there was nothing to do but watch men and women with peeling scabs and an itch that drove them to tear at themselves a man with no ears unable to move and screaming for water listen he shouted tell satan anyone tell satan there is a plot to overthrow him for water i will reveal the names of the plotters tell him they were all deathly ill and they were all in pain except one and he was startling by contrast he sat against the slope of the gully a few feet from the girl and across from me a middleaged cherub comfortably overweight his blue eyes twinkling above a mad and happy smile certainly he was mad was it a sickness of the mind or had some vile bacterium reached his brain i had to get out of here the most ferocious contagious diseases ever to wrack mankind were all around me i tried to move and stopped at once my legs wouldnt obey and it felt as if my spine were being twisted in a vise had i caught something already spinal meningitis maybe the madmans wandering blue eyes found me he said i was a psychiatrist i didnt ask in fact id already learned more of hell than i really wanted to know i only wanted out dont tell me any more i closed my eyes they trusted me the mad voice said happily they thought we knew what we were doing for fifty bucks an hour i listened to their life stories wouldnt you he subsided the woman said hes crazy thanks i really wondered about that i told her without opening my eyes listen you fell in over the edge have you been upslope have you seen a lot of whats up there a lot what do they do to shall we say ladies of the evening i opened my eyes she was tense waiting for my words i didnt notice anything special for whores why i i listen some girls dont actually sleep with the customers they take a gentleman to a motel they get their money in advance then they disappear sometimes you can do better than that youre just getting down to business when your boyfriend walks in the door you see sure id been robbed that way a couple of times in england well she said youd think that wouldnt be as bad as being an actual prostitute and she looked at me somehow the memory was very dim now of a time on earth when a london girl had propositioned me taken my money and vanished from a bathroom with an unsuspected second door leaving me in rage and frustrated lust if id caught her id have killed her but that was long ago and nothing looked bad next to where i was now so i lied theyd be downslope from here i havent been there yet satisfied she sank back and forgot me in the examination of her ruined body the mad psychiatrist noticed me again we were just playing he said dreamily tinkering with something we didnt understand i knew oh i knew let me tell you dont tell me they kept hurting at me all of them he was a catatonic he was like a rubber doll you could put him in any position and hed stay there for hours we tried all sorts of things in those days shock therapy insulin shock lobotomy punish the patient for not noticing the outside world or for not noticing you i meant it to hurt but he nodded happily so we put him in a hotbox and started raising the temperature we watched him through a window first he just sweated then he started to move around at a hundred and thirty he said his first words in sixteen years get me the fuck out of here the mad eyes found me and his face seemed to cave in the cherubic smile vanished urgently he said get me the fuck out of here i cant ill be lucky to get out myself i tried moving again there was pain but not enough to keep me in that place i stood gingerly and started up the slope the girl cried you cant do that come back here come back i kept going there were rocks to pull myself up cracks to use as footholds id climbed just far enough when another hydrophobia case raged past biting and chewing on everyone he passed a rock rolled from beneath my foot and pain grated in my spine as i caught myself the rabid man screamed at the psychiatrist but the cherubic look had returned and he was smiling dreamily at the opposite wall when i reached the top i remembered who had been in the last pit of the eighth circle frauds falsifiers false witnesses chapter that was the last of the bolgias now the way led across an empty rocky land i turned and looked at the ten canyons rising upward behind me light flickering from some others marked by rising smoke or roiling heated air it had not been a pleasant journey far ahead through a twilit gloom that would just have had drivers turning on their headlights i saw what seemed a cluster of great towers there was nothmg else to see nothing at all benitos evil counsel had brought me this far now it was too late i could get back a little way probably to the fifth pit possibly as far as the cliff but id never talk geryon into taking me up that cliff and there were just too many places where allen carpentier might belong could i talk the monster into summoning minos that could get me all the way back to the vestibule yeah and into the bottle again if i were lucky i hadnt forgotten that burrowing this far into hell might be a crime in itself minos had told me that i could choose far worse for myself than justice maybe id already made the choice or i could just sit down in this empty borderland i could spend a good piece of eternity before some angel noticed me i sat down it was very peaceful it was in fact the only completely empty spot id seen in hell why maybe it was reserved for some brand new sin something that hadnt been invented yet say a development of brain research or genetics at some time in the indefinite future i might have to vacate fast meanwhile it was better than the bottle i could see my navel time passed without leaving footprints days i think the stinks of hell were still in my nostrils the everpresent background noise might have been soothing if i hadnt known what it was millions of moans and cries blended by distance but nobody was hurting me or hurting at me i didnt have to watch people getting sliced up or burned or riddled by diseases or smashed by demon cars or distorted into obscene shapes i sat and dreamed of the past i wondered idly about the looming towers i could see in the dark distance i wondered at benitos ultimate purpose in luring me here but none of it seemed to matter i thought that even curiosity had been burned out of me that would have been nice i would have liked to turn my mind off for a long time but it wouldnt turn off whatever quiet id found here there was still hell around me and i hurt with the need to know why god had created human souls could he not uncreate the failures god had created sleep could he not put the failures to sleep forever there were no good excuses for hell i thought of some unsettling bad ones the universe would fly off its axis if hells agony did not balance heavens bliss or part of heavens bliss was the knowledge that lots of nasty people were suffering terribly or the old standby we were in the hands of infinite power and infinite sadism i got restless the towers kept catching at my eye blurred gray shadows on the horizon skyscrapers a city in hell quarters to house the maintenance crew for infernoland or were they the true entrance the tourist entrance but i was only playing with plots i didnt believe in infernoland anymore this was hell and i knew it i finally realized what was really bothering me to all intents and purposes i was back in the bottle i got up i walked toward the towers no harm in looking they werent towers they were giants enormous humanoids buried in the earth from the navel down i stopped well out of their reach to study them their enormous eyes found me and pinned me to the landscape like a butterfly on a board then shifted away i was not worth their attention i was glad unreasonably i felt that those tremendous deep eyes could see everything there was to know about me one was mad he looked down at me hopefully and said ilfurb fistenant imb his face fell when i did not respond alien language alien being what were these aliens doing in human hell not serving big juju not hardly miles of chain bound their arms to their sides there were giants in the bible and titans in mythology but no archaeologist had ever found human bones this size and how could they survive earths gravity the squarecube law should have flattened them into mountains of hamburger maybe they werent from this universe at all an attacking army from another universe made by another creator the sciencefiction writer in me the late allen carpentier wanted very much to see their legs and feet they must be disproportionately large and sturdy to support their weight unless they had developed in a lighter gravity field while carpentier the trapped damned soul was examining the chains that wrapped another of the giants for the giants were buried just outside a chinhigh wall their chins not mine the wall looked too smooth to climb i walked up to the chained giant ready to jump but it wasnt necessary the chain looked like anchor cable whoever had wrapped it round him had a fine eye for detail hed have been lucky to shrug his eyebrows now what would benito have done here climbed the giant of course the thought of climbing such a monster gave me pause yet i was sure i could do it up the chain stepping in the links as far as his shoulder beware of snapping teeth then onto the wall and down if benito had told the truth if what i remembered of dante was true i would then be in the last circle of hell the circle of traitors traitors to nation to overlord to benefactor to parents and siblings a great ice plain and the traitors embedded in it there would be nothing but the cold to stop me from crossing it and i knew i couldnt freeze to death it looked so easy what had benito left out i remembered the great ice plain well enough the college boy had been jolted at finding part of hell already frozen over benito hadnt said anything that jarred with my own memories of dante but there had to be a joker in the deck somewhere benito had been a power in hell hed given orders to others of hells minions hed demonstrated demonic strength against a tank of a man in the great swamp carpender why didnt he do that to you maybe it was guilt that stopped him hed writhed and torn at the ground but he hadnt actually hit me not once hed uprooted jagged rocks while trying to use them as anchors but he hadnt tried to hit me with them and for all his presumed safeconduct he was back where minos had sentenced him with the evil counselors maybe satan or god or big juju had rendered some kind of judgment against benito with me as the agent but why hadnt benito fought the giant tried to shake himself the chains barely rustled no danger there you writhe and you struggle but theres no way around it me too giant from every possible direction it looked the same it was going to be unreasonably easy for allen carpentier to enter the circle of traitors the place of punishment for those who had betrayed their benefactors i thought it over for a long time then i turned and started back chapter going back was harder the dip at the lower end of the tenth bridge was steeper and now i was climbing it i crossed the pit without looking down and climbed backward down the high end of the bridge i saw the next bridge close by and made for it a swords point flicked up before my eyes i stopped surely hed been under a different bridge id skewed my path deliberately but a halfhuman halfbestial head beyond the swords point shook itself negatively you cant go back carpenter i have to the blade hung before me rocksteady i could have chinned myself on it i halfstepped forward and the blade moved too fast to follow now it pricked the tip of my nose i shrugged and turned back i took no chances i crossed the inner pit again and circled through the wasteland beyond two bridges away i crossed again on my belly i slid down the high end of the bridge and kept crawling along the ridge above the ninth pit he couldnt be under all the bridges couldnt he just like the damned clerk he was waiting when i tried to stand up at this the low side of the pit he had the angle on me you cant go uphill he said i really dont know how to make it plainer im from the vestibule i said i dont belong here you never created your own church carpenter oh dammit listen those werent in competition with god or anybody all i did was make up some religions for aliens if that was enough youd have every sciencefiction writer who ever lived weve got him said the demon and he pointed with the sword i forgot the sword entirely i leaned far out over the edge of the pit to see what in hell to coin a phrase is that it was in a sense the last word in centaurs at one end was most of what i took for a trilobite the head of the trilobite was a gristly primitive fish its head was the torso of a bony fish and so on up the line lungfish protorat bigger rat a large smoothskinned beast i didnt recognize a thing like a gorilla a thing like a man finally a true man none of the beasts had full hindquarters except the trilobite none had a head except the man the whole thing crawled along on flopping fishtorsos and forelegs and hands a tremendous unmatched centipede the human face seemed quite mad he founded a religion that masks as a form of lay psychiatry members try to recall previous lives in their presumed animal ancestry they also recall their own past lives and that adds an interesting blackmail angle because those who hear confession are often more dedicated than honorable excuse me for the line of victims had bunched up while we talked the demon turned and sliced at them rapidly to a tune of scream and curses the centaur creature he sliced into its separate components and it went past him in a parade on arms and forelegs and wriggling fishy fins the sword flicked up again just as id decided to make a break for it a bead of blood formed at the tip of my nose im not like him i said quickly he played the game for real with me it was just a game i backed away until the tenth bolgia was an emptiness beneath my heels he couldnt reach me now take the silpies they were humanoid but telepaths they believed they had one collective soul and they could prove it and the sloots were slugs with toolusing tentacles developed from their tongues to them god was a sloot with no tongue he didnt need a tongue he didnt eat and he could create at will by the power of his mind i saw him nodding and was encouraged none of this was more than playing with ideas the demon was still nodding games played with the concept of religion enough such games and all religions might look equally silly you cant do this i shouted listen theres a friend of mine in the eighth bolgia and its my fault hes there and ive got to get him out did anyone promise you it would be easy or even possible whatever it takes i said and thought i meant it step closer i walked to the edge carpentier shows his good faith the sword flashed twice i heard and felt the tip grate along my ribs it left two vertical slashes along my chest and belly i reeled back with my arms wrapped around myself to bold my guts in the demon was watching me steadily what could he be waiting for i knew i stepped forward and dropped my arms carpentier shows his inability to learn the sword flashed twice more leaving two deep horizontal slashes perhaps mortally deep a living man would have fainted from shock i couldnt games said the big evil humanoid your move i studied the slashes and the flowing blood shock did seem to be slowing down my thought processes but presently i saw what he meant i said what do i use for a pencil youll think of something i studied my fingernails i thought of something i gouged a ragged x in the top left square of the diagram the sword flashed to place an in an adjacent corner i climbed the first slope of the bridge on fingers and toes when i could walk i held my arms wrapped around myself holding me in the pride of my victory seemed excessive tor a stupid game of ticktacktoe as i left the bridge i heard him call carpenter i turned my head best two out of three my imagination was dead of shock the only dirty word i could think of was one id never use again not after seeing the place of the flatterers i just kept walking along the rim the eighth pit was a canyon filled with firelight benito my voice echoed hollowly between the canyun walls benito some of the flames wavered thrumming voices retarded by the transfer from voice to flame tip floated upward leave the damned to suffer alone benito who bug off you the canyon stretched endlessly away in both directions in a gentle curve if it was a full circle it could hold millions how was i to find benito benito there was panic in my voice the strain hurt my slashed chest benito benito mussolini he just passed me going that way no it was the other direction youre both wrong mussolinis in the boiling lake a fat lot of help id get here and if i found him what then how was i going to get him out how did he get out in the first place maybe hed already left again a frustrating thought because i couldnt do a thing about it and it would mean id played my game with the demon for nothing i hoped benito was already out but i had to assume he was still in there the canyon wasnt all that deep what i needed was a climbers rope yeah an asbestos one stupid benito was on fire for that matter i hadnt seen any ropes anywhere i thought for a second about the chain on the giant it would mean passing the demon twice no even if i got the chain loose it was too heavy to move and the freed giant would probably crush me for my trouble i was glad i didnt have to decide to face the demons sword again i dont know what i would have done well think carpentier there are tools in hell sure boats carry rope now were getting somewhere a heavy rope kept wet while benito climbs wait a minute haw do we climb the cliff when theres no rope yet there havent been any boats since the gaudy alien geryon took us down tackle geryon again and if it doesnt work back in the bottle while benito burns benito was smarter than i was maybe hed think of something benito mocking thrumming voices answered i thought of fourteen feet of sword blade attached to a twentyfoot demon disable the demon cut the blade loose send it down to benito but could he climb something that sharp or would he lose his fingers immediately did fingernail burn waitaminute there were smaller demons higher up carrying iron pitchforks i made for the bridge in a few steps i was running if i slowed down id want to stop because i was terrified of what i planned i was in too much of a hurry i was trotting toward the base of the tremendous bridge over the chasm of thieves when something flashed scarlet from behind a rock i turned frowning and there was agony flashing out from my neck to engulf me and drown me i felt my bones soften and bend the pain drew back like a broken wave receding but it left a blackened mind i was confused i couldnt think a homely bearded man bent over me saying urgent words that made no sense which way is out he was huge i realized a giant i stepped toward him and i was tiny and fourlegged my belly scraped the ground a lizard i was a lizard the bearded man repeated himself enunciating each word which way is out how can i leave hell vengeance i advanced on him bite the son of a bitch he backed away still talking but i couldnt understand him he stopped and seemed to brace himself i leapt i sank my teeth into his belly he howled and i dropped to the ground writhing in new agony when my mind cleared i was a man i rolled away fast from the red lizard and didnt stop until there was a rock between us the lizard stayed where he was watching me i was making for the next bridge when his words came back to me my dumb reptile brain had registered them only as sounds you cant speak hed wailed then tell me ill let you bite me but tell me the way out he was a scarlet splash on a gray rock still watching me i pointed downslope toward the lake of ice there all the way to the center if i havent been lied to myself i glanced back once after id crossed the next bridge the lizard was poised on the rim staring down as i watched he made his decision he leapt into the pit now what was that all about never mind carpentier youve got other concerns chapter far below me the golden monks stood like so many statues every couple of seconds one or another would rock forward as if its base were unstable the broken bridge dropped in a cascade of rock i stopped to catch my breath then went down the broken slope with some care it would have been easy to break an ankle i had reached the floor of the canyon before i noticed that one of the monks bad turned completely around to stare at me his slategray eyes were the oldest the weariest i had ever seen and i recognized them he said didnt you pass here a week ago a few days i think and youve only come this far we hurry as fast as we can the gray eyes studied me they were so tired they made me want to sag down and rest may i ask what game are you playing are you a courier or something equally unlikely no i why not tell the truth he wasnt about to run tell someone ive got to steal a pitchfork from one of the tenfoot demons in the next pit over don a cloak like mine he said see what it does to your sense of humor i sank down against the bank those tired eyes ill wear the cloak i said you get benito out of the pit of the evil counselors okay i beg your pardon i pushed a good friend into the pit of the evil counselors if i cant but why would you do a thing like that i howled it startled me more than him id been about to say something else entirely but no words came and i threw back my head and howled the tears streamed down my face the monk said something in a foreign language he tottered toward me and stopped he didnt know what to do there there he said it will be all right dont cry with a touch of bitterness he added everyone will notice there was a howl as big as the world inside me it wanted out and it was stronger than i was i howled the priest muttered to himself aloud he said please please dont do that if you will only stop crying i will help you got your pitchfork i shook my head i got out a whimpered how he sighed i cannot even take off my robe i do not see how i can help perhaps i could act as bait somehow he lifted his head his teeth grinding with the effort to look up along the cascade of broken rock i stood up i patted him on his leaden back clunk clunk clunk youve got your own problems i girded up my mental loins and started up the slope loose rocks rolled under my feet this was the high side of the gully it took a long time to get to the top i had just one advantage part of the bridge still projected out from the cliff i climbed in its shadow and stopped underneath i waited after all what could a demon do to me rip me to pieces id heal drop me into the pitch forever throw me into the pit of the thieves one of the horned black demons strolled past his head turned to study the pitch on the other side of the ridge he held six yards of iron pitchfork balanced in one hand all i had to do was leap out and grab it i let him go when he was past i began to shake the beast had threeinch claws ten and eightinch tusks two and carpentier was a coward i heard clanking and puffing below me i turned and saw an amazing sight the priest was coming up behind me i watched him i didnt believe it but it was true he was actually in motion he sounded as if he were dying again but every so often his hand or his foot would move and hed be two inches higher when i finally made myself believe what was happening i scrambled down the cliff got under him and pushed up on the rigid hem of his robe i doubt it helped i might as well have been trying to lift the world we reached a flattish fragment of rock just under what was left of the bridge there we rested the death rattle was in his throat his eyes were closed his face glistened thousand years he got out been walking thousand years in this lead coffin legs like trees then was a priest a priest supposed to keep people out of hell i still dont know how were going to do it the we was courtesy and he deserved it but what could he do get me up he said i got my arms under his robe it was warm together we got him upright somehow then i looked up at a demons hooves the demon looked down at us grinning you know he said pleasantly youre the first one ever got this far out of the tar i said youre making a mistake im not then i leapt for it the pitchfork struck sparks from the rock where id been but i was in midair falling i landed hard on a raggededged boulder i rolled immediately ready to dodge again the priest was gripping the business end of the pitchfork the demon bellowed and pulled for an instant he had lifted the priest off the rock robe and all then the priest sagged back still gripping the tines i tried to climb up to help the priest took two steps back and off the edge of the rock the demon bellowed for help he was trying to lift half a ton of leaden robe and it wasnt working out i had almost reached them when the demon cried out and let go the priest dropped through space i crawled down to him the robe was bent like tinsel and cracked down the front the edges glowed yellow hed been told wrong the robe was solid gold when i touched it it burned my fingers the priest was mangled inside he looked violently dead except for his eyes which followed me if i didnt get him out of the robe hed fry but you dont move an accident victim hell heal carpentier we all heal to be hurt again i pulled him out by his feet the robe wasnt contoured to let him pass but it didnt matter he came out like a jellyfish he must have broken every bone in his body i spoke not to the softlooking head but to the gray eyes alone youll heal when you heal theres a way out of hell benito says so go downhill downhill the eyes blinked ive got to rescue benito i said i pulled him over to the side so nobody would step on him i picked up the pitchfork and left benito i walked the ridge between the pits calling like a lost soul the answering voices all sounded the same anonymous thrumming inhuman here i am fellah benito who who dares disturb the silence of hell benito allen that had to be him but a dozen voices took it up allen here i am allen what kept you benito ive come to get you out i listened for the italian accent and heard it never mind i belong here i should not have tried to leave all the flames looked alike but i thought i had him placed now i reached down with the pitchfork bugger that grab the end the other flames were wandering off benito said it is not long enough in any case it wasnt i looked along the rim there was a rough place where i might climb down partway benito tried to stop me you are being stupid if you fall you will burn like the rest of us can you reach the end go away allen this is my proper place i was ten feet below the rim and almost out of footholds the pitchfork was heavy and awkward i tried to go further setting my feet very carefully all right benito said suddenly the huge flame moved to engulf the tines i felt a feather touch on the haft and the flame began to rise from the pit he called can you hold me i laughed wih relief you dont weigh as much as an ounce i could lift a thousand of you after all id been through suddenly it was going to be easy the flame rose higher along the haft and i felt the first warming of the metal i waited until i was sure i could filter the panic from my voice some of it may have got through anyway benito hurry is something wrong no never mind just hurry i was afraid hed let go the metal was uncomfortably warm it grew hot down there where a huge flame was rising in dreamy sloth the metal began to glow dull red he wouldnt notice his own bright flame would blind him to it up here it was too hot to hold but i held on my teeth clenched against the scream the scream grew bulky in my throat i stopped breathing to hold it in if benito gave up now to save me pain id never never find the courage to do this twice the metal was cherry red around the flame my hands began to sizzle i wasnt breathing but the smell of cooked meat worked its way into my nose i couldnt imagine how my hands still held i was clenching them with everything i had but the muscles and nerves must be cooked through charred through i knew that smell too dinner ruined my head was thrown back my eyes clenched tight there was no sensation but the fire you can let go said benito he was beside me clinging to the cliff his body no longer hidden by the flame i tried to let go my hands were charred fast to the haft i tried to knock the pitchfork loose it came loose all right and slid bumping into the eighth bolgia with my charred hands still attached benito had to virtually lift me up the cliff chapter we went inward i followed benito nursing my charred wrists he had to haul me up the last bridges by the slagk of my robe the pain never stopped the nerves gave no sign of having been cauterized by the redhot iron the charred bone broke away the black flesh split to expose red flesh itll heal carpentier oh shut up and call me carpenter carpentier the famous author is dead in the empty borderland between the tenth pit and the giants we sat down presently benito spoke thank you yeah im sorry i pushed you in he didnt say anything i said i thought i had to do it i thought it was right still nothing look i said i was raised to believe that benito mussolini and adolf hitler were identical monsters benito sighed sometimes toward the end perhaps we were i didnt start that way i meant well he laughed bitterly i had good intentions we know what is said to be paved with those tell me about it he spoke musingly without looking at me after the war i saw my country humiliated no one believed in anything corruption everywhere laboring people working against wealthy people middle class working against the government everyone fighting each other and everyone ruining each other if theyd only work together we were romans once we ruled the world we could be great again instead of a joke for clemenceau and lloyd george to swat aside so you made people work together i gave italy hope for years i even stopped hitler from taking austria allen if id chosen the side of the allies in the second war would i have as great a place in history as stalin i couldnt say anything to that yet he killed ten million peasants adolf never equaled that record as for me in the early days we used castor oil not clubs he sighed but you can never stop once you begin seeing what is better for people than they know themselves the opposition will make a thorough mess of everything youve done and you know they will destroy the country what do you do destroy the opposition now they really have grievances bigger opposition more police needed to suppress them but i meant well i loved my people to the day they killed me the purpose of power is power what benito was badly shocked never mind quote from a novel nineteen eightyfour so then you tried to set up a government here for my sins i did benitos sudden laugh was like my own howling in the sixth bolgia there was an agonized laugh in him and it clawed its way through his throat oh allen and you think youve seen hell a government among the evil counselors when i tried to get out they stopped me they needed me as figurehead never mind i got out anyway i had to but you never did anything but good for me or anyone else you met down here how are your hands we looked two tiny infants fists were forming at the lumpy bones of my wrists we must wait until they heal you will never climb with those he laughed we sat and talked hours went by i think the worst was when they shot my cabinet people italians shooting men whose only crime was to love italy and trust me he shuddered those are strange scars on your chest i had to play games with the demon in the tenth bolgia funny we didnt see him coming back games reluctantly i told him it could have been embarrassing but it wasnt he didnt thank me again instead he smiled and said do you still believe that hell is a place of entertainment no i didnt even then i think geryon convinced me geryon yeah you may not have noticed but geryon is the only nonhuman in hell who really looks like an et an extraterrestrial something from another world hes consistent not like those patchwork demons animal traits grafted on a human frame and when i climbed aboard him i kicked machinery around his waist so i had to laugh oh really benito an antigravity belt when theyve already proved they can take the mass and weight out of anything they like geryon was lying lying without saying a word and it was geryon that convinced you you have seen no proper miracles i saw one i told him where the pitchfork had come from that priest climbed the broken bridge in half a ton of gold he hung from the demons pitchfork until the demon had to let go and he knew what would happen then benito smiled yes that was a miracle too right i know a miracle when i see one then you are more fortunate than most of us he looked thoughtful geryon has looked a little different each time i have seen him that worried me too just how often have you made this trip six times each has been easier for me although not for the one who accompanied me to the exit as i told you it does not matter how many start only one leaves and there really is a way out there was a time when i thought you were just leading me into something more horrible im still scared but not of that now there remains only the lake of ice you have nothing to fear im afraid to relax too often ive thought i was through the worst part his look probed my soul when the iron began to grow warm in your hands tell me all about it i think not but now there is only the ice it will be colder than anything you can imagine but we can endure it nothing can bar us now soon we reach the center and then he stopped and then you will see he looked me in the face i think you have enough courage even now i feel it leaking away spit it out benito we will meet lucifer and pass him ignore anything he says when we have passed that go uphill to purgatory he paused without me but youve traveled this route you know where it leads no and yes i have not traveled it but i know where it leads how by faith and by dantes description dantes been wrong a couple of times admit it benito you dont know what happened to those six you rescued i know but i have not seen do you want to leave hell or are you afraid of whats tihere how are your hands they were a childs hands now still too small to support my weight you didnt answer my question i would leave hell if i could i belong here so long as there are lost souls to oe rescued you sent six men and women into the unknown but you were afraid to go yourself he didnt answer only looked at me i stood up come on my handsll heal before we need them they healed we climbed the torso of a chained giant it was easier than mountain climbing and harder mountains dont shake mountains dont snap at you with teeth the size of medieval shields we stepped across space from the giants shoulder to the flat top of a wall from the wall i watched benito slide down on the seat of his pants if hed been wearing pants a pity he hadnt found a better way down in six previous trips i slid after him imagine one of the great lakes frozen over seen on a moonless night maybe it looked like that id never seen any of the great lakes to me it was an iceskating rink for a society of teleports big enough to hold say one percent of a population of five billion the wall behind me seemed arrowstraight the dark ice infinite a breath of a breeze whispered around us and leeched all the warmth from our massless souls i stiffened with the shock then crouched down and tried to shelter in my own arms benito was standing that will not help nothing helps he said patiently you must bear the cold if he could do it i stood up and closed my eyes tight against the soft unreasonably cold breeze surely it was below freezing way below freezing how cold was it if it could kill a man in minutes or seconds id never know it i couldnt die benito burst into flame again for your good friend i would if i could my apologies allen benito took my arm we walked it had certainly been worth asking was it water ice we walked on for all of me it could have been dry ice or frozen nitrogen or something even colder i kicked something that cursed me without emotion i tried to open my eyes the winds tears had frozen them shut i pulled them open painfully with my fingers leave them open benito said without pity and they will freeze open when the urge came to blink i fought it then there was no need for my eyes would not close i looked back at what id kicked i said sorry the face was handsome photogenic dignified in middle age undignified in the way it grimaced and bent to the ice for shelter had i seen that face sometime on television maybe the man was buried to his chin in the ice at the sound of my voice he cried wait are you american arent we all i cant seem to find anything but the head called to another head sitting like a cabbage on the ice george maybe we can settle this now it turned back to me late american do you know anything about the abm controversy sure antiballistic missiles to knock down incoming missiles the controversy was over whether to build the abm system wonderful all right sir george was a democrat and i was a republican the democrats were against building the system the republicans were in favor of it but which of us was right i havent the faintest idea i said do you really have nothing better to talk about than that no the man id kicked said sharply we do not one of us had to be right so why are we both here the cold wasnt just getting to me it had gotten me i wanted out not conversation i said other crimes maybe one of us was wrong george said senator gates here thought the system was a waste of money but he went along with his party he it was more than a waste of money it used up efforts we could have spent on a laser system sir ive seen how accurate a laser defense system could be against incoming missiles but politics dictated that i must support the abm system i went along i dont know anything about the darned lasers george said except they were highly experimental experimental weapons did a lot for the nazis didnt they he snorted contempt then sneezed on the freezing air i was convinced that the abm system was needed to defend the country against an atomic attack but our party platform was in favor of military cutbacks officially so was i now sir senator gates said to me we cant both have been wrong i think rm getting the picture you both thought you were wrong yes and a mistake could wipe out the united states of america neither answered for what its worth i said were still getting americans in hell corbett died much later than you thank you said exsenator gates and they both turned their faces to the ice again but you were both traitors in your minds thank you for your help said exsenator george it was a dismissal we walked with care to avoid kicking heads there were certainly enough of them but now it was worse here the dead had been buried supine and we would have been stepping on faces once i missed my step and came down hard on a human face the ice across its eyes crackled under my feet and i leapt back fast sorry thanks i heard mistake thanks oh thanks it said weeping i havent cried in years the damned ice froze across my eyes and i couldnt cry thanks i felt awful this was an awful place thats okay i said i bent and picked the remaining shards of ice from her eyes whatd you do i dont want to say okay i tore the ice visors from a couple of dozen pairs of eyes always they froze over again almost immediately only one ever said thanks finally i gave it up there were just too many and the next head i passed screamed the ice stupid tear off the ice you did it for the others i stopped whore you none of your business i turned away the ice wait al capone im al capone you want names thats vito genovese trying to turn his face wait ill show you lepke wait he was shouting against a chorus of voices trying to drown him out i kept walking when the noise was behind us benito said i knew vito genovese was he worth talking to no were you thinking of going back its cold allen sound whispered all around us partly it was the breeze which had stiffened partly it was the chattermg of teeth id suppressed that reflex in myself it wasnt warming me at all but in all that expanse of ice there was only one point of motion i caught it in the corner of my eye way off to one side doubted my senses kept looking saw it again benito i pointed he found it i had no idea i thought i was the only one you may be it seems to be one man and a dog they had noticed us and they angled to meet us as they came closer i saw my mistake the dog was a lizard its scarlet color leeched from it by the cold and the man was the blackbearded thief who had stolen my shape at the seventh pit we studied each other no greeting seemed appropriate finally i gestured and said benito mussolini im allen carpenter jesse james this lizard is bob ford what was that all about that business there at the bridge a bunch of us got together said jesse we thought maybe we could cooperate in getting one of us out it turned out a man couldnt throw a lizard far enough but we could stand a human pyramid against one of the walls and the top man could throw a lizard at the bridge i was the lizard funny nobody thought of it before he sighed its getting those animals to work together thats the problem all the time we were trying to make the pyramid some of us in the lizard form kept biting the ones in human form we didnt get anything done till we had a dozen big lizards to guard us while we made the pyramid figures whyd you jump back i had to tell them which way was out you might not have got out again they might not even have let you take human form again he nodded i remembered something a line from a song it was little robert ford that dirty little coward i wonder how does he feel for he ate of jesses bread and he slept in jesses bed and he laid jesse james in his grave bob ford didnt he kill you shot you while you were taking a bath hanging a picture yeah he shot me all right i was following your advice for which i thank you stranger he laughed and there was bob fords head sitting on the ice i thought it over for a while i wandered around and around him wondering what i could do to him and wondering if i still hated him the lizard was rubbing affectionately against his leg i finally bit him on the nose it hit me like a stiff shot of good whiskey you can get out of the ice sure friend i just reached into that manshaped bubble and picked up a lizard well which way now inward benito said let us go it is cold here that had to be the most unnecessary statement of all time we moved inward and the wind came up it was blowing right in our faces pretty soon it was a real howler as bad as the circle of the winds i wondered if corbett had ever got back there the wind whistled past us and lifted jesse off the ice the lizard squealed and leaped after him and the wind caught it too man and lizard were bowled end over end across the ice then lifted and flung high and outward i watched them dwindle so close i said they were so close they were not ready benito said perhaps they must see what is done to others theft and treachery may not have been all they did it is even possible that they will be blown all the way back to the vestibule and must make their way back come but they know the way allen come all right we bowed our heads against the wind and staggered on the wind had been entirely too selective for coincidence it had thrown jesse and ford an unguessable distance without knocking me or benito off our feet i thought it was a good omen for us chapter suddenly there were no more heads there was only the ice and the wind that had blown the others away we leaned into it and kept moving i said hell has run out of sins look down hell had not run out of sinners they were buried beneath the ice in weird positions once i looked down and then no more we walked crouched wrapped in our own arms to no purpose the wind had early sucked every erg of heat out of us i saw motion ahead high up as we drew near a shadowy mass loomed around the suggestion of motion pterodactyls on a mountain restless rhythmic motion like the wings of enormous birds and gradually it all came clear there was a humanoid form a hairy torso more than a mile tall we stood at the bottom at waist level and looked up at three vast faces whose features were almost lost in distance bat wings flapped on either side of each face and the wind was now beating down at our heads this was a very different picture from the dapper gentleman who offers to buy your soul or from miltons epic hero proud and unrepentant one could not imagine playing riddles or chess games with this hideous miserable helpless mountain i studied it almost without fear all three pairs of jaws were moving in the same rhythm as the wings something fluttered around the lips benito whats he chewing on are you sure you want to know skip it which way is out hey i reached to stop him not fast enough benito was striding straight toward lucifer he stopped at the edge of the ice the ice ended short of lucifer himself there was three feet of empty space all around the enormous waist and no navel i couldnt have missed it it would have been big enough to hide a battleship you must climb down said benito i looked into the gap after you he shook his head i cannot leave there are others to rescue i dont go without you you have not shown such fear before its not all fear youve rescued seven of us now rescue yourself youve earned it if this doesnt lead to where you think it does we can help each other get back what if i turn back now leaving you here id wondered about that myself i dont know and thats the truth but theres a moral problem youre a better man than i am he smiled sardonically i the murderous dictator you pushed into the eighth pit youve changed since you reached hell youve given me no evil counsel i guess thats the point if you havent changed in hell if you havent earned the right to leave then i havent and wont if you cant go i cant i i think i can go i choose not to if you can leave hell youll have to prove it he studied my face and then he smiled a joyful luminous smile he turned and stepped across the gap and had two fistfuls of coarse hair and a sound beat down at our heads a wind with an almost subsonic voice in it carpenter i looked straight up lucifers middle face was looking down the curve of lucifers chest two fluttering human legs protruded like a ghastly cigarette from the corner of the mouth it spoke and the deep bass voice blew down to me what will you tell god when you see him i didnt answer will you tell him that he could learn morality from vlad the impaler benito was far below clinging like a tick in the billowing hair waiting for me i stepped across and worked my way down as i did my weight seemed to increase against all the laws of physics it scared me i was back in infernoland climbing down into the quantum black hole big juju had used for artificial gravity benito looked up at me curiously what did he say to you i shook my head we descended getting heavier there was a point where i must have weighed tons and all of it pushing inward toward my navel no quantum black hole crushed and swallowed me i hadnt really expected one benito worked his way around until his feet pointed at me and kept climbing i followed his example now we climbed up once i found breath to laugh at the picture we would have made two men climbing at least half a mile of hairy leg like ticks in the devils hair i halfexpected to pass a dong the size of the empire state building testicles like twin astrodomes there was nothing but hair the climb seemed endless but it ended not in ice but in an echoing grotto of gray rock dimly lit the devils hooves still loomed over us big enough to stamp a city flat we lay on our backs on the smooth rock panting somewhere a running stream made a bright happy gurgling sound the dim light came from a single bright pinpoint source overhead the rock curved inward over our heads but it never closed it stretched away like the neck of an inverted funnel straight up for an unguessable distance presently i got up and found the stream and drank from it the water was clear and sweet there is the peace of deep sleep and once i had thought there would be peace in death i drank again then lay with my fingers trailing in the water peace in death id found it but benito was on his feet onward he cried and began to climb the handholds were not difficult and he moved like a spider monkey or like a fat man who no longer weighs anything at all he looked down from the inwardtilting gray slope of grotto roof a fourthousandmile climb if dante was half right he bellowed cheerfully are you coming im afraid not what did you say no i sighed in exasperation when i saw him climbing back down but id halfexpected it he dropped the last few feet and it did seem he fell like a settling balloon too slowly what was it satan said to you he asked me what i would say to god well i have to know something before i can speak to god at all benito waited i have to know the purpose of hell come and ask him you dont get it every torture in hell was too much too late punishment but its infinite punishment for things that are little in comparison dracula caused a lot of people a lot of pain and death but it ended george only lied to people to make them buy things and what about the fat lady in the vestibule area whats the point to teach us a lesson but were dead revenge punishment completely out of proportion balance does the universe need as much pain in it as pleasure i couldnt take heaven if that was the case there is a reason and the reason is good i know yeah i dont theres only one possible excuse for hell and i almost missed it in the ravings of a crazy psychiatrist it has to be the final training ground if nothing can get a soul into heaven in its life theres still hell gods last attempt to get his attention like a catatonic in a hotbox like me in that bottle if hell wont make a man yell for help then it was still worth a try benito was nodding you may be right you may have found the purpose of hell yeah yeah but do you see where it leaves me everyone in hell has to be able to leave once hes learned enough about himself everyone even the trees in the wood of the suicides even the poor devils in the boiling pitch and the sullen types anchored under the lake even the ones who think theyre satisfied the ones in the first circle and i cant leave hell until im sure they can do it benito nodded we go back no no you idiot i was furious how can i tell anyone he can leave unless i know you did it youre going up and im going to watch you do it he thundered carpenter you must still learn humility granted and you but they need me they ah they have you they have me i put out my hand goodbye benito good luck i hope you find he stepped past my hand and wrapped his arms around me and squeezed all the air out of me i said something like huff and hugged him back we held the embrace for a long moment then benito released me and turned away fast i couldnt see his face and started climbing i lay flat on the rock and looked up at the end of the vertical tube the pinpoint light source had all but vanished leaving benito nearly invisible many hours later the light brightened again and i knew i was seeing the sun benito was a dark fleck that moved if i watched it long enough he had made good progress before the light dimmed and went out the water sounds burbled back from the rock walls i lay with my arms folded behind my head taking joy in laziness the peace of this place was almost tangible worrying seemed inappropriate here a breach of good manners what did they do to billy did the priest get out all right how could any thinking being do such a thing to mrs herrnstein ive got to get back but i felt no sense of urgency the damned had all the time there was and so did i hell was the violent ward of a hospital for the theologically insane some could be cured i would have to return to hell i was afraid of that not afraid of the pains or that the demons would catch me because the pains would heal and pain in the right cause is a badge of honor as to the demons thered be no chance they could hold me not now i knew no my fear was of the doubts that would return they would come and id just have to live with them and fight them with my memory of these few moments of peace there were no doubts here none at all the light was back and there was a tiny mote in it that moved even as i watched my eyes were better than human now else id never have seen him at all the light was dimming with sunset when the mote moved out of it and left it clear
