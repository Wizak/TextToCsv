cold christmas lane edgar million cold christmas lane published by edgar million at smashwords copyright edgar million cold christmas lane the prey the dipping sun streaked through the heavy tree cover which gave shelter to the winding twisting country road the light danced across the silver grey bonnet of rogers ford kuga painting patterns across a window which he now noticed needed a good clean saturday tomorrow he thought contemplating a warm afternoon out on the drive washing away a weeks grime then drying and polishing with wax simple pleasures too much time spent working he thought he often thought to find enough space to enjoy the small joys such as the reflective gleam of this machine after hed finished no time for all that rush here rush there his big brother joe told him it was his age men in their forties are a discontented group if you make it to fifty without killing yourself youll be home clear but it will be touch and go for a bit it was true lately roger lurched between mild discontent and outright rage and despair still should be a nice weekend he reflected a thin smile cracking a face which he only looked at these days when shaving or whilst drunk his fathers face now pressing out his own once youthful features replacing them with a scowl which roger thought buried forever but his fathers face remained far from his thoughts now as he rode a pleasant two pint beer buzz into the weekend surely not enough to get him banned but probably not the most sensible action before navigating his way along the lane never mind he thought many worse in the world an unwarranted image of his sharp faced child of a line manager stepping in and then out again from his minds eye forcing roger tried not to think of the deadline he was almost certainly guaranteed not to meet on monday many worse in the world like him he announced aloud to the empty car nodding at a black and white lycra clad cyclist whod appeared some way ahead making his way along the winding country lane riding squarely at the centre of the road theres much worse in the world than me having a couple of pints on a friday night roger closed the gap on the cyclist almost immediately then hissed in irritation at the delay was it too much to want to get home on a friday night he tooted his horn a short hopefully polite request to pass but this selfish middleofthelane cyclist continued to hold the lane refused to let him pass so he sat close behind him revving his engine the cyclists lycra uniform strained and stretched under the pressure of the flabby body it contained and roger wondered how any man could present himself to the world like that his fat thinning the material to such an extent the man may as well be naked the man had no shame he liked to ride a bike himself sometimes or at least he liked the idea he liked to ride a bike sometimes but lately the occasions upon which he roused himself to reinflate the flat tyres on his old halfords mountain bike and soak the rusty chain in wd became less and less frequent still he thought his occasional rides may be rare but they were considerate to the needs of other and it wouldnt have occurred to him to do this to hog the road on a friday evening during rush hour he pressed again on the cars horn if only the rider would move over a little he could nip past there was just about enough space but this guy seemed to think he owned the road rogers intestines twisted and contracted as he tried maintain his temper so aggravating and so smug these people so selfish the evening remained humid but the air con was running on low and kept the hot air outside at bay the slight beer buzz had began to slip from his grasp tensions of work and life resurfacing prodding him his boss asking him questions about the cambridge account and again he chased away the boss and the deadline from his thoughts roger again tooted the horn this time expressing his growing temper a little longer then made a half hearted effort to pull round the bloated cyclist but there just wasnt space without him risking god knows what shooting round the corner but oh this was too much oh sod it he announced pushing up a gear and darting round him bike rocking from side to side cracking his window down a touch then calling to him pull over you wanker youre too far out with a degree of satisfaction a slight release of tension as roger contemplated at last the pleasant weekend ahead the cyclist hadnt reacted to his shout which was a shame he thought without the cyclists angry return it made him doubt himself a moment wonder if his aggression was unwarranted but he knew watching a cyclist gesticulating in the background would have provided a small shot of pleasure selfish sod except roger groaned another one dressed in the same black and white lycra adorned by the first part of a club this rider appeared in somewhat better shape than the other but still another lane hogging inconsiderate sod of a cyclist with nothing better to do on a friday evening than get in the way of hard working commuters trying to get home so once again be found himself stuck in a two person traffic jam in the middle of nowhere i just want to be home he groaned at the back of the cyclists head this guy seemed a little faster than the last but bradley wiggins couldnt go fast enough for him right now he tried to edge out and round him but the figure prone across his machine also veered outwards causing roger to curse again and settle in behind him what was it margaret thatcher said any man over the age of thirty riding a bike was a failure something like that probably not true these days though given the pile of bromptons in the work kitchen belonging to the well paid management consultants now running now ruining his office not failures then not workwise anyway but there was something broken about this lot surely just move over get in close to the curb and let other road users tax paying roadusers by the way get past there were no red lights out here on these lanes but no doubt if there were the road hogs would be running them although roger had to admit hed run red lights too if he could do so with the impunity of a cyclist in frustration roger pressed hard on the accelerator and forced himself violently around the cyclist whose lycra roger now realised was adorned with a skeletal ribcage design crisp and white against the ivory black fabric buffeting the rider just making it past without clipping him then pressing his right foot down even harder as he pulled away from what he considered to be the riders midlife crisis heading back into his own waiting for him in the fridge and in his internet history tacky and graceless but certainly more appealing than squeezing his chunky middle aged torso into stretchy sports wear he laughed to himself acknowledging that his idea of good wholesome fun might not be appreciated by all certainly not the missus but he was glad to be past them home free roger moaned aloud another one clearly part of the same cycling club the skeletal design decorating this one too another one to shake off yet try as he might to swing past there seemed to be no passing him the rider drifting right out into the road each time he tried to overtake him on a path overloaded with sharp forbidding corners he hated getting stuck behind cyclists on this endless stretch of road the tight lane and winding corners twisted and turned sharply and made it a bugger to overtake except yes foot down up a gear and he was narrowly round the selfish sod as well but oh shit he groaned what was it with this lot no escape another two appearing as he turned the next corner still he knew the winding road was about to straighten out slightly for a small stretch so he dropped in behind them ready to leave them all behind as he hit the short straight needed to be now he thought or he was back into more winding country lane and hed be stuck behind this lot forever in his rear view he now noticed one of the cyclists hed overtaken loom into view catching him up now then another one immediately behind riding their slipstream he groaned then noticed his air conditioning appeared to be working overtime he emitted a small shiver with a shrug of his shoulders as he turned it down a notch then as this didnt seem to make a difference off entirely part of moving out to the sticks was meant to be freedom from this sort of thing traffic jams and the like yet here he was being hunted down by bloody cyclists again he tried to find a way round the two riding parallel at the front of this passive aggressive peloton but the cyclists again drifted out to block him at each attempt seemingly following intuition refusing to allow him transit and he slammed hard on his horn blaring out frustration in gloom now settling to such an extent hed began to rely upon his headlights for visibility as he rounded into the straight section the beams of his headlights brought more cyclists into view all in the same gear and the two became four seven including those riding the slipstream behind his car leaning so far forwards they could have almost touched his rear window he tried to drift round the pack but again they blocked him again he sounded his horn and screamed at them in frustration as they left the straight and were back into the tight twisting road i dont need this he thought realising he could hear his heart pounding in his chest blood screaming in his ears his breath came out in an icy fog and thinking for a moment the air con must be malfunctioning he fiddled with the controls before remembering hed turned it off there was something about them something dangerous which made him desperate to escape crazy just men riding bikes but for a moment he saw what he was a beast cornered by the mob he could crush them he was the beast his car looked like a fist whilst they were flimsy breakable but there is danger in numbers again he tried to pass but as he did two of the front drivers dropped back to sit either side of him surrounded his car like a presidential guard around a limousine to move either way would be to kill them and why not roger thought shivering from the cold bloody messing about like this bloody cyclists thinking they own the road it would serve them right if i just punched through them yet he knew he wouldnt dare instead he tried to edge this way then that tentative chess moves knights pawn he tried bully them into submission but they seemed fearless and banged gloved fists on his roof at each attempted manoeuvre the cyclists began to rotate in orbit about him taking turns to mock him with the sharp raps on his car calling unheard words refusing to allow him space to escape as the road weaved and wound sharply downhill riders now racing in absolute darkness roger thinks he can hear them through the glass and steel laughing at him mocking him through the frame of his car roger presses his face against his door window cursing incoherently at the rider on his right whilst spraying spit across the frosty glass screaming at a man who turns to stare at him out of eyes which seem strangely empty even monstrous those eyes were black pits of darkness his stomach lurched as he looked into them because who knows what hides in the darkness he told his youngest son kieran dont be afraid of the dark son theres nothing there but part of him wondered sometimes if the boy wasnt right to be afraid monsters lurk in the darkness cruelty waits for you in the darkness his fathers eyes used to loom out of there darkness angry and disappointed the cyclist looks through the glass and taps with a rap taps and peers more closely before his lips break open into a bloody broken toothed grin a blackened tongue licking a speck of blood from his top lip roger tried again to escape to find that gap these riders had no fear of death dipping in and out of visibility into the night gazing at the rider his blood slowed ice cold and he placed a hand over the air conditioning vents wondering if the system had broken somehow but no air leaked out he looked frantically back at the road aware of the mans cold eyes boring into him desperately seeking a gap which didnt appear but then then it was there his chance an opening to the front right on a sharp hairpin forcing his foot down on the accelerator he barely cared if he hit a cyclist it was time to break free of their malicious game firing his vehicle in through the space hurtling around the bend but no for one moment he found himself through clear but then turning the corner he is greeted by the blare of oncoming headlights a big green mud splattered land rover and a strangers horn raging at him to give waybut there is no time no space a swerve then hes battling with the steering wheel fighting a skid as his suv spins uncontrollably into bushes the rolls into the forest the world tumbling and coming apart a world now turning then an explosion of bright orange pain lighting roger up as the world turned red then black the last thing he would think of black eyes and a broken smile the pack it never used to be like this james mused as he glanced back at the car leaving the road listening to the explosion of flame behind he missed the pleasure these rides used to give him give all of them so long ago before cycling became an endless relentless journey sometimes it feels like they never stop riding now and he strains to picture a time when they werent here like like this hurtling along this twisting winding path there was a time warm days hurtling downhill climbing up there was a time when he enjoyed this the way they used to ride was so different not like now these days their group has become a more stretched partnership a fishermans net stretched out along the road then gathered in when errant motorists couldnt resist the trap he lived for this now but doubted this was any way to live then he wondered about that trying to capture a thought which appeared only in the periphery indistinct which then fled as his mind returned to the hunt to the prey tonights prey was a grey man with red cheeks and tiny angry eyes hair greased and receding screaming at them this was everything now daring them to pass on dangerous corners then drawing close about them like a noose round a killers neck was there a time when it was like this james wondered and then answered himself as he remembered there was something before this before the incident before the incident before everything changed they used to ride together as a tight compact group interchangeable members of a team as they took to the hills the strong dragging the weak uphill at a pace then swapping positions in the pack if you too began to struggle on a climb your razor sharp front wheel often the merest centimetre from your mate they shared a fierce union and friendship which james recalled warmly trust and concentration essential to avoid careering at thirty miles an hour into another cyclist back then they rode solely as a tight compact group seldom separating but since they began riding in the darkness they needed be so close couldnt be as they plunged forwards into to the black night after what happened they rode solely for revenge which required them to be a looser group what did happen james grimaced as he tried to remember the thought slipping away as he swung away from the side of the fragile monster as the grey man tried to take control which was never his not all drivers took the bait most didnt in fact but they waited on the ones who couldnt resist the temptation they waited on the one who started all this who left them for dead they sought them out then there is was again memories flooding in and he remembered it all everything they had lost all these rides used to be about james hurtled along the road each imperfection in the tarmac pressing and testing his gloved hands straining arms and shoulders equal to it all james missed the days when they used to ride for pleasure but not nearly as much as he missed his wife his kids his life he longed for that life longed to remember more of it but he struggled to recall much of anything lately except that moment which constantly recurs which lives at the front of his mind the moment the driver crashed into them smashed into them his old life is just a dream a flavour a scent on the wind the crash is the main course ever present the day replayed in his mind a group of twelve men aged between twenty and sixtyfive but mostly wearing the middleaged tag with little grace refusing to bow to the inevitable forcing themselves up steep hills then picking up even more speed as they headed down the countryside a green blur they rode in a precise union guiding each other around potholes and hazards were on that day nearly halfway through a sixty miler heading for a halfway lunch at a small café near hatfield with laughter and cake and a bubbly waitress who always flirted with young terence the youngest of their group still young enough in fact to not notice the flirting the food was always sweet and unhealthy the laughter almost drunken in pitch a pile of expensive bikes stacked against a nearby drystone wall it was a saturday morning dry but overcast perfect cycling weather and they sped along the thought of cream buns and black coffee overcoming the strain in the legs swapping places from time to time to give the front riders some rest you always had to concentrate on these rides but it was worth it the team ride was something akin to a football match closer even and the camaraderie of the group came as a welcome relief to the collective day jobs a retreat from bickering office politics or the duties of home and fatherhood not far to go james called from the front the message then passed back through the group and the group eased up a touch beginning to cool down ahead of their break thinking of scones with jam and fresh whipped cream not knowing how close they were to the end of their journey james often rode at the head of the peloton not quite as fast as terence he possessed a stamina which should see him through another thirty years or more of these rides or until the knees went because the knees had to go eventually james remembered the moment it was there it was always there on that same hairpin turn they were always there now it seemed to james riding towards the corner or riding away but that afternoon as they approached they heard the sound before they saw it the low angry growl of a car refusing to wait the riders at the rear anxiously checking behind them in a chin to shoulder motion as the growl became a roar the driver veered round them on the corner only to find a black mercedes coming the other way then smashing into them to avoid the collision crushing them ending them he recalled standing there by the side of the road a shadow bike standing beside him his bike and body both lay twisted and broken at his feet a pool of bloody spreading out and running into the dusty earth at the side of the road he watched the driver race away escaping the harm hed caused screaming at him vowing revenge james assumed some of the peloton must have survived that day as their group was now reduced from twelve to seven he hoped the others survived although there was only one who still cycled on cold christmas lane barry wilson a retired policeman who used to like to make jokes with puns in them which made them all groan but still made them laugh as well he was the only they saw the only one they knew for certain had escaped poor old barry whod spent the last twenty years of his career as a desk sergeant checking in low level tottenham criminals and friday night drunk barry who had always struggled at the tail of the pack but who they dragged along on their slipstream nonetheless urged to stay with them part of the gang barry the lone rider these days james hoped the others avoided this road because of the bad memories it stirred in them rather than because of wheel chairs or missing limbs on barrys straining leg a long whitegrey scar now streaked up into purple lycra they saw their old friend crawling up hills alone face straining with the effort so whenever they saw him they dropped into place in front and pulled him along in their slipstream towing him up the hill whenever he reached that corner he always said hello to them where it happened so they wondered if maybe he really did sense them even if he couldnt see them alright lads he call out breathing heavily im still here boys riding for you see you next week lately james had begun to long for the ride to stop wondering whether they would ever catch him the man in the silver grey mercedes who escaped the scene of devastation hed caused without mercy blazing away and over the hill he longed to escape this life then he dropped down a gear beginning a steep climb and he wondered if the ghosts of riders and drivers now lined up along the lane like tombstones would ever be enough to allow them to reach the end of their journey note on the story declaration of interest here im a cyclist a fairly keen cyclist not i hope one of those shouty militant cyclists although like any road user i have my moments im not one of those car driving cyclists who wear tshirts informing you of their positive road tax status because ive never driven a car in my life im not a club rider zooming up and down the hills in a peloton in a pack like james and his friends although when i see them zooming past i do understand the appeal im just a bloke on a bike in black and orange lycra an orange so bright it might damage your retinas but if you do crash into me not seeing me cannot be your excuse generally i find equal irritation with a small number of cyclists and car drivers alike both tribes have their morons but thankfully the numbers of idiots are relatively low in each camp although ill admit us cyclists are winning on youtube in the smug git stakes although without the smug gits wed have missed out on that video of the fat bloke chasing the cyclist and falling over so although i write this story with a very slight bias towards the cyclist im generally of the opinion we should all make more of an effort to be considerate to each other on the road drivers dont overtake if there isnt room cyclists try to move over when safe to let the cars backing up behind you pass and for christs sake learn to look behind you before you pull out then maybe we could all get home safely
