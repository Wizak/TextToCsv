 chapter one baby al i killed a dead man thats why im in prison the dead man was my brother al he was born six years after me and i always hated him even when he was a baby before he was born my parents loved me my father carried me on his back and took me swimming my mother bought me lots of dolls and we played with them together i have seen the photos my parents took a lot of photos of me in my first six years i still have the photos in a book but then al was born i have a photo of him too as a baby in the hospital here in los angeles my mother is holding him and looking at him with a big smile on her face my father has his arm round my mother and he is smiling at baby al too al is holding his daddys finger and me where am i in this picture i am standing by myself beside the bed watching them there is a strange smile on my face i think i am happy but im not sure and no one is looking at me it was always like that after al was born he was a boy and that was important to my parents and very important to my dad most of the photos in the book are of al al eating baby food al learning to walk al on my dads back al playing football al swimming al running al having a big party with his friends a hundred photos of al and five or ten of me of course my parents played with me sometimes took me swimming bought me clothes but they werent interested in me before al was born they spent a lot of time with me after he was born they didnt often i played hospitals with my dolls i played that the dolls were sick and i was a nurse when the dolls had bad stomachs i gave them medicine to take sometimes i pulled their arms and legs off and put tomatoes on them to look like blood and sometimes i gave them drugs that was the best of all my mother gave me an old syringe and i put water in it and pushed it into the dolls soon the dolls were full of holes thats a good game for a little girl my mother said but she didnt understand because in my game all the dolls were boys like al and they never got better they were sick for a very long time and then they died i put them in a hole in the ground in the garden when i was ten my mother died my father was unhappy and began to drink a lot sometimes he came home with strange women but he didnt marry any of them i think the women didnt like him because he drank so much when he wasnt drunk he played with al so i had more time alone i was a good girl at school and i was beautiful too so i had a lot of boyfriends my father hated them you stay away from those boys ellen he shouted its not right i dont want them in my house why not dad i asked you bring your women here dont you why cant i bring my boyfriends shut up girl he shouted he was very angry sometimes he hit me and once i had to go to the hospital so what did al do you ask him nothing he just watched and laughed and played football with dad then i met john he was twentytwo years old and big and strong like arnold schwarzenegger all the girls thought he was wonderful one day he asked me to go to a party with him me i was very excited so i went home and put on my best clothes and shortest skirt to look nice for him then i heard johns motorbike and went downstairs dad was at the door where are you going he asked out i smiled at him with my new boyfriend oh no youre not he said not in that skirt youre only eighteen ellen i know what boys want i dont care i said i pushed past him but he pulled my arm i screamed and he hit my face then john came he was wonderful he took dads arms held them by his side and pushed him slowly back into the house dad couldnt do anything john sat him down in a chair then walked out and put his arms round me right there in front of the house then we rode away on his motorbike chapter two wilds boys i never went home again that night i stayed in johns apartment and three months later i knew that i was going to have his baby but i lost that baby at five months and soon i went back to finish my training as a nurse four years later i had another baby and this one was born all right now im twentynine and i have three small kids but im not really happy john is a goodlooking man a wonderful lover but im not his only woman i know he has two other girlfriends and both of them have babies maybe there are more sometimes i dont see him for weeks and then he comes back and smiles and tries to be nice to me but i still get angry he doesnt have a real job and we have very little money i work as a nurse in a hospital but i dont get much for that and i have to pay half of it to someone to look after my kids while im at work dad died four years ago al told me about it dad had a heart attack he said he was really angry about john so he began running to try to get stronger but he didnt stop drinking then one day he drank half a bottle of whisky went for a run came home and fell down dead on the floor al laughed how strange i thought dad loved al but when he died al laughed perhaps men are just animals really not people like us when dad was dead i saw al more often i didnt like him much but he was my only family sometimes we went swimming together with the kids or out for a pizza john didnt like me to talk to other men but al was ok because he was my brother when al was eighteen he began a rock band wild boys he sang and played guitar at first they played in small restaurants and then they made a record lots of people bought it the band began to play in front of thousands of people they made three more records and travelled all over the world it was wonderful by the time he was twenty my little brother al was famous and rich he was very very rich he bought a yellow rollsroyce a jaguar a porsche and a house in the best part of los angeles with fifteen bedrooms a tennis court a swimming pool and a view over the sea and he gave me our parents house that was nice but it wasnt very nice i mean our parents house is very old it has three small bedrooms a small garden and is in a noisy dirty street its better than my old apartment but still i went to see al often he gave me a key to get in and out of his house and i cooked for him when he had big parties there i enjoyed the parties john came too there were famous people wonderful food and music lots of drink and drugs drugs yes well the drugs were a bad thing al got much too interested in drugs a lot of his friends took drugs and my john did too and when they were on drugs they often didnt know what day it was they did crazy things i remember one party when they went for a midnight swim down at the beach the boys took all johns clothes away while he was still in the sea and drove away with them so john had to walk back through the streets in the middle of the night all wet from the sea while we laughed at him from the car he was so angry i thought that was really funny but john didnt talk to me for a week but al and his friends took more and more drugs and the music began to get worse sometimes al was still in bed at four oclock in the afternoon and when he did get up he looked very sick he was thin his face was white and he didnt want to eat anything he asked me to help him youre a nurse ellen he said i feel sick give me some medicine or something help me you dont need medicine i said you need a lot of good food swimming and no more drugs who do you think you are ellen he said my mother or something no but i am your sister and a nurse i said listen to me im going to get you some medicine to help you stop the drugs and im going to cook you a good meal every day but you must stop the drugs try it al it works i know it does he did try it and it helped after two or three months al was stronger and happier and he began to play good music again he was pleased he trusted me sometimes in the evenings he took me and my kids to the beach we had a meal and drank and went swimming together and had a good time those few months with my brother were a good time in my life now at last i thought my brother likes me hes happy and healthy because of me maybe he can help me give me money buy me a new car and a nice house take me to europe with him but of course i was wrong no one ever gives me anything chapter three the tour im going away on a tour al said one day all around the usa and europe to play music for four months i looked at him and thought hes going to ask me to come too i can see the world bring my kids wonderful i said we can when im away i want you to clean the house for me al said of course you cant live here but i want you to come every day to clean and theres another thing ellen yes what so im not going im just his cleaner i thought i really hated him then i wanted to scream but i didnt i said nothing you know i get very tired on these tours and i need drugs to help me play good music but i dont want to take dangerous drugs ellen i need clean safe drugs i want you to get some drugs from the hospital for me youre a nurse its easy for you just take them secretly no one will know thats a crime al i said people go to prison for that is that what you want me to do steal drugs for you and go to prison maybe why not he laughed youre my sister ellen and dont forget i gave you my parents house didnt i what more do you want thats what he said my parents house not our parents house really half of it always belonged to me but dad gave it all to al because he was so angry about me and john but al didnt think of that he thought that everything belonged to him just like when he and i were kids when he played football with dad and i played with my dolls i remembered my dolls then and the syringe with water in it and i smiled all right al ill get you something youre right you are my brother and i looked around at the beautiful house and the swimming pool and the view of the sea and i thought youre not married al and theres only you and me in our family so when you die all this is going to belong to me al was right it was easy to steal drugs from the hospital no one saw me i also stole syringes which were all clean and new al was very pleased with them thanks ellen he said now im going to play lots of good music ill be ok now chapter four the futures he went away for four months and i cleaned his beautiful big house every day but he didnt phone me once and when he came back he wasnt ok he looked thin and white and sick i tried to talk to him but he didnt listen i was just the cook and cleaning woman he had a lot of new friends now and some of these friends were very strange i first met the futures one night in november there was a party at als house and when i went there after work i saw a big black car outside it looked like a boring car and when i went inside i thought the people looked boring too but that was only on the outside inside they were as dangerous as wild animals a businessman in a dark suit sat opposite al with a young woman on the arm of a chair beside him the man was about forty years old with grey hair the woman was much younger about twentyfour maybe she had long black hair and was wearing a blue dress at first i thought she was the mans daughter but then al said hi ellen meet my new friends dan future and his wife linda we met in new mexico there were about ten other people there talking and listening to music we had one or two drinks and al and linda went for a swim in the pool i sat and watched the beautiful evening sun over the sea and dan future sat beside me we watched als thin body when he got slowly out of the pool and dan said lifes so very short dont you think what do you mean i asked he smiled he had beautiful white teeth my father died last year he was sixtyfive thats not much is it sixty five years of life well maybe not i said but think how many times the sun has gone down in the evenings ten billion times maybe a hundred billion a hundred billion evenings as beautiful as this but my father sat and watched maybe only a few hundred of them we only live a short time like birds you know yes i see i said i looked at him surprised businessmen dont usually say things like that but then businessmen didnt usually come to als parties dan futures hair was beautifully cut he had an expensive watch nice clothes he looked strong and healthy why did he want to talk about death the only sick person in this house was al what did dan future know about that he smiled again we dont have to die you know soon people are going to live a hundred and fifty years maybe more you just need to have money thats all i told your brother about it in new mexico and he was very interested maybe you are too oh no i thought the mans crazy are you er do you belong to one of these new churches i asked no no im a scientist i can tell you all about it if you like but he didnt because at that minute al came up to me and said we need some more drinks and food how about some food ellen there are some hamburgers in the freezer and so i went to get them al had the money and i didnt and i was a woman so i got the drinks and cooked and about ten oclock i went home and i didnt learn any more about dan future and his crazy ideas not then but i learned a lot about them two weeks later chapter five the freezer it was the night of als birthday i got home about seven then i put the kids to bed and made supper for john he didnt talk to me he just sat in front of the tv with the food and his bottles of whisky so i thought im going out ill go say happy birthday to al even al cant be as bad as this and he is my brother i had some more drugs and syringes for him from the hospital so i put them in nice paper like presents like sweets for a baby i thought als just a big baby really with his music and a lot of expensive cars to play with or a doll and im like his nurse when i got to his house it was very quiet there were only one or two lights on downstairs and the big black car was outside thats strange i thought its als birthday why isnt there a party i got out of my car and walked to the door it was open there was soft music in the big living room but no lights were on the moonlight came in through the windows and i could see the moon in the water in the pool outside al i called al where are you no answer just the music quiet and very beautiful i went to als room but his bed was empty all the rooms were empty i came back to the living room opened the door to the moonlit garden and there aaaaaaah i screamed and nearly fell down then i stood still and laughed but nothing happened i stopped laughing and it was silent again two people sat on the ground they sat very still and held their hands and faces up to the moon they didnt move or look at me al i said al what are you doing but it wasnt al it was a man and a woman the mans hair was silver in the moonlight and the womans hair was long and dark dan and linda future they began to sing it was a strange song without words and they sang for nearly ten minutes when they finished i said in a loud voice where is al they looked at me then and got up both of them came to me and took my hands hes asleep dan said we have saved him i took my hands away afraid what do you mean i said what are you talking about he was very sick dan said he had aids you knew that didnt you for a minute i couldnt speak i was afraid i said no of course i didnt when did he get it who knows dan said on tour i think he took drugs didnt he no one can cure aids not yet but one day someones going to find a cure so we helped him he is safe now for hundreds of years isnt that good linda took my hand again come with me she said lets go and look but where dont be afraid its all right she smiled i saw her beautiful white teeth in the moonlight then she took me like a child into the house through the living room and down into the music room the music room was in the ground under the house al liked to play very loud music all night so he built the room down there to be quiet it was a big room with one small window high up it was never hot in the summer not cold in the winter but now now it was different in the middle of the room there was a big glass case a cold blue light came from inside it there was the noise of something large and quiet like a big freezer and inside the glass case there was a body als body my brother the body was lying on a bed of ice inside the case with its head higher than its feet it wore silver clothes and its face was blue oh no whats happened i said its all right ellen linda future said he isnt dead not dead i said but hes frozen he took a sleeping drug and then we froze him it is very very cold in there celsius nothing happens to bodies as cold as that nothing changes for hundreds of years thousands of years maybe thats whats going to happen to al hes going to stay there for a hundred years two hundred years maybe then one day a doctor can wake him up and cure him thats what our company does you know your company i said what do you mean im sorry didnt al tell you dan future said he was in the room too now with his hand on my back he gave me a business card it said escape from death the cryonics company dan and linda future i dont understand i said whats cryonics its the science of freezing people he said thats what we do we help people like your brother to stay alive for hundreds of years then when the doctors can cure them they wake up and we look after their money and houses too you do what i said suddenly i was very very angry you look after their money and houses yes he smiled and his beautiful teeth looked blue in the strange light from the freezer he took a piece of paper out of his pocket its all here ellen your brother wrote his name on this paper it says that we must keep him here frozen in this room for two hundred years by then there will be a cure for aids for now we will look after his money and his house and when we are dead our company will go on looking after them then they will be ready for him when he comes back to life but you killed him i screamed my anger was terrible and now youre stealing his money too and his house it belongs to me not you dan future laughed no no my dear you dont understand the money and the house dont belong to us or to you they belong to your brother al he isnt dead lies just frozen and hes going to stay frozen for two hundred years he laughed again and his young wife began to laugh too i turned and walked out of the house chapter six the key next day the futures sent me all the papers with als name on i showed them to john you need a lawyer he said these people are criminals so i got a lawyer but it didnt help you need money for a good lawyer and i had nothing i went to the nearest lawyers office but the lawyer was unfriendly and unhelpful it costs for half an hour and you pay before we talk he told me when i gave him the he took off his watch and put it on the table in front of him he was a small man with not much hair and a white tired face his eyes were cold and grey like stones when i told him my story he said its not possible but its true read this he read the papers slowly then smiled and looked at his watch well this is very interesting he said i agree these people are criminals but to get the house we have to show that your brother is dead so how can we do that well we can ask scientists to say that cryonics doesnt work but the futures are going to have other scientists who say it does work so we need a doctor to look at your brothers body and say hes dead thats a better idea i laughed how can a doctor look at the body its frozen to celsius its just a piece of ice yes well that is difficult ms shore i do see that the lawyer looked at his watch again its difficult but thats what we need to do but he looked at the papers again before we begin i have to tell you that dan futures lawyer is one of the best in the country maybe i can win and maybe i cant but its going to cost you a lot of money how much i asked at first maybe a lot more later i stood up slowly forget it i said i only had in the bank and there was no food in the house i looked at the lawyers old tired face i cant win can i because i dont have any money the futures are stealing that house from me and i cant do anything about it i ran out of the office for a week i was angry every day all day i shouted at people at work i shouted at the kids john got drunk so i dropped a plate of eggs spaghetti and hamburgers on his head he hit me and went to stay with one of his girlfriends i wasnt sorry he was stupid and lazy like all men twice i drove past als house and saw the black car outside that house belongs to me i thought those people stole it from me and i can do nothing nothing one night i had a dream in my dream i saw als frozen body with a key in his mouth the key was warm and the ice on als frozen head changed to water then the key moved and warmed als body too al opened his mouth screamed and died at two oclock i woke up it was very quiet there was moonlight in the room and no cars were moving on the road outside i began to think about my dream the key of course suddenly i had a plan i got up put on a black shirt and jeans and drove to als house the big black car was outside but there were no lights on in the house i left my car two hundred yards away and walked quietly to the door the futures didnt know that i had a key i opened the door very quietly and went into the big living room there was no sound everyone was asleep my key opened the music room too it opened all the doors in the house i went in and looked at al he was still there the silver body and icy blue face in the glass case the room was full of blue light and the quiet noise of electricity electricity that was the thing al needed electricity in here for his music and of course the freezer needed a lot of electricity too beside the freezer was a big electric switch i put my hand on the switch and smiled goodbye al i said then i switched the electricity off the blue lights went off and the quiet noise stopped it was very dark but i didnt go for a long time i just stood there i wanted to be sure after about twenty minutes the sound began noises from inside the freezer i switched on my flashlight and looked at it the freezer was full of gas like a cloud the gas came from the ice it made small noises i waited another ten minutes until i was sure there was more gas more small noises the freezer was getting warmer very quietly i went upstairs and out of the front door i smiled al i thought you are really dying now and when you are dead all this is going to belong to me and the futures can drive away in their stupid car happily i touched the big black car with my hand and that was my big mistake because beep beep beep the car had an alarm and it made a very loud noise it also turned the cars lights on on off on off on off quickly i began to run to my car two hundred yards away but a police car came round the corner and saw me two policemen got out took hold of my arms and pushed me into their car ok whats all this one man said black clothes three in the morning car alarm i think weve got a car thief pete yeah the other man touched my face with his hand a young woman too ok lets take her to the station chapter seven in court i arrived at the police station at am and said nothing the futures arrived at it was our car dan said someone tried to steal it yeah ok sir a policeman answered weve got the woman here then i said you stole my house so i wanted to steal your car thats ok isnt it it wasnt true but it gave me time while we were all talking in the police station al was getting warmer every minute so we talked angrily from am until i loved it then the futures had to write their story on three pieces of paper for the police so it was after six oclock when they went back to the house and i was happy because i knew they were too late by now i thought al wont be frozen hell just be dead of course they found out at eight oclock the futures came back and there was a lot of trouble als dead they shouted you killed him you switched off the freezer and killed your brother i laughed of course i didnt i said he was dead already i just saved you some electricity thats why im here in court today the police called me a murderer and all the newspapers wrote about me and so of course now i have not one but two really good lawyers the lawyers are free because i have no money but i am famous and they want to be on tv and because of my expensive lawyers the police and the futures look really stupid al shore was dead my lawyers say again and again he was already dying of aids and then he took a dangerous sleeping drug either he took the drug himself or the futures gave it to him and then the futures put him in a freezer and froze his body to celsius nobody can stay alive when theyre just a piece of ice so the futures are the murderers not his sister ellen when she switched off the freezer he was already dead how can anybody kill a dead man every day people write about this in the newspapers and talk about it on tv most people think im right and the futures are wrong last week a newspaper tried to give me for my story but my lawyers told me to wait and this week another newspaper tried to give me this is the last week of the trial soon im going to be free free and rich too at last today my lawyers asked me questions in court and i told my story then they sat down and the police lawyer stood up the police lawyer is a young woman with short dark hair she talks very quickly in a hard strong voice she is clever i know but it doesnt matter now she found only one doctor who thinks that cryonics is possible we found four very famous doctors who dont they say that al was dead before i switched the freezer off either because of the sleeping drug or because of the cold so how could i kill a dead man ms shore did you love your brother she asks i laugh no not really oh why not there is a small smile on her face i tell the court the story of our family how our parents gave al everything and me nothing how al gave me nothing only our parents old house how i cleaned his house for him and cooked at parties how i helped him when he was sick but he gave me nothing my lawyers look unhappy but it doesnt matter nothing matters now next week im going to be free your brother was very sick he had aids did you know that i know now because dan future told me after al was dead i didnt know before i see but you knew that your brother was sick and you bought medicine for him didnt you yes i did why didnt he go to a doctor because im a nurse and his sister he trusted me thats right he trusted you his sister the lawyer looks at me for a long minute she is silent i begin to feel cold and afraid she takes a police bag from under her table opens it and slowly takes out a syringe she holds it up in front of my face look at this ms shore have you seen it before i dont know maybe maybe you say but it has your fingerprints on it ms shore it came from the hospital and we found it by your brothers bed with two other syringes you stole them from the hospital and gave them to your brother didnt you there is a long silence in a very small voice i say all right maybe i did why did you steal them why to help al of course to help him to play good music he wanted clean drugs i tell her what al said to me clean drugs you say do you know what was in this syringe ms shore clean safe drugs oh no ms shore these drugs werent clean or safe these syringes also had bacteria in them very dangerous bacteria bacteria that can kill a strong healthy person bacteria that will kill a person with aids very quickly and perhaps a while ago who knows there was another syringe a dirty syringe not from a hospital but from a drug user in the streets a syringe that gave your brother aids the police lawyer puts the syringe down on the table and looks at me again but we found these three syringes by your brothers bed with your fingerprints on them do you know why they had these dangerous bacteria in them no of course not dont you ms shore well thats strange because i know why they were there and i think everyone in this courtroom knows why they were there too you hated your brother didnt you because he was rich and you were poor and he gave you nothing and you stole drugs and syringes for him because he trusted you he trusted you his sister the nurse she looks at the people in the court a small smile on her young face but that was your brothers big mistake wasnt it ms shore you wanted him to die because you wanted his money and his big house just like the futures so you gave him syringes with dangerous bacteria in them because you wanted to kill him the court is very quiet now and everyone is looking at me but there is nothing i can say nothing because it is all true you didnt kill your brother when you switched off the freezer ms shore we all know that now but you were trying to kill him slowly week by week month by month you were trying to murder him dirty syringes dirty drugs dangerous bacteria you wanted to give him a slow terrible death i think that this court will want to send you to prison for a very long time ellen shore i look around the courtroom at the faces hundreds of eyes are looking at me and they all hate me all of them no one understands me no one loves me no one wants to save me no one i feel nothing at first then i begin to feel cold like ice like a body in a freezer the end
