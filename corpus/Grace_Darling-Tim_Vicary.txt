 chapter one the forfarshire daniel donovan was a passenger on the forfarshire he stood on the deck of the ship and looked at the sea it was difficult to stand on the deck because the wind was so strong the ship was moving up and down uncomfortably and daniel felt ill then a big wave hit the side of the ship and salt water flew into his face the wind is getting stronger said a passenger beside him he was a tall dark man with a black coat mr robb a churchman and its getting darker too yes said daniel i cant see the land now he looked to the west but he could see no land no lights only water big grey waves with white tops which went up and down up and down but the forfarshire is a good modern ship said mr robb nothing can happen to a new ship like this listen to those fine strong engines daniel looked down at the big paddle wheel on the side of the ship it went round and round down under the white water and up again under the water and up then he looked up at the black smoke which came from the forfarshires tunnel yes he said theyre good strong engines but he was not really sure he was an engineer so he knew about engines sometimes the forfarshires engines made strange noises and the paddle wheels went round slowly then there was a crash and they went quickly again daniel was not happy a sea bird flew low across the white tops of the big grey waves daniel watched it and felt wind and rain on his face then a door opened behind him and a woman screamed simon come back come back at once daniel looked behind him and saw a small boy he was running across the deck he was only three or four years old and the wind was much too strong for him he fell over on the deck and began to cry then another big wave hit the side of the ship the white water came over the side and carried the hoy along the deck help the woman screamed save my child daniel put out a hand and caught the boys coat then he carried him quickly back to his mother quick get back in out of the wind woman he shouted he hurried through the door and closed it with a crash its too dangerous for children out there yes i know the woman said come here simon she sat down and held the hoy with one arm she had another child in her other arm a little girl about one or two years old thank you sir she said the ship moved up and down very quickly and daniel sat down beside the woman she smiled at him but she looked very white and ill im daniel donovan he said whats your name mary dawson she said this is my son simon and my daughter sarah isnt your husband with you no she said hes in scotland were going home to see him its good were in a strong modern ship yes said daniel then for a few seconds he said nothing it was quiet in this room much quieter than outside mr donovan said mrs dawson suddenly whats happened to the engines i cant hear them now can you daniel listened my god he thought shes right the engines have stopped he could hear the noise of the wind and the sea but not the engines youre right mrs dawson he said he stood up and ran to the door excuse me i but then he opened the door and his words were lost in the wind outside he looked up at the ships funnel there was no smoke above it he looked over the side of the ship at the big paddle wheels he watched them for two minutes but they did not move and all the time the big grey waves lifted the forfarshire up and down and white water blew over the deck whats happening screamed mr robb why arent we moving the engines have broken down shouted donovan this isnt a sailing ship it cant move without its engines a big wave hit the side of the paddle wheel and sent white water over their heads some sailors were trying to put up a small sail but the wind blew it out of their hands away across the sea into the night there are women and children on this ship shouted mr robb its nearly dark and the weather is getting worse what can we do daniel looked at him i dont know my friend he shouted back i cant do anything why not ask god youre a churchman perhaps hell send an angel to save us chapter two the lighthouse when the engines stopped the forfarshire was about five kilometres east of st abbs head in scotland the ship was travelling north from hull to dundee but the wind came from the north so the forfarshire without her engines began to go south again back to england it was dark and the wind was very strong about thirty kilometres southeast of st abbs head is a group of small rocky islands not far from the mainland these are the fame islands on one of them longstons island there is a lighthouse there were three people in the lighthouse that night william darling his wife thomasin and their daughter grace graces brothers were usually there too but that night they were in bamburgh on the mainland at seven oclock that night william darling went up the long stairs of the lighthouse to light the big oil lantern grace went with him william darling was a thin strong man about fifty years old he moved quickly and quietly he had a candle in his hand sometimes he turned to talk to grace and the candlelight lit up the big brown eyes in his kind old face grace was a young woman about twentytwo years old she was not very tall or strong she bad big brown eyes like her father and soft brown hair she carried an oil can one hand and held the side of her long skirts with the other hand she smiled at her father while they talked at the top of the lighthouse grace and her father came into a small room this room had no walls just big windows all around the noise of the wind and rain was terrible here and they had to shout to hear each other grace put oil in the lug lantern in the middle of the room and william lit it when the lantern was burning the big silver mirrors began to move slowly around it william darling and his daughter stood and watched them the rain trashed against the windows and the wind streamed like an animal in the night god help the poor sailors to see this light shouted william its as dark as death out there no moon no stars nothing but wind and rain and wild white water let us pray there are no ships near the rocks shouted grace the storm will wreck any ship that comes near them tonight thats true lass said william but we can do no more now lets go down to supper the father and daughter went slowly down the dark narrow stairs to the kitchen graces mother thomasin was putting the supper on the table she was a white haired woman of sixtyfive did you see anything she asked no my love nothing william answered only the rain on the windows thank god she said you couldnt help anyone tonight william if there is a shipwreck you can do nothing the hoys arent here bur mother grace said father has to try to save people its his job he cant leave them to die grace no man could row a boat by himself in this wild sea said thomasin so let us thank god that there are no poor ships near us on this terrible night yes grace let us thank god for that said william and so the three people sat quietly around their table in the warm kitchen and put their hands together to pray in the black night outside the wind screamed and the big waves crashed against the rocks again and again and again chapter three in the engine room mr donovan yes the captain wants to see you youre an engineer arent you come this way please the sailor opened a door and daniel went quickly inside they went down some stairs he opened another door and a great cloud of steam came out daniel followed the young sailor into the room it was very hot in here and there were clouds of steam everywhere a tall redfaced man came up to him mr donovan my names humble captain humble we need you sir youre an engineer i understand one of these engines has already stopped and the other is working very badly theres too much steam in this room sir and not a big wave hit the ship with a terrible crash and daniel captain humble and the young sailor held onto the wall daniel saw a big man in a blue coat and shouted to him are you the ships engineer yes the man looked angry tired and frightened whats the matter why has this engine stopped why because its too old of course look here see this and this for five minutes the two engineers moved around in the steam and smoke and looked at the big engines see its broken here and here how can i mend it now in the middle of a storm can you do that sir daniel shook his head he was angry and frightened no of course i cant the ship must go back to land the man agreed quickly thats right thats what i say but you tell captain humble that he says this a new modern ship so it can go anywhere in any weather our rich passengers want to go to scotland so thats where were going he says but its too dangerous and the man stopped when captain humble came near well mr donovan can you help us do you know more about engines than this stupid engineer here he says he can do nothing and we must go back to hull because of a small storm but im sure hes right captain humble shouted daniel i can do nothing for these engines here in this storm theyre too old and this one is broken in three places we must go back to land captain or we will all drown i cannot help you gaaaaaargh the captain pushed daniel angrily away from him then get out of my way mr donovan youre no good to me get back to the women and children daniel went quickly to the door and up the stairs to the wind and rain outside but he was a badly frightened man his hands were shaking and it was hard for him to stand in the terrible screaming wind above his head two sailors were putting up a small sail thats no good he thought its too small for a big ship like this without engines we can do nothing he stared out to sea but he could see nothing only the white tops of the great black waves and the black clouds above no stars no moon but far away to the south west there was a little light flashing on off on off it went behind a wave and then came back again like a star in the night sky far away but it was coming nearer nearer all the time chapter four nothing to see it was half past two in the morning in the lighthouse grace was asleep in her room it was a small tidy room with white walls her dress was on the back of the door and her other cloches were on a chair by the bed there were some books on a desk and some seabirds eggs on a table someone knocked at the door grace her fathers voice called wake up lass i need you to help me what is it father she got up quickly and opened the door william darling stood there with a candle in his hand he was wearing his big black coat and heavy boots and his hat was pulled down over his ears his face was tired and wet with rain the storm is worse the wind is coming from the north now and its stronger we shall have to go outside and tie the boat down or we shall lose it all right ill he down in a minute quickly grace closed the door and put her clothes on she often got up in the night there was always work on a lighthouse and the sea did not wait for morning a minute later she ran downstairs to the kitchen put a coat over her thin dress tied her hair under her hat and followed her father out into the night the wind nearly lifted her off her feet it was strong black hard and wet she opened her mouth to call to her father but the words blew away into the night her coat and dress blew out behind her like paper and the rain hit her face like small stones she walked slowly after her father to the boathouse her father was carrying a small lantern and in its light grace saw a great wave of white water it broke against the rock in front of the boathouse and white water crashed against the boathouse doors william shouted something to grace but she could not hear him the sounds of the wind and the sea were too loud too terrible in the boathouse she helped her father tie the boat down to the rock they tied down the oars too so that nothing could move them then they ran outside and carried everything into the kitchen their chickens their fishing things nothing could stay outside on a night like this before they went back in grace stared out into the night the light from the top of the lighthouse flashed out over the water and for thirty seconds she could see very well one after another the big black waves came out of the darkness waves ten twenty metres high when they hit the rock there was a huge crash and white water flew everywhere thirty forty metres up over the long stone rock grace stared out over the waves past the rocks and islands but thank god she could see no lights no ships no ship could live in that sea tonight grace come on in lass her father held the door open behind her she went in quickly and he closed the door behind them her mother had warm drinks ready for them go to bed now father grace said youve had no sleep yet tonight ill watch the light now and mother can come up at five all right lass he said william was very tired he went upstairs with his wife and in two minutes they were asleep grace finished her drink quickly and changed out of her wet clothes then she went up alone to the room with the big windows at the top of the lighthouse the wild wind screamed and shook the glass it was half past three in the morning chapter five the shipwreck in the passengers sitting room on the forfarshire mrs dawson looked unhappily at daniel mr robb and two other men thomas buchanan and james kelly her two children were crying in her arms im so frightened do you think were going to die what can we do mr donovan without the engines not much mrs dawson said daniel slowly but there are some islands south of here called the farne islands they are very near ive seen the lighthouse flashing on them i think the captain is trying to go into the quieter water between the islands and the mainland i ill go outside again to see how near the lighthouse is ill come back and tell you daniel got up and went out into the night it was raining hard now and the wind was screaming from the back of the ship he stared into the dark he could see nothing in the west where was the light he walked carefully across the ship to the other side suddenly he fell on the wet deck and he caught the side of the ship with his hands then he looked up and a light flashed into his eyes there it was the lighthouse only three hundred metres away to the north but this is wrong he thought were too close much too close i must tell the captain he stood up and began to run along the deck but there in front of him a great mountain of white water flew into the sky ten twenty metres above the ship rocks screamed daniel rocks there are rocks in front of us rocks all round captain captain the captain was already shouting at the sailors and the ship was turning turning to the west away from the light but it was too late there was a great crush and daniel and all the sailors fell to the deck then another crash and another the waves lifted the forfarshire and threw it onto the rock like a child playing with a toy daniel held onto a rope and stared into the dark the light flashed again from the lighthouse then he looked back along the ship people were running out onto the deck and screaming then another very big wave hit the ship white water flew everywhere and fell on daniel like stones he heard a terrible crash and more water fell on him he opened his eyes and looked back along the ship but there was nothing there nothing but black water and more waves the ship was broken in two and the back of the ship with the captain and all the rich passengers was not there a voice shouted into the wind god help us save us from the sea oh god the door of the passengers room was broken but there were still some people inside the room mr robb mrs dawson and her two children mr buchanan and james kelly mr robb was praying loudly daniel went carefully back along the deck to the broken door he put out his hand to touch it and then a wall of white water hit the ship and he could see nothing chapter six out of the window at twenty to five that morning grace felt a hand on her face i was her mother grace was nearly asleep the wind was screaming and shaking the big windows and thomasin darling had to shout go to bed grace its nearly morning ill look after the lantern now all right mother grace got up slowly and went downstairs to her bedroom it was much quieter in her room because of the strong stone walls she looked at the birds eggs on her table the books on the desk near the bed the bed looked warm and comfortable she smiled and began to get undressed a little grey light was coming in through the window its nearly morning she thought ill look at the sea before i go to sleep she walked to the window and looked out but she could see nothing because of the salt and rain on the glass it doesnt matter she thought im too tired ill go to bed but before she went to bed she prayed and when she prayed she heard a voice in her head go to the window grace it said go and look out so she got up went to the window and opened it the wind blew strongly into the room it blew her hair across her face and some hooks fell on the floor in the grey morning light grace looked out across the sea most of the rocks and small islands were under water big white waves were breaking over them the sea was wild frightening terrible grace looked and felt cold she could not remember a storm as bad as this she thought of her warm bed and began to close the window then she saw the ship it was a big ship on harkers rock about three hundred metres away to the south west a very big ship but it was broken in two with white water breaking all over it grace could not see it very well because of the rain and the sea father father come quick she ran out of the room down the stairs to her patents bedroom come quick theres a ship on harkers rock a big one a passenger ship its broken in two william darling was out of bed in a second he put on his boots and coat and followed grace up the stairs did you see any people no father but its difficult to see anything in this wild sea her father took a telescope from his pocket and stared out of graces window at the wreck of the forfarshire he looked for a long time then said i can see no one but my eyes are old you look lass grace stared carefully through the telescope white water crashed over the wreck sometimes the ship moved on the rock and sometimes pieces of wood fell off into the sea but she saw no people no father i think they have all drowned poor poor people yes but its a good thing too william graces mother was in the room now and she was looking run of the window with her husband and daughter why is that thomasin william asked her why because the boys arent here william you couldnt take a boat out in that wild sea alone no one could if there are people alive on that ship now you cannot save them william i could go with him mother said grace quietly not in a sea like that grace her mother said her father said nothing we mustnt stop looking said grace if there is someone alive we cant just leave them to die and so for the next two hours grace and her parents watched the wreck of the forfarshire through the telescope slowly daylight came but they saw no people only rain and waves and a broken ship in the wild angry sea chapter seven on harkers rock there were twelve people on harkers rock daniel donovan was with mrs dawson and her children and there were eight other people near them the wreck of the forfarshirc was behind them between them and the lighthouse they were nearly dead with wet and cold every two minutes white water fell on them daniel had lost his coat and the wind cut through his thin shirt like a knife his hands and legs were red with blood mrs dawson was crying and sat with her arms around her two small children mr robb prayed in a loud voice without stopping thomas buchanan and the other men sat together too cold to move one man had a broken leg the waves got bigger and the people on the rock moved closer together after half an hour mr robb the churchman stopped praying daniel looked at him he was lying on the rock his face white and cold his eyes were open but he did not see daniels hand in front of his face he was dead well all be dead soon shouted thomas buchanan angrily no man can live long here in this wind why dont they come from the lighthouse to save us shouted james kelly the lighthouse daniel remembered it suddenly we must wave to id he shouted they cant see us here come up onto the top of the rook wave to them daniel and james kelly climbed to the top of the rock but at first the others did not move they were too cold too tired too frightened thomas buchanan had to hit them and push them to the top of the rock the wind was very strong there so it was difficult to stand they held onto the rock and shouted and waved at the lighthouse as hard as they could no one answered behind the wild sea and the rain the lighthouse stood still and quiet a few minutes later the light stopped flashing but they saw nobody one by one the men came down from the top of the rock and sat with their arms around each other out of the wind only daniel and thomas buchanan stayed on top of the rock they waved and shouted and cried but they saw no one their faces were as cold as death and salty and wet from the sea chapter eight the worst sea this year grace saw them first her mother was cooking breakfast in the kitchen and her father was turning off the lantern grace was still looking out of her window through the telescope for a second she saw a man on top of the rock then she could not see him behind the waves but a minute later she saw him again and there were two men this time they stood together and waved wildly then the rain came and she could see nothing but perhaps there were four or live she put down the telescope and called her father father come quick there are men on the rock they are still alive william darling ran into the room he saw them he put down the telescope and looked at his daughter we must go lass he said quietly you and i we must take the boat and save them will you come of course father she said if we dont save them who will thats right lass william darling looked out of the window unhappily ive not seen a worse sea this year no boat could come from the mainland in this wind graces mother came into the room and heard him you cant go william she said grace is only a girl look at that sea youll both drown we have to try mother said grace angrily think of those poor people alone on that rock we live on a lighthouse its our job its a job for your father and brothers grace not you youll drown how will that help those men how will it help them if we do nothing thomasin darling looked out of the window again at the wild angry sea she shook her head perhaps youll get to the rock grace she said with gods help and the wind behind you but youll never get back against the wind not one man and a girl in a storm like this never william darling took his wifes hands in his listen to me thomasin he said there are three or four seamen on that rock strong men theyll help row us back if we save them if you save them said thomasin and if you dont at first william darling did not answer he looked into his wife s eyes were going thomasin he said quietly we have to go come down now and help us with the boat outside in the terrible wind and the rain it took them fifteen minutes to get the boat ready three times the waves nearly broke the boat on the rock william got in first and sat at the front grace and her mother held the boat away from the rocks william got two oars ready and waited for the next wave all right grace get in now he shouted grace jumped into the boat and william pulled hard with the oars one two three pulls and then a wave lifted the boat and the oars were pulling at air but they were away from the rocks the boat came down between two waves and grace quickly got her oars out they both pulled hard together but carefully too they did not want to lose an oar in the wild water grace was cold and her dress and hat were wet she was afraid but happy and excited too this is what god wants me to do she thought at the top of a wave she could easily see across the longstone rock to the other side then the boat went down between the waves and she could see only mountains of wild water everywhere pull left left william shouted we must keep the rocks between us and the worst waves grace pulled hard at her oars and watched the waves god will help us save them she thought happily i know he will outside the lighthouse thomasin darling watched the little boat she saw it for a second then it went behind a wave and came up again its not possible she thought no boat can live in a sea like that oh god please save my husband and daughter she watched and prayed and the little boat got smaller and smaller on the wild grey sea chapter nine angel in the storm help me mr donovan please help how can i help you woman daniel shouted at mrs dawson how can anyone help he was too cold too frightened too tired he couldnt think now please help my children cried mrs dawson keep them warm for me theyre so cold daniel put his arms around the woman and her children it was true the children were cold very cold their eyes were open but they were not moving he tried to warm them with his hands he shook them but they did not move its no good woman he said no one can theyre not dead yet screamed mrs dawson i know theyre not dead she looked into her childrens faces wake up simon sarah god will save us soon please dont die daniel was tired and angry dont be stupid woman he shouted at her were all going to die dont you understand no one knows were here mrs dawson stared at him her face was wet with rain and her hair was blowing in her eyes god will send someone she said he must i know he will whos he going to send an angel daniel laughed angrily and looked at the wild empty sea but mrs dawson was still screaming someone must come she shouted we cant die here go to the top of the rock and look again tell them about my children your children are but he was afraid to say it he turned away angry with himself and climbed to the top of the rock the wind screamed in his ears he looked across to the lighthouse and saw nothing only waves and more waves i hate the sea he thought its like a great grey animal with a hundred white teeth i hate it it wants to kill us all and then he saw the boat he saw it only for a second it was on top of a white wave it went down behind the wave but then it came up again down and up again and it was coming nearer a little boat with two people in it he held the rock and stared at it the boat came nearer and nearer still then a great mountain of a wave came with white angry teeth and the little boat went down behind it no daniel cried no please god no the boat came up on top of the wave with white water all around it the oars were up out of the water for a second the boat began to turn on its side then the oars went down into the water and the boat came down the side of the wave daniel could see the two people in the boat now one was a man one was a young woman he got up and ran down the rock he was crying and laughing at the same time its all right mrs dawson he shouted its all right look there look your angel is coming chapter ten too many people grace looked quickly behind her and saw the people on the rock they were waving shouting laughing but there were eight nine perhaps ten of them too many for this small boat she looked back at the waves and pulled hard and carefully with her oars it was more than a kilometre around the islands from the lighthouse to the ship and every wave every rock was different and dangerous she was tired now but the job was not finished the wrecked ship on harkers rock was still fifty metres away how many can you see grace her father shunted she looked again ten twelve perhaps she said its too many father well all drown if they try to get in yes put me on the rock lass and then take the boat out again shouted william ill talk to them we cant take more than five the first time it was very dangerous near the rock in the best place the waves went up and down two or three metres every minute if we make one mistake grace thought the boat will break into fifty small pieces and well he on the rock with the others carefully slowly grace and her father tried to get the boat near the rock but three times they had to pull away at the last minute then the fourth time william darling jumped the passengers pulled him onto the rock grace quickly rowed the boat out to sea again she was alone in the boat now and the boat moved differently she was tired and her arms and back were hurting but she knew about boats watch the sea all the time she told herself the waves must meet the front of the boat first or the boat will turn over forger the cold and the rain and the wet god will help me on the rock william darling spoke quickly im going to take the woman back with me he said and that man there with the broken leg then i need three strong men to help me row the boat he looked at daniel donovan and two others you man and you and you the others must wait here well come back for you later no by god why me shouted james kelly i want to come now youre going to stay here sir shouted william angrily dont you understand if you get in the boat well all drown and my children cried mrs dawson dont forget my children william looked at her unhappily he held out his arms give the children to me mother he said carefully he took the boy and the girl from her and put the little bodies on the rock near the sea they were dead and cold they are in gods hands mother he said then he spoke quickly and quietly to daniel donovan when the boat comes help me get the woman in we cant take her children daniel agreed william put his arm around mrs dawson and waved to grace carefully slowly she rowed the boat in to the rock it was harder without her father the wind and the waves moved the boat more quickly and grace was very tired now one mistake meant death for them all she came closer twenty metres ten seven five a big wave lifted the boat then a smaller one behind it she pulled hard on the oars and threw a rope to a man on the rock then her father got into the boat with a woman in his arms she was screaming my children bring the children please no mother william darling took the oars help her grace grace went to the back of the boat with the woman and held her daniel donovan and two other men got in they were carrying the man with the broken leg the front of the boat was very near the rock now too near grace looked behind her and saw a big wave pull father she shouted pull hard she stood up and pushed against the rock with an oar the boat was very heavy now with all these people in it william pulled hard with his oars the big wave came in and broke into white water all around them but the boat did not hit the rock william pulled again and shouted you men help me take the oars one each the little boat was very full the sides were only just above the water and often the water came in grace threw it out with her hat the wind and waves were against them now and the four men had to row hard but slowly very slowly the lighthouse came nearer at last from the top of the waves they could see thomasin darling she was standing in front of the lighthouse and waving to them they were very tired when they got to the lighthouse william and daniel carried the man with the broken leg into the kitchen and grace and her mother helped mrs dawson inside the kitchen william smiled at his daughter you did a good job lass he said thank you ill come back again with you father she said no he said youre too tired ill take two of these he looked at daniel and the other two men which are the strongest he asked daniel was very tired there was a fire in the kitchen a warm beautiful fire he wanted to lie down in front of the fire and go to sleep for a long long time but william darlings quiet brown eyes were looking at him ill come with yon daniel said ill come too said thomas buchanan william darling smiled good men he said can you two men row as well as my daughter daniel looked at grace who was busy helping mrs dawson she looked very small here in the kitchen like any young woman ill try he said right said william come on then so daniel and thomas buchanan followed the old lighthouse man away from the warm kitchen fire out into the rain and wind again daniel looked at the angry sea with its terrible waves and he felt cold and frightened he remembered the small young woman alone in the boat by harkers rock great god he thought you made that girl strong like an angel make me strong too like her the times london th september mr darling and his young daughter saved nine people from the wreck of the forfarshire the storm lasted for three days and they stayed all that time with the darlings in the lighthouse queen victoria thinks that grace darling is one of the finest young women in this country and she is writing to thank her one hundred years from now people will remember this day the end
