prior consent in any form of binding or cover other than that in which it is published and without a similar condition including this condition being imposed on the subsequent purchaser the vibrating clangour from the four great piston engines set teeth on edge and made an intolerable assault on cringing eardrums the decibellevel smith calculated must have been about that found in a boiler factory and one moreover that was working on overtime rates while the shaking cold in that cramped instrumentcrowded flightdeck was positively siberian on balance he reflected he would have gone for the siberian boiler factory any time because whatever its drawbacks it wasnt liable to fall out of the sky or crash into a mountainside which in his present circumstances seemed a likely enough if not imminent contingency for all that the pilot of their lancaster bomber appeared to care to the contrary smith looked away from the darkly opaque world beyond the windscreens where the wipers fought a useless battle with the driving snow and looked again at the man in the lefthand captains seat wing commander cecil carpenter was as completely at home in his environment as the most contented oyster in his shell in whitstable bay any comparison with a siberian boiler factory he would have regarded as the ravings of an unhinged mind quite dearly he found the shuddering vibration as soothing as the ministrations of the gentlest of masseurs the roar of theengines positively soporific and the ambient temperature just right for a man of his leisured literary tastes before him at a comfortable reading distance a book rested on a hinged contraption which he had swung out from the cabins side from what little smith could occasionally see of the lurid cover depicting a bloodstained knife plunged into the back of a girl who didnt seem to have any clothes on the wing commander held the more serious contemporary novelists in a fine contempt he turned a page magnificent he said admiringly he puffed deeply on an ancient briar that smelt like a fumigating plant by heavens this feller can write banned of course young tremayne this to the freshfaced youngster in the copilots seat so i cant let you have it till you grow up he broke off fanned the smokeladen air to improve the visibility and peered accusingly at his copilot flying officer tremayne you have that look of pained apprehension on your face again yes sir thats to say no sir part of the malaise of our time carpenter said sorrowfully the young lack so many things like appreciation of a fine pipe tobacco or faith in their commanding officers he sighed heavily carefully marked the place in his book folded the rest away and straightened in his seat youd think a man would be entitled to some peace and quiet on his own flightdeck he slid open his side screen an icy gust of snowladen wind blew into the flightdeck carrying with it the suddenly deepened roar from the engines carpenter grimaced and thrust his head outside shielding his eyes with a gauntleted right hand five seconds later he shook his head dispiritedly screwed his eyes shut as he winced in what appeared to be considerable pain withdrew his head closed the screen brushed the snow away from his flaming red hair and magnificent handlebar moustache and twisted round to look at smith it is no small thing major to be lost in a blizzard in the night skies over wartorn europe not again sir tremayne said protestingly no man is infallible my son smith smiled politely you mean you dont know where we are sir how should i carpenter slid down in his seat halfdosed his eyes and yawned vastly im only the driver we have a navigator and the navigator has a radar set and ive no faith in either of them well well smith shook his head to think that they lied to me at the air ministry they told me youd flown some three hundred missions and knew the continent better than any taxi driver knows his london a foul canard put about by unfriendly elements who are trying to prevent me from getting a nice safe job behind a desk in london carpenter glanced at his watch ill give you exactly thirty minutes warning before we shove you out over the dropping zone a second glance at his watch and a heavy frown flying officer tremayne your gross dereliction of duty is endangering the entire mission sir an even deeper apprehension in tremaynes face i should have had my coffee exactly three minutes ago yes sir right away sir smith smiled again straightened from his cramped position behind the pilots seats left the flightdeck and moved aft into the lancasters fuselage here in this cold bleak and forbidding compartment which resembled nothing so much as an iron tomb the impression of the siberian boiler factory was redoubled the noise level was so high as to be almost intolerable the cold was intense and metalribbed metal walls dripping with condensation made no concessions whatsoever to creature comfort nor did the six metalframed canvas seats bolted to the floor functionalism gone mad any attempt to introduce those sadistically designed instruments of torture in hm penitentiaries would have caused a national outcry huddled in those six chairs sat six men probably smith reflected the six most miserable men hed ever seen like himself each of the six was dressed in the uniform of the german alpine corps like himself each man wore two parachutes all were shivering constantly stamping their feet and beating their arms and their frozen breath hung heavy in the icechill air facing them along the upper starboard side of the fuselage ran a taut metal wire which passed over the top of the doorway on to this wire were clipped snapcatches wires from which led down to folded parachutes resting on top of an assortment of variously shaped bundles the contents of only one of which could be identified by the protruding ends of several pairs of skis the nearest parachutist a dark intense man with latin features looked up at smiths arrival he had never smith thought seen edward carraciola look quite so unhappy well carraciolas voice was just as unhappy as his face ill bet hes no more bloody idea where we are than i have he does seem to navigate his way across europe by opening his window and sniffing the air from time to time smith admitted but i wouldnt worry he broke off as a sergeant airgunner entered from the rear carrying a can of steaming coffee and enamel mugs neither would i sir the sergeant smiled tolerantly the wing commander has his little ways coffee gentlemen back at base he claims that he reads detective novels all the time and depends upon one of the gunners telling him from time to time where we are smith cradled frozen hands round the coffee mug do you know where we are of course sir he seemed genuinely surprised then nodded to the metal rungs leading to the upper machinegun turret just nip up there sir and look down to your right smith lifted an enquiring eyebrow handed over his mug climbed the ladder and peered down to his right through the perspex dome of the turret cupola for a few seconds only the darkness filled his eyes then gradually far below and seen dimly through the driving snow he could make out a ghostly luminescence in the night a luminescence which gradually resolved itself into a crisscross pattern of illuminated streets for a brief moment only smiths face registered total disbelief then quickly returned to its normal dark stillness well well he retrieved his coffee somebody should tell them down there the lights are supposed to be out all over europe not in switzerland sir the sergeant explained patiently thats basle basle smith stared at him basle good god hes gone seventy or eighty miles off course the flight plan routed us north of strasbourg yes sir the sergeant airgunner was unabashed the wing commander says he doesnt understand flight plans he grinned half apologetically to tell the truth sir this is our milkrun into the vorarlberg we fly east along the swiss frontier then south of schaffhausen but thats over swiss territory is it on a clear night you can see the lights of zurich they say wing commander carpenter has a room permanently reserved for him there in the bauraulac what he says if its a choice between a prisonerofwar camp in germany and internment in switzerland he knows which side of the frontier hes coming down on after that we fly down the swiss side of lake constance turn east at lindau climb to eight thousand to clear the mountains and its only a hop skip and jump to the weissspitze i see smith said weakly butbut dont the swiss object frequently sir their complaints always seem to coincide with the nights were around those parts wing commander carpenter claims its some illintentioned luftwaffe pilot trying to discredit him what else smith asked but the sergeant was already on his way to the flightdeck the lancaster lurched as it hit an infrequent air pocket smith grabbed a rail to steady himself and lieutenant morris schaffer of the american office of strategic services and smiths secondincommand cursed fluently as the better part of a cup of scalding coffee emptied itself over his thigh thats all i need he said bitterlyive no morale left i wish to god we would crashland in switzerland think of all those lovely wienerschnitzels and apfelstrudels after a couple of years living among you limeys spam and powdered eggs and an ounce of margarine a day thats what mama schaffers little boy requires building up youd also live a damn sight longer friend carraciola observed morosely he transferred his gaze to smith gave him a long considering look the whole setup stinks major i dont think i understand smith said quietly suicidal is what i mean what a bunch just look at us he gestured to the three men sitting nearest to him on his left olaf christiansen a flaxen haired first cousin of leif ericsson lee thomas a short dark welshmanboth those men seemed slightly amusedand torrancesmythe as languidly aristocraticlooking as any cidevant french count that ever rode a tumbrel a doleful exoxford don who clearly wished he were back among the university cloisters christiansen thomas old smithy and myself were just a bunch of civil servants filing clerks i know very well what you are smith said quietly or yourself in the desynchronised thunder of the engines the softvoiced interruption had gone unnoticed a major in the black watch no doubt you cut quite a dash playing the bagpipes at el alamein but why the hell you to command us no offence but this is no more in your line than it is ours or lieutenant schaffer here an airborne cowboy i hate horses schaffer said loudly thats why i had to leave montana or take george here carraciola jerked a thumb in the direction of the last member of the party george harrod a stocky army sergeant radiooperator with an expression of profound resignation on his face ill bet hes never as much as made a parachute jump in his life before i have news for you harrod said stoically ive never even been in a plane before hes never even been in a plane before carraciola said despairingly my god what a bunch of nohopers all we need is a team composed of specialist alpinists commandos mountaineers and safebreakers and what do we have he shook his head slowly we have us smith said gently we were all the colonel could get be fair he told us yesterday that the one thing in the world that he didnt have was time carraciola made no reply none of the others spoke but smith didnt have to be any clairvoyant to know what was in the minds of all of them they were thinking what he was thinking like himself they were back several hours in time and several hundred miles in space in that admiralty operations room in london where viceadmiral rolland ostensibly assistant director of naval operations but in fact the longserving head of mi the counterespionage branch of the british secret service and his deputy colonel wyattturner had gravely and reluctantly briefed them on what they had as gravely and reluctantly admitted to be a mission born from the sheerest desperation deucedly sorry and all that chaps but time is of the essence wyattturner a big redfaced heavily moustached colonel tapped his cane against a wallmap of germany pointing to a spot just north of the austrian border and a little west of garmischpartenkirchen our man was brought down here at am this morning but shaef in their allknowing wisdom didnt let us know until am damned idiots damned idiots for not letting us know until so late and doubledamned idiots for ignoring our advice in the first place gad will they never learn to listen to us he shook his head in anger tapped the map again anyway hes here schloss adler the castle of the eagle believe me its well named only an eagle could get there our job smith said how are you so sure hes there sir were sure mosquito he was in crashlanded only ten miles away the pilot got off a radio message just before a german patrol dosed in he paused smiled grimly continued schloss adler major smith is the combined hq of the german secret service and the gestapo in south germany where else would they take him where indeed how was he brought down sir through the most damnable illluck we carried out a saturation raid on numberg last night and there shouldnt have been a german fighter within a hundred miles of the austrian border but a wandering messerschmidtt patrol got him thats unimportant whats important is getting him out before he talks hell talk thomas said sombrely they all do why did they disregard our advice sir we told them two days ago the whys dont matter wyattturner said tiredly not any more the fact that hell talk does so we get him out you get him out torrancesmythe cleared his throat delicately there are paratroops sir scared smithy naturally sir the schloss adler is inaccessible and impregnable it would require a battalion of paratroops to take it of course christiansen said the fact that theres no time to mount a massed paratroop attack has no bearing on the matter christiansen appeared positively cheerful the proposed operation obviously appealed vastly to him wyattturner gave him the benefit of his icy blue stare then decided to ignore him secrecy and stealth are the only hope he went on and you gentlemen arei trustsecretive and stealthy you are experts at that and experts at survival behind enemy lines where all of you have spent considerable periods of time major smith lieutenant schaffer and sergeant harrod here in their professional capacities the rest of you inurn other duties with the that was a damned long time ago sir carraciola interrupted at least for smithy thomas christiansen and myself were out of touch now we dont know the latest developments in weapons and combat techniques and god only knows were out of training after a couple of years behind a desk it takes me all my time to run fifty yards after a bus youll have to get fit fast wont you wyattturner said coldly besides what matters most is that with the exception of major smith you all have an extensive knowledge of western europe you all speak fluent german youll find your combat trainingon the level youll be engaged inas relevant today as it was five years ago you are men with exceptional records of resourcefulness ability and ingenuity if anyone has a chance you have youre all volunteers of course of course carraciola echoed his face carefully deadpan then he looked speculatively at wyattturner there is of course another way sir he paused then went on very quietly indeed a way with a hundred per cent guarantee of success neither admiral holland nor i claim to be infallible wyattturner said slowly we have missed an alternative you have the answer to our problems yes whistle up a pathfinder squadron of lancasters with ton blockbuster bombs do you think anyone in the schloss adler would ever talk again i dont think so admiral holland spoke gently and for the first time moving from the wallmap to join the group admiral holland always spoke gently when you wielded the almost incredible range of power that he did you didnt have to talk loudly to make yourself heard he was a short greyhaired man with a deeply trenched face and an air of immense authority no he repeated i dont think so nor do i think that your grasp of the realities of the situation is any match for your total ruthlessness the captured man lieutenant general carnaby is an american if we were to destroy him general eisenhower would probably launch his second front against us instead of against the germans he smiled deprecatingly as though to remove rebuke from his voice there are certainurnniceties to be observed in our relationship with our allies wouldnt you agree carraciola didnt agree or disagree he had apparently nothing to say neither did anyone else colonel wyattturner cleared his throat thats it then gentlemen ten oclock tonight at the airfield no more questions i take it yes sir there bloody well is begging the colonels pardon sir sergeant george harrod not only sounded heated he looked it too whats all this about whys this geezer so bloody important why the hell do we have to risk our necks thatll do sergeant wyattturners voice was sharp authoritative you know all you require to know if were sending a man to what may be his death colonel i think he has the tight to know why admiral holland interrupted gently almost apologetically the rest know he should too its painfully simple sergeant general carnaby is the overall coordinator of planning for the exercise known as operation overlordthe second front it would be absolutely true to say that he knows more about the allied preparations for the second front than any man alive he set off last night to meet his opposite numbers in the middle east russia and the italian front to coordinate final plans for the invasion of europe the rendezvous was in cretethe only meeting point the russians would accept they havent a plane fast enough to outrun the german fighters the british mosquito canbut it didnt last night silence lay heavy in the austere operations room harrod rubbed his hand across his eyes then shook his head slowly as if to clear it when he spoke again all the truculence all the anger had vanished from his voice his words came very slowly and if the general talks hell talk holland said the voice was soft but it carried total conviction as mr thomas has just said they all talk he wont be able to help himself a mixture of mescalin and scopolamine and hell tell them all the plans for the second front the words came as from a man in a dream when where howgood god sir well have to call the whole thing off precisely we call it off no second front this year another nine months on the war another million lives needlessly lost you understand the urgency sergeant the sheer desperate urgency of it all i understand sir now i understand harrod turned to wyattturner sorry i spoke like that sir im afraidwell im a bit edgy sir were all a bit edgy sergeant well the airfield at ten oclock and well check the equipment he smiled without humour im afraid the uniforms may not fit too well this is early closing day in savile row sergeant harrod huddled more closely into his bucket seat beat freezing hands against freezing shoulders morosely surveyed his uniform wrinkled like an elephants legs and about three sizes too big for him then raised his voice above the clamour of the lancasters engines well he said bitterly he was right about the bloody uniforms anyway and wrong about everything else carraciola said heavily i still say we should have sent in the lancasters smith still standing against the starboard fuselage lit a cigarette and eyed him speculatively he opened his mouth to speak when it occurred to him that he had seen men in more receptive mood he looked away without saying anything in the flightdeck now slid so impossibly far forward in his seat that the back of his head rested on the back of his seat wing commander carpenter was still deeply and contentedly preoccupied with pipe coffee and literature beside him flying officer tremayne was obviously failing to share his mood of pleasurable relaxation he was in fact keeping a most anxious watch his eyes constantly shifting from the instrument panel to the opaque darkness beyond the windscreen to the recumbent figure of his superior officer who appeared to be in danger of dropping off to sleep at any moment suddenly tremayne sat far forward in his seat stared for long seconds through the windscreen ahead of him then turned excitedly to carpenter theres schaffhausen down there sir carpenter groaned heavily closed his book swung back the hinged bookrest finished his coffee levered himself upright with another groan slid open his sidescreen and made an elaborate pretence of examining the loom of light far below without however actually going to the lengths of exposing his face to the wind and the driving snow outside he closed the screen and looked at tremayne by heavens he said admiringly i believe youre right its a great comfort to have you along my boy a great comfort he switched on the intercom while tremayne looked suitably abashed major smith yes thirty minutes to go he switched off and turned again to tremayne right southeast down the old bodensee and for gods sake keep to the swiss side smith hung up the headphones and looked quizzically at the six seated men thats it then half an hour lets hope its warmer down there than it is up here no one had any comment to make on that no one seemed to have any hope either soundlessly wordlessly they looked without expression at one another then pulled themselves stiffly to their frozen feet then very slowly very awkwardly their numbed hands and cramped conditions making things almost impossibly awkward for them they prepared themselves for the drop they helped each other strap loads on their backs beneath the highmounted parachutes then struggled into their white waterproof snow trousers sergeant harrod went one better he pulled a voluminous snow smock over his head zipped it up with difficulty and drew the hood over his head he turned round questioningly as a hand tapped the hummocked outline below his white smock i hardly like to say this schaffer said diffidently but i really dont reckon your radio is going to stand the shock of landing sergeant why not harrod looked more lugubrious than ever its been done before not by you it hasnt by my reckoning youre going to hit the ground with a terminal velocity of a hundred and eighty miles an hour not to put too fine a point on it i think youre going to experience some difficulty in opening your chute harrod looked at him looked at his other five smockless companions then nodded slowly and touched his own smock you mean i put this on after we reach the ground well schaffer said consideringly i really think it would help he grinned at harrod who grinned back almost cheerfully even carraciolas lips twitched in the beginnings of a smile the release of tension within that frozen fuselage was almost palpable well well time i earned my wingcommanders pay while you stripling pilots sit and gaze in rapt admiration carpenter studied his watch two fifteen time we changed places both men unhooked their safety belts and awkwardly changed over carpenter fastidiously adjusted the righthand seats back rest until it was exactly right for him manoeuvred his parachute to its position of maximum comfort fastened his seatbelt unhooked and adjusted on his head a combined earphones and microphone set and made a switch sergeant johnson carpenter never bothered with the regulation callup formalities are you awake back in the navigators tiny and extremely uncomfortable recess sergeant johnson was very much awake he had been awake for hours he was bent over a glowing greenish radar screen his eyes leaving it only to make rapid reference to the charts an ordnance map a picture and a duplicate compass altimeter and airspeed indicator he reached for the switch by his side im awake sir if you fly us into the side of the weissspitze carpenter said threateningly ill have you reduced to aircraftman aircraftman second class johnson i wouldnt like that i make it nine minutes sir for once were agreed on something so do i carpenter switched off slid open the starboard screen and peered out although there was just the faintest wash of moonlight in the night sky visibility might as well have been zero it was a greyly opaque world a blind world with nothing to be seen but the thinly driving snow he withdrew his head brushed away the snow from his huge moustache closed the screen looked regretfully at his pipe and carefully put it away in his pocket for tremayne the stowage of the pipe was the final proof that the wing commander was clearing the decks for action he said unhappily a bit dicey isnt it sir locating the weissspitze in this lot i mean dicey carpenter sounded almost jovial dicey i dont see why its as big as a mountain in fact it is a mountain we cant miss it my dear boy thats what i mean he paused a pause with more meaning in it and this plateau on the weissspitze that we have to drop them on only three hundred yards wide sir mountain above it cliff below it and those adiabatic mountain winds or whatever you call them blowing in any old unpredictable direction a fraction to the south and well hit the mountain a fraction to the north and theyll fall down that whacking great cliff and like as not all break their necks three hundred yards what do you want carpenter demanded expansively heathrow airport three hundred yards all the room in the world my boy we land this old crate on runways a tenth of that width yes sir ive always found runway landing lights a great help sir at seven thousand feet up the side of the weissspitze he broke off as a buzzer rang carpenter made a switch johnson yes sir johnson was huddled more closely than ever over his radar screen where the revolving scannerline had picked up a white spot immediately to the right of centre of the screen i have it sir right where it should be he looked away from the screen and made a quick check on the compass course ohninethree sir good lad carpenter smiled at tremayne made a tiny course alteration and began to whistle softly to himself have a look out your window laddie my moustache is beginning to get all waterlogged tremayne opened his window strained his head as far as possible but still there was only this grey and featureless opacity he withdrew his head silently shook it no matter it must be there somewhere carpenter said reasonably he spoke into the intercom sergeant five minutes hook up hook up the sergeant airgunner repeated the order to the seven men standing in line along the starboard side of the fuselage five minutes silently they clipped their parachute snap catches on to the overhead wire the sergeant airgunner carefully checking each catch nearest the door and first man to jump was sergeant harrod behind him stood lieutenant schaffer whose experiences with the oss had made him by far the most experienced parachutist of the group and whose unenviable task it was to keep an eye on harrod he was followed by carraciola then smithas leader he preferred to be in the middle of the groupthen christiansen thomas and torrancesmythe behind torrancesmythe two young aircraftmen stood ready to slide packaged equipment and parachutes along the wire and heave them out as swiftly as possible after the last man had jumped the sergeant airgunner took up position by the door the tension was back in the air again twentyfive feet forward of where they were standing carpenter slid open his side screen for the fifth time in as many minutes the now downward drooping moustache had lost much of its splendid panache but the wing commander had obviously decided that there were more urgent considerations in life than waterlogged moustaches he was wearing goggles now continuously brushing away snow and moisture with a chamois leather but the view aheador lack of view remained obstinately the same still that greyly driving snow looming out of and vanishing into that greyly impenetrable opacity still nothingness he closed the screen a callup buzzer rang carpenter made a switch listened nodded three minutes he said to tremayne ohninetwo tremayne made the necessary minute course adjustment he no longer looked through the sidescreen he no longer even looked at the screen ahead of him his whole being was concentrated upon flying that big bomber his allexclusive attention his total concentration on three things only the compass the altimeter and carpenter a degree too far to the south and the lancaster would crash into the side of the weissspitze a couple of hundred feet too low and the same thing would happen a missed signal from carpenter and the mission was over before it had begun the young the absurdly young face was expressionless the body immobile as he piloted the lancaster with a hairtrigger precision that he had never before achieved only his eyes moved in a regular rhythmic unvarying pattern the compass the altimeter carpenter the compass the altimeter carpenter and never longer than a second on each again carpenter slid open his sidescreen and peered out again he had the same reward the opacity the grey nothingness with his head still outside he lifted his left hand palm downwards and made a forward motion instantly tremaynes hand fell on the throttle levers and eased them forward the roar of the big engines died away to a more muted thunder carpenter withdrew his head if he was concerned no trace of it showed in his face he resumed his soft whistling calmly almost leisurely scanned the instrument panel then turned his head to tremayne he said conversationally when you were in flying school ever hear tell of a strange phenomenon known as stalling speed tremayne started glanced hurriedly at the instrument panel and quickly gave a fraction more power to the engines carpenter smiled looked at his watch and pressed a buzzer twice the bell rang above the head of the sergeant airgunner standing by the fuselage door he looked at the tense expectant faces before him and nodded two minutes gentlemen he eased the door a few inches to test whether it was moving freely with the door only fractionally open the suddenly deepened roar from the engines was startling but nowhere nearly as dismaying as the snowladen gust of icy wind that whistled into the fuselage the parachutists exchanged carefully expressionless glances glances correctly interpreted by the sergeant who closed the door and nodded again i agree gentlemen no night for man nor beast wing commander carpenter his head once again poked through the sidescreen didnt think so either five seconds exposure to that arctic wind and driving snow and your face was full of porcupine quills fifteen seconds and the totally numbed skin conveyed no sensation at all it was when you withdrew you head and waited for the exquisite pain of returning circulation that the fun really started but this time carpenter was determined not to withdraw his head until he had complete justification for doing so and the only justification would be the sighting of the weissspitze mechanically industriously he rubbed the chamois leather across his goggles stared unblinkingly into the greyly swirling gloom and hoped that he saw the weissspitze before the weissspitze saw him inside tremaynes eyes continued on their rhythmic unvarying pattern of movement the compass the altimeter carpenter the compass the altimeter carpenter but now his gaze was resting fractionally longer on carpenter each time waiting for the sudden signal that would galvanise him into throwing the big lancaster into a violent bank to port the only avoiding action they could possibly take carpenters left hand was moving but he wasnt giving any signal the fingers of his left hand were drumming gently on his knee this tremayne suddenly and incredulously realised was probably the highest state of excitement that carpenter was capable of achieving ten seconds passed five and another five tremayne was conscious that even in that icecold cabin the sweat was pouring down his face the urge to pull the bomber away to the left to avoid the shattering annihilating collision that could be only seconds away now was almost overpowering he was aware of a fear a fear bordering on a reasonabdicating panic such as he had never previously guessed at let alone experienced and then he became aware of something else the drumming of carpenters left fingers had abruptly ceased carpenter had it now it was more imagined than real more guessed at than seen but he had it now then gradually almost imperceptibly ahead and a little to the right of the direction of flight he became aware of something more solidly tangible than wishful thinking beginning to materialise out of the nothingness and then suddenly it wasnt materialising any more it was solidly unmistakably there the smooth unbroken side of an almost vertically towering mountain soaring up at a dizzy є until it vanished in the grey darkness above carpenter withdrew his head leaving the screen open this time and pressed his headswitch sergeant johnson the words came out stiffly mechanically not because of any crisis of emotion that the wing commander was passing through but because his entire face lips included was so frozen that he could no longer articulate properly sir johnsons voice over the intercom was disembodied empty but even the metallic impersonality of that single word could not disguise the bowtaut tension behind it carpenter said i think flying officer johnson a much nicer name sir relax i have it you can go back to sleep he switched off took a quick look through the sidescreen reached up and touched an overhead switch above the starboard door in the fuselage a red light came on the sergeant airgunner laid his hand on the door one minute gentlemen he jerked the door wide open securing it on its standing latch and a miniature blizzard howled into the belly of the lancaster when the red light turns green he left the sentence unfinished partly because those few words were crystal clear in themselves partly because he had to shout so loudly to make himself heard over the combined roar of wind and engines that any superfluity of words was only that much wasted effort no one else said anything mainly because of the near impossibility of making oneself heard in any event the parachutists silently exchanged glances conveyed more eloquently than words the very obvious thought that was in the minds of all of them if it was like that inside what the hell was it like outside at a gesture from the sergeant they moved up in line to the open door sergeant harrod in the lead on his face was the expression of a christian martyr meeting his first and last lion the lancaster like some great black pterodactyl from out of the primeval past roared on through the driving snow alongside the smoothly precipitous side of the weissspitze that sheer wall of iceencrusted rock seemed very close indeed tremayne was convinced that it was impossibly close he stared through the still open screen by carpenters head and would have sworn that the starboard wingtip must be brushing the side of the mountain tremayne could still feel the sweat that bathed his face but his lips were as dry as ashes he licked them surreptitiously so that carpenter would not see him but it didnt do any good at all as dry as ashes they remained sergeant harrods lips werent dry but that was only because his face was taking the full brunt of the horizontally driving snowstorm that lashed along the bombers fuselage otherwise he shared tremaynes sentiments and apprehensions to a very marked degree he stood in the doorway gripping the fuselage on each side to hold him in position against the gale of wind his stormlashed face showing no fear just a peculiarly resigned expression his eyes were turned to the left looking forward with an almost hypnotised fixity at that point in space where it seemed that at any second now the starboard wingtip must strike against the weissspitze inside the fuselage the red lamp still burned the sergeant airgunners hand fell on harrods shoulder in an encouraging gesture it took harrod all of three seconds to free himself from his thralllike fixation with that starboard wing tip and take a half step back inside he reached up and firmly removed the sergeants hand dont shove mate he had to shout to make himself heard if im to commit suicide let me do it in the oldfashioned way by my own hand he again took up position by the open door at the same instant carpenter took a last quick look through the sidescreen and made the gesture that tremayne had been waiting for been praying for a slight turning motion of the left hand quickly tremayne banked the big bomber as quickly straightened up again slowly the mountainside fell away the mountainbrushing episode had been no mere bravado or folly carpenter had been deliberately lining up for his predetermined course across the narrow plateau once again and for the last time he had his head outside while his left hand slowlyinterminably slowly it seemed to tremaynereached up for the button on the bulkhead above the screen located it paused then pressed it sergeant harrod head craned back at a neckstraining angle saw the red light turn to green brought his head down screwed shut his eyes and with a convulsive jerk of his arms launched himself out into the snow and the darkness not a very expert launching for instead of jumping out he had stepped out and was already twisting in midair as the parachute opened schaffer was the next to go smoothly cleanly feet and knees together then carraciola followed by smith smith glanced down below him and his lips tightened just dimly visible in the greyness beneath harrod a very erratic human pendulum was swinging wildly across the sky the parachute cords were already badly twisted and his clumsily desperate attempts to untwist them resulted only in their becoming more entangled than ever his lefthand cords were pulled too far down air was spilling from the parachute and still swaying madly he was sideslipping to his left faster than any man smith had ever seen sideslip a parachute before smith stared after the rapidly disappearing figure and hoped to god that he didnt sideslip his way right over the edge of the precipice grimfaced he stared upwards to see how the others had fared thank god there was no worry there christiansen thomas and smithy all there so close as to be almost touching all making perfectly normal descents even before the last of the parachutists torrancesmythe had cleared the doorway the sergeant airgunner was running towards the after end of the fuselage swiftly he flung aside a packingcase dragging a tarpaulin away reached down and pulled a huddled figure uprighta girl quite small with wide dark eyes and delicate features one would have looked for the figure below to be as petite as the features but it was enveloped in bulky clothes over which had been drawn a snowsuit over the snowsuit she wore a parachute she was almost numb with cold and cramp but the sergeant had his orders come on miss ellison his arm round her waist he moved quickly towards the doorway not a second to lose he half led half carried her there where an aircraftman was just heaving the second last parachute and container through the doorway the sergeant snapped the parachute catch on to the wire mary ellison halfturned as if to speak to him then turned away abruptly and dropped out into the darkness the last parachute and container followed at once for a long moment the sergeant stared down into the darkness then he rubbed his chin with the palm of his hand shook his head in disbelief stepped back and pulled the heavy door to the lancaster its four engines still on reduced power droned on into the snow and the night almost immediately it was lost to sight and bare seconds later the last faint throb of its engines died away in the darkness smith reached his hands far up into the parachute shrouds hauled himself sharply upwards and made a perfect kneesbent feettogether landing in about two feet of snow the wind tugged fiercely at his parachute he struck the quick release harness clasp collapsed the parachute pulled it in rolled it up and pressed it deeply into the snow using for weight the pack he had just shrugged off his shoulders down there at ground levelif seven thousand feet up on the weissspitze could be called ground levelthe snowfall was comparatively slight compared to that blizzard theyd experienced jumping from the lancaster but even so visibility was almost as bad as it had been up above for there was a twentyknot wind blowing and the dry powdery snow was drifting quite heavily smith made a swift є sweep of his horizon but there was nothing to be seen nobody to be seen with fumbling frozen hands he clumsily extracted ј torch and whistle from his tunic facing alternately east and west he bleeped on the whistle and flashed his torch the first to appear was thomas then schaffer then within two minutes altogether all of the others with the exception of sergeant harrod pile your chutes there and weight them smith ordered yes bed them deep anyone seen sergeant harrod a shaking of heads nobody no sight of him at all last i saw of him schaffer said he was going across my bows like a destroyer in a heavy sea i saw a bit of that smith nodded the shrouds were twisted put a corkscrew to shame but id have said there was no danger of the chute collapsing not enough time we were almost on the ground before i lost sight of him any idea where he landed then roughly hell be all right major a twisted ankle a bump on the head not to worry use your torches smith said abruptly spread out find him with two men on one side of him three on the other all within interlocking distance of their torch beams smith searched through the snow his flashlight raking the ground ahead of him if he shared schaffers optimism about harrod his face didnt show it it was set and grim three minutes passed and then came a shout from the right smith broke into a run carraciola it was who had called and was now standing at the farther edge of a windswept outcrop of bare rock his torch shining downwards and slightly ahead beyond the rock the ground fell away abruptly to a depth of several feet and in this lee a deep drift had formed halfburied in its white depths sergeant harrod lay spreadeagled on his back his feet almost touching the rock his face upturned to the falling snow his eyes open he did not seem to notice the snow falling on his eyes they were all there now staring down at die motionless man smith jumped down into the drift dropped to his knees slid an arm under harrods shoulders and began to lift him to a sitting position harrods head lolled back like that of a broken rag doll smith lowered him back into the snow and felt for the pulse in the throat still kneeling smith straightened paused for a moment with bent head then climbed wearily to his feet dead carraciola asked hes dead his neck is broken smiths face was without expression he must have got caught up in the shrouds and made a bad landing it happens schaffer said ive known it happen a long pause then shall take the radio sir smith nodded schaffer dropped to his knees and began to fumble for the buckle of the strap securing the radio to harrods back smith said sorry no not that way theres a key around his neck under his tunic it fits the lock under the flap of the breast buckle schaffer located the key unlocked the buckle after some difficulty eased the straps off the dead mans shoulders and finally managed to work the radio clear he rose to his feet the radio dangling from his hand and looked at smith second thoughts whats the point any fall hard enough to break his neck wouldnt have done the innards of this radio any good wordlessly smith took the radio set it on the rock extended the antenna set the switch to transmit and cranked the callup handle the red telltale glowed showing the transmission circuit to be in order smith turned the switch to receive turned up the volume moved the tuning knob listened briefly to some staticladen music closed up the radio set and handed it back to schaffer it made a better landing than sergeant harrod smith said briefly come on we bury him major carraciola asked no need smith shook his head and gestured with his torch at the drifting snow hell be buried within the hour lets find the supplies now for gods sake dont lose your grip thomas said urgently thats the trouble with you celts schaffer said reprovingly no faith in anyone there is no cause for alarm your life is in the safe hands of schaffer and christiansen not to worry what else do you think im worrying about if we all start sliding schaffer said encouragingly we wont let you go until the last possible minute thomas gave a last baleful glance over his shoulder and then began to edge himself out over the black lip of the precipice schaffer and christiansen had an ankle apiece and they in turn were anchored by the others as far as the beam of thomass torch could reach the cliff stretching down into the darkness was absolutely vertical black naked rock with the only fissures in sight blocked with ice and with otherwise never a hand or foothold ive seen all i want to he said over his shoulder they pulled him back and he edged his way carefully up to their supply pile before getting to his feet he prodded the pack with the skis protruding from one end very handy he said morosely oh very handy for this lot indeed as steep as that smith asked vertical smooth as glass and you cant see the bottom how deep do you reckon it is major who knows smith shrugged were seven thousand feet up maps never give details at this altitude break out that nylon the proper supply pack was located and the nylon produced one thousand feet of it coiled inside a canvas bag as it had come from the makers it had very little more diameter than a clothes line but its wire core made it immensely strong and every yard of it had been fully tested to its rated breaking strainits actual breaking strain was much higherbefore leaving the factory smith tied a hammer to one end and with two of the men holding him securely paid it out over the edge counting his arm spans as he let it go several times the hammer snagged on some unseen obstruction but each time smith managed to swing it free finally the rope went completely slack and despite all smiths efforts it remained that way well smith moved back from the edge that seems to be about it and if it isnt hey christiansen asked if its caught on a teensyweensy ledge a thousand feet above damn all ill let you know smith said shortly you measured it off carraciola said how deep two hundred feet eight hundred feet left eh thomas grinned well need it all to tie up the garrison of the schloss adler no one was amused smith said ill need a piton and two walkietalkies fifteen feet back from the edge of the cliff they cleared away the snow and hammered an angled piton securely into the bare rock smith made a double bowline at one end of the nylon slipped his legs through the loops unclasped his belt then fastened it tightly round both himself and the rope and slipped a walkietalkie over his shoulder the rope was then passed round the piton and three men backs to the cliff wrapped it round their hands and prepared to take the weight schaffer stood by with the other walkietalkie smith checked that there were no sharp or abrasive edges on the clifftop wriggled cautiously over and gave the signal to be lowered the descent itself was simple as thomas had said it was a vertical drop and all he had to do was to fend himself off from the face as the men above paid out the rope once only passing an overhang he spun wildly in space but within ten seconds regained contact with the rock face again mountaineering made easy smith thought or it seemed easy perhaps he thought wryly it was as well that he couldnt see what stretched beneath him his feet passed through eighteen inches of snow and rested on solid ground he flashed his torch in a semicircle from cliff wall to cliff wall if it was a ledge it was a very big one for as far as his eye and torch could reach it appeared to be a smooth plateau sloping gently outwards from the cliff the cliff wall itself was smooth unbroken except for one shallow fissure a few feet wide close by to where he stood he climbed out of the double bowline and made the switch on the walkietalkie ok so far haul up the rope supplies first then yourselves the rope snaked upwards into the darkness within five minutes all the equipment had been lowered in two separate loads christiansen appeared soon afterwards whats all the fuss about this alpine stuff then he asked cheerfully my grandmother could do it maybe we should have brought your grandmother along instead smith said sourly were not down yet take your torch and find out how big this ledge is and the best way down and for gods sake dont go falling over any precipices christiansen grinned and moved off life was for the living and christiansen gave the impression of a man thoroughly enjoying himself while he was away reconnoitring all the others came down in turn until only schaffer was left his plaintive voice came over the walkietalkie and how am i supposed to get down hand over hand for two hundred feet frozen hand over frozen hand for two hundred feet on a rope this size youd better stand clear somebody should have thought of this somebody did smith said patiently make sure the rope is still round the piton then kick the other eight hundred feet over the edge theres always an answer schaffer sounded relieved they had just lowered him to the ground when christiansen returned i its not so bad he reported theres another cliff ahead of us maybe fifty yards away curving around to the east at least i think its a cliff i didnt try to find out how deep or how steep im married but the plateau falls away gently to the west there seems it might go on a fair way trees too i followed the line of them for two hundred yards trees at this altitude well no masts for a tall ship scrub pine theyll give shelter hiding fair enough smith nodded well bivouac there so close the surprised tone in schaffers voice showed that he didnt think much of the idea shouldnt we get as far down this mountain as possible tonight major no need if we start at first light well be well below the main tree line by dawn i agree with schaffer carraciola said reasonably lets get as much as we can behind us what do you think olaf this to christiansen it doesnt matter what christiansen thinks smiths voice was quiet but cold as the mountain air itself nor you carraciola this isnt a roundtable seminar its a military operation military operations have leaders like it or not admiral holland put me in charge we stay here tonight get the stuff across the five men looked speculatively at one another then stooped to lift the supplies there was no longer any question as to who was in charge we pitch the tents right away boss schaffer asked yes in schaffers book smith reflected boss was probably a higher mark of respect than either major or sir then hot food hot coffee and a try for london on the radio haul that rope down christiansen come the dawn we dont want to start giving heart attacks to any binocular toting characters in the schloss adler christiansen nodded began to haul on the rope as the free end rose into the air smith gave a shout jumped towards christiansen and caught his arm christiansen startled stopped pulling and looked round jesus smith drew the back of his hand across his forehead that was a dose one whats up shaffer asked quickly two of you hoist me up quickly before that damn rope disappears two of them hoisted him into the air smith reached up and caught the dangling end of the rope dropped to earth taking the rope with him and then very carefully very securely tied it to the other end of the rope now that youve quite finished torrancesmythe said politely the radio smith let out a long sigh of relief theres only one list of frequencies call signs and code security and that one list is inside sergeant hatreds tunic mind if i mop my brow too boss schaffer enquired ill go get it for you if you like christiansen volunteered thanks but its my fault and ill get it besides im the only person here whos done any climbingor so i believe from colonel wyattturnerand i think youd find that cliff rather more awkward to climb than descend no hurry lets bivouac and eat first if you cant do better than this smithy schaffer said to torrancesmythe you can have a weeks notice starting from a week ago he scraped the bottom of his metal plate and shuddered i was brought up in a christian home so i wont tell you what this reminds me of its not my fault torrancesmythe complained they packed the wrong size tinopeners he stirred the indeterminatelooking goulash in the pot on top of the butane stove and looked hopefully at the men seated in a rough semicircle in the dimlylit tent anyone for any more thats not funny schaffer said severely wait till you try his coffee smith advised and youll be wondering what you were complaining about he rose poked his head through the door to take a look at the weather looked inside again may take me an hour but if its been drifting up there the seated men suddenly serious nodded if it had been drifting up there it might take smith a very long time indeed to locate sergeant harrod its a bad night schaffer said ill come and give you a hand thanks no need ill haul myself up and lower myself down a rope round a piton is no elevator but itll get me there and back and two are no better than one for that job but ill tell you what you can do he moved out and reappeared shortly afterwards carrying the radio which he placed in front of schaffer i dont want to go all the way up there to get the codebook just to find that some hobnailed idiot has fallen over this and given it a heart attack guard it with your life lieutenant schaffer aye aye sir schaffer said solemnly with a hammer and a couple of spare pitons hanging from his waist smith secured himself to the rope with double bowline and belt as before grabbed the free end of the rope and began to haul himself up smiths statement to the others that this was a job for a mountaineer seemed hardly accurate for the amount of mountaineering skill required was minimal it was gruelling physical labour no more most of the time with his legs almost at right angles to his body he walked up the vertical cliff face on the stretch of the overhang with no assistance for his arms he twice had to take a turn of the free end of the rope and rest until the strength came back to aching shoulder and forearm muscles and by the time he finally dragged himself gasping painfully and sweating like a man in a sauna bath over the edge of the cliff exhaustion was very dose indeed he had overlooked the crippling effect of altitude to a man unaccustomed to it he lay face down for several minutes until breathing and pulse returned to something like normalor what was normal for seven thousand feet rose and examined the piton round which the nylon passed it seemed firm enough but for good measure he gave it another few heavy blows with the hammer undid the double bowline round his legs and secured the end of the rope to the piton with a round turn and two halfhitches hauling on the rope until the knot locked tight he moved a few feet farther away from the cliff edge cleared away the snow and lightly hammered in one of the spare pitons he had brought with him he tested it with his hand to see if it broke clear easily it did he tapped it in lightly a second time and led round it the part of the rope that was secured to the firmly anchored first piton then he walked away moving up the gently sloping plateau whistling lorelei it was as smith himself would have been the first to admit a far from tuneful whistle but recognisable for all that a figure appeared out of the night and came running towards him stumbling and slipping in the deep snow it was mary ellison she stopped short a yard away and put her hands on her hips well he could hear her teeth chattering uncontrollably with the cold you took your time about it didnt you never wasted a minute smith said defensively i had to have a hot meal and coffee first you had to haveyou beast you selfish beast she took a quick step forward and flung her arms around his neck i hate you i know he pulled off a gauntlet and gently touched her disengaged cheek youre frozen youre frozen he says of course im frozen i almost died in that plane why couldnt you have supplied some hot water bottlesoror an electrically heated suit or or something i thought you loved me i cant help what you think smith said kindly patting her on the back wheres your gear fifty yards and stop patting me in thatthat avuncular fashion language language smith said come on lets fetch it they trudged upwards through the deep snow mary holding his arm tightly she said curiously what on earth excuse did you give for coming back up here lost a cufflink there was something i had to come for something apart from you although i gave a songanddance act of having forgotten about it until the last moment until it was almost too late the radio codebook inside sergeant harrods tunic hehe lost it he dropped it howhow could he have been so criminally careless she stopped puzzled besides its chained its still inside sergeant harrods runic smith said sombrely hes up here dead dead she stopped and clutched him by the arms after a long pause she repeated hes dead thatthat nice man i heard him saying hed never jumped before a bad landing so it seems they located the kitbag in silence and smith carried it back to the edge of the cliff mary said and now the codebook lets wait a minute i want to watch this rope why the rope why not dont tell me mary said resignedly im only a little girl i suppose you know what youre doing i wish to god i did smith said feelingly they waited again in silence side by side on the kitbag both stared at the rope in solemn concentration as if nylon ropes at seven thousand feet had taken on a special meaning fulness denied nylon ropes elsewhere twice smith tried to light a cigarette and twice it sputtered to extinction in the drifting snow the minutes passed three maybe four they felt more like thirty or forty he became conscious that the girl beside him was shivering violentlyhe guessed that she had her teeth clamped tight to prevent their chatteringand was even more acutely conscious that his entire left sidehe was trying to shelter her from the wind and snowwas becoming numb he rose to leave when suddenly the rope gave a violent jerk and the piton farther from the cliff edge was torn free the loop of the rope slid quickly down past the piton to which it was anchored and kept on going till it was brought up short by its anchor whatever pressure was on the rope increased until the nylon bit deeply into the fresh snow on the cliffedge smith moved across and tested the pressure on the rope at first gingerly and tentatively then with all his strength the rope was bartaut and remained bartaut but the piton held whatwhat on earth mary began then broke off her voice was an unconscious whisper charming charming smith murmured someone down there doesnt like me surprised ifif that spike hadnt held wed never have got down again the tremor in her voice wasnt all due to the cold its a fair old jump smith conceded he took her arm and they moved off the snow was heavier now and even with the aid of their torches visibility was no more than six feet but by using the rocky outcrop as a bearing it took smith no more than two minutes to locate sergeant harrod now no more than a featureless mound buried in the depths of the snowdrift smith brushed aside the covering shroud of white undid the dead mans tunic recovered the codebook hung the chain round his neck and buttoned the book securely inside his own alpenkorps uniform then came the task of turning sergeant harrod over on his side unpleasant smith had expected it to be and it was impossible he hadnt expected it to be and it wasntnot quite but the effort all but defeated him the dead man was stiff as a board literally frozen solid into the arms outflung position into which he had fallen for the second time that night smith could feel the sweat mingling with the melted snow on his face but by and by he had him over the frozen right arm pointing up into the snowfilled sky smith knelt brought his torch close and carefully examined the back of the dead mans head what are you trying to do mary asked what are you looking for again her voice was a whisper his neck is broken i want to find out just how it was broken he glanced up at the girl you dont have to look dont worry she turned away im not going to the clothes like the man were frozen stiff the hood covering harrods head crackled and splintered in smiths gauntleted hands as he pulled it down exposing the back of the head and neck finally just below the collar of the snow smock smith found what he was searching fora red mark at the base of the neck where the skin was broken he rose caught the dead mans ankles and dragged him a foot or two down the slope what now in spite of herself mary was watching again in reluctant and horrified fascination what are you looking for now a rock smith said briefly there was a cold edge to the words and although mary knew it wasnt intended for her it was an effective discouragement to any further questioning smith cleared the snow for two feet around where harrods head had lain with hand and eyes he examined the ground with meticulous care rose slowly to his feet took marys arm and began to walk away after a few steps he hesitated stopped turned back to the dead man and turned him over again so that the right arm was no longer pointing towards the sky halfway back to the cliffedge smith said abruptly something struck harrod on the back of the neck i thought it might have been a rock but there was no rock where he lay only turf there was a rocky outcrop near by you dont break your neck on a rocky outcrop then stand up and jump out into a snowdrift even had he rolled over into the drift he could never have finished with his head seven feet out from the rock he was struck by some hard metallic object either the butt of a gun or the haft of a knife the skin is broken but there is no bruising for the neck was broken immediately afterwards when he was unconscious to make us think it was an accident it must have happened on the rockthere was no disturbance in the snow round harrodand it must have happened while he was upright a tap on the neck a quick necktwist then he fell or was pushed over the edge of the outcrop wonderful stuff stone smith finished bitterly it leaves no footprints mary stopped and stared at him do you realise what youre saying she caught his speculative and very oldfashioned look took his arm and went on quickly no i mean the implications im sorry im sorry of course you do john iim scared even all those months with you in italywell you know nothing like this she broke off then continued couldnt there couldnt there be some other explanation like he hit himself on the back of the head or the abominable snowman got him she looked at him steadily her dark eyes far too large in what could be seen of her hooded face i dont deserve that john i am frightened me too i dont believe you well if im not its damn well time i started to be smith checked his descent when he estimated he was about forty feet from the base of the cliff he took two turns of the nylon round his left leg clamped it with his right took a turn round his left arm pulled off his right gauntlet with his teeth stuffed it inside his tunic eased out his luger slid the safety catch and went on his way again checking his speed of descent with his gauntleted left hand it was a reasonable enough expectation that whoever had tried to pull down the rope would be waiting there to finish off the job but there was no reception committee waiting not at least at the spot where he touched down he traversed a quick circle with his torch there was nobody there and nothing there and the footprints that must have been there were long obscured by the drifting snow gun in one hand torch in the other he moved along the cliff face for thirty yards then moved out in a semicircle until he arrived back at the cliff face the ropepuller had evidently opted for discretion smith returned to the rope and jerked it in two minutes he had marys kitbag down and a few minutes later mary herself as soon as she had stepped out of the double bowline smith undid the knot pulled the rope down from the top of the cliff and coiled it so numbed and frozen were his hands by this time that the operation took him nearly fifteen minutes rope over one shoulder her kitbag in the other smith led mary to the fissure in the cliff side dont pitch the tent smith said unroll it put yoursleeping bag on one half get into it and pull the other half of the tent over you half an hour and youll be covered with drifting snow the snow will not only keep you warm itll hide you from any somnambulists ill be along in the morning before we leave he walked away stopped looked back mary was still standing where he had left her looking after him there was no sag to her shoulders no particular expression to her face but for all that she looked oddly defenceless lonely and forlorn a quality as indefinable as it was unmistakable smith hesitated then went back to her unrolled her tent and sleeping bag waited till she had climbed in zipped up the bag and pulled the other half of the tent up to her chin she smiled at him he fixed the sleeping bag hood pulled a corner of the tent over it and left all without saying a word locating his own tent was simple enough a steady light burnt inside it smith beat the snow from his clothes stooped and entered christiansen thomas and carraciola were in their sleeping bags and were asleep or appeared to be torrancesmythe was checking over their store of plastic explosives fuses detonators and grenades while schaffer was reading a paperbackin germansmoking a cigarette also germanand faithfully guarding the radio he put down the book and looked at smith ok ok smith produced the codebook from his tunic sorry i was so long but i thought id never find him drifting pretty badly up there weve arranged to take turns on watch schaffer said half an hour each itll be dawn in three hours smith smiled what are you guarding against in theseparts the abominable snowman the smile left smiths face as quickly as it had come he turned his attention to harrods codebook and spent about ten minutes in memorising callup signals and wavefrequencies and writing a message out in code before he had finished schaffer had turned into his sleeping bag leaving torrancesmythe on watch smith folded the message tucked it in a pocket rose took the radio and a rubber groundsheet to protect it from the snow im going to move out a bit he said to torrancesmythe reception is lousy among trees besides i dont want to wake everyone up wont be long two hundred yards from the tent after having stopped twice and changed direction twice smith knelt with his backand the rubber groundsheetto the drifting snow he extended a fourteen feet telescopic aerial adjusted a preselected callup and cranked a handle four times he cranked the handle and on the fifth he got results someone was keeping a very close radio watch indeed this is danny boy the set speaker crackled the signal was faint and intermittent but just comprehensible danny boy replying to you over smith spoke into the mouth microphone this is broadsword can i speak to father machree or mother machree over sorry unavailable over code smith said over ready smith extracted the paper from his pocket and shone his torch on it there were two lines containing meaningless jumbles of letters and below that the plain language translation which read safe landing harrod dead weather fine please await message ooo gmt smith read off the corresponding code figures and finished off have that delivered to father machree by without fail torrancesmythe looked up at smiths return back already surprise in his voice you got through not a chance smith said disgustedly too many bloody mountains around didnt try for very long did you two and a half minutes it was smiths turn to look surprised surely you know thats the safe maximum you think there may be radio monitoring stations hereabouts oh no not at all smiths voice was heavy with sarcasm you wouldnt expect to find radio monitors in the schloss adler would you now well now torrancesmythe smiled tiredly i believe someone did mention it was the southern hq of the german secret service sorry major its not that im growing old though theres that too its just that what passes for my mind is so gummed up by cold and lack of sleep that i think its stopped altogether smith pulled off his boots and snowsuit climbed into his sleeping bag and pulled the radio close to him then its time you had some sleep my explosives expert is going to be no good to me if he cant tell a detonator from a doorknob go on turn in ill keep watch but we had arranged arguments arguments smith sighed insubordination on every hand he smiled straight up smithy im wide awake i know i wont sleep tonight one downright lie smith thought and one statement of incontrovertible truth he wasnt wide awake he was physically and mentally exhausted and on the slightest relaxation of willpower oblivion would have overtaken him in seconds but that he wouldnt sleep that night was beyond doubt no power on earth would have let him sleep that night but in the circumstances it was perhaps wiser not to say so to torrancesmythe the predawn greyness was in the sky smith and his men had broken camp tent and sleeping bags were stored away and the cooking utensilsafter a very sketchy breakfast scarcely deserving of the namewere being thrust into haversacks there was no conversation none at all it wasnt a morning for speaking all of them smith thought looked more drawn more exhausted than they had done three hours ago he wondered how he himself who had had no sleep at all must look it was as well he reflected that mirrors were not part of their commando equipment he looked at his watch well leave in ten minutes he announced should give us plenty of time to be down in the tree line before sunup assuming there are no more cliffs back in a moment visibility is improving and i think ill go recce along the cliff edge with any luck maybe i can see the best way down and if you havent any luck carraciola asked sourly weve still that thousand feet of nylon rope smith said shortly he pulled on his snowsuit and left angling off in the direction of the cliff as soon as he was beyond the belt of the scrub pines and out of sight of the camp he changed direction uphill and broke into a run a single eye appeared under a lifted corner of snowcovered canvas as mary ellison heard the soft crunch of running footsteps in the snow she heard the first two bars of a tuneless whistling of lorelei unzipped her sleeping bag and sat up smith was standing above her not already she said protestingly yes already come on up i havent slept a wink neither have i ive been watching that damned radio all nightand watching to check that no somnambulists took a stroll in this direction you kept awake you did that for me i kept awake were off start in five minutes leave your tent and kitbag here you wont be requiring them again take some food something to drink thats all and for gods sake dont get too close to us he glanced at his watch well stop at am check your watch exactly am and dont bump into us what do you think i am but smith didnt tell her what he thought she was he had already gone a thousand feet farther down the side of the weissspitze the trees were something worth calling trees towering conifers that soared sixty and seventy feet up into the sky into the dear sky for the snow had stopped falling now it was dawn the slope of the weissspitze was still very steep perhaps one in four or five smith with his five men strung out behind him in single file slipped and stumbled almost constantly but the deep snow smith reflected at least cushioned their frequent falls and as a mode of progress it was a damn sight preferable to shinning down vertical clifffaces on an impossibly thin clothesline the curses of his bruised companions were almost continuous but serious complaints were marked by their total absence there was no danger they were making excellent time and they were now completely hidden in the deep belt of pines two hundred yards behind them mary ellison carefully picked her way down the tracks made by the men below her she slipped and fell only very occasionally for unlike the men she was carrying no overbalancing gear on her back nor had she any fear of being observed of coming too close to smith and the others in still frosty air on a mountain sound carries with a preternatural clarity and from the sound of the voices farther down the slope she could judge her distance from them to a nicety for the twentieth time she looked at her watch it was twenty minutes to seven some time later for much more than the twentieth time smith checked his watch again it was exactly oclock the dawn had gone and the light of full daytime filtered down through the snowbent boughs of the conifers smith stopped and held up his hand waiting until the other five had caught up with him we must be halfway down now he shrugged off the heavy pack on his back and lowered it gratefully into the snow i think its time we had a look at the scenery they piled their gear and moved off to their right within a minute the pines started to thin out and at a signal from smith they all dropped to hands and knees and crawled forward the last few yards towards the edge of the belt of pines smith carried a telescope in his hand christiansen and thomas both wore binoculars zeiss binoculars admiral holland had left nothing to chance beyond the last of the pines a mound of snow obstructed their view of the valley below shrouded from top to toe in the allenveloping white of their snowsmocks they completed the last few feet on their elbows and knees what lay below them was something out of a fairy tale an impossibly beautiful scene from an impossibly beautiful fairy tale a fairy tale set aeons back in the nevernever land of the age of dreams a kindlier land a nobler land than man had ever known since first he had set his hand against his brother a land that never was smith thought a land that never was but there it lay before them the golden land that never was the home of that most dreaded organisation in the entire world the german gestapo the impeccable incongruity of it all smith reflected passed all belief the valley was bowlshaped open to the north hemmed in by steeply rising hills to the east and west closed off by the towering bulk of the weissspitze to the south a scene of fantastic beauty nine thousand seven hundred and ten feet in height the second highest mountain in germany the weissspitze soared up menacingly like another north wall of the eiger its dazzling whiteness caught in the morning sun its starkly lovely outline sharply etched against the now cloudless blue of the sky high up near the coneshaped summit could be seen the line of black rock marking the cliff smith and his men had descended during the night with just below it a much greater cliffface on the plateau above which they had spent the night directly opposite where they lay and almost exactly on the same level was the schloss adler itself the castle of the eagle had been aptly named an impregnable fortress an inaccessible eyrie set between mountain and sky just below the spot where the steepsided slopes of the weissspitze began to flatten out northwards into the head of the valley a geological freak known as a volcanic plug jutted two hundred vertical feet up into the sparkling icecold air it was on this that the schloss adler had been built the northern western and eastern sides of this volcanic plug were sheer perpendicular walls of rock walls that swept up smoothly without intermission or break into the structure of the castle itself from where they lay it was impossible to say where the one ended and the other began to the south a steeplysloping ridgeback connected the plug to the equally sloping ramparts of the weissspitze the castle itself was another dream the dream of the apotheosis of medievalism this dream smith was aware was as illusory as the golden age of its setting it wasnt medieval at all it had been built as late as the midnineteenth century to the express order of one of the madder of the bavarian monarchs who had suffered from a comprehensive list of delusions of which grandeur had not been the least but delusions or not he had had as the deluded so often haveto the dismay and consternation of their allegedly saner brethrenimpeccable taste the castle was perfect for the valley the valley for the castle any other combination would have been inconceivable the schloss adler was built in the form of a hollow square it was towered battlemented and crenellated its most imposing aspects two perfectly circular towers the one to the east higher than that to the west facing down the valley towards the north two smaller but still magnificent towers lay at the southern corners facing the looming bulk of the weissspitze from where smith lay at some slight level above that of the castle he could just see into the open square in its middle outside access to which was obtained by a pair of huge iron gates at the rear the sun had not yet climbed sufficiently high above the eastern hills for its rays to strike the castle directly but for all that its incredibly white walls gleamed and glittered as if made of the most iridescent marble below the soaring northern ramparts of the castle the valley fell away steeply to the blau see beautiful pinefringed jewel of a lake of the deepest and most sparkling blue a colour which with the green of the pines the white dazzle of thesnow and the brilliant lighter blue of the sky above formed a combination of breathtaking loveliness impossibly lovely smith thought a completely faithful colour reproduction of the scene would have had everybody shouting fake from where they lay they could see that the belt of pines in which they lay hidden extended almost all the way down to the lake getting down there unobserved would be no problem at all an almost exactly matching line of pines swept down the oppositethe easternside of the valley from the lake those two long sweeps of pines climbing steadily upwards as they marched to the south must have appeared like a pair of great curving horns almost meeting at the top of the lower of the two clifffaces on the weissspitze a small village lay at the head of the lake basically it consisted of a single wide street perhaps two hundred yards in length a railway station two inevitable churches perched on two inevitable knolls and a thin scattering of houses climbing up the steep slopes on either side of the village from the southern end of the village a road curved up the far side of the valley till it reached the ridgeback to the south of the castle this ridgeback it ascended by a series of hairpin bends the last of which led to the great doors guarding the forecourt at the back of the castle the road just then was completely blocked by snow and sole access to the castle was obviously by means of the lujtseittiahn an aerial cableway two cables stretched from the village straight up to the castle crossing three supporting pylons en route even as they watched a cablecar was completing the last section of its journey up to the castle at a distance of not much more than a hundred feet from the glittering walls of the schloss adler it appeared to be climbing almost vertically on the blau see about a mile beyond the village lay a very large group of regularly spaced huts arranged in rectangular patterns it bore an uncommonly dose resemblance to a military encampment well ill be damned with an almost physical effort of will schaffer forced himself to look away and smith could see the wonder reflected in his eyes is this for real boss it wasnt a question that called for an answer schaffer had summed up their collective feeling pretty well and there was nothing that anyone could add that wouldnt seem and sound superfluous prone in the snow they watched in silence as the cablecar climbed agonisingly slowly up the last fifty feet towards the castle it seemed as if it would never make it and smith could almost palpably sense the empathy of his companions and himself as they willed that little car on the last few feet of its journey but make it it did and it disappeared from sight under the roof of the cable header station that has been built into the western foot of the castle the tension relaxed and schaffer cleared his throat boss he said diffidently there are a couple of minor points that occur to me requiring elucidation one might say first of all if i didnt know better id say that was a military barracks down by that little old lake there you dont know better that is a military barracks down by that little old lake there and no ordinary military barracks either i might say thats the training hq of the jager battalions of the wehrmachts alpenkorps oh my gosh the alpine corps if id known this id never have come along the alpine corps why didnt someone tell ma schaffers nearest and dearest i thought you knew smith said mildly why do you think were not dressed as german sailors or red cross nurses schaffer unzipped his snowsmock minutely examined his alpenkorps uniform as if seeing it for the first time then zipped it up again he said carefully you mean to say were going to mingle careless like with the german army he paused looked wideeyed at smiths smiling nod then went on incredulously butbut well be recognised as strangers training troops come and go all the time smith said offhandedly whats six new faces among six hundred new faces this is terrible schaffer said gloomily worse than horses smith smiled after all the alpenkorps dont buck and trample all over you horses dont carry machineguns schaffer said morosely and your second point ah yes the second point theres the little matter of the old schloss itself kinda forgotten our helicopter havent we how do we get in a good point smith conceded well have to think about it but ill tell you this if colonel wyattturner can penetrate the german high command and more important get away again this should be a piece of cake for us he did what schaffer demanded didnt you know how should i know schaffer was irritated never met the guy till yesterday he spent the years to inside germany served in the wehrmacht for part of the time ended up in the ghq in berlin says he knows hitler quite well well ill be damned schaffer paused for a long moment finally arrived at a conclusion the guy he said moodily must be nuts maybe but if he can do it we can well figure a way lets get back among the trees they inched their way back into cover leaving christiansen behind with smiths telescope to keep watch after theyd made a temporary camp heated and drunk some coffee smith announced his intention of trying to contact london again he unpacked the radio and sat down on a kitbag a few feet distant from the others the switch that cut in the transmitter circuit was on the left hand side of the radio the side remote from where the other four men were sitting smith switched on with a loud positive click cranked the callup handle with his left hand with the very first crank his left hand moved the transmitting switch from on to off the whirring of the callup blanketing the sound smith cranked away diligently at intervals stopping from time to time to make minute adjustments to the controls then finally gave up and sat back shaking his head in disgust youll never make it with all those trees around torrancesmythe observed that must be it smith agreed ill try the other side of the wood might have better luck there he slung the transmitter over his shoulder and trudged off through the deep snow cutting straight across to the other side of the belt of pines when he thought he was safely out of eyeshot of the men at the camp he checked with a quick look over his shoulder they were out of sight he turned more than ninety degrees left and hurried up the hill until he cut the tracks that he and his men had made on the way down he followed the tracks uphill whistling lorelei but whistling softly in that frosty air sound travelled dangerously far he stopped whistling when mary appeared from where she had been hiding behind a fallen pine hallo darling she said brightly well have less of the darlings smith said briskly its am father machree awaits and keep your voice down he sat on the fallen tree cranked the handle and established contact almost immediately the transmission from london was still very faint but clearer than it had been in the earlier hours of the morning father machree is waiting the radio crackled hold hold smith held and the unmistakable voice of admiral rolland took over from the london operator position please broadsword smith consulted the piece of paper in his hand again in code and plain language the message read woods due west castle descending wh this evening smith read out the corresponding code letters there was a pause presumably while rolland was having the message decoded then his voice came again understood proceed harrod killed accidentally no over by the enemy over no what is the weather report over deteriorating freshening winds strong later snow over smith looked up at the still and cloudless sky above he assumed that holland hadnt got his forecasts mixed up he said time of next broadcast uncertain can you stand by over am remaining hq until operation complete holland said good luck goodbye smith closed up the radio and said thoughtfully to mary i didnt much care for the way he said goodbye there in the naval operations room in whitehall admiral holland and colonel wyattturner one on either side of the radio operator manning a huge transceiver looked at each other with heavy faces so the poor devil was murdered wyattturner said flatly a high price to pay for confirmation that we were right holland said sombrely poor devil as you say the moment we gave him that radio to carry we signed a deathwarrant i wonder whos next smith himself not smith wyattturner shook his head positively some people have a sixth sense smith has a seventh eighth and ninth and a builtin radar set for danger smith can survive under any circumstances i can conceive of i didnt pick him with a pin sir hes the best agent in europe except possibly yourself and dont forget colonel there may possibly be circumstances that even you cant conceive of yes thats so he looked directly at holland what do you reckon his chances are sir chances hollands eyes were remote unseeing what do you mean chances he doesnt have any almost precisely the same thought was in smiths mind as he lit a cigarette and looked at the girl beside him careful not to let his thoughts show in his face not until that first sight hed just had of the castle had the full realisation of the apparent impossibility of their task struck him had he known what the precise physical situation had been he doubted very much whether he would have come deep in the furthest recesses of his mind he knew although he would not admit it to himself that there really was no room for the element of doubt he wouldnt have come but he had come he was here and he had better do something about it he said to mary have you had a squint at the old schloss yet its a fantastic place how on earth do we ever get general carnaby out of there easy well take a walk up there tonight get inside and take him away mary stared at him in disbelief and waited for him to amplify his statement he didnt finally she said thats all thats all the simplicity of true genius you must have spent a lot of time working that one out when he still didnt reply she went on elaborately sarcastic in the first place of course therell be no trouble about getting in you just go up to the main door and knock more or less then the door or windowopens i smile at you say thank you and pass inside you what i smile and say thank you even in wartime theres no reason why the little courtesies please she was thoroughly exasperated now if you cant talk sense you are going to open the door for me smith explained patiently are you feeling all right the staff shortage in germany is acute the schloss adler is no exception youre just the type theyre looking for young intelligent goodlooking you can cook polish sew on colonel kramers buttons whos colonel kramer her tone as much as her face showed the bewilderment in her mind deputy chief of the german secret service mary said with conviction you must be mad if i wasnt i wouldnt be doing this job he glanced at his watch ive been gone too long and i fear that im surrounded by the odd suspicious mind we move off at five exactly five down in the village theres a gasthaus on the east side of the main street called zum wilden hirsch the wild deer remember it zum wilden hirsch we dont want you wandering into the wrong pub behind it theres a shed used as a beer cellar its always kept locked but there will be a key in the door tonight ill meet you there at exactly eight oclock he turned to go but she caught him by the arm how do you know all this she asked tensely about the gasthaus and the bottle store and the key being there and about colonel kramer and ah ah smith shook his head admonishingly and touched her lips with his forefinger handbook for spies golden rule number one she drew away from him and stared down at the snowcovered ground her voice low and bitter never ever ever tell anyone anything unless you have to she paused and looked up not even me especially not you poppet he patted her lightly on the cheek dont be late he walked away down the slope leaving her looking after him with an expressionless face lieutenant schaffer lay stretched out and almost buried in the deep snow halfhidden behind the bole of a pine with a telescope to his eye he twisted as he heard the soft crunch of snow behind him and saw smith approaching on his hands and knees couldnt you knock or something schaffer asked irritably sorry something you wanted to show me so the boys say yeah schaffer handed smith the telescope take a gander at this lot thought it might interest you smith took the telescope and fingered the very precise adjustment until he achieved maximum definition lower down schaffer said at the foot of the rock smith traversed the telescope down the sides of the schloss adler and the sheer walls of the volcanic plug until the fine crosshairs came to rest on the snowcovered slopes at the foot moving across the slope he could see two soldiers with slung machinecarbines and not on leashes four dogs my my smith murmured thoughtfully i see what you mean those are dobermann pinchers boss well they arent toy poodles and thats a fact smith agreed he moved the telescope a little way up the walls of the volcanic plug held it there and floodlights he added softly he lowered the telescope again past the patrolling soldiers and dogs till it came to rest on a high wire fence that appeared to go all the way around the base of the volcanic plug and a dinky little fence fences schaffer said pontifically are made to be cut or climbed you try cutting or climbing this one laddie and youll be cooked to a turn in nothing flat a standard design using a standard current of volt singlephase cycle ac all the best electric chairs have it schaffer shook his head amazing the lengths some folks will go to protect their privacy fences floods and dobermans smith said i dont think that combination will stop us do you lieutenant of course not stop us of course not he paused for some moments then burst out how in gods name do you propose well decide when the time comes smith said easily you mean youll decide schaffer said complainingly play it pretty close to the cuff dont you thats because im too young to die why me for gods sake schaffer demanded after a long pause why pick me for this job this isnt my line of country major god knows smith said frankly come to that why me schaffer was in the middle of giving him a long and pointedly disbelieving look when he suddenly stiffened and cocked his head up to the sky in the direction of the unmistakably rackety whirr of a helicopter engine both men picked it up at once it was coming from the north over the blau see and heading directly towards them it was a big military version and even at that distance the swastika markings were clearly distinguishable schaffer started to move backwards towards the line of pines exit schaffer he announced hurriedly the bloodhounds are out for us i dont think so smith said stay where you are and pull your smock over your head quickly they pulled their white smocks over their heads until only their eyes and smiths telescope partly buried in the snow could be seen from thirty yards in any direction including straight up they must have been quite invisible the helicopter swept up the valley still maintaining a course directly towards the spot where the two men lay hidden when it was only a few hundred yards away even smith began to feel uneasy and wondered if by some evil mischance the enemy knew er suspected their presence they were bound to have heard the engines of the lancaster muted though they had been during the night had some suspicious and intelligent characterand there would be no lack of those in the schloss adlercome up with the right answer to the question of the presence of this errant bomber in one of the most unlikely places in all germany could picked members of the alpenkorps be combing the pine woods even at that momentand he smith had been so confident that he hadnt even bothered to post a guard then abruptly when the helicopter was almost directly overhead it sideslipped sharply to its left sank down over the castle courtyard hovered for a few moments and slowly descended smith surreptitiously mopped his forehead and applied his eye to the telescope the helicopter had landed the rotor stopped steps descended and a man climbed down to the courtyard floor from his uniform smith decided a very senior officer then he suddenly realised that it was a very very senior officer indeed his face tightened as he pushed the telescope across to schaffer take a good look he advised schaffer took a good look lowered the telescope as the man passed through a doorway pal of yours boss i know him reichsmarschall julius rosemeyer the wehrmacht chief of staff my very first reichsmarschall and me without my telescopic rifle schaffer said regretfully wonder what his highness wants same as us smith said briefly general carnaby when youre going to ask the allies overall coordinator of planning a few questions about the second front you dont send just the corporal of the guard to interview him you dont think they might have come to take old carnaby away schaffer asked anxiously not a chance the gestapo never gives up its prisoners in this country the wehrmacht does what the gestapo says or else or else off you go theyve more coffee on the brew back there send someone to relieve me in an hour admiral rollands weather forecast for the area turned out to be perfectly correct as the endless shivering hours dragged slowly by the weather steadily deteriorated by noon the sun was gone and a keen wind sprung up from the east by early afternoon snow had begun to fall from the darkened sky slowly at first then with increasing severity as the east wind steadily increased in strength and became bitingly cold it looked like being a bad night smith thought but a bad night that reduced visibility to nearzero and kept people indoors was what they wanted it would have been difficult for them to saunter up to the schloss adler bathed in the warm light of a harvest moon smith checked his watch time to go he climbed stiffly to his feet and beat his arms to restore circulation call thomas will you rucksacks and kitbags were slung and shouldered thomas who had been keeping watch appeared carrying smiths telescope thomas was very far from being his usual cheerful self and it wasnt just the fact that hed spent the last hour exposed to the full force of wind and snow that had left him in such illhumour is that damned radio working yet he asked smith not a hope six tries six failures why ill tell you why thomas said bitterly pity we couldnt get the admiral to change his mind about the paratroops a full troop train just got in thats all well thats fine smith said equably the old hands will think were new boys and the new boys will think were old hands very convenient thomas looked thoughtfully at smith very very convenient he hesitated then went on how about loosening up a bit major what do you mean come off it carraciola said roughly you know damn well what he means its our lives why do we have to go down into that damned village and how do you intend to get carnaby out if were to commit suicide tell us why you owe us that i owe you nothing smith said flatly ill tell you nothing and if you know nothing you cant talk youll be told when the time comes you smith torrancesmythe said precisely are a cold blooded devil its been said before smith said indifferently the village railway station was a small twotrack endoftheline depot like all endoftheline depots it was characterised by rust dilapidation the barest functionalism of design and an odd pessimisticallyexpectant air of waiting for someone to come along and finish it off properly at any time its air of desolation was total that night completely deserted with a high gusting wind driving snow through pools of light cast by dim and swaying electric lamps the ghostly impression of a place abandoned by man and by the world was almost overwhelming it suited smiths purpose perfectly he led his five snowsmock clad men quickly across the tracks and into the comparative shelter of the station buildings they filed silently past the closed bookstall the freight office the booking office flitted quickly into the shadows beyond and stopped smith lowered the radio shrugged off his rucksack removed snowsmock and trousers and sauntered casually alongside the tracksthe thrifty bavarians regarded platforms as a wasteful luxury he stopped outside a door next to a bolted hatch which bore above it the legend gepack anna h m e he tried the door it was locked he made a quick survey to check that he was unobserved stooped examined the keyhole with a pencil flash took a bunch of oddly shaped keys from his pockets and had the door opened in seconds he whistled softly and was almost at once joined by the others who filed quickly inside already slipping off their packs as they went schaffer bringing up the rear paused and glanced up at the sign above the hatch my god he shook his head the left luggage office where else smith asked reasonably he ushered schaffer in closed and locked the door behind him hooding his pencil torch until only a fingerwidth beam emerged he passed by the luggage racks till he came to the far end of the room where a bay window was set in the wall it was a perfectly ordinary sash window and he examined it very minutely careful that at no time the pinpoint of light touched the glass to shine through to the street beyond he turned his attention to the vertical wooden planking at the side of the window took out his sheath knife and levered a plank away to expose a length of twincored flex stapled vertically to the wall he split the cores sliced through each in turn replaced the plank and tested the lower sash of the window it moved easily up and down an interesting performance schaffer observed what was all that in aid of its not always convenient to enter by the front door or come to that leave by it either a youth misspent in philandering or burgling schaffer said sadly how did you know it was wired for sound even a small country station will have valuables stored in its left luggage office from time to time smith said patiently but it will not have a fulltime baggage attendant the attendant booking clerk ticketcollector porter and stationmaster are probably all one man so its kept locked but theres no point in barring the front door if your bagsnatcher can climb in through the back window so your back window is grilled wired no grilleand a badlyfitting plank obvious obvious to you maybe carraciola said sourly all this ah expertise with skeleton keys and burglar alarms the black watch you said you were in thats right very odd training they give you in those scottish regiments very odd indeed thorough is the word youre searching for smith said kindly lets go and have a drink lets do that carraciola said heavily remind me to get mine down in one go or ten gets you one that ill never live to finish it it would be a shame to waste good beer smith agreed he waited until the last man was out locked the door behind him and rejoined them as they walked out of the main station entrance under the bahnhof sign they were now no longer carrying rucksacks or wearing snowsmocks all were dressed in the uniforms of soldiers of a jager battalion smith as a major schaffer as a lieutenant and the other four as sergeants their uniforms were no longer as immaculately creasefree as they might have been nor for that matter as sergeant harrod had observed did they fit as well as they might have done but in a village street or crowded bar at nighttime they should pass muster or so smith devoutly hoped it was a typical main street in a typical high alpine village the buildings lining either side of the street solid rugged foursquare buildings looked as if they had been defying the bitter bavarian winters for a long long time and intended going on doing so for as long again nearly all the houses were of the wooden chalet type with great sweeping eaves and balconies running the full width of the front of the houses a few were of comparatively modern construction with shingled walls large doubleglazed windows and fancy wroughtiron grillework but most were very old and low planked with rough adzecut wood and having the interlocking wallbeams projecting at the corners there were no street lamps but neither was there any attempt at a blackout elongated rectangles of light from uncurtained windows patterned the snowpacked streets beyond the far or southern end of the street intermittently seen through the sweeping curtains of snow a duster of bright lights seemed to hang suspended in the sky instinctively almost smith stopped to gaze at this distant constellation and his men stopped with him the lights of the schloss adler the castle of the eagle seemed impossibly remote as unattainable as the mountains of the moon wordlessly the men looked at them in long silence then at one another then by mutual and still silent consent moved on their way again their boots crunching crisply in the beaten snow their frozen breaths wisping away in the chill night wind the main street the only street was deserted quite empty of life inevitably so on so bitter a night but if the street was deserted the village was anything but the sounds of laughter and singing and the babel of voices filled the night air and the nosetotail row of parked german trucks along one side of the street showed clearly enough just who was responsible for the singing and the laughter for the training troops in the military barracks on the blau see there was only one centre of entertainment for twenty miles around and this village was it the gasthauser and weinstuben were jammed to the doors with soldiers of the alpenkorps probably the most highly trained combat troops in europe schaffer said plaintively i dont really feel like a drink boss nonsense smith said encouragingly youre just shy at the thought of meeting strangers he stopped in front of a gastbaus with the legend drei konige above the door heres a likely looking place now hang on a minute he climbed the steps opened the door and looked inside down in the street the other five looked at one another the same mingled apprehension and expectancy mirrored in every eye austrian schrammel music hauntingly and nostalgically evocative of a kindlier and happier age flooded through the open doorway the expressions on the faces of the men below didnt change there was a time and a place for schrammel music and this wasnt it smith shook his head closed the door and rejoined his men packed he said not even standing room he nodded across the street to another hostelry the eichhof a small squat beetlebrowed building with adzecut corner beams and an air of advanced dilapidation lets see what this has to offer but the eichhof had nothing to offer regretfully but firmly smith closed its front door and turned away jammed he announced besides a lowclass dump unsuitable for officers and ncos of the wehrmacht but this next place looks more promising dont you think from the pointed silence it was apparent that the other five didnt think anything of the kind and in fact apart from the factor of size the third wemstube looked remarkably like the ones smith had just passed up zum wilden hirsch it was called and above the sign was a snowshrouded wooden carving of a wild deer smith walked up the halfdozen steps to the front door and opened it he winced as the blast of sound reached him an almost physical assault upon the eardrums heaven knew the last two weinstuben had been clamorous enough but compared to this place they now seemed in retrospect to have been invested in a cathedral silence to the blaring accompaniment of a battery of discordant accordions what appeared from the sheer volume of sound to be an entire regiment were giving lili marlene all they had smith glanced at his men nodded and passed inside as the others followed schaffer paused in the doorway as christiansen took his arm and said wonderingly you think he thinks this isnt packed they must schaffer conceded have had them packed six deep in the other joints they werent exactly stacked six deep inside zum wilden hirsch but they might well have been if the musicswaying crowd of elbowjostling customers has assumed the horizontal instead of the perpendicular he had never smith thought seen so many people in one bar before there must have been at least four hundred of them to accommodate a number of that order called for a room of no ordinary dimensions and this one wasnt it was a very big room indeed it was also a very very old room the floor of knotted pine sagged the walls sagged and the massive smokeblackened beams on the roof seemed to be about ready to fall down at any moment in the middle of the room stood a huge black woodburning stove a stove stoked with such ferocious purpose that the castiron top cover glowed dull red from just below the cover two sixinch twentyfoot long blackenamelled stove pipes led off to points high up on opposite sides of the rooma primitive but extremely efficient form of central heating the threesided setteeshalf boothslining three walls of the room were of oak darkened by age and smoke and unknown centuries of customers each booth having recessed holes for stowing newspapers rolled round slats of wood the twenty or so tables scattered across the floor had handcut wooden tops of not less than three inches in thickness with chairs to match most of the back of the room was taken up by a solid oaken bar with a coffeemachine at one end and behind the bar swing doors that presumably led to the kitchen what little illumination there was in the room came from ceilingsuspended and very sooty oil lamps each one with its generationsold patch of coalblack charred wood in the roof above smith transferred his attention from the room to the customers in the room a clientele of a composition such as one might expect to find in a high alpine village with a military encampment at its back door in one corner were a group of obvious locals men with still lean aquiline weatherbeaten faces unmistakably men of the mountains many of them in intricately embroidered leather jackets and tyrolean hats they spoke little and drank quietly as did another small group at the back of the room perhaps a dozen or so nondescript civilians clearly not locals who drank sparingly from small schnapps glasses but ninety per cent of the customers were soldiers of the german alpenkorps some seated many more standing but all giving of their very best with lili marlene and nearly all of them enthusiastically waving their pewtercapped litre steinbechers in the air happily oblivious in that moment of tearfully nostalgic romanticism of the fact that the amount of beer finding its way to comrades uniforms and the floor was about the equivalent of a moderately heavy rainstorm behind the bar was the obvious proprietor a gargantuan threehundred pounder with an impassive moonlike face and several girls busy filling trays with steinbechers several others moved about the room collecting or serving beermugs one of them approaching in his direction caught smiths eye it would have been surprising if she hadnt it would have been surprising if she hadnt caught the attention of every man there but there was no surprise she did she would have won any miss europe contest hands down if she had had a face other than her own which though pleasant and plump was rather plain but any possible lack of attraction in that cheerfully smiling face was more than overcompensated for elsewhere she was dressed in a gailypatterned dirndl and tyrolean blouse had a handspan waist an hourandahalfglass figure and an obvious predilection for lowcut blouses that in terms of attracting local custom must have been worth a fortune to the gigantic proprietor behind the bar she drew a great deal of attention from the assembled soldiery not all of it just consisting of admiring glances if she werent wearing armourplating smith reflected she must be permanently black and blue she approached smith brushed back her blonde hair and smiled the gesture as provocative as the smile can i help you sir dark beer please smith said politely six with pleasure sir again the provocative smile this time accompanied by a halfappraising halflingering look from cornflower blue eyes then she turned and walked away if her method of locomotion could strictly be described as walking schaffer a slightly dazed expression on his face stared after her then caught smith by the arm now i know why i left montana boss his voice held something of the dazed quality on his face it wasnt because of the horses after all your mind on the job if you dont mind lieutenant smith looked thoughtfully after the girl rubbed his chin and said slowly barmaids know more about whats going on in their own manor than any chief of policeand that one looks as if she might know more than most yes ill do that do what schaffer asked suspiciously try to get next to her i saw her first schaffer said plaintively you can have the next dance smith promised the levity of the words were belied by the cool watchful expression on his face as his eyes constantly travelled the room when you get your drinks circulate see if you can hear any mention of carnaby or reichsmarschall rosemeyer he caught sight of an empty chair by a corner table moved across and sat in it nodding politely to a rather blearyeyed alpenkorps captain deep in what appeared to be rather patronising conversation with two lieutenants the captain showed no more than a brief recognition of his presence and as far as smith could tell no other person present was showing the slightest interest in either himself or his companions the accordion band finished its stint more or less on the same note and at the same time and the singing of lili marlene died away for long seconds there was a profound and nostalgicsilence four hundred men alone with lili marlene under the barrack gate lantern then as if on cue a babel of voices broke out all over the room four hundred men with unfinished litre jugs do not remain sentimental for overly long he caught sight of the girl returning with six steinbechers on a tray pushing her way through the crowd and fending off admirers with a practised hand she gave drinks to smiths men who immediately but unostentatiously broke up and began to wander away into different parts of the room the girl looked around located smith smiled brightly crossed to his table and put the steinbecher on it before she could straighten smith put his arm around her waist and pulled her on to his knee the jager captain across the table broke off his conversation stared across in startled disapproval opened his mouth as if to speak caught smiths discouraging glance decided to mind his own business and resumed his conversation smith in his turn looked away squeezed the girls waist patted her knee and smiled what he hoped was a winning smile and what might your name be my alpine rose his voice had a slightly slurred edge to it heidi she struggled to rise but didnt really put her heart into it please major i have work to do there is no more important work than entertaining soldiers of the fatherland smith said loudly holding heidi firmly to forestall any attempt at escape he took a long pull at his beer then continued quietly now the mug still in front of his face shall i sing you a song what song heidi asked warily i hear too much singing i whistle better than i sing listen he whistled very softly the first two bars of lorelei do you like that heidi stiffened and stared but immediately relaxed and smiled at him coquettishly its very nice major and im sure you have a beautiful singing voice too smith put his steinbecher down with an unsteady bang that brought more disapproval from the other side of the table then lifted his hand to wipe the froth from his lips heidi smiled down at him but the wary eyes werent smiling smith said from behind his hand the men at the bar the civilians dont turn round gestapo she made another apparently futile attempt to free herself from the castle ones a lipreader smith had the steinbecher in front of his face again i can tell theyre watching your room in five minutes hit me good and heidi stared at him in bewilderment then yelped in pain as he pinched her far from gently she drew back her right hand came over in a roundhouse swing and the sound of the slap could be heard clear across the crowded room cutting sharply through the deep buzz of conversation the voices died away steinbechers remained poised halfway towards lips and every eye in the room turned until it was focused on the scene of the disturbance smith now had the exclusive and undivided attention of close on four hundred german soldiers which was exactly how he wanted it no man anxious to avoid attention at all costs would ever do anything to incur the slightest risk of drawing that unwanted attention heidi pushed herself to her feet rubbed herself tenderly snatched up the note which smith had earlier placed on the table and stalked haughtily away smith his already reddening face discomfited and tight in anger rose made to leave the table then halted when confronted by the jager captain who had already risen from his side of the table he was a spruce erect youngster very much of the hitler jugend type punctilious and correct but at that moment rather suffering from the effect of too many steinbechers beneath the redlydulled eyes lay a gleam which bespoke the not uncommon combination of selfimportance and officious selfrighteousness your conduct does not become an officer of the wehrmacht he said loudly smith did not reply at once the embarrassed anger faded from his face to be replaced by an expressionlessly penetrating stare he gazed unwinkingly into the captains eyes for so long that the other finally looked away when smiths voice came it was too quiet to be heard even at the next table herr major when you talk to me little man the tone was glacial so now were also the eyes major bernd himmler you may have heard of me he paused significantly and the young captain seemed to shrink perceptibly before his eyes himmler head of the gestapo was the most feared man in germany smith could have been any relative of himmler possibly even his son report to me at am tomorrow morning smith said curtly he swung away without waiting for an answer the alpenkorps captain suddenly very sober indeed nodded wordlessly and sank wearily into his chair as smith strode towards the door the hubbub of conversation resumed for the soldiers stationed in that remote military outpost drinking beer very large quantities of beer was the only pastime such incidents were no sooner seen than forgotten on his way to the door smith stopped briefly by schaffer and said well i fouled that one up you could have handled it differently schaffer conceded then went on curiously what did you say to him the young alpine corps captain i mean i gave him to understand that i was himmlers son the gestapo boss schaffer asked incredulously god above you took a chance i couldnt afford to take a chance smith said cryptically ill go try the eichhof better luck there maybe back in ten minutes less he left schaffer looking uncertainly after him made an urgent negative move of his hand towards carraciola who was approaching him and passed outside he moved a few paces along the wooden boardwalk stopped and glanced briefly up and down the snowfilled street it was deserted in both directions he turned and walked quickly up a narrow alleyway which paralleled the side of zum wilden hirsch at the rear stood a small wooden hut smith checked again that he was unobserved opened the door quietly eight oclock he said into the darkness come on there was a rustle of clothes and mary appeared in the doorway she was shivering violently her face bluetinged with the extreme cold she looked questioningly at smith but he took her arm without a word and led her quickly to the back door of the gasthaus they entered a small hallway dimly lit by an oil lamp crossed it climbed a flight of stairs moved along a corridor and stopped at the second door on the right they passed swiftly inside smith closing the door behind him it was a small room plainly furnished but from the chintz soft furnishings and toilet articles on a dressingtable very obviously a feminine room mary sat down on the bed hugging herself tightly to try to restore some warmth and looked up at smith without any admiration in her face i hope youre enjoying your little game she said bitterly seem to know your way around dont you instinct smith explained he stooped over the lowburning oil lamp by the bed turned up the flame glanced briefly about the room located a battered leather case in one corner swung it to the bed and snapped open the lid the case contained womens clothing he pulled mary to her feet and said dont waste time take off your clothes and when i say that i mean your clothes every last stitch then get into that top outfit there youll find everything you need mary stared at him those clothes why on earth must i dont argue now now it is she said resignedly you might at least turn your back relax smith said wearily i have other things on my mind he crossed to the window stood peering out through a crack in the chintz curtains and went on now hurry youre supposed to be coming off the bus from steingaden that arrives in twenty minutes time youll be carrying that case which contains the rest of your clothes your name is maria schenk youre from dusseldorf a cousin of a barmaid that works here and youve had tb and been forced to give up your factory job and go to the mountains for your health so youve got this new job through this barmaid in the schloss adler and you have identity papers travel permit references and letters in appropriately postmarked envelopes to prove all of it theyre in that handbag in the case think you got all that i i think so she said uncertainly but if youd only tell me for gods sake smith said impatiently time girl time got it or not maria schenk dusseldorf factory tb cousin here steingadenyes i have it she broke off to pull a ribbed blue wool dress over her head smoothed it down and said wonderingly its a perfect fit youd think this dress was made for me it was made for you smith turned round to inspect her or whatever weumbroke into your flat and borrowed a dress to use as a model thorough thats us you broke into my flat she asked slowly well now you wouldnt want to go around like a refugee from a jumble sale smith said reasonably he looked at the dress with an approving eye doessomething for you td like to do something for you she said feelingly her eyes mirrored her bafflement her total lack of understanding butbut it must have taken weeks to prepare those clothes and those papers like enough smith agreed our forgery section did a very special job on those papers had to to get you into the lions den weeks mary said incredulously weeks but general carnabys plane crashed only yesterday morning she stared at him registering successive expressions of confusion accusation and finally downright anger you knew it was going to crash right first time my poppet smith said cheerfully he gave her an affectionate pat we rigged it dont do that she snapped then went on carefully her face still tight with anger there really was a plane crash guaranteed the plane crashlanded on the airfield hq of the bavarian mountain rescue pilots place called oberhausen about five miles from here the place well be leaving from incidentally the place well be leaving she broke off gazed at him a long moment then shook her head almost in despair but but in the plane i overheard you telling the men that if the mission failed or you had to split up that you were all to make a rendezvous at frauenfeld over the swiss border did you now there was mild interest in smiths voice i must be getting confused anyway this mosquito put down on the oberhausen airfield riddled with machinegun bullet holes british machinegun bullet holes but what the hell holes are holes and youd risk the life of an american generaland all the plans for the second front well now thats why im in such a hurry to get inside the schloss adler smith cleared his throat not before they get his secrets out of him but before they find out that hes not an american general and knows no more about the second front than i do about the back of the room what hes a plant name of jones smith nodded cartwright jones american actor as a thespian hes pretty second rate but hes a dead ringer for carnaby she looked at him with something like horror in her eyes youd risk an innocent hes getting plenty smith interrupted twentyfive thousand dollars for a onenight stand the peak of his professional career there came a soft double knock on the door a swift sliding movement of smiths hand and a gun was suddenly there a mauser automatic cocked and ready to go another swift movement and he was silently by the door jerking it open smith put his gun away heidi came in smith shutting the door behind her well cousins here we are he announced marynow mariaand heidi im off youre off mary said dazedly butbut what am i supposed to do heidi will tell you mary looked uncertainly at the other girl heidi heidi our top secret agent in bavaria since ourtop mary shook her head i dont believe it nobody would smith surveyed heidis opulent charms with an admiring eye brother what a disguise smith opened the back door of the gasthaus with a cautious hand moved swiftly outside and remained stockstill in the almost total darkness waiting for his eyes to become accustomed to the change of light the snow he thought was heavier than when they had first entered zum wilden hirsch and the wind had certainly freshened it was bitingly cold satisfied that he was unobserved smith turned to the left took two steps and bit off an exclamation as he tripped over some unseen object and fell his length in the snow he rolled over three times in the snow just in case any bystander might have a knife or gun and homicidal ideas about using them then got to his feet with catlike speed his mauser in one hand his pencilflash in the other he snapped on the torch and swung round in a є turn he was alone alone that was but for the crumpled form over which he had tripped an alpenkorps sergeant lying facedown in the snow a form lying still and curiously relaxed in that huddled shapelessness of death smith stooped and rolled the figure over to expose the great red stain in the snow where the body had been lying the pencilflash rested briefly on the front of the tunic a tunic gashed and soaked in blood the beam of the torch moved up to the face no more cloisters for this don smith thought in irrational emptiness no more honey still for tea and the fault is all mine and i can see it in his face the already dulled and faded eyes of torrancesmythe stared up at him in the sightless reproach of death smith straightened to his feet his face remote and withdrawn and quartered the immediate ground area with his light there were no signs of a struggle but struggle there must have been for some tunic buttons had been ripped off and the high collar torn open smithy had not died easily flash still in hand smith walked slowly along to the mouth of the narrow alleyway then stopped a confusion of footprints dark smears of blood in the trodden snow dark bare patches on the wooden walls of the gasthaus where struggling men had staggered heavily against ithere was where the struggle had been smith switched off the light returned both torch and gun to their hidingplaces and stepped out into the street on the one side was zum wilden hirsch with the sound of singing once again emanating from it on the other side a brightlylit telephone kiosk outside a post office in the kiosk talking animatedly on the telephone was a uniformed figure a soldier smith had never seen before the street itself was deserted schaffer leaned negligently against the bar the picture of complete and careless relaxation his face belied him it was grim and shocked and he was savagely shredding a cigarette between his fingers smithy schaffers voice was a low and vicious whisper not smithy you sure boss im sure smiths face still held the same remote and withdrawn expression almost as if all feeling had been drained from him you say he left in a hurry three minutes after id gone so he wasnt after me who else left no idea schaffer snapped the cigarette in half dropped it to the floor the place is packed and theres another door i cant believe it why old smithy why torrancesmythe he was the cleverest of us all thats why hes dead smith said sombrely now listen carefully its time you knew the score schaffer looked at him steadily and said its more than time smith began to speak in a very low voice in fluent completely idiomatic german careful that his back was turned to the gestapo officers at the far end of the bar after a minute or two he saw heidi returning to the room through the doorway behind the bar but ignored her as she ignored him almost immediately afterwards a gradual diminution in the babel of talk followed by an almost complete silence made him fall quiet himself and follow the direction of the gaze of hundreds of soldiers all of whom were looking towards the door there was reason for the silence especially good reason smith thought for soldiers almost totally cut off from womankind mary ellison clad in a belted raincoat with a scarf over her head and a battered suitcase in her hand was standing in the doorway the silence seemed to deepen women are rare at any time in a high alpine gasthaus unaccompanied young women even rarer and beautiful young women on their own virtually unknown for some moments mary stood there uncertainly as if unsure of her welcome or not knowing what to do then she dropped her bag and her face lit up as she caught sight of heidi a face transformed with joy marlene dietrich in the blue angel smith thought inconsequentially with a face and a figure and an acting talent like that she could have had hollywood tramping a path of beaten gold to her doorstep through the silent room she and heidi ran toward one another and embraced my dear maria my dear maria there was a break in heidis voice that made smith reflect that hollywood might have been well advised to tramp out two paths of beaten gold so you came after all after all these years mary hugged the other girl and kissed her again its wonderful to see you again cousin heidi wonderful wonderful wonderful of course i came why ever not well heidi made no effort to lower her voice as she looked around significantly theyre a pretty rough lot hereabouts you should carry a gun always hunter battalion they call themselves theyre well named the soldiers broke out into a roar of laughter and the normal hubbub of sound resumed almost at once arm in arm heidi led mary across to the small group of civilians standing at the far end of the bar she stopped in front of the man in the centre of the group a dark wiry intelligentfaced man who looked very very tough indeed and performed the introductions maria this is captain von brauchitsch heurnworks in the schloss adler captain my cousin maria schenk von brauchitsch bowed slightly you are fortunate in your cousins heidi we were expecting you miss schenk he smiled but not someone as beautiful as this mary smiled in turn her face puzzled you were expecting he was expecting heidi said dryly it is the captains business to know what is going on dont make me sound so sinister heidi youll frighten miss schenk he glanced at his watch the next cablecar leaves in ten minutes if i might escort the young lady the young lady is going to my room first heidi said firmly for a washup and a kaffeeschnapps cant you see that shes halfdead with cold i do believe her teeth are chattering von brauchitsch said with a smile i thought it might have been me well the cablecar after the next one then and im going with her heidi announced both of you von brauchitsch shook his head and smiled again von brauchitsch was always smiling my lucky night permits travel documents identity cards and letters you have heidi said she fished up some papers from the recesses of her tyrolean blouse and handed them to mary who was sitting across from her on the bed in her room plan of the castle and instructions do your homework well then give them back to me ill take them up you might be searched theyre a suspicious bunch up there and drink up that schnapps first thing von brauchitsch will do is to smell your breath just to check he checks everything hes the most suspicious of the lot he seemed a very pleasant man to me mary said mildly hes a very unpleasant gestapo officer heidi said dryly when heidi returned to the bar smith and schaffer had been rejoined by carraciola thomas and christiansen all five appeared to be carefree in their drinking and chatting inconsequentially but their low and urgent voices were evidence enough of the desperate worry in their minds or in the minds of some of them you havent seen old smithy then smith asked quietly none of you saw him go then where in hell has he got to there was no reply but the shrugs and worried frowns were reply enough christiansen said shall i go and have a look i dont think so smith said im afraid its too late to go anywhere now both doors of zum wilden hirsch had suddenly burst open and half a dozen soldiers were coming quickly in through either door all had slung machinecarbines schmeissers at the ready they fanned out along the walls and waited machinecarbines horizontal fingers on triggers their eyes very calm very watchful well well christiansen murmured it was a nice war the sudden and total silence was emphasised rather than broken by the crisp footfalls on the wooden floor as a full colonel of the wehrmacht came striding into the room and looked coldly around him the gargantuan proprietor of the gasthatts came hurrying round from the back of the bar tripping over chairs in the anxiety and fear limned so unmistakably clearly in his round pumpkin of a face colonel weissner it required no acute ear to catch the shake in the proprietors voice what in gods name no fault of yours mein herr the colonels words were reassuring which was more than the tone of his voice was but you harbour enemies of the state enemies of the state in a matter of seconds the proprietors complexion had changed from a most unbecoming puce to an even more unbecoming washedout grey while his voice now quavered like a highc tuning fork what i i josef wartmann please the colonel held up his hand for silence we are looking for four or five alpenkorps deserters from the stuttgart military prison to escape they killed two officers and a guardroom sergeant they were known to be heading this way smith nodded and said in schaffers ear very clever very clever indeed now then weissner continued briskly if theyre here well soon have them i want the senior officers present of drafts thirteen fourteen and fifteen to come forward he waited until two majors and a captain came forward and stood at attention before him you know all your officers and men by sight the three officers nodded good i wish you no need colonel heidi had come round from behind the bar and now stood before weissner hands clasped respectfully behind her back i know the man youre after the ringleader ah colonel weissner smiled the charming heidi herr colonel i have waited table on you up in the schloss adler weissner bowed gallantly as if one could ever forget that one her face full of a combination of righteous indignation and devotion to duty heidi pointed a dramatically accusing finger at smith thats the one herr colonel he he pinched me my dear heidi colonel weissner smiled indulgently if we were to convict every man who ever harboured thoughts of not that herr colonel he asked me what i knew or had heard about a man called general cannabeei think general carnaby colonel weissner was no longer smiling he glanced at smith motioned guards to close in on him then glanced back at heidi what did you tell him herr colonel heidi was stiff with outraged dignity i hope i am a good german and i value my engagements at the schloss adler she halfturned and pointed across the room captain von brauchitsch of the gestapo will vouch for me no need we will not forget this my dear child he patted her affectionately on the cheek then turned to smith the temperature of his voice dropping from warm to subzero your accomplices sir and at once at once my dear colonel the look he gave heidi was as glacial as the colonels voice surely not lets get our priorities straight first her thirty pieces of silver then us you talk like a fool colonel weissner said contemptuously heidi is a true patriot im sure she is smith said bitterly mary her face still and shocked stared down from the uncurtained crack in heidis dark room as smith and the four others were led out of the front door of zum wilden hirsch and marched off down the road under heavy escort to where several command cars were parked on the far side of the street brusquely efficiently the prisoners were bundled into two of the cars engines started up and within a minute both cars were lost to sight round a bend in the road for almost a minute afterwards mary stood there staring out unseeingly on the swirling snow then pulled the curtains together and turned back towards the darkened room she said in a whisper how did it happen a match scratched as heidi lit and turned up the flame of the oil lamp i cant guess heidi shrugged someone i dont know where eagles dare who must have tipped colonel weissner off but i put i finger on him mary stared at her youyou hed have been found out in another minute anyway they were strangers but it strengthens our hand iand youare now above suspicion above suspicion mary looked at her in disbelief then went on almost wildly but theres no point in going ahead now is there not heidi said thoughtfully somehow i feel sorrier for colonel weissner than i do for major smith is not our major smith a man of resource or do our employers in whitehall lie to us when they told me he was coming here they told me not to worry to trust him implicitly a man of infinite resourcethose were their exact wordswho can extricate himself from positions of utmost difficulty they have a funny way of talking in whitehall but already i trust him dont you there was no reply mary stared at the floor her eyes bright with unshed tears heidi touched her arm and said softly you love him as much as that mary nodded in silence and does he love you i dont know i just dont know hes been too long in this businesseven if he did know she said bitterly he probably wouldnt tell himself heidi looked at her for a moment shook her head and said they should never have sent you how can you hope to she broke off shook her head again and went on its too late now come on we mustnt keep von brauchitsch waiting butbut if he doesnt come if he cant escapeand how can he escape she gestured despairingly at the papers lying on the bed theyre bound to check with dusseldorf first thing in the morning about those forged references heidi said without any particular expression in her voice i dont think hed let you down mary no mary said dolefully i dont suppose he would the big black mercedes command car swept along the snow packed road that paralleled the blau see the windscreen wipers just coping with the thicklyswirling snow that rushed greyly back at the windscreen through powerful headlight beams it was an expensive car and a very comfortable one but neither schaffer up front nor smith in the rear seat experienced any degree of comfort whatsoever either mental or physical on the mental side there was the bitter prospect of the inevitable firing squad and the knowledge that their mission was over even before it had properly begun on the physical side they were cramped in the middle of their seats schaffer flanked by driver and guard smith by colonel weissner and guard and both smith and schaffer were suffering from pain in the lower ribs the owners of the schmeisser machinepistols the muzzles of which were grinding into the captives sides had no compunction about letting their presence be known they were now smith estimated halfway between village and barracks another thirty seconds and they would be through the barrack gates thirty seconds no more stop this car smiths voice was cold authoritative with an odd undertone of menace immediately do you hear i must think colonel weissner startled turned and stared at him smith ignored him completely his face reflected an intensely frowning concentration a thinlipped anger barely under control the face of a man to whom the thought of disobedience of his curt instruction was unthinkable most certainly not the face of a man going to captivity and death weissner hesitated but only fractionally he gave an order and the big car began to slow you oaf you utter idiot smiths tone shaking with anger was low and vicious so low that only weissner could hear it youve almost certainly ruined everything and by god if you have weissner youll be without a regiment tomorrow the car pulled into the roadside and stopped ahead the red tail lights of the command car in front vanished into a snowfilled darkness weissner said brusquely but with a barely perceptible tremor of agitation in his voice what the devil are you talking about you knew about this american general carnaby smiths face eyes narrowed and teeth bared in anger was within six inches of weissners how he almost spat the word out i dined in the schloss adler last night i smith looked at him in total incredulity colonel paul kramer told you he actually talked to you about him weissner nodded wordlessly admiral canaris chief of staff and now everybody knows god in heaven heads will roll for this he screwed the heels of his palms into his eyes lowered his hands wearily to his thighs gazed ahead unseeingly and shook his head very slowly this is too big even for me he fished out his pass and handed it to weissner who examined it in the beam of a none too steady torch back to the barracks at once i must get through to berlin immediately my uncle will know what to do your uncle by what seemed a great effort of will weissner looked up from the pass he held in his hand his voice was no steadier than the torch heinrick himmler who do you think smith snarled mickey mouse he dropped his voice to a low murmur i trust you never have the privilege of meeting him colonel weissner he gave weissner the benefit of a long and speculative look singularly lacking in any encouragement then turned away and prodded the driver none too lightly in the back the barracksand make it quick the car moved off anything that the nephew of the dreaded heinrich himmler chief of the gestapo said was good enough for the driver smith turned to the guard by his side take that damned thing out of my ribs angrily he snatched the gun away the guard who had also heard of himmler meekly yielded up the machinepistol one second later he was doubled up in helpless retching agony as the butt of the schmeisser smashed into his stomach and another second later colonel weissner was pinned against the window of his mercedes as the muzzle of the schmeisser ground into his right ear smith said if your men move you die okay schaffers calm voice from the front seat i have their guns stop the car smith ordered the car came to a halt through the windscreen smith could see the lights of the barracks guardroom now less than two hundred yards away he gave weissner a prod with the schmeisser muzzle out weissners face was a mask of chagrined rage but he was too experienced a soldier even to hesitate he got out three paces from the car smith said face down in the snow hands clasped behind your head schaffer your gun on your guard out beside the general you this with his gun muzzle in the drivers neck twenty seconds later schaffer at the wheel they were on their way leaving three men face downwards in the snow and the fourth smiths erstwhile guard still doubled up in agony by the roadside a creditable effort young himmler schaffer said approvingly ill never be that lucky again smith said soberly take your time passing the barracks we dont want any of the sentries getting the wrong idea at a steady twenty miles an hour they passed the main gates and then the secondary gates apparently as far as smith could see without exciting any comment just behind the threepointed star on the cars radiator flew a small triangular pennant the camp commandants personal standard and no one it was safe to assume would question the comings and goings of colonel weissner for half a mile or so beyond the secondary gates the road ran northwards in a straight line with on the left a sheer hundredfoot cliff dropping down into the waters of the blau see and to the right a line of pines not more than fifty yards wide backing up against another vertical cliffface which soared up until lost in the snow and the darkness at the end of the halfmile straight the road ahead swept sharply to the right to follow an indentation in the blau sees shoreline a dangerous corner marked by white fencing which would normally have been conspicuous enough by nighttime but which was at the moment all but invisible against the all enveloping background of snow schaffer braked for the corner a thoughtful expression crossed his face and he applied still heavier pressure to the brake pedal and glanced at smith an excellent idea it was smiths turn to be approving well make an agent out of you yet the mercedes stopped smith gathered up the schmeissers and pistols they had taken from weissner and his men and got out schaffer wound down the drivers window released the handbrake engaged gear and jumped out as the car began to move with his right arm through the window schaffer walked and then as the car began to gather speed ran along beside the mercedes his hand on the steering wheel twenty feet from the cliff edge he gave a last steering correction jerked the quadrant hand throttle wide open and leapt aside as the car accelerated the wooden fence never had a chance with a splintering crash barely audible above the roaring of the engine at maximum revs in first gear the mercedes went through the barrier as if it had been made of cardboard shot out over the edge of the cliff and disappeared from sight smith and schaffer reached the safety of an unbroken stretch of fencing and peered down just in time to see the car upside down now and its headlamps still blazing strike the surface of the lake with an oddly flat explosive sound like distant gunfire a column of water and weirdly phosphorescent spray reached halfway up the cliff side when it subsided they could at once locate from an underwater luminescence the position of the sinking car the headlamps were still burning smith and schaffer looked at each other then smith thoughtfully removed his peaked cap and sent it sailing over the edge the strong gusting wind blew the cap in against the cliff face but it tumbled on down and landed inside up on still surfacing bubbles iridescently glittering from the light now far below then the light went out so who cares schaffer straightened up from the fencing and shrugged his shoulders wasnt our car back to the village hey not on your life smith said emphatically and i mean thatliterally come on other way clutching their recently acquired weapons they ran round the corner in the direction in which the car had been travelling they had covered less than seventy yards when they heard the sound of car engines and saw wavering beams lighting up the splintered fence seconds later smith and schaffer were off the road hidden in the pines and moving slowly back in the direction of a command car and two armoured cars that had now pulled up at the broken barrier thats it then herr colonel an alpenkorps sergeant with shoulder slung gun peered gingerly over the edge of the cliff going too fast saw it too lateor never saw it at all the blau see is over a hundred metres deep here herr colonel theyre gone maybe theyre gone and maybe theyre not i wouldnt trust that lot as far as my front door colonel weissners voice carried clearly and sounded bitter they may have faked it and doubled back send one party of men straight into the pines there as far as the cliff wall five metre spacing let them use their torches then another party of men five hundred metres in the car back towards the camp you go with them sergeant again spread out to the cliffface let them come together and be quick schaffer from his hidingplace behind the bole of a pine looked thoughtfully at smith i have to concede a point boss its perhaps as well we didnt go straight back to the village cunning old devil isnt he and what does that make me smith murmured okay okay ill concede that point too five minutes passed comparatively little of the falling snow penetrated the thicklymatted branches of the pines and the two men could clearly see the occasional flicker of torches as the line of men nearest them moved away to the south their lights probing behind treetrunks and under windfalls as they searched for the two escaped prisoners colonel weissner paced up and down slowly beside his command car his head bowed as if immersed in thought from time to time he consulted his watch as smith watched he moved out to the unbroken fencing and remained there peering down towards the surface of the blau see by and by smith and schaffer could hear the distant sound of muffled voices and within a minute the sergeant moved into the beam of the command car headlamps approached colonel weissner and saluted not even a footprint herr colonel weissner straightened and turned there wouldnt be he said sombrely ive just seen a hat floating in the water a squalid end for such brave men sergeant a squalid end the cablecar moved slowly out of the lower station at the beginning of its long climb up to the castle an impossible climb mary thought a dangerous and impossible climb peering through the front windows she could just distinguish the outline of the first pylon through the thinlydriving snow the second and third pylons were invisible but the intermittently shining cluster of lights suspended impossibly high in the sky showed clearly enough where they had to go people have made it before she thought dully well probably make it too the way she felt then with the bottom gone from her world she didnt particularly care whether she made it or not the cablecar was a twelvepassenger vehicle painted bright red outside welllit inside there were no seats only grabrails along the two sides that the grabrails were very necessary became immediately and alarmingly obvious the wind was now very strong and the car began to sway alarmingly only seconds after clearing the shelter of the lower station apart from two soldiers and an apparent civilian the only other passengers consisted of von brauchitsch mary and heidi the last now with a heavy woollen coat and cossack fur hat over her ordinary clothes von brauchitsch holding on to the grabrail with one hand had his free arm round marys shoulders he gave them a reassuring squeeze and smiled down at her scared he asked no and she wasnt she hadnt enough emotion left to be scared but even with no hope left she was supposed to be a professional no im not scared im terrified i feel seasick already doesdoes this cable ever break never von brauchitsch was reassurance itself just hang on to me and youll be all right thats what he used to say to me heidi said coldly fraulein von brauchitsch explained patiently i am gifted beyond the average but i havent yet managed to grow a third arm guests first with a cupped cigarette in his hand schaffer leaned against the base of an unmistakable telephone pole and gazed thoughtfully into the middle distance there was reason both for the hooded cigarette and the thoughtful expression less than a hundred yards away from where he stood at the edge of the pines bordering the road running alongside the shore of the blau see he could see guards clearly illuminated by overhead lights moving briskly to and fro in the vicinity of the barrack gates dimly seen behind them were the outline of the barracks themselves schaffer shifted his stance and gazed upwards the snow was almost gone now the moon was threatening to break through and he had no difficulty at all in distinguishing the form of smith his legs straddled across the lowest crossbar smith was busily employed with a knife a specially designed commando knife which among other advanced features had a builtin wire cutter carefully methodically he brought the wirecutter to bear with eight consecutive snips eight consecutive telephone wires fell to the ground smith closed and pocketed his knife disentangled his legs from the crossbar wrapped his arms round the pole and slid down to the ground he grinned at schaffer every little helps he said should hold them for a while schaffer agreed once more they gathered up their guns and moved off to the east vanishing into the pine woods which bordered the rear of the barracks the cablecar swayed more alarmingly than ever it had now entered upon the last nearvertical lap of its journey with von brauchitschs arm still around her shoulders with her face still pressed against the front windows of the car mary stared up at the towering battlements white as the driving snow and thought that they reached up almost to the clouds themselves as she watched a break came in the wisping clouds and the whole fairytale castle was bathed in bright moonlight fear touched her eyes she moistened her lips and gave an involuntary shiver nothing escaped von brauchitschs acute perception he gave her shoulders another reassuring squeeze perhaps the twentieth in that brief journey not to worry fraulein it will be all right i hope so her voice was the ghost of a whisper the same unexpected moonlight almost caught smith and schaffer they had just crossed the station tracks and were moving stealthily along towards the left luggage office when the moon broke through but they were still in the shadows of the overhanging station roof they pressed back into those shadows and peered along the tracks past thehydraulic bumpers which marked the end of the line clearly now sharplylimned as if in full daylight red etched against the white they could see one cablecar approaching the lower station the other climbing the last few vertical feet towards the header station and above that the dazzling outline of the schloss adler glittering under the bright moon that helps schaffer said bitterly that helps a lot skys still full of clouds smith said mildly he bent to the keyhole of the left luggage office used his skeleton keys and moved inside schaffer followed closing the door smith located their rucksacks cut a length of rope from the nylon wrapped it round his waist and began stuffing some hand grenades and plastic explosives into a canvas bag he raised his head as schaffer diffidently cleared his throat boss this with an apprehensive glance through the window huhhuh boss has it occurred to you that colonel weissner probably knows all about this cache by this time what i mean is we may have company soon we may indeed smith admitted surprised if we dont have thats why ive cut this itsybitsy piece of rope off the big coil and why im taking the explosives and grenades only from my rucksack and yours its a very big coiland no one knows whats inside our rucksacks so its unlikely that anything will be missed but the radio if we broadcast from here we might be caught in the act if we take it away and they find it gone theyll know that that car at the bottom of the blau see is empty is that it more or less so we compromise we remove it but we return it here after weve broadcast from a safe place what do you mean safe place schaffer demanded plaintively the darkly saturnine face was unhappy there isnt a safe place in bavaria theres one not twenty yards away last place theyd look he tossed schaffer a bunch of skeleton keys ever been inside a bavarian ladies cloakroom schaffer fielded the keys stared at smith shook his head and left quickly he moved down the tracks his torch flashing briefly on and off finally his torch settled on a doorway with above it the legend damen schaffer looked at it pursed his lips shrugged his shoulders and got to work on the lock slowly with apparently infinite labour the cablecar completed the last few feet of its ascent and passed in under the roof of the schloss adler header station it juddered to a halt the front door opened and the passengers disembarked they moved from the header stationbuilt into the northwest base of the castleup through a steeplyclimbing twentyfive foot tunnel which had heavy iron doors and guards at either end passing the top gateway they emerged into the courtyard the entrance of which was sealed off by a massivelybarred iron gate guarded by heavily armed soldiers and dobermann pinchers the courtyard itself was brightly illuminated by the light of dozens of uncurtained interior windows in the very centre of the courtyard stood the helicopter which had that morning brought reichsmarschall rosemeyer to the schloss adler under the cover of a heavy tarpaulin momentarily unnecessary because of the cessation of the snow a dungareed figure possibly the pilot worked on the helicopter engine with the aid of a small but powerful arclamp mary turned to von brauchitsch still holding a proprietary grip on her arm and smiled ruefully so many soldiers so many men and im sure so few women what happens if i want to escape from the licentious soldiery easy von brauchitsch really did have mary thought dully a most charming smile just jump from your bedroom window one hundred metres straight down and there you are free the ladies cloakroom in the station was a superlatively nondescript place bleakly furnished with hardbacked benches chairs deal tables and a sagging wooden floor the spartans would have turned up their noses at it in its sheer lack of decorative inspiration it could have been surpassed only by its counterpart in england the expiring remains of a fire burnt dully in a black enamel stove smith was seated by the central table radio beside him consulting a small book by the light of a hooded pencilflash and writing on a slip of paper he checked what he had written straightened and handed the book to schaffer burn it page by page page by page all surprise in the saturnine face you wont be requiring this any more smith shook his head and began to crank the radio handle there was a very much better fire in the operations room in whitehall a pinelog fire with a healthy crackle and flames of a respectable size but the two men sitting on either side of the fire were a great deal less alert than the two men sitting by the dying embers of the fire in the bavarian alps admiral rolland and colonel wyattturner were frankly dozing eyes shut more asleep than awake but they came to full wakefulness jerking upright almost instantly when the longawaited callsign came through on the big transceiver manned by the civilian operator at the far end of the room they glanced at each other heaved themselves out of their deep armchairs broadsword calling danny boy the voice on the radio was faint but clear broadsword calling danny boy you hear me over the civilian operator spoke into his microphone we hear you over code ready over ready over rolland and wyattturner were by the operators shoulder now his eyes fixed on his pencil as he began to make an instantaneous transcription of the meaningless jumble of letters beginning to come over the radio swiftly the message was spelt out torrancesmythe murdered thomas christiansen and carraciola captured as if triggered by an unheard signal the eyes of rolland and wyattturner lifted and met their faces were strained and grim their eyes returned to the flickering pencil enemy believe schaffer and self dead the message continued effecting entry inside the hour please have transport standing by ninety minutes over admiral rolland seized the microphone from the operator broadsword broadsword do you know who i am broadsword i know who you are sir over pull out broadsword pull out now save yourselves over you must be joking the words were spoken in slow motion a perceptible pause between each pair over you heard me rollands voice was almost as slow and distinct you heard me that was an order broadsword mary is already inside over and out the transceiver went dead hes gone sir the operator said quietly hes gone rolland repeated mechanically dear god hes gone colonel wyattturner moved away and sat down heavily in his chair by the fire for such a big burly man he appeared curiously huddled and shrunken he looked up dully as admiral holland sank into the opposite chair its all my fault the colonels voice was barely distinguishable all my fault we did what we had to do all our fault colonel it was my idea he gazed into the fire now this this on top of everything else our worst day wyattturner agreed heavily our worst day ever maybe im too old maybe were all too old with his right forefinger holland began to tick off the fingers of his left hand hq commanderinchief portsmouth secret alarm triggered nothing missing nothing taken wyattturner agreed wearily but the vigil emulsion plates show photostat copies taken two southampton bargemovement duplicates missing three plymouth timelock in the naval hq inoperative we dont know what this means we can guess we can guess dover copy of a section of the mulberry harbour plans missing an error carelessness well never know five bradleys hq guard sergeant missing could mean anything could mean everything all the troop movements for overlords omaha beach are there lastly seven os reports today france belgium netherlands four demonstrably false other three unverifiable for long moments there was a heavy a defeated silence finally broken by wyattturner if there was ever any doubt theres none now he spoke without looking up his eyes gazing emptily into the fire the germans have almost total penetration here and we have almost none on the continent and now this smith and his men i mean smith and his men holland echoed smith and his men we can write them off wyattturner dropped his voice speaking so softly that the radio operator couldnt overhear and operation overlord sir operation overlord holland murmured yes we can write that off too intelligence is the first arm of modern warfare wyattturner said bitterly or has someone said that before no intelligence no war admiral holland pressed an intercom button have my car brought round coming colonel to the airfield and a lot farther than that if i have your permission sir weve discussed it admiral holland shrugged i understand how you feel kill yourself if you must ive no intention wyattturner crossed to a cupboard and took out a sten gun turned to holland and smiled we may encounter hostiles sir you may indeed there was no answering smile on the admirals face you heard what the man said smith switched off the transmitter telescoped the aerial and glanced across at schaffer we can pull out now pull out now pull out now schaffer was outraged dont you realise that if we do theyll get to mary inside twelve hours he paused significantly making sure he had all smiths attention and if they get to her theyre bound to get to heidi ten minutes later come off it lieutenant smith said protestingly youve only seen her once for five minutes so schaffer was looking positively belligerent how often did paris see helen of troy how often did antony see cleopatra how often did romeo he broke off then went on defiantly and i dont care if she is a traitor spying on her own people she was born and brought up in birmingham smith said wearily so who cares i draw the line at nothing even if she is a limey he paused english come on smith said lets return this radio we may have callers soon we mustnt be raising too many eyebrows schaffer agreed they returned the radio locked the left luggage office and were just moving towards the station exit when they were halted by the sound of truck engines and a sirens ululation they pressed back against a wall as headlights lit up the station entrance the leading truck came to a skidding halt not ten yards away schaffer looked at smith discretion i think discretion indeed behind the booking office the two men moved swiftly alongside the tracks and hid in the deep shadows behind the booking office a sergeant the one who had organised the search along the blau see came running through the entrance followed by four soldiers located the left luggage office tried the door handle reversed his machinepistol and hammered the lock without effect reversed his gun again shot away the lock and passed inside torch in hand he appeared at the doorway almost at once tell the captain they didnt lie the englanders gear is here one of the soldiers left and the sergeant said to the three remaining men right get their stuff out and load it up there goes my last pair of cotton socks schaffer murmured mournfully as their rucksacks were taken away not to mention my toothbrush and he broke off as smith caught his arm the sergeant had stopped the man carrying the radio taken it from him placed his hand on it and stood quite still he was directly under one of the small swinging electric lights and the expression on his face could clearly be seen to change from puzzlement to disbelief to complete and shocked understanding kapitan the sergeant shouted kapitan an officer came hurrying through the station entrance the radio kapitan its warm very warm its been in use inside the last five minutes in the last five minutes impossible he stared at the sergeant unless yes herr kapitan unless surround the station the officer shouted search every room oh god schaffer moaned why cant they leave us alone quickly smith said softly he took schaffers arm and they moved through the dark shadows till they reached the ladies cloakroom carefully not to rattle his skeleton keys smith had the door open in seconds they passed inside and locked the door behind them this wont look so good in my obituary schaffer said dolefully there was a perceptible edge of strain under the lightlyspoken words what wont gave his life for his country in a ladies lavatory in upper bavaria how can a man rip with that on his mind whats our friend outside saying if you shut up we might hear and when i say everywhere i mean everywhere the german captain was barking out his commands in the best paradeground fashion if a door is locked break it open if you cant break it open shoot the lock away and if you dont want to die in the next five minutes never forget that these are violent and extremely dangerous men almost certainly armed with stolen schmeisser machinepistols apart from their own weapons make no attempt to capture them shoot on sight and shoot to kill you heard smith said im afraid i did there was a perceptible click as schaffer cocked his machinepistol they stood sidebyside in the darkness listening to the sounds of the search the calling of voices the hammering of rifle butts on wood the splintering of yielding doors the occasional short burst of machinegun fire where a door presumably had failed to yield to more conventional methods of persuasion the sounds of the approaching search grew very close theyre getting warm schaffer murmured schaffer had underestimated the temperature just as he finished speaking an unseen hand closed on the outer door handle and rattled the door furiously smith and schaffer moved silently and took up position pressed close against the wall one on either side of the door the rattling ceased a heavy crashing impact from the outside shook the door on its hinges a second such impact and the woodwork in the jamb by the lock began to splinter two more would do it smith thought two more but there were no more gott in himmel hans the voice beyond the door held or appeared to hold a mixture of consternation and outrage what are you thinking of cant you read cant i the second voice broke off abruptly and when it came again it was in tones of defensive apology damen mein gott damen a pause if you had spent as many years on the russian front as i have his voice faded as the two men moved away god bless our common anglosaxon heritage schaffer murmured fervently what are you talking about smith demanded he had released his tense grip on the schmeisser and realised that the palms of his hands were damp this misplaced sense of decency schaffer explained a far from misplaced and highly developed sense of selfpreservation smith said dryly would you like to come searching for a couple of reputed killers like us knowing that the first man to find us would probably be cut in half by a burst of machinegun fire put yourself in their position how do you think those men feel how would you feel td feel very unhappy schaffer said candidly and so do they and so they seize on any reasonable excuse not to investigate our two friends who have just left have no idea whatsoever whether were in here or not and whats more the last thing they want to do is to find out stop making with the old psychology all that matters is that schaffer is saved saved if you believe that smith said curtly you deserve to end up with a blindfold round your eyes hows that again schaffer asked apprehensively you and i smith explained patiently are not the only people who can put ourselves in the places of the searchers you can bet your life that the captain can and more than likely the sergeant too you saw how quickly he caught on to the damn radio by and by one or other is going to come by see this closed and undamaged door blow his top and insist on a few of his men being offered the chance to earn a posthumous iron cross what i mean is schaffer is not yet saved what do we do boss schaffer said quietly i dont feel so funny any more we create a diversion here are the keys this one put it in the lock and hold it ready to turn well be leaving in a hurry troops of this calibre cant be fooled for long he dug into his knapsack fished out a handgrenade crossed the cloakroom into the washroom and in almost total darkness felt his way across it to where the window at the back should have been finally located it from the source of a faint wash of light he pressed his nose against the glass but could see nothing cursed softly as he realised a washroom window would always certainly be frosted located the latch and slowly swung the window wide with infinite caution a fraction of an inch at a time he thrust his head slowly through the window nobody blew his head off there were soldiers immediately to be seen it was true soldiers armed and at the ready but they werent looking in his direction there were five of them spread out in an arc of a circle perhaps fifteen yards from the station entrance and every machinepistol was trained on that entrance waiting for the rabbits to bolt smith thought what was of much more interest was the empty truck parked only feet away from the window where he was it was the reflected light from its sidelights that had enabled him to locate the window hoping that the truck was built along conventional lines smith armed the grenade counted three lobbed it under the back wheels of the truck and ducked behind the shelter of the washroom wall the two explosions grenade and petrol tank went off so almost simultaneously as to be indistinguishable in time shattered glass from the window above showered down on his head and his eardrums hurt fiercely both from the roar of sound and the proximity to the explosive shockwave smith made no attempt to inspect the damage he had done less from the urgent need for haste to leave there than from the very obvious fact that the remains of the truck outside had burst into flames and to have lifted his head above that window sill would have been a swift form of illuminated suicide not that he could have done so in any event for the winddriven flames from the track were already beginning to lick through the shattered washroom window on hands and knees smith scuttled across the washroom floor not rising till he had reached the cloakroom schaffer who had his hand on the key and the door already open a fraction of an inch turned at smiths approach to the hills boss he enquired to the hills the trackside of the station was predictably deserted those who had not automatically run to investigate the source of the explosion would have as automatically assumed that the explosion was in some way connected with an escape attempt or resistance on the part of the hunted men however it was the result was the satisfactory same they ran along the tracks till they came to the bumpers at the end of the line skirted these and continued running until they were safely among the scatter of houses that rose steeply up the hillside on the eastern side of the village they stopped to take breath and looked back the way they had come the station was on fire not yet heavily on fire but with flames rising six to eight feet and black smoke billowing into the night sky obviously already beyond any hope of extinction schaffer said theyre not going to be very pleased i shouldnt think so what i mean is theyre really going to go after us now with everything they have theyve dobermann pinchers up at the castle and ive no doubt they have them at the camp too theyve only to bring them to the station sniff our gear have them circle the station pick up our scent and thats it smith and schaffer torn to shreds ill take on the alpenkorps by numbers but i draw the line at dobermann pinchers boss i thought it was horses you were scared of smith said mildly horses dobermann pinchers you name it im scared of it all its got to have is four feet he looked gloomily at the burning station td make a rotten vet no worry smith assured him we wont be here long enough for any of your fourfooted pals to come bothering you no schaffer looked at him suspiciously the castle smith said patiently thats what were here for remember i hadnt forgotten the flames from the blazing station were now licking thirty forty feet up in the air you gone and ruined a perfectly good station you know that as you would say yourself smith reminded him it wasnt our station to start with come on weve a call to make then well go see what kind of reception awaits us at the schloss adler mary ellison was just at that moment discovering what the reception in the schloss adler was like in her case it was none too pleasant von brauchitsch and heidi beside her she was gazing around the great hall of the castle stone walls stone flags a dark oaken roof when a door at the end of the hall opened and a girl came towards them there was an arrogance a crisp authority about her r she marched rather than walked but a very beautiful girl mary had to admit to herself big blonde blueeyed and beautiful she could have been a pinup girl for the third reich at the moment the blue eyes were very cold goodevening annemarie von brauchitsch said there was a marked lack of cordiality in his voice this is the new girl fraulein maria schenk maria this is the colonels secretary in charge of all female staff took your time about getting here didnt you schenk if annemarie had a soft lilting mellifluous voice she wasnt bothering to use it just then she turned to heidi and gave her an icy upanddown and why you just because we let you wait table when the colonel has company heidi is this girls cousin von brauchitsch interrupted brusquely and she has my permission the cold implication that she should confine herself to her duties was unmistakable annemarie glared at him but made no attempt to press the point very few people would have done von brauchitsch was just that sort of person in here schenk annemarie nodded to a side door i have a few questions to ask mary looked at heidi then at von brauchitsch who shrugged and said routine investigation fraulein im afraid you must mary preceded annemarie through the doorway the door was firmly closed behind them heidi and von brauchitsch looked at each other heidi compressed her lips and the expression that momentarily flitted over her face about matched the one annemarie had been wearing von brauchitsch made the ageold helpless gesture of lifting his shoulders high palms of the hands turned up within half a minute the reason for von brauchitschs helpless gesture became obvious through the door there came first the sound of a raised voice a brief scuffle then a sharp cry of pain von brauchitsch exchanged another resigned glance with heidi then turned as he heard heavy footsteps behind him the man approaching was burly weatherbeaten middleaged and in civilian clothes but although not in uniform he could never have been mistaken for anything other than an army officer the heavy blueshaven jowls bullneck closecropped hair and piercing blue eyes made him almost a caricature of the world war i prussian uhlan cavalry officer that he was by no means as fossilised as he appeared was quite evident from the distinctly respectful manner in which von brauchitsch addressed him good evening colonel kramer evening captain evening fraulein he had an unexpectedly gentle and courteous voice you wear an air of expectancy before either could answer the door opened and annemarie and mary entered mary gave the impression of having been pushed into the room annemarie was slightly flushed and breathing rather heavily but otherwise her beautiful aryan self marys clothes were disordered her hair dishevelled and it was obvious that she had been crying her cheeks were still tearstained well have no more trouble with her annemarie announced with satisfaction she caught sight of kramer and the change in her tone was perceptible interviewing new staff colonel in your usual competent fashion i see colonel kramer said dryly he shook his head when will you learn that respectable young girls do not like being forcibly searched and having their underclothes examined to see if they were made in piccadilly or gorki street security regulations annemarie said defensively yes yes kramers voice was brusque but there are other ways he turned away impatiently the engaging of female staff was not the problem of the deputy chief of the german secret service while heidi was helping mary to straighten her clothes he went on to von brauchitsch a little excitement in the village tonight nothing for us von brauchitsch shrugged deserters kramer smiled thats what i told colonel weissner to say i think our friends are british agents what after general carnaby i shouldnt wonder kramer said carelessly relax captain its over three of them are coming up for interrogation within the hour id like you to be present later on i think youll find it most entertaining and ah instructive there were five of them sir i saw them myself when they were rounded up in zum wilden hirsch there were five colonel kramer corrected not now two of them the leader and one other are in the blau see they commandeered a car and went over a cliff mary her back to the men and annemarie smoothed down her dress and slowly straightened her face was stricken annemarie turned saw marys curiously immobile position and was moving curiously towards her when heidi took marys arm and said quickly my cousin looks ill may i take her to her room all right annemarie waved her hand in curt dismissal the one you use when you are here the room was bleak monastic linoleumcovered with a madeup iron bed chair tiny dressingtable a hanging cupboard and nothing else heidi locked the door behind them you heard mary said emptily her face was as drained of life as her voice i heard and i dont believe it why should they lie they believe it heidis tone was impatient almost rough its time you stopped loving and started thinking the major smiths of this world dont drive over cliff edges talk is easy heidi so is giving up believe he is alive and if he is and if he comes here and youre gone or not there to help him you know what hell be then mary made no reply just gazed emptily into heidis face hell be dead hell be dead because you let him down would he let you down mary shook her head dumbly now then heidi went on briskly she reached first under her skirt then down the front of her blouse and laid seven objects on the table here we are lilliput automatic two spare magazines ball of string lead weight plan of the castle and the instructions she crossed to a corner of the room raised a loose floorboard placed the articles beneath it and replaced the board theyll be safe enough there mary looked at her for a long moment and showed her first spark of interest in an hour you knew that board was loose she said slowly of course i loosened it myself a fortnight ago you you knew about this as far back as then whatever else heidi smiled good luck cousin mary sank on to the bed and sat there motionless for ten minutes after heidi had gone then rose wearily to her feet and crossed to her window her window faced to the north and she could see the line of pylons the lights of the village and beyond that the darkened waters of the blau see but what dominated the entire scene were the redlytowering flames and billowing clouds of black smoke reaching up from some burning building at the far end of the village for a hundred yards around it night had been turned into day and even if there had been a local fire brigade to hand it would have been clearly impossible for them to approach anywhere near the flames when that fire went out all that would be left would be smoking ashes mary wondered vaguely what it might mean she opened her window and leaned out but cautiously even for a person as depressed as she was there was no temptation to lean too far castle walls and volcanic plug stretched vertically downwards for almost three hundred feet she felt slightly dizzy to the left and below a cablecar left the castle header station and started to move down to the valley below heidi was in that car leaning out a partially opened window and hopefully waving but marys eyes had again blurred with tears and she did not see her she closed the window turned away lay down heavily on the bed and wondered again about john smith whether he were alive or dead and she wondered again about the significance of that fire in the valley below smith and schaffer skirted the backs of the houses shops and weinstuben on the east side of the street keeping to the dark shadows as far as it was possible their precautions smith realised were largely superfluous the undoubted centre of attraction that night was the blazing station and the street leading to it was jammed with hundreds of soldiers and villagers it must smith thought be a conflagration of quite some note for although they could no longer see the fire itself only the red glow in the sky above it they could clearly hear the roaring crackle of the flames flames three hundred yards away and with the wind blowing in the wrong direction as a diversion it was a roaring success they came to one of the few stone buildings in the village a large barnlike affair with double doors at the back the yard abutting the rear doors looked like an automobile scrap yard there were halfadozen old cars lying around most of them without tyres some rusted engines dozens of small useless engine and body parts and a small mountain of empty oil drums they picked their way carefully through the debris and came to the doors schaffer used skeleton keys to effect and they were inside doors closed and both torches on inside fifteen seconds one side of the garage was given over to lathes or machine tools of one kind or another but the rest of the floor space was occupied by a variety of vehicles mostly elderly what caught and held smiths immediate attention however was a big yellow bus parked just inside the double front doors it was a typically alpine postbus with a very long overhang at the back to help negotiate mountain hairpin bends the rear wheels were so far forward as to be almost in the middle of the bus as was also common with alpine postbuses in winter it had a huge angled snowplough bolted on to the front of the chassis smith looked at schaffer promising you think if i was optimistic enough to think wed ever get back to this place schaffer said sourly id say it was very promising you knew about this what do you think i am a busdiviner of course i knew about it smith climbed into the drivers seat the keys were in the ignition smith switched on and watched the fuel gauge climb up to the halffull mark he located the headlamps switch and turned it on they worked he pressed the starter button and the engine caught at once smith killed it immediately schaffer watched the performance with interest i suppose you know you need a psv licence to drive one of those boss i have one around somewhere leave half the explosives in the back of the bus and hurry heidi might be down with the next car smith climbed down from the drivers seat went to the front doors unbolted both top and bottom and pushed gently the doors gave an inch then stopped padlocked smith said briefly schaffer surveyed the massive steel plough on the front of the bus and shook his head sorrowfully poor old padlock he said the snow had stopped but the wind from the west was now very strong the cold was intense masses of ragged dark cloud hurried across the sky and the entire valley was alternatively cast into the deepest shadow or bathed in contrastingly dazzling light as the moon was alternatively obscured by the clouds or shone through the shifting gaps between them but there was no alternating light and shade at the far end of the village the station still burnt furiously enough to render the moons best efforts pretty ineffectual a cablecar was coming slowly down the valley less than a hundred yards now from the lower station impelled by the powerfully gusting wind it swung wildly terrifyingly across the night sky but as it approached the end of its journey the motion quickly dampened down and disappeared altogether as it approached the station the cablecar jerked to a stop heidi the only passenger climbed out understandably enough she was looking rather pale she walked down the steps at the back of the station reached ground level then stopped dead as she heard the softlywhistled first few notes of lorelei she whirled round then slowly approached two shapes clad all in white huddled by the side of the station the major smiths of this world dont drive off clifftops she said calmly she paused then stepped forward suddenly and gave each man a quick hug and kiss on the cheek but you had me a little worried there you just keep on worrying like that schaffer said no need to worry about him though heidi waved a hand in the direction of the other end of the village from the cablecar station on the lower slopes they had an excellent if distant view of the fire are you responsible for this she asked it was a mistake smith explained yeah his hand slipped schaffer added you two should audition for a turn on vaudeville heidi said dryly suddenly serious she said mary thinks youre both gone weissner doesnt smith said the car that went over the cliff went without us theyre on to us hardly surprising she murmured or hadnt you noticed the size of the fire she paused then went on bleakly theyre not the only ones who are on to you kramer knows youre british agents after general carnaby well well well smith said thoughtfully i wonder what little bird has been whispering in kramers shelllike ear one with a very longrange voice methinks what are you talking about nothing its not important its not important but dont you see her voice was imploring almost despairing they know or will any minute that youre alive they know who you are theyll be expecting you up there ah but you overlook the subtleties my dear heidi schaffer put in what they dont know is that we are expecting them to be expecting us at least thats what i think i mean youre whistling in the dark lieutenant and one last thing your friends are being brought up to the castle any time now for interrogation smith asked i dont expect theyve been asked up for tea she said acidly fair enough smith nodded well go up with them in the same car the words didnt question smiths sanity but the tone and expression did not in with smith peered at his watch the postbus in sulzs garage be there in eighty minutes and oh bring a couple of crates of empty beer bottles bring a couple of oh all right she shook her head in conviction youre both mad shines through in our every word and gesture schaffer agreed then suddenly serious added say a prayer for us honey and if you dont know any prayers keep your fingers crossed till they ache please come back she said there was a catch in her voice she hesitated made to say more turned and walked quickly away schaffer looked after her admiringly as she walked down the street there goes the future mrs schaffer he announced bit tetchy and snappy perhaps he pondered but funny i thought she was near crying at the end there maybe youd be tetchy and snappy and tearful if youd been through what shes been in the past two and a half years smith said sourly maybe shed be less tetchy and tearful if she knew a bit more about whats going on i havent the time to explain everything to everybody you can say that again devious boss thats the word for you like enough smith glanced at his watch i wish to god theyd hurry up speak for yourself schaffer paused when we well if wer get away is she coming with us is who coming with us heidi of course heidi of course if we make it and we can only do it through mary and mary was introduced by say no more he stared after the retreating figure and shook his head shell be a sensation in the savoy grill he said dreamily the seconds crawled by and became minutes and the minutes in turn piled up with agonising slowness until almost quarter of an hour had passed brilliant moonshine and a contrastingly almost total darkness had alternated a score of times as the low tattered black clouds scudded across the valley and the cold deepened until it reached down into the bones of the two watchers in the shadows and still they waited they waited because they had to they couldnt reach the schloss adler without company and company was a long time in coming and they waited in silence each man alone with his own thoughts what was in schaffers mind smith couldnt guess probably he was blissfully envisaging himself as the instigator of a series of uncontrollable stampedes in a selection of the better known hostelries in the west end of london smiths own thoughts were much more pragmatic and concerned solely with the immediate future he was becoming concerned and seriously concerned about the intense cold and how it would affect their chances of making the trip up to the castle intact stamp their feet and flail their arms as they might that numbing cold tightened its grip on them with every minute that passed what they were about to do needed both physical strength and quick reactions in full measure and that glacial cold was swiftly draining them of both briefly and bleakly he wondered what odds any reasonable bookmaker would have given against their chances of reaching the castle but dismissed the thought stillborn when no other option offered there was no point in figuring the percentages and besides they were due to find out immediately the longawaited company was at hand two alpenkorps command cars the leading one with wailing siren and flashing headlamps swept up the village street just as the moon broke through the cloudwrack once again flooding the valley with light smith and schaffer looked up at the moon then at each other and then wordlessly moved back and pressed more deeply into the shadows on the west side of the lower station the two metallic clicks seemed unnaturally loud as they eased forward the safety catches of their schmeisser machinepistols engines stopped and headlamps faded and died almost on the same instant as the two cars pulled up beneath the steps men hurried out and lined up briefly before advancing single file up the station steps a dozen altogether smith counted an officer eight guards and carraciola thomas and christiansen all eight guards had their guns at the ready which seemed a rather superfluous precaution as the three prisoners had their hands manacled behind their backs ergo the guns werent there to guard the prisoners but against any rescue attempt by smith and schaffer he and schaffer smith thought wryly must be acquiring quite a reputation for themselves but nonetheless a reassuring spectacle if the germans had known the true reason for his smiths presence in bavaria they would also have known that they could have taken the three prisoners up with only a peashooter for protection and still have remained free from molestation the last of the twelve men passed inside the lower station smith touched schaffers arm they slung their schmeissers scrambled quickly but quietly on to the icecovered and steeplysloping roof of the station and silently and with no little difficulty crawled forwards and upwards to the front edge of the roof under which the cablecar would appear as it moved out at the beginning of its long haul towards the castle they were smith knew terribly exposed snowsuits or not a casual passerby in the street below had only to glance upwards and their detection was certain fortunately there appeared to be no casual passersby the free entertainment provided by the burning station was drawing a full house and then as the cable began to move the moon disappeared behind clouds they waited tensely till the leading edge of the cablecar appeared swung their legs over the lip of the roof waited till the suspension bracket passed beneath them reached down for the cable allowed themselves to be pulled off the roof fell across the cable and lowered themselves gently until their feet touched the roof of the cablecar mary walked softly along the dimlylit stoneflagged passage counting off doors as she went outside the fifth she stopped put her ear to it stooped glanced through the keyhole knocked quietly and waited for a response there was none she knocked again more loudly with the same result she turned the handle and found the door locked from her small handbag she produced a set of skeleton keys when the door yielded she slipped quickly inside closed the door and switched on the light the room was a considerable improvement on the one she had been given although furnished with the same regulation iron bedstead it was closecarpeted boasted a couple of armchairs and had a small chair with an oberleutnants uniform on it a large wardrobe and a chest of drawers with a bolstered belt gun and binoculars resting on its glass top mary locked the door withdrew the key crossed the room lifted the lower sash window and looked down she was she saw directly above the roof of the cablecar header station a very steeply downward sloping roof the upper edge of which was built into the castle wall itself she withdrew her head removed from her handbag a ball of string with a heavy bolt attached to one end laid it on the bed picked up the binoculars and took up station by the window shivering in the bitter night wind she adjusted the focus of the fieldglasses then traversed down the line of the aerial cables and then she had it dimly seen but unmistakable the squat black outline of the cablecar now halfway between the bottom and middle pylons swaying madly frighteningly across the sky in the high and gusting wind smith and schaffer lay stretched out on the roof clutching desperately to the suspension bracket the only anchorage available the roof was solidly coated with whitesheeted ice they could find no purchase anywhere for their feet and their bodies slid uncontrollably in all directions with the violent buffeting of the car beneath them the sheer physical strain on hands and arms and shoulders was even worse than smith had feared and the worst was yet to come schaffer twisted his head and peered downwards it was a dizzy vertiginous and frankly terrifying spectacle the entire valley below seemed to be swinging through a fortyfive degree arc one second he was looking at the line of pines that bordered the western slope of the valley then the floor of the valley rushed by beneath them and seconds later he was staring at the line of pines that swept up the eastern side of the valley he twisted his head upwards but that was no improvement the lights of the schloss adler careened wildly through the same dizzy arc it was like being on a combination of a rollercoaster big dipper and runaway ferris wheel with the notable exception schaffer thought bleakly that the coaster dipper and ferris wheel were provided with safety belts and other securing devices designed to prevent the occupant from parting company with his machine the wind howled its high and lonely threnody through the cables and the suspension bracket schaffer looked away screwed his eyes shut lowered his head between his outstretched arms and moaned still think the horse the worlds worst form of transport smith asked his lips were close to schaffers ear give me my boots and saddle schaffer said then even more despairingly oh no not again once more without any warning the moon had broken through flooding the two men in its pale cold light gauging the time when the strain on their arms was least they pulled the snow hoods far over their heads and tried to flatten themselves even more closely on to the roof in the schloss adler two people were watching the wild upward progress of the cablecar now brilliantly illuminated by the moon through marys fieldglasses two clearly distinguishable shapes of men could be seen stretched out on the cablecar roof for half a minute she kept the glasses trained on them then slowly turned away her eyes wide almost staring her face empty of expression fifty feet above her head a sentry with slung gun patrolling the battlements stopped and gazed down at the cablecar crawling up the valley but he didnt gaze for long although booted gauntleted and muffled to the ears he shook with the cold it was no night for idle spectating he looked away indifferently and resumed his brisk sentrygo indifference was a quality that was conspicuously lacking on top of the cablecar the cablecar was on the last lap now the section between the last pylon and the castle header station soon the moment of truth a minute from then smith thought and they could both well be lying broken and lifeless on the rocks two hundred feet below he twisted his head upwards the cold moon still sailed across a clear gap in the sky but was closing rapidly towards another bank of cloud the castle battlements with the header station at the base seemed almost vertically above his head so steeply was the car rising on this last section that the volcanic plug itself was now less than fourteen yards away his gaze followed the volcanic plug downwards till it readied its base down there on the slopes below patrolling guards and their dobermann pinchers were barely the size of beetles suits her doesnt it schaffer said suddenly harsh edges of strain buried in his voice and his face was tight and desperate a lovely name what are you talking about smith demanded heidi oh my god smith stared up at the rapidly closing header station her name is ethel you didnt have to tell me schaffer tried to sound aggrieved but it didnt quite come off he followed smiths upward gaze and after a long pause said very slowly jesus look at the slope of that goddamned roof ive been looking smith eased his knife from its sheath and made a quick grab at the suspension bracket as a particularly violent swing almost broke his grip with his other hand get your knife ready and for gods sake dont lose it the moon slid behind a black patch of cloud and the valley was flooded with darkness slowly carefully as the cablecar approached the header station and the swaying motion dampened down smith and schaffer eased their way to the after end of the car rose gingerly but swiftly to their feet and grabbed the cable with their free hands while their feet tried to find what precarious hold they could on the treacherously icesheathed roof the front of the car passed under the lip of the header station roof a moment later the suspension bracket followed and smith lunged forward and upwards flinging himself bodily on to the roof his right arm struck downwards and the knife blade pierced the coating of ice and imbedded itself firmly in the wood beneath less than a second later schaffer had landed beside him the downward arcing knife making contact at exactly the same instant as himself the blade broke off at the hilt schaffer opened his hand dropped the haft and clawed desperately at the ic the dragging nails ripped through the encrusting ice quite failing to hold him he reached his left hand to his mouth tore off the gauntlet and dug both hands in with all the strength that was in him he slowed but not enough his scrabbling toes failed to find any more purchase and he knew he was sliding out over the edge and that when he went the first thing to halt his fall would be the rockpile two hundred and fifty feet beneath at the base of the volcanic plug smith had been badly winded by his fall several seconds elapsed before he realised that schaffer wasnt where he should have been lying on the roof beside him he twisted round saw the white blur of schaffers strained and desperate face had a vague impression of schaffers eight fingernails scoring their way through the ice as his body already up to midthigh slid inexorably over the edge and brought his left hand flashing down with a speed and power that even in those circumstances made schaffer grunt in pain as the vicelike grip clamped over his right wrist for some seconds they lay like that spreadeagled and motionless on the sloping rope the lives of both dependent on the slim imbedded blade of smiths knife then schaffer urged by smiths quivering left arm began to inch his way slowly upwards thirty seconds later and he was level with smith this is a knife i have not an iceaxe smith said hoarsely wont take much more of this have you another knife schaffer shook his head momentarily speech was beyond him piton the same shake of the head your torch schaffer nodded reached under the cumbersome snowsmock with his left hand and eventually managed to wriggle his torch free unscrew the bottom smith said throw it away and the battery schaffer brought his left hand acrossto where his right was pinioned by smith removed base and battery flattened the now empty cylinder base a little reversed his grip and gouged the torch into the ice downwards and towards himself he moved his right hand and smith released his grip schaffer remained where he was smith smiled and said try holding me schaffer caught smiths left wrist tentatively his hand still hooked in readiness smith removed his hand from the haft of the knife schaffers imbedded torch held firm cautiously at first then with increasing confidence as the sharp blade cut through the protective sheathing of ice smith carved out a secure handhold in the wooden roof of the station passed his knife to schaffer wriggled out of his snowsmock undid a few turns of the knotted rope round his waist and secured the free end to schaffers belt he said with the knife and torch think you can make it can i make it schaffer tested both knife and torch and smiled a pretty strained effort but his first for some time after what ive been through well ever seen a monkey go up a coconut palm tree fifty feet above their heads mary withdrew from the window and laid the binoculars on the chest of drawers her hands shook and the metal of the binoculars rattled like castanets against the glass top she returned to the window and began to pay out the weighted string smith came up the last few feet of the sloping roof at the end of the rope caught schaffers hand stood upright on the flat inner section of the roof and at once began to unwind the rest of the knotted rope from his waist schaffer although the temperature was far below freezing wiped his brow like a man in a heatwave brother he mopped his brow some more if i can ever do you a favour like lending you a carfare smith grinned clapped his shoulder reached up into the gloom caught the weighted end of the suspended string and quickly bent the nylon on to it he gave two gentle tugs and the rope began to move upwards as mary hauled it in through the window smith waited until two more gentle return tugs indicated that the rope was securely fastened and began to climb he was halfway up to the window when the moon broke through in his alpenkorps uniform he was perfectly silhouetted against the gleaming white of the castle walls he hung there motionless not daring to move not so much as even daring to glance upwards or downwards lest the movement attract some hostile attention twentyfive feet below him schaffer peered cautiously over the edge of the header station roof the guards and dogs were still patrolling the area round the roof of the volcanic plug they had only to give one casual upwards glance and smiths discovery was inevitable then some hairprickling sixth sense made schaffer look sharply upwards and he became very still indeed the sentry another circuit of the battlements completed was standing with hands splayed out on the parapet gazing out over the valley perhaps watching the now dying flames from the burntout station he had to lower his eyes only a fraction and that was that slowly with his right hand schaffer brought up the luger with the long perforated silencer screwed to its muzzle and laid it in the best police fashion across his left wrist he had no doubt he could kill his man with one shot the only question was when best to do it how to weigh the balance of possibilities if he waited until the man sighted them he might give a warning shout or thrust himself back into cover before schaffer could kill him if he shot the sentry before he sighted them then there would be no question of either escape or warning but there was the possibility that the man might pitch forward over the battlements crash off the roof of the header station and fall into the valley below close by the patrolling men and dogs a possibility only schaffer decided not a probability the slamming effect of the luger shell would almost certainly knock him backwards off his feet schaffer had never before gunned down an unsuspecting man but he coldly prepared to do so now he lined up the luminous sight on the mans breastbone and began to squeeze the trigger the moon went behind a cloud slowly stiffly schaffer lowered his gun schaffer once again wiped sweat from his forehead he had the feeling that he wasnt through with browmopping for the night smith reached the window clambered over the sill gave the rope two tugs as a signal for schaffer to start climbing and passed into the room it was almost totally dark inside hed just time to make out the iron bedstead which had been dragged to the window as anchorage for the rope when a pair of arms wound tightly round his neck and someone started murmuring incoherently in his ear easy on easy on smith protested he was still breathing heavily and needed all the air he could get but summoned enough energy to bend and kiss her unprofessional conduct whats more but i wont report it this time she was still clinging to him silent now when lieutenant schaffer made his appearance dragging himself wearily over the sill and collapsing on the iron bedstead he was breathing very heavily indeed and had about him the air of one who has suffered much have they no elevators in this dump he demanded it took him two breaths to get the words out out of training smith said unsympathetically he crossed to the door and switched on the light hurriedly switched it off again damn get the rope in then pull the curtains this is the way they treated them in the roman galleys schaffer said bitterly but he had the rope inside and the curtains closed in ten seconds as smith was manoeuvring the bed back into its original position schaffer was stuffing the nylon into their canvas bag a bag which in addition to snowsuits and schmeissers contained some hand grenades and a stock of plastic explosives he had just finished tying the neck of the bag when a key scraped in the lock smith motioned mary to stay where she was as he moved quickly to take up position behind the door schaffer for all his alleged exhaustion had dropped flat to the floor behind the bed with all the speed and silence of a cat the door opened and a young oberleutnant strode into the room stopping short as he saw mary her hand to her mouth his face registered astonishment an astonishment almost immediately replaced by an anticipatory halfsmile as he stepped forward beyond the opened door smiths arm came down and the young officers eyes turned up in his head smith studied the plans of the castle given him by mary while schaffer trussed up the oberleutnant with the nylon gagged him with tape and shoved him jackknifed into the bottom of the cupboard for good measure he pulled the top of the bed against the door ready when you are boss thats now i have my bearings first left down the stairs third left the gold drawingroom where colonel kramer holds court complete with minstrels gallery whats a minstrels gallery schaffer enquired a gallery for minstrels then the next righthander takes us to the east wing down again second left telephone exchange why there schaffer asked weve already cut the lines not the ones between here and the barracks we havent want them to whistle up a regiment of alpenkorps he turned to mary helicopter still here it was when i arrived the helicopter schaffer showed his puzzlement what gives with the whirlybird then this gives with the whirlybird they could use it either to whip carnaby out of here they might just be nervous if they think were on the loose or they might use it to block our getaway if we get away theres that how are you on immobilising helicopters lieutenant schaffer your report states that you were an upandcoming racing driver and a very competent mechanic before they scraped the bottom of the barrel and dragged you in i volunteered schaffer said with dignity about the competence i dunno but give me a fourpound hammer and ill sure as little fishes immobilise anything from a bulldozer to a bicycle and without the fourpounder this is not a boilermakers convention i have been known to use finesse smith said to mary how can we get a sight of this machine just five paces that way she pointed to the door every passage window in the schloss adler opens on to the courtyard smith opened the door glanced up and down the passage and crossed to an opposite window schaffer was by his side the comings and goings of the moon made no difference to the state of illumination in the schloss adler courtyard two big overhead arc lamps burned by the heavilybarred entrance gates a third burned at the opposite end of the courtyard over the main doorway leading into the castle itself at a height of about ten feet four waterproof storm lamps were fastened to the east and west walls of the courtyard lights burned from a dozen windows on the east and northern sides and the brightest light of all came from an arclamp that had been rigged above the helicopter and under the temporary protection of a stretched tarpaulin a figure in green overalls and a highpeaked cap was working on the helicopters engine smith touched schaffers arm and they moved back into the room where mary was waiting closing the door behind them seems a straightforward operation schaffer said fixing it so that the chopper doesnt fly again i mean i cross to the main gates overpower the four men on guard strangle the four dobermann pinchers knock off two or three other characters armed characters who appear to be patrolling the place all the time overpower about twenty soldiers who appear to be drinking beer in some sort of canteen across the way dispose of the guy whos working on the engine and then immobilise the chopper i mean just immobilising the chopper itself wouldnt be anything really would it well think of something smith said soothingly ill bet you think of something schaffer said moodily thats what im afraid of times awasting we wont be needing those any more smith folded the plan handed it to mary then frowned as she put it in her bag you know better than that the lilliput it should be on your person not in the bag here he handed her the mauser hed taken from colonel weissner this in your bag hide the lilliput on you when i get to my room i will she said primly all those leering yankee lieutenants around schaffer said sadly thank heavens im a changed man his mind is set on higher things smith explained he glanced at his watch give us thirty minutes they slipped cautiously through the doorway then strode briskly and confidently along the passage making no attempt to conceal their presence the bag with the schmeissers rope grenades and explosives smith swung carelessly from one hand they passed a bespectacled soldier carrying a sheaf of papers and a girl carrying a laden tray neither of whom paid any attention to them they turned right at the end of the passage reached a circular flight of stairs and went down three floors until they came to the level of the courtyard a short broad passage with two doors on either side took them to the main door leading out to the courtyard smith opened the door and looked out the scene was very much as schaffer had feelingly described it with far too many armed guards and police dogs around for anyones peace of mind the overalled mechanic was still at work on the helicopters engine smith quietly closed the door and turned his attention to the nearest righthand door in the passage it was locked he said to schaffer keep an eye open at the end of the passage there schaffer went as soon as he was in position smith brought out skeleton keys the third key fitted and the door gave under his hand he signalled schaffer to return with the door closed and locked behind them they looked around the room a room faintly but for their purposes adequately lit by the backwash of light shining through the unsuited window from the courtyard it was quite apparently the firefighting hq of the castle the walls were hung with drums of rolled hoses asbestos suits helmets and fireaxes wheeled handpumps co cylinders and a variety of smaller cylinders for fighting oil and electrical fires took up much of the floor space ideal smith murmured couldnt be better schaffer agreed what are you talking about if we leave anyone in here smith explained hes unlikely to be discovered unless theres an actual outbreak of fire agreed so he took schaffer by the arm and led him to the window the lad working on the chopper there about your size wouldnt you say i wouldnt know schaffer said and if youve got in mind what i think you have in mind then i dont want to know either smith drew the shutters crossed to the door and switched on the overhead light you got any better ideas give me time he complained i cant give you what we havent got take your jacket off and keep your luger lined up on that door ill be back in a minute smith left closing but not locking the door behind him he passed through the outer doorway walked a few paces across the courtyard halted at the base of a set of steps leading up to the helicopter and looked up at the man working above him a tall rangy man with a thin intelligent face and a lugubrious expression on it if hed been working barehanded with metal tools in that freezing temperature smith thought hed have had a lugubrious expression on his face too you the pilot smith asked you wouldnt think so would you the overalled man said bitterly he laid down a spanner and blew on his hands back in tempelhof i have two mechanics for this machine one a farmhand from swabia the other a blacksmiths assistant from the harz if i want to keep alive i do my own mechanics what do you want not me reichsmarschall rosemeyer the phone the reichsmarschall the pilot was puzzled i was speaking to him less than fifteen minutes ago a call just came through from the chancellory in berlin it seems urgent smith let a slight note of impatience creep into his voice you better hurry through the main door there then the first on the right smith stood aside as the pilot clambered down looked casually around him a guard with a leashed dobermann was no more than twenty feet away but paying no attention to them with his pinched bluish face sunk deep in his upturned collar his hands thrust down into his greatcoat pockets and his frozen breath hanging heavily in the air he was too busy concentrating on his own miseries to have time to spare for ridiculous suspicions smith turned to follow the pilot through the main door unobtrusively unholstering his luger and gripping it by the barrel smith hadnt intended chopping down the pilot with his gun butt but was left with no option as soon as the pilot had passed through the side door and seen schaffers luger pointing at his chest from a distance of four feet his shoulders lifted the preliminary smith knew not to violence or resistance but to a shout for help schaffer caught him as he pitched forward and lowered him to the floor quickly they unzipped the overall from the unconscious man bound and gagged him and left him lying in a corner the overall was hardly a perfect fit for schaffer but then overalls are rarely a perfect fit for anybody schaffer switched the pilots hat for his own pulled the peak low over his eyes and left smith switched off the light unshuttered the window raised the lower sash and stood luger in hand just far enough back from the window so as not to be seen from outside schaffer was already climbing the steps up to the helicopter the guard was now only feet from the base of the ladder hed his hands out of his pockets now and was flailing his arms across his shoulders in an attempt to keep warm thirty seconds later schaffer climbed down the ladder again carrying some pieces of equipment in his left hand he reached the ground lifted the piece of equipment for a closer inspection shook his head in disgust lifted his right hand in a vague halfgreeting to the uncaring german guard and headed for the main door again by the time he reached the firefighting room smith had the window shuttered again and the light on that was quick smith said approvingly fear lent him wings as the saying goes schaffer said sourly im always quick when im nervous did you see the size of the teeth in that great slavering monster out there he held up the piece of equipment for inspection dropped it to the floor and brought his heel down on it distributor cap ill bet they havent another in bavaria not for that engine and now i suppose you want me to go and impersonate the telephone operator no we dont want to exhaust all your thespian stamina my what schaffer asked suspiciously that sounds kinda like a nasty crack to me your acting resources the only other impersonation youll be called to make tonight is that of lieutenant schaffer oss the innocent american abroad that shouldnt be too difficult schaffer said bitterly he draped the overalls hed just removed over the unconscious pilot a cold night anyway the telephone exchange soon but id like to check first how far theyve got with old carnabyjones lets take a look two floors higher up and midway along the central passage smith stopped outside a doorway at a nod from him schaffer reached for a light switch except for a faint glow of light at either end the passage was now completely dark smith laid a gentle hand on the doorknob and quietly eased the door open fifteen inches no more both men swiftly slid through the narrow gap smith quickly and softly closing the door to again the room if so enormous a chamber could be called a room must have been at least seventy feet long by thirty wide the farther end of the room was brightly and warmly lit by three large chandeliers comparatively the end of the room where smith and schaffer stood was shrouded in near darkness they stood not on the floor but on a platform some dozen feet above the floor it was a massive and grotesquely carved oaken minstrels gallery which completely spanned the thirtyfoot width of that end and ran perhaps a quarter of the way down both the longer sides of the room there were rows of wooden benches an organ on one side of the door through which they had just passed a battery of organ pipes on the other whoever had built that place had obviously liked the organ and choirsinging or maybe he just thought he did from the centre of the front of the gallery opposite the rear door a flight of steps with intricately scrolled wooden banisters led down to what was very obviously the gold drawingroom it was aptly named smith thought everything in it was gold or golden or gilt the enormous walltowall carpet was deep gold in colour the thickness of the pile would have turned a polar bear green with envy the heavy baroque furniture all twisted snakes and gargoyles heads was gilt the huge couches and chairs covered in a dusty gold lame the chandeliers were gilded and above the enormous white and giltplated fireplace in which a crackling pine log fire burned hung an almost equally enormous white and giltplated mirror the great heavy curtains could have been made from beaten gold the ceilinghigh oak panelling was a mistake it continued to look obstinately like oak panelling maybe the original covering gold paint had worn off all in all smith reflected it was a room only a mad bavarian monarch could have conceived of far less lived in three men were seated comfortably round the great fire to all appearances having an amicable discussion over afterdinner coffee and brandy which was being served to them from almost inevitably a golden trolley by annemarie annemarie like the panelling was a disappointment instead of a gold lame dress she wore a long white silk sheath gown which admittedly went very well with her blonde colouring and snowtan she looked as if she were about to leave for the opera the man with his back to him smith had never seen before but because he immediately recognised who the other men were knew who this man must be colonel paul kramer deputy chief of the german secret service regarded by mi as having the most brilliant and formidable brain in german intelligence the man to watch smith knew the man to fear it was said of kramer that he never made the same mistake twice and that no one could remember when hed last made a mistake for the first time as smith watched colonel kramer stirred poured some more brandy from a napoleon bottle by his side and looked first at the man on his left a tall ageing but still goodlooking man in the uniform of a reichsmarschall of the wehrmacht at that moment wearing a very glum expression on his face then at the man seated opposite an irongreyhaired and very distinguished looking character in the uniform of a lieutenant general of the us army without a comptometer to hand it was difficult to say which of the two generals was wearing the more decorations kramer sipped his brandy and said wearily you make things very difficult for me general carnaby very very difficult indeed the difficulties are of your own making my dear kramer cartwright jones said easily yours and general rosemeyers here there is no difficulty he turned to annemarie and smiled if i might have some more of that excellent brandy my dear my word weve nothing like this in shaef marooned in your alpine redoubt or not you people know how to look after yourselves in the gloom at the back of the minstrels gallery schaffer nudged smith with his elbow what gives with old carnabyjones knocking back the napoleon then he asked in a low indignant murmur why isnt he being turned on a spit or having the french fits coming out of scopolamine sssh smiths nudge carried a great deal more weight and authority than schaffers had done jones smiled his thanks as annemarie poured him some more brandy sipped from the glass sighed in satisfaction and continued or have you forgotten general rosemeyer that germany is also a signatory to the hague conventions i havent forgotten rosemeyer said uncomfortably and if i had my way general my hands are tied i have my orders from berlin and you can tell berlin all theyre entitled to know jones said easily i am general lieutenant general george camby united states army and chief coordinator of planning for the second front rosemeyer added morosely the second front jones asked with interest whats that rosemeyer said heavily and with earnest gravity general ive done all i can you must believe me for thirtysix hours now ive held off berlin ive persuaded ive tried to persuade the high command that the mere fact of your capture will compel the allies to alter all their invasion plans but this it seems is not enough for the last time may i request general george carnaby jones said calmly united states army i expected nothing else rosemeyer admitted tiredly how could i expect anything else from a senior army officer im afraid the matter is now in colonel kramers hands jones sipped some more brandy and eyed kramer thoughtfully the colonel doesnt seem very happy about it either im not kramer said but the matter is out of my hands too also have my orders annemarie will attend to the rest of it this charming young lady jones was politely incredulous a maestro of the thumbscrew of the hypodermic syringe kramer said shortly she used to be a trained nurse a bell rang and kramer picked up a phone by his side yes ah they have of course been searched very good now he looked across at jones well well well some interesting company coming up general very interesting indeed parachutists a rescue team for you im sure youll be delighted to meet one another i really cant imagine what youre talking about jones said idly the rescue team weve seen before smith murmured to schaffer and no doubt well be renewing old acquaintances before long come on what now schaffer jerked an urgent thumb in the direction of jones just when theyre going to get to work on him out of your social depth lieutenant smith whispered theyre civilised first they finish the brandy then the works its like i said schaffer said mournfully im from montana the two men left as quietly as they had come and as quietly closed the door behind them against the loom of light at either end of the corridor they could see that the passageway was clear smith switched on the light they walked briskly along the passage dropped down a flight of stairs turned left and halted outside a doorway which bore above it the legend telefon zentrale telephone exchange schaffer said smith shook his head in admiration put his ear to the door dropped to one knee peered through the keyhole and while still in that position softly tried the handle whatever slight sound he made was masked by the muffled sound of a voice speaking over a telephone the door was locked smith slowly released the handle straightened and shook his head suspicious bunch of devils schaffer said sourly the skeletons the operator would hear us next door next door wasnt locked the door gave before smiths pressure on the handle the room beyond was in total darkness and appeared to be empty moment bitte a cold voice said behind them quickly but not too quickly smith and schaffer turned round a few feet away stood a soldier levelled carbine in his hand his eyes moving in active suspicion from the two men to the kitbag in smiths hands smith glared at the man raised an imperative forefinger to his lips dammkopf smiths voice was a low furious whisper through clenched teeth silenz englander he turned away impatiently and peered tensely through the partlyopened doorway again he held up an imperious hand that commanded silence after a few more seconds he straightened lips compressed looked significantly at schaffer and moved slightly to one side schaffer took his position and started peering in turn curiosity smith could see was replacing suspicion in the soldiers face schaffer straightened and said softly what in gods name do we do i dont know smith said in a worried whisper colonel kramer told me he wanted them alive but what is it the soldier demanded in a voice as low as their own with the mention of colonel kramer the last of his suspicions had gone who is it you still here smith said irritably all right go on have a look but be quick the soldier his face and eyes now alight with intense curiosity and what might have been dreams of rapid promotion moved forward on tiptoe as schaffer courteously stepped to one side to let him see a pair of lugers grinding simultaneously into both temples effectively put an end to any idea of rapid military advancement that he might briefly have entertained he was propelled stumbling into the room and by the time hed picked himself up and turned round the door was closed the light on and both pistols lined at his head those are silencers you see on our guns smith said quietly no heroics no shooting dying for the fatherland is one thing dying uselessly for no reason at all is another and very stupid thing dont you agree the soldier looked at them calculated his chances accepted the fact that he had none and nodded schaffer produced a length of rope and said you may be overeager son but youre no fool lie down with your hands behind your back the room smith saw was small and lined with metal shelves and filing cabinets some sort of storage room for office records the chances of anyone coming along werent high and it was anyway a chance they had to take he waited till schaffer had bound and gagged the prisoner put his luger away helped schaffer to bind the man to two of the metal poles supporting the shelves turned to the window slid up the lower sash and peered out the valley to the north stretched out before him the lights of the village and the smouldering embers of the railway station visible through very gently falling snow smith looked to his right the lighted window of the telephone exchange was only a few feet away from the window a heavy leadsheathed cable attached to a wire almost equally as heavy stretched down the castle wall into the darkness that the one schaffer was by his side now thats the one lets have the rope smith eased his legs into a double bowline wriggled over the windowsill and cautiously lowered himself to the full extent of his arms while schaffer standing by the window with the rope belayed round one of the stanchions of the shelving took the strain smith released his grip on the sill and was lowered jerkily by schaffer till he was about ten or twelve feet down then using a free hand and both feet to fend himself off from the wall he began to swing himself in a pendulum arc across the face of the castle an assist from schaffer up above adding momentum to his swing on the fifth swing the fingers of his left hand hooked round the lead cable and wire as schaffer eased off tension on the rope smith got both hands round the cable and quickly climbed up the few feet to the window above he was almost certain that the lead cable he had in his hands was the telephone outlet but only almost he had no desire to slice the blade of his knife through highpowered electricity supply lines he hitched a wary eye over the windowsill saw that the telephone operator his back almost directly to him was talking animatedly on the phone lifted himself another six indies observed a cable of what appeared to be exactly similar dimensions to the one he was holding running along the skirtingboard to some point behind the exchange and then not reappearing again he lowered himself a couple of feet grasped cable and wire firmly with his left hand inserted the point of his knife between cable and wire a few inches below that and started sawing a dozen powerful sawcuts and he was through he replaced the knife in its sheath hoisted himself up again and had another look through the window the operator was still animated but this time not with his voice but with a hand which he was using furiously to crank a handle at the side of the exchange after a few seconds of this profitless exercise he gave up and just sat there staring at the switchboard and shaking his head in bafflement smith made a signal to schaffer released his grip on the cable and swung back across the castle wall mary glanced at her watch for the tenth time in less than as many minutes stubbed out the halfcigarette shed been nervously smoking rose from her chair opened her handbag checked that the safety catch of the mauser inside was in the off position closed the bag and crossed the room she had just turned the handle and begun to open the door when knuckles rapped on the outside she hesitated glanced at the bag in her hand and looked round almost wildly to see where she could dispose of it but it was too late to dispose of any thing the door opened and a cheerfully smiling von brauchitsch stood framed in the doorway ah fraulein he glanced at the bag and smiled again lucky me just in time to escort you wherever youre going to escort me she broke off and smiled my business is of no consequence it can wait you wanted to see me captain naturally what about what about she says about nothing thats what unless you call yourself nothing just to see you is that a crime the prettiest girl weve seen he smiled again this man who was always smiling and took her arm come a little bavarian hospitality coffee we have an armoury thats been converted into the finest kaffeestabe but but my duties mary said uncertainly i must see the colonels secretary that one let her wait there was a marked lack of cordiality in von brauchitschs voice you and i have a lot to talk about we have it was impossible to resist the infectious smile not to reply in kind such as dusseldorf dusseldorf of course thats my home town too your home town too she smiled again and gave his arm the briefest of squeezes how small a world that will be nice she wondered vaguely as she walked along how one could smile and smile and inside feel as chilled as the tomb for the second time in fifteen minutes smith and schaffer stopped at the doorway outside the gold rooms minstrels gallery switched out the passage light paused listened then passed silently inside this time however smith reached through the crack of the almost closed door and switched the light back on again he did not expect to be using that door again that night or any other night and he had no wish to raise any eyebrows however millimetric the raising survival was a matter of the infinitely careful consideration of all possible dangers no matter how remote that possibility might at times appear this time smith and schaffer did not remain at the back of the minstrels gallery they moved slowly to the front till they had come to the head of the broad flight of stairs leading down to the floor of the gold room and then sat down on the front oaken benches one on each side of the gallerys passageway they were still shrouded in deep gloom completely invisible from below colonel kramers stock of vsop napoleon brandy was certainly taking a beating that night smith reflected the colonel reichsmarschall rosemeyer jones and annemarie had been joined by three others carraciola thomas and christiansen those last three were no longer manacled and under heavy guard on the contrary there was no sign of any guard and the three men were sitting deeply relaxed and side by side on one of the massive gold lamecovered couches glasses of brandy and no small ones at that in their hands even annemarie now held a glass in her hand it appeared to be an occasion for a celebration of some note kramer lifted his glass towards the three men seated in the couch your health gentlemen your very good health he turned to the reichsmarschall three of the best in europe sir i suppose they are necessary rosemeyer said in resigned distaste at least their courage is beyond dispute your health gentlemen your health gentlemen jones said bitterly he sat forward in his chair and hurled his glass into the fire the glass shattered and there was a momentary tongue of flame as the brandy ignited thats how i drink the health of double agents schaffer leaned across the passageway and whispered i thought you said he couldnt act nobodys ever paid him twentyfive thousand bucks a night before smith said sardonically tut tut general best venetian glass kramer shook his head deprecatingly then smiled but an understandable fit of pique when your heroic rescuers turn out to be well birds of a different feather double agents in his contempt jones almost spat out the words kramer smiled again tolerantly and turned to the three men on the couch and the return trip gentlemen as well organised as your outward journey thats about the one thing the closemouthed soandso told us carraciola said with some bitterness a mosquito bomber is to come to pick us up salen a little village north of frauenfeld in switzerland theres a little civilian airfield just to the north of salen schaffer bent across the passage again and said in an admiring whisper you really are a fearful liar so salen it is kramer was saying we know all about it the swiss are very good at looking the wrong way when it suits them but for reasons of our own we find it convenient not to protest too much odd things happen at salen however a little message to london arrange pickup times and so forth then a helicopter to the border so much easier than walking gentlemen a rubber dinghy for the rhine and then a short walk youll be back in whitehall reporting general carnabys transfer to berlin before you know it back in london thomas shook his head in slow emphasis not on your nelly colonel with smith and that yank still at large what happens if they find out whats really happening what happens if they remain at large what happens if they get a message through to london what do you take us for kramer said tiredly you will also of course be reporting the unfortunate demise of your leader as soon as we located that stillwarm radio set in the left luggage office we put on bloodhounds from the barracks your precious major smith was the last man to handle that set and he left a pretty clear trail the hounds traced him along the east side of the village as far as a garage and then up to the lower station ofthe lujtseilbabn the cablecar thomas was frankly disbelieving the cablecar our major smith is either a very foolhardy or a very dangerous man i must confess i know nothing of him and there at the lower station the hounds completely lost the scent the handlers circled the station with the hounds and then brought them into the cablecar itself but the trail was cold our quarry appeared to have vanished into thin air it was then that one of the searchers had the original idea of examining the thin air so to speak he climbed up and examined the roof of the lower station surprise surprise unmistakable signs in the snow and ice that two men had been up there before him from that it was only a logical step to examine the roof of the cablecar itself and sure enough theyre inside christiansen exclaimed and wont get out again colonel kramer leaned back comfortably in his chair have no fear gentlemen every exit is blocked including the header station weve doubled the guards outside and the rest have just begun to carry out a floor to floor search in the gloom of the minstrels gallery smith and schaffer exchanged thoughtful glances i dont know thomas said uneasily hes a resourceful devil kramer held up a hand fifteen minutes i guarantee it he shifted his glance to jones i dont pretend to look forward to this general but shall we get on with your ah medication jones glared at carraciola christiansen and thomas and said very slowly and distinctly you bloody swine against all my principles general carnaby rosemeyer said uncomfortably but if we could only dispense with force principles you make me sick jones stood up and made a strangled noise in his throat the hell with you all the hague conventions principles officers and gentlemen of the third woody reich he stripped off his uniform jacket rolled up a sleeve and sat down again there was a brief and uncomfortable silence then kramer nodded to annemarie who put down her glass and moved off to a side door leading off the gold drawingroom it was obvious to everyone that annemarie wasnt feeling in the least uncomfortable the halfsmile on her face was as near to that of pleasurable anticipation as she could permit herself in the presence of rosemeyer and kramer again smith and schaffer exchanged glances no longer thoughtful glances but the glances of men who know what they have to do and are committed to doing it carefully silently they eased themselves up from the choirstalls adjusted the straps of their shoulderslung schmeissers until the machinepistols were in the horizontal position then started slowly down the stairs well apart and as close as possible to their respective banisters to minimise the danger of creaking treads they were halfday down just beginning to emerge from the dark gloom of the gallery when annemarie reentered the room she was carrying a small stainless steel tray on the tray were a glass beaker a phial containing some colourless liquid and a hypodermic syringe she set the tray down on an occasional table close to jones and broke the phial into the narrow beaker smith and schaffer had reached the foot of the stairs and were now advancing towards the group round the fireplace they had now completely emerged from the shadows and were in full view of anyone who cared to turn his head but no one cared to turn his head every seated person in the drawingroom was engrossed in the scene before him watching in varying degrees of willing or unwilling fascination as annemarie carefully filled the hypodermic syringe and held it up to the light to examine it smith and schaffer continued to advance their footfalls soundless on the luxuriously deep pile of the gold carpet carefully professionally but with the trace of the smile still on her lips annemarie swabbed an area of joness forearm with cotton wool soaked in alcohol and then as the watchers unconsciously bent forward in their seats picked up joness wrist in one hand and the hypodermic in the other the hypodermic hovered over the swabbed area as she located the vein she wanted just a waste of good scopolamine my dear smith said you wont get anything out of him there was a moments frozen and incredulous stillness the hypodermic syringe fell soundlessly to the floor then everyone whirled round to stare at the two advancing figures carbines moving gently from side to side predictably colonel kramer was the first to recover and react almost imperceptibly his hand began to drift to a button on a panel beside his chair that button colonel smith said conversationally slowly reluctantly kramers hand retreated from the button on the other hand smith went on cordially why not by all means if you wish kramer glanced at him in narroweyed and puzzled suspicion you will notice colonel smith continued by way of explanation that my gun is not pointing at you it is pointed at him he swung his gun to cover carraciola at him the gun moved to thomas at him it covered christiansen and at him smith swung round abruptly and ground the muzzle of the schmeisser into schaffers ribs drop that gun now drop the gun schaffer stared at him in shock and baffled consternation what in the name of god smith stepped swiftly forward and without altering his grip on his gun lifted the barrel sharply upwards and drove the butt of the schmeisser into schaffers stomach schaffer grunted in agony doubled forward with both hands clutched over his midriff then seconds later obviously in great pain began to straighten slowly glaring at smith the dark eyes mad in his face he slipped the shoulder strap and the schmeisser fell to the carpet sit there with the muzzle of his gun smith gestured to a chair halfway between rosemeyers and the couch where the three men were sitting schaffer said slowly painfully you goddamned lousy dirty doublecrossing thats what they all say youre not even original the contempt in smiths voice gave way to menace that chair schaffer schaffer lowered himself with difficulty into his chair rubbed his solar plexus and said you if i live to be a hundred if you live to be a hundred youll do nothing smith said contemptuously in your own idiom schaffer youre a punk and a pretty secondrate one at that he settled himself comfortably in a chair beside colonel kramer a simpleminded american he explained carelessly had him along for local colour i see kramer said it was obvious that he did not see he went on uncertainly if we might have an explanation smith waved him negligently to silence all in good time my dear kramer all in good time as i was saying my dear annemarie how did you know her name was annemarie kramer asked sharply smith smiled enigmatically ignored him completely and scopolamine will do as youre all aware is to reveal the truth about our friend here which is that he is not lieutenant general george carnaby chief coordinator of planning for the second front but a certain cartwright jones an american actor being paid precisely twentyfive thousand dollars to impersonate general carnaby he looked over to jones and bowed my congratulations mr jones a very creditable performance pity youll have to spend the rest of the war in a concentration camp kramer and rosemeyer were on their feet the others leaning far forward on the couch an almost exactly identical expression of disbelief showing in every face if cartwright jones had been earths first visitor from outer space he couldnt possibly have been the object of more incredulous consternation well well well smith said with interest surprise surprise surprise he tapped kramer on the arm and gestured in the direction of carraciola thomas and christiansen odd wouldnt you say kramer they seem just as astonished as you are is this true rosemeyer demanded hoarsely of jones what he says do you deny in a voice that was no more than a whisper jones said how how in gods name who are you sir a stranger in the night smith waved a hand dropped in in the passing you might say maybe the allies will let you have that twentyfive thousand after the war i wouldnt bank on it though if international kw allows you to shoot a captured enemy soldier dressed as a civilian maybe the opposite holds good too smith stretched and politely patted a yawn to extinction and now annemarie if i could with your permission my dear kramer have a glass of that excellent napoleon clinging to the roofs of cablecars works the devil with my circulation the girl hesitated looked at kramer and rosemeyer found neither encouragement nor discouragement shrugged poured a glass and handed it to smith who sniffed the bouquet approvingly drank a little and bowed again to jones my congratulations sir you are a connoisseur he sipped again turned to kramer and said sadly to think you have been wasting such excellent liquor on enemies of the third reich dont listen to him colonel kramer dont listen to him carraciola shouted wildly its a bluff hes just trying smith lined up his gun on carraciolas chest and said softly keep quiet or ill make you quiet you damned traitor youll have your chance and well see whos bluffing he lowered his gun to his knees and went on tiredly colonel kramer i dont fancy talking and having to keep a gun on this unlovely trio all the time have you a guard you can trust a man who wont talk afterwards i mean he sat back in his chair sipped his brandy and ignored the malevolent stares from his four erstwhile colleagues kramer looked at him for a very long moment then nodded thoughtfully and reached for a phone the armoury now converted into a kafeestube of the schloss adler was very much in keeping with the remainder of the castle something out of a medieval dream or nightmare according to how individual tastes and inclinations lay it was a large darklypanelled stoneflagged room with enormous adzecut smokeblackened beams and walls behung with ancient and rusty suits of armour ancient and rusty weapons of all kinds and scores of armorial bearings some of which could have been genuine threesided halfbooths lined the walls and halfadozen slabtopped monastery refectory tables flanked by massive oak benches paralleled the shorter axis of the room the oil lamps suspended by iron chains from the ceiling were turned low lending the atmosphere in the armoury an air of intimacy or brooding menace according to ones original mood on entering there was no doubt in marys mind as to its effect upon her her gaze followed halfadozen heavily armed and jackbooted men who were just leaving the armoury then came back reluctantly to the man sitting close beside her in the corner booth well what did i tell you von brauchitsch said expansively coffee to match the surroundings coffee to match the surroundings mary thought would have tasted of hemlock she said what did those men want they seemed to be looking for someone forget them concentrate on von brauchitsch but you spoke to them what did they want they say there are spies in the castle von brauchitsch threw his head back laughed and spread his hands palms up imagine spies in the schloss adler the gestapo hq they must have flown in on their broomsticks the military commandant is an old woman he has spies in about once a week now what was i saying about dusseldorf he broke off glancing at her empty coffee cup my apologies my dear fraulein come more coffee no really i must go von brauchitsch laughed again and put his hand on hers go where there is nowhere to go inside the schloss adler nonsense nonsense he turned in his seat and called fraulein two more coffees and with schnapps this time while he was ordering mary glanced quickly at her watch and a momentary expression of desperation crossed her face but by the time von brauchitsch turned back she was smiling sweetly at him she said you were saying about dusseldorf the company in the gold drawingroom had now been increased by one a tall coldfaced and hardeyed sergeant who held a carbine cradled in a pair of strong and very capable looking hands he was standing behind the couch on which carraciola thomas and christiansen were seated and he was giving them his entire attention apart from a frequent sideways glance at schaffer he had about him a reassuring air of competence a very much more civilised arrangement smith said approvingly he rose leaving his schmeisser lying on the floor crossed to the brandy decanter on the sideboard poured himself another drink and made his way back to the fireplace where he placed his glass on the mantelpiece this will take but minutes only smith said in a soft and ominous voice annemarie bring in three more capsules of scopolamine he smiled at her and i neednt remind you to bring the hypodermics colonel kramer carraciola said desperately this is madness are you going to allow guard smiths voice was harsh if that man talks again silence him the guard jabbed his carbine muzzle none too lightly into carraciolas back carraciola subsided fuming his fists clenched till the ivory showed what do you take reichsmarschall rosemeyer and colonel kramer for smith demanded cuttingly credulous fools little children imbeciles of your own calibre who imagine you can get away with a cretinous masquerade of this nature the scopolamine will be used after i have established my own bonafides and after i have disproved yours annemarie annemarie smiled and marched away it was not every night that she got the chance to administer three injections of scopolamine then she stopped and turned eyebrows raised in interrogation as smith called her name again one moment fraulein smith brandy glass in hand was staring unseeingly into the middle distance and the watchers could see a slow smile coming to his face a smile obviously heralding the birth of a new idea and one that pleased him very much of course of course smith said softly and bring three notebooks will you my dear three notebooks colonel kramers tone was neutral his eyes watchful three capsules you give the impression that we have four enemies of the reich here only three enemies that matter smith said in weary patience the american the fact that he neither bothered to glance at schaffer nor even permit a trace of contempt to creep into his voice showed unmistakably his opinion of the american he doesnt even know what day of the week it is now then he picked up a cigar from an inlaid marquetry box lit it and sipped some more brandy lets be fair and establish my bonafides first pointers first then proof in the best judicial fashion first why did i invite another guard in and lay down my own gun he paused and went on sarcastically of course because i wanted to increase the odds against myself secondly why didnt ikill colonel weissner and his men when i had them at my mercy if that is im an enemy of the third reich earlier this evening i had some difficulty i might tell you in restraining our fireeating young american here from turning himself into a oneman firing squad very aggressivehe was ill damned well tell you why carraciola said viciously because you knew the shots would be heard smith sighed lifted the flap of his jacket produced an automatic and fired the sound of the impact of the bullet thudding into the couch inches from carraciolas shoulder completely blanketed the soft plop made by the automatic itself smith carelessly threw the silenced luger into a nearby empty chair and smiled quizzically at carraciola didnt know i had that did you i didnt kill colonel weissner because german does not kill german you are german kramers eyes were still watchful but the tone perhaps a shade less neutral johann schmidt at your service this with a little bow and click of the heels captain john smith of the black watch from the rhineland by your accent heidelberg but that is my home town indeed smith smiled his interest then i think we have a mutual friend momentarily a faraway look came to kramers eyes and he said softly apparently apropos of nothing the columns of charlemagne ah and the fountain in the courtyard of the dear old friedrichsbau smith said nostalgically he glanced at kramer and the nostalgia gave way to a pseudomournful reproof how could you my dear colonel to proceed why third point i think why did i stage this elaborate car accident because i knew those three impostors wouldnt dare come into the open until they thought i was dead anyway if i were the impostor would i have come back when i knew the game was up anyway to come back for what he smiled wearily and nodded at jones to rescue another impostor kramer said thoughtfully i must say im rather beginning to look forward to hearing what our three friends here have to say ill tell you now what ive bloody well got to say christiansen was on his feet ignoring the guards gun his voice shaking with fury hes fooling you hes fooling all of us hes a damned liar and youre too damned stupid to see the wool over your eyes a tissue of lies from beginning to end that will do kramers hand was up his eyes bleak his tone icy you condemn yourselves from your own mouths every statement made so far by this officer is demonstrably true sergeant hartmann this to the guard with the carbine if any of those men speak again do you think you could silence him without silencing him permanently hartmann produced a small wovenleather truncheon from his tunic and slipped the looped thong over his wrist you know i can herr colonel good pray continue captain schmidt thank you i hadnt finished smith felt like pouring himself another brandy a celebration brandy or alternatively pinning a medal on christiansen for having so unerringly if unwittingly exposed the chink in kramers armour a wounded intellectual vanity the lacerated professional pride of a brilliant man being reminded of his capacity for being duped by one of those who had already duped him for the same excellent reason i came here by the roof of the cablecar theyd never have come into the open if theyd known i was here and alive incidentally kramer hasnt it occurred to you that its impossible to enter the schloss adler from the roof of the header station without the assistance of a rope and someone inside damnation coming so soon after christiansens reminder of his fallibility smiths question left kramers selfconfidence badly shaken i never thought von brauchitsch smith said carelessly he had his orders direct from berlin he placed his glass on the mantelpiece walked across and stood before the three spies tell me how did know jones was an impostor why did you not know he was one and if im not what i claim to be then what in gods name am i doing here at all perhaps you would like to explain that the three men glared up at him in baleful silence perhaps they would indeed kramer said heavily he came and stood by smith staring down at the three men with an oddly expressionless gaze that was more disturbing than any show of anger could ever have been after another and longer silence he said captain schmidt this has gone far enough not yet i require no more kramer persisted i promised you proof those were but the pointers a proof to satisfy the deputy chief of the german secret service and that proof is in three parts a yes or no colonel kramer if you please do you or do you not know the name of our top man in britain kramer nodded then suppose we ask them the three men on the couch looked at each other then at smith they looked in silence thomas licked dry lips a movement that did not go unnoticed by kramer smith produced a small red notebook from his tunic pocket removed a rubber band tore out the central page then carefully replaced the band on the book and the book in his pocket he wrote something on the page and handed it to kramer who glanced at it and nodded smith took the paper from him walked across to the fire and burned it now then smith said you have here in the schloss adler the most powerful radio transmitter in central europe you are singularly wellinformed captain schmidt kramer said wryly smith i live smith i breathe smith i am smith put a radiotelephone call through to fieldmarshal kesselrings hq in northern italy ask for his chief of military intelligence kramer said softly the mutual friend you mentioned an old alumnus of heidelberg university smith nodded colonel wilhelm wilner he smiled williwilli you know that then it will not be necessary to call him admiral canaris would like you to and you know my chief too kramers voice was even softer my selfesteem urges me to say that i do but modesty and the truth compels me to admit i dont smith said disarmingly i just work for him im convinced already convinced beyond all doubt rosemeyer said but do as he says colonel kramer did as he was told he put a call through to the radio room hung up and waited patiently smith lay back in his armchair brandy in one hand cigar in the other the picture of relaxed confidence if schaffer and the three men on the couch beside him were either relaxed or confident they entirely failed to show it behind them their guard watched his four charges hopefully as if eager to show his expertise with a blackjack if either rosemeyer or jones were thinking any thoughts at all those thoughts didnt break through to the surface annemarie not quite knowing what was going on hovered around indecisively a tentative smile of anticipation still on her face she was the only person who moved during the period of waiting and that only because smith crooked a finger at her and indicated his empty brandy glass so complete was the ascendancy he had achieved that she obeyed the unspoken command without hesitation and brought back a very generous measure of brandy which she set down by his sidetable to the accompaniment of a winning smile smith gave her a winning smile in return but no one spoke not once during that seemingly interminable wait the phone bell rang kramer lifted it and after a few preliminary exchanges presumably with operators said colonel wilhelm wilner my dear friend williwilli how are you after the introductory courtesies were over kramer said we have an agent here who claims to know you a captain john smith have you ever ah so you know him good good a pause then he continued could you describe him he listened intently looking at smith as a voice crackled over the receiver suddenly he beckoned to smith who rose and crossed over to where kramer was sitting your left hand kramer said to smith took it in his own then spoke into the phone yes the tip of the little finger is missing and the right forearm has what smith bared his right forearm without being told yes yes two parallel scars three centimetres apart whats that tell him hes a traitor and tell him hes a renegade smith smiled and youre a renegade kramer said on the phone chambertin you say ah thank you thank you goodbye my old friend he replaced the receiver we both prefer french wine smith said apologetically and by way of explanation our top double agent in the mediterranean kramer said wonderingly and id never even heard of you maybe thats why he is what he is rosemeyer said dryly ive been lucky smith shrugged then said briskly well then my credentials impeccable kramer said my god theyre impeccable so smith said grimly now for our friends credentials as you know christiansen thomas and carraciola the real christiansen thomas and carraciola while working for what in gods name are you talking about christiansen shouted he was on his feet his face suffused with uncontrollable anger the real christiansen his eyes turned up as hartmanns blackjack caught him behind the ear and he sagged to the floor he was warned kramer said grimly you didnt hit him too hard sergeant a twominute tap hartmann said reassuringly good i think you may now proceed without interruption my dear schmidt smith smith corrected him as i was saying our real agents while working for the british counterespionage have not only been responsible for the deep infiltration of the german secret service into the british espionage network in france and the low countries but have also set up an excellent chain of spies in england a most successful ring as admiral canaris well knows its not my territory kramer said but that of course i know smith said coldly to your feet you impostors and sit at the table there sergeant lend a hand to that man on the floor there he appears to be coming round their faces baffled and uncomprehending carraciola and thomas made their way towards the table and sat down where they were shortly joined by a very shaky and sicklooking christiansen the sergeant remained by him just long enough to ensure that he didnt fall off his chair then took three paces back and covered them all with his carbine again from the other side of the table smith flung down in front of the three men the little notebooks that annemarie had brought then he produced his own elasticbanded notebook from his pocket and laid it on the small table beside kramer if they are who they claim to be smith said quietly it would be reasonable would it not my dear kramer to expect them to be able to write the names and the addresses or contacts of our agents in england and of the british agents who have been supplanted on the continent by our men he paused significantly and then compare their lists with the genuine one in my book there it would indeed kramer said slowly proof at one stroke masterly my dear captain schmidt smith i mean he smiled almost wanly im afraid im not myself tonight but tell me captain he touched the banded notebook by his side this list of agents i mean carrying it around on your person does this not contravene every rule we have of course it does rules can only be broken by the man who made them you think that even i would dare without his authority admiral walter canaris will be in his berlin office now smith nodded towards the telephone what do you take me for kramer smiled and turned to the three men at the table well you heard theres something terribly far wrong carraciola began despairingly there is indeed kramer interrupted bleakly i dont doubt smiths bonafides carraciola was almost in anguish now not any more but theres been some ghastly mistake you are the ones who have made it smith said curtly write kramer commanded sergeant hartmann sergeant hartmann stepped forward his leatherthonged blackjack at the ready the three men bent their heads and wrote the armoury was almost deserted now some time previously a couple of sergeants had entered moved around among the coffee tables and taken at least a score of grumbling men away for unspecified duties mary did not have to guess at what those unspecified duties might be she glanced secretly at her watch for what must have been the twentieth time rubbed her forehead wearily rose to her feet and smiled palely at von brauchitsch im so sorry captain i must go i really must go a most dreadful headache i am sorry my dear maria a troubled contrition had replaced his habitual smile you should have told me earlier you dont look at all well a long journey from the rhineland then all this schnapps im afraid im not used to it mary said ruefully ill be all right when ive lain down of course of course come my dear let me escort you to your room no no then realising she had spoken with uncalledfor vehemence she smiled again and touched his hand ill be all right really i will captain von brauchitsch knows whats best the face was serious but friendly the voice authoritative but with an underlying tone of humour and mary knew there was no answer to it i positively insist come along he tucked her arm protectively under his arid led her from the armoury arm in arm they walked along the passageway leading from the ztmouiycamkaffeestube towards the central block of the castle the passageway in contrast to the last time they had walked along there was completely deserted and mary commented on the fact its the witches on their broomsticks von brauchitsch laughed the commandant hasnt caught them yet but give him another few years and you never know all those poor souls you saw being hauled out of the armoury are now probably poking about the eaves or climbing up the flagpoles you never know where spies get to nowadays you seem to treat the possibility lightly enough mary said im a gestapo officer im paid and trained to use my head not an overheated imagination he said curtly then squeezed her arm and apologised sorry that tone of voice was aimed at someone else not you he halted abruptly peered out a window into the courtyard and said now that is strange whats strange the helicopter there von brauchitsch said thoughtfully army regulations state that high command helicopters must be kept in instant readiness at all times but that one has part of its engine cover dismantled and a tarpaulin stretched in position over it wouldnt call that instant readiness would you i suppose helicopters need repairing from time to time the same as any other machine her throat was suddenly dry and she wished von brauchitsch wouldnt hold her so closely he was bound to notice her accelerating heartbeat whats so unusual about that whats so unusual is that there was no one working on that machine almost half an hour ago when we first passed by here von brauchitsch said unheard of for a reichsmarschalls personal pilot to walk away and leave a job half done would it be unheard of for him to take a piece of mechanism inside and repair it under cover mary asked sweetly or perhaps you havent seen a thermometer tonight im getting as bad as the old commandant and his witchhunts von brauchitsch said sadly he moved on shaking his head you see before you a horrible example of the dangers of being too long in my business the obvious answer is far too obvious for shrewd and cunning intellects like ours i must remember that later on tonight youre going to exercise this great mind again tonight mary asked lightly in there as a matter of fact von brauchitsch nodded as they passed by an ornate door the gold drawingroom he glanced at his watch in twenty minutes so soon your charming company fraulein thank you kind sir you you have an appointment her heart was back at its old tricks again an evening of musical appreciation even the gestapo has its finer side we are going to listen to a nightingale sing he quickened his pace sorry fraulein but ive just remembered ive one or two reports to prepare im sorry if ive kept you from your work captain she said demurely how much does he know she thought wildly how much does he suspect what action has he suddenly decided to take the von brauchitschs of this world didnt just suddenly remember anything for the excellent reason that they never forgot it in the first place its been most kind of you the pleasure was onesided von brauchitsch protested gallantly mine and mine alone he stopped outside her bedroom door took her hand in his and smiled goodnight my dear maria you really are the most charming girl goodnight she returned smile for smile and thank you we really must get to know each other better von brauchitsch said in farewell he opened her door bowed kissed her hand gently closed the door behind her and rubbed his chin thoughtfully very much better my dear maria he said softly to himself very much better indeed carraciola thomas and christiansen bent over their notebooks and scribbled furiously at least the first two did christiansen had not yet recovered from the blow on the head and was making heavy weather of his writing kramer who was standing apart with smith and talking to him in low tones looked at them in curiosity and with just a trace of uneasiness they seem to be finding plenty of inspiration from somewhere he said carefully the spectacle of an open grave is often thoughtprovoking smith said cynically i am afraid i dont quite follow do you know what those men will be fifteen minutes from now im tired kramer said he sounded it please dont play with words captain schmidt smith in fifteen minutes theyll be dead and they know it theyre fighting desperately for extra minutes to live when you have as little time left as they have even a minute is a prize snatched from eternity or the last despairing fling of the ruined gambler call it what you like you wax lyrical captain kramer grumbled he paced up and down for almost a minute no longer troubling to watch the men at the table then stopped and planted himself squarely in front of smith all right he said wearily ive been on the spit long enough i confess im baffled out with it what in gods name is behind all this the simplicity of true genius my dear kramer admiral holland the head of mi and he is a genius make no mistake so hes a genius kramer said impatiently well carraciola thomas and christiansen were caught three weeks ago now as you are aware they were concerned only with northwest europe and were not known here by reputation they were yes yes but only that admiral rolland reckoned that if three fullybriefed men impersonated our three captured men and were despatched here for a perfectly plausible reason they would be persona grata of some note honoured guests and completely accepted by you and of course once they were accepted by you they could operate inside the schloss adler with complete security and safety and well dont you see it was smiths turn to be impatient rolland knew that if general carnaby he broke off and scowled across the room at carnabyjones or that impostor masquerading as general carnaby were taken here his opposite number in the german army would be sent to interrogate him smith smiled even in britain they are aware that the prophet must go to the mountain not the mountain to the prophet the army calls upon the gestapo not vice versa go on go on the wehrmacht chief of staff reichsmarschall julius rosemeyer would have been just as priceless to the allies as general carnaby to us the reichsmarschall kramer spoke in a shocked whisper his eyes straying across the room to rosemeyer kidnap your precious trusted agents there smith said savagely and they would have got away with it my god god in heaven its its diabolical isnt it smith said isnt it just kramer left him abruptly crossed the room to rosemeyer and sat down in the chair beside him for perhaps two minutes they talked together in low tones occasionally glancing in smiths direction kramer it was smith could see who did most of the talking rosemeyer who did all of the reacting kramer smith reflected must be putting it across rather well a printed diagram could have been no clearer than the successive expressions of curiosity puzzlement astonishment and finally shocked realisation that reflected on rosemeyers face after some seconds silence both men rose to their feet and walked across to where smith stood the reichsmarschall smith saw was a little paler than normal and when he spoke it required neither a sensitive ear nor imagination to detect a slight tremor in his voice he said this is an incredible story captain smith incredible but inevitable it must be the only explanation that can cover all the facts put all the pieces of the jigsaw together he attempted a smile to change the metaphor i must say that it comes as a considerable shock to find that one is the missing key in a baffling code i am eternally in your debt captain smith germany is eternally in your debt kramer said you have done her a great service we shall not forget this i am sure the fuhrer will personally wish to honour you with some mark of his esteem you are too kind gentlemen smith murmured to do my duty is reward enough he smiled faintly perhaps our fuhrer will give me two or three weeks leave the way i feel tonight my nerves arent what they were but if you gentlemen will excuse me my present task is not yet completed he moved away and walked slowly up and down brandy glass in hand behind the three men bent over the table from time to time he glanced at one of the notebooks and smiled in weary cynicism neither the smile nor the significance of the smile going unremarked by anyone in the room except the three writing men he stopped behind thomas shook his head in disbelief and said my god lets finish it now rosemeyer demanded impatiently if you please reichsmarschall let us play this charade out to the bitter end you have your reasons i most certainly have briskly but not hurriedly von brauchitsch walked away from marys room his footfalls echoing crisply on the stoneflagged corridor once round the corner of the corridor he broke into a run he reached the courtyard and ran across to the helicopter there was no one there quickly he ran up a few steps and peered through the perspex cupola of the cockpit he reached ground again and hailed the nearest guard who came stumbling across a leashed dobermann trailing behind him quickly von brauchitsch snapped have you seen the pilot no herr major the guard answered nervously he was an elderly man long past frontline service and held the gestapo in great fear not for a long time what do you mean by a long time von brauchitsch demanded i dont know thats to say the guard added hastily half an hour more threequarters i would say herr major damnation von brauchitsch swore so long tell me when the pilot is carrying out repairs is there a place near here he uses as a workshop yes sir the guard was eager to oblige with some positive information that door there sir the old grain store is he in there now i dont know herr major you should know von brauchitsch said coldly its your job to keep your eyes open well just dont stand there oaf go and find out the elderly guard trotted away while von brauchitsch shaking his head angrily over his impatience with the old soldier crossed the courtyard and questioned the guards at the gate three tough competent young stormtroopers who unlike the patrol guard could be guaranteed not to miss anything he received the same negative answer there he strode back towards the helicopter and intercepted the elderly guard running from the old grain store theres nobody there herr major he was slightly out of breath and highly apprehensive at being the bearer of what might be ill news its empty it would be von brauchitsch nodded he patted the old shoulder and smiled no fault of yours my friend you keep a good watch unhurriedly almost now he made for the main entrance door pulling out a set of master keys as he went he struck oil with the first door he opened the pilot lay there still unconscious the smashed distributor cap lay beside him the pair of overalls lying on top of him a mute but entirely sufficient explanation of the way in which the distributor cap had been removed without detection von brauchitsch took a torch from a long rack on the wall cut the pilots bonds freed his gag and left him lying there with the door wide open the passage outside was a heavily travelled one and someone was bound to be along soon von brauchitsch ran up the stairs to the passage leading to the bedrooms slowed down walked easily casually past marys bedroom and stopped at the fifth door beyond that he used his master keys and passed inside switching on the light as he went in he crossed the room lifted the lower sash window and nodded when he saw that nearly all the snow on the sill had been brushed or rubbed away he leaned farther out switched on his torch and flashed the beam downwards the roof of the header station was fifty feet directly below and the markings and footprints in the snow told their own unmistakable story von brauchitsch straightened looked at the odd position of the iron bedstead against the wardrobe door and tugged the bed away he watched the wardrobe door burst open and the bound and gagged figure inside roll to the floor without as much as hoisting an eyebrow this had been entirely predictable from the depths of the bound mans groans it was obvious that he was coming round von brauchitsch cut him free removed his gag and left there were more urgent matters demanding his attention than holding the hands of young oberleutnants as they held their heads and groaned their way back to consciousness he stopped outside marys room put his ear to the door and listened no sound he put his eye to the keyhole and peered no light he knocked no reply he used his master keys and passed inside no mary well well well von brauchitsch murmured very interesting indeed finished smith asked thomas nodded christiansen and carraciola glowered but all three were sitting back and it was obvious that all three were in fact finished smith walked along behind them reaching over their shoulders for the notebooks he took them across the room and laid them on the little table by kramers chair the moment of truth smith said quietly one book should be enough kramer reluctantly almost picked up the top book and began to read slowly he began to leaf his way through the pages smith drained his glass and sauntered unconcernedly across the room to the decanter on the sideboard he poured some brandy carefully recapped the bottle walked a few aimless steps and halted he was within two feet of the guard with the carbine he sipped his brandy and said to kramer enough kramer nodded then compare it with my original kramer nodded as you say the moment of truth he picked up the notebook slid off the rubber band and opened the cover the first page was blank so was the next and the next frowning baffled kramer lifted his eyes to look across the room to smith smiths brandy glass was falling to the ground as smith himself with a whiplash violent movement of his body brought the side of his right hand chopping down on the guards neck the guard toppled as if a bridge had fallen on him glasses on the sideboard tinkled in the vibration of his fall kramers moment of utter incomprehension vanished the bitter chagrin of total understanding flooded his face his hand stretched out towards the alarm button uhuh not the buzzer mac the blow that had struck down the guard had held no more whiplash than the biting urgency in schaffers voice he was stretched his length on the floor where hed dived to retrieve the schmeisser now trained rock steady on kramers heart for the second time that night kramers hand withdrew from the alarm button smith picked up the guards carbine walked across the room and changed it for his silenced luger schaffer his gun still trained on kramer picked himself up from the floor and glared at smith a secondrate punk he said indignantly a simpleminded american thats what you said dont know what goddamned day of the week it is do i all i could think of on the spur of the moment smith said apologetically that makes it even worse schaffer complained and did you have to clobber me so goddamned realistically local colour what are you complaining about it worked he walked across to kramers table picked up the three notebooks and buttoned them securely inside his tunic he said to schaffer between them they shouldnt have missed anything well time to be gone ready mr jones and hurry about it schaffer added we have a streetcar to catch well anyhow a cablecar its a chicken farm in the boondocks for me jones looked completely dazed and he sounded exactly the same way acting my god i dont know anything about it this is all you want kramer was completely under control again calm quiet the total professional those books just those books well just about lots of nice names and addresses a bedtime story for mi i see kramer nodded his understanding then those men are of course what they claim to be theyve been under suspicion for weeks classified information of an invaluable nature was going out and false and totally valueless information was coming in it took two months work to pinpoint the leakages and channels of false information to one or more of the departments controlled by those men but we knew we could never prove it on them we werent even sure if there was more than one traitor and had no idea who that one might be and in any event proving it without finding out their contacts at home and abroad would have been useless so we um thought this one up you mean you thought it up captain smith rosemeyer said what does it matter smith said indifferently true it doesnt but something else does rosemeyer smiled faintly when colonel kramer asked you if the books were all you wanted you said just about indicating that there was possibly something else it is your hope to kill two birds with one stone to invite me to accompany you if you can believe that reichsmarschall rosemeyer smith said unkindly its time you handed your baton over to someone else i have no intention of binding you hand and foot and carrying you over the alps on my shoulder the only way i could take you is at the point of a gun and i very much fear that you are a man of honour a man to whom the safety of his skin comes a very long way behind his loyalty to his country if i pointed this gun at you and said to get up and come with us or be gunned down nobody in this room doubts that youd just keep on sitting so we must part you are as complimentary as you are logical rosemeyer smiled a little bitter smile i wish the logic had struck me as forcibly when we were discussing this very subject a few minutes ago it is perhaps as well it didnt smith admitted but but colonel wilner kramer said fieldmarshal kesselrings chief of intelligence surely hes not rest easy williwilli is not on our payroll what he said he believed to be perfectly true he believes me to be the top doubleagent in italy ive been feeding him useless false and outofdate information for almost two years tell him so will you kind of treble agent see schaffer said in a patient explaining tone thats one better than double heidelberg kramer asked two years at the university courtesy of the um foreign office kramer shook his head i still dont understand sorry were going in fact were off schaffer said read all about it in the postwar memoirs of pimpernel schaffer he broke off as the door opened wide mary stood framed in the doorway and the mauser was very steady in her hand she let it fall to her side with a sigh of relief took your time about getting here didnt you smith said severely we were beginning to get a little worried about you im sorry i just couldnt get away von brauchitsch no odds young lady schaffer made a grandiose gesture with his right arm schaffer was here the new girl who arrived tonight kramer whispered he looked slightly dazed the cousin of that girl from the none else smith said shes the one who has been helping me to keep williwilli happy for a long time past and shes the one who opened the door for us tonight boss schaffer said unhappily far be it for me to rush you coming now smith smiled at rosemeyer you were right the books werent all i wanted you were right i did want company but unlike you reichsmarschall those i want have a high regard for their own skins and are entirely without honour and so they will come his gun waved in the direction of carraciola thomas and christiansen on your feet you three youre coming with us coming with us schaffer said incredulously to england to stand trial for treason its no part of my duties to act as public executioner god alone knows how many hundreds and thousands of lives theyve cost already not to mention torrancesmythe and sergeant harrod he looked at carraciola and his eyes were very cold ill never know but i think you were the brains it was you who killed harrod back up there on the mountain if you could have got that radio codebook you could have cracked our network in south germany that would have been something our network here has never been penetrated the radio codebook was a trap that didnt spring and you got old smithy you left the pub a couple of minutes after i did tonight and he followed you but he couldnt cope with a man drop those guns von brauchitschs voice was quiet and cold and compelling no one had heard or seen the stealthy opening of the door he stood just inside about four feet from mary and he had a smallcalibre automatic in his right hand smith whirled round his luger lining up on the doorway hesitated a fatal fraction of a second because mary was almost directly in line with von brauchitsch von brauchitsch his earlier gallantry of the evening abruptly yielding to a coldly professional assessment of the situation had no such inhibitions there was a sharp flat crack the bullet passed through marys sleeve just above the elbow and smith exclaimed in pain as he clutched his bleeding hand and heard his flying luger strike against some unidentified furniture mary tried to turn round but von brauchitsch was too quick and too strong he jumped forward hooked his arm round her and caught her wrist with the gun and thrust his own over her shoulder she tried to struggle free von brauchitsch squeezed her wrist she cried out in pain her hand opened and her gun fell to the floor von brauchitsch seemed to notice none of this his unwinking right eye the only vulnerable part of him that could be seen behind marys gun was levelled along the barrel of his automatic schaffer dropped his gun you shouldnt have tried it von brauchitsch said to smith an extremely silly thing to do in your circumstances id have done exactly the same silly thing he looked at kramer sorry for the delay herr colonel but i thought the young lady was very anxious and restive and she knows precious little about her native dusseldorf and she doesnt know enough not to let people hold her hand when shes telling lies as she does most of the time he released the girl and half turned her round smiling down at her a delightful hand my dear but what a fascinating variation of pulse rates i dont know what youre talking about and i dont care kramer gave vent to a long luxurious sigh and drooped with relief well done my boy well done my god another minute he heaved himself to his feet crossed over to schaffer prudently keeping clear of von brauchitschs line of fire searched him for hidden weapons found none did the same to smith with the same results handed him a white handkerchief to stem the flow of blood looked at mary and hesitated well i dont see how she very well can be but i wonder annemarie certainly herr colonel it will be a pleasure weve met before and she knows my methods dont you my dear with a smile as nearly wolflike as any beautiful aryan could give annemarie walked across to mary and struck her viciously across the face mary cried in pain staggered back against the wall and crouched there eyes too wide in a pale face palms pressed behind her for support from the wall a trickle of blood coming from the corner of her mouth well annemarie demanded have you a gun annemarie there was protest and aversion in kramers face must you i know how to deal with cheap little spies like her she turned to mary and said im afraid they dont like watching how i get results in there she caught mary by the hair pulled her to the side door opened it and pushed her violently inside the sound of her body crashing to the floor and another gasp of pain came together annemarie closed the door behind them for the next ten seconds or so there could be clearly heard the sound of blows and muffled cries of pain von brauchitsch waved smith and schaffer back with his gun advanced hitched a seat on the edge of one of the big armchairs winced as he listened to the sound of the struggle and said to kramer dryly i somehow think the young lady would have preferred me to search her theres a limit to the value of false modesty im afraid annemarie sometimes lets her enthusiasm carry her away kramer conceded his mouth was wrinkled in distaste sometimes von brauchitsch winced again as more sounds filtered through the door the crash of a body against a wall a shriek of pain low sobbing moans then silence always when the other girl is as young and beautiful as herself its over now kramer sighed its all over now he looked at smith and schaffer well fix that hand first then well one thing about the schloss adler there are no shortage of dungeons he broke off the fractional widening of his eyes matching a similar slumping of his shoulders and he said carefully to von brauchitsch you are far too good a man to lose captain it would seem that we were wasting our sympathy on the wrong person theres a gun four feet from you pointing at the middle of your back von brauchitsch his gunhand resting helplessly on his thigh turned slowly round and looked over his shoulder there was indeed a gun pointing at the middle of his back a lilliput automatic and the hand that held it was disconcertingly steady the dark eyes cool and very watchful apart from the small trickle of blood from her cut lip and rather dishevelled hair mary looked singularly little the worse for wear its every parents duty schaffer said pontifically to encourage his daughter to take up judo he took the gun from von brauchitschs unresisting hand retrieved his own schmeisser walked across to the main door and locked it far too many folk coming in here without knocking on his way back he looked through the opened door of the room whistled grinned and said to mary its a good job i have my thoughts set on someone else i wouldnt like to be married to you if you lost your temper thats a regular sickbay dispensary in there fix the majors hand as best you can ill watch them he hoisted his schmeisser and smiled almost blissfully oh brother how ill watch them and he watched them while mary attended to smiths injured hand in the small room where annemarie had so lately met her waterloo schaffer herded his six charges into one of the massive couches took up position by the mantelpiece poured himself some brandy sipped it delicately and gave the prisoners an encouraging smile from time to time there were no answering smiles for all schaffers nonchalance and lighthearted banter there was about him not only a coldly discouraging competence with the weapon in his hand but also the unmistakable air of one who would when the need arose and without a seconds hesitation squeeze the trigger and keep on squeezing it being at the wrong end of a schmeisser machinepistol does not make for an easy cordiality in relationships smith and mary emerged from the side room the latter carrying a clothcovered tray smith was pale and had his right hand heavily bandaged schaffer looked at the hand then lifted an enquiring eyebrow to mary not so good she looked a little pale herself forefinger and thumb are both smashed ive patched it as best i can but im afraid its a job for a surgeon if i can survive marys first aid smith said philosophically i can survive anything we have a more immediate little problem here he tapped his tunic those names and addresses here might be an hour or two before we get them through to england and then another hour or two before those men can be rounded up he looked at the men seated on the couch you could get through to them in a lot less than that and warn them so we have to ensure your silence for a few hours we could ensure it for ever boss schaffer said carelessly that wont be necessary as you said yourself its a regular little dispensary in there he removed the tray cloth to show bottles and hypodermic syringes he held up a bottle in his left hand nembutal youll hardly feel the prick kramer stared at him nembutal ill be damned if i do smith said in a tone of utter conviction youll be dead if you dont smith halted outside the door marked radio raum held up his hand for silence looked at the three scowling captives and said dont even think of tipping anyone off or raising the alarm im not all that keen on taking you back to england lieutenant schaffer i think we might immobilise those men a bit more we might at that schaffer agreed he went behind each of the three men in turn ripped open the top buttons on their tunics and pulled the tunics down their backs until their sleeves reached their elbows and said in the same soft voice thatll keep their hands out of trouble for a little but not their feet dont let them come anywhere near you smith said to mary theyve nothing to lose right lieutenant when youre ready ready now carefully silently schaffer eased open the door of the radio room it was a large welllit but very bleak room the two main items of furniture being a massive table by the window on the far wall and on the table an almost equally massive transceiver in gleaming metal apart from two chairs and a filing cabinet the room held nothing else not even as much as a carpet to cover the floorboards perhaps it was the lack of a carpet that betrayed them for the first half of schaffers stealthy advance across the room the operator his back to them sat smoking a cigarette in idle unconcern listening to soft austrian schrammel music coming in over his big machine suddenly alerted either by the faintest whisper of sound from a creaking floorboard or just by some sixth sense he whirled round and jumped to his feet and he thought as quickly as he moved even as he raised his arms high in apparently eager surrender he appeared to move slightly to his right shifting the position of his right foot there came the sudden strident clamour of an alarm bell ringing in the passage outside schaffer leapt forward his schmeisser swinging and the operator staggered back against his transceiver then slid unconscious to the floor but schaffer was too late the bell rang and kept on ringing thats all i need smith swore bitterly thats all i bloody well need he ran through the radio room door out into the passage located the glasscased alarm bell some feet away and struck it viciously with the butt of his schmeisser the shattered glass tinkled to the floor and the clangour abruptly ceased inside smith gestured to the open doorway of the radio room all of you quickly he ushered them all inside looked around saw a side door leading off to the right and said to mary quickly whats in there schaffer horatio hold the bridge schaffer murmured he moved across and took up position at the radio room door we could have done without this boss we could do without a lot of things in this world smith said wearily he glanced at mary well storage rooms for radio spares looks like you and jones take those three in there if they breathe kill them jones looked down at the gun held gingerly in his hand and said i am not a serviceman sir i have news for you smith said neither am i he crossed hurriedly to the transceiver sat down and studied the confusing array of dials knobs and switches for fully twenty seconds he sat there just looking schaffer said from the doorway know how to work it boss a fine time to ask me smith said well soon find out wont we he switched the machine to send selected the ultra short wave band and lined up his transmitting frequency he opened another switch and picked up a microphone broadsword calling danny boy he said broadsword calling danny boy can you hear me can you hear me nobody heard him or gave indication of hearing him smith altered the transmitting frequency fractionally and tried again and again and again after the sixth or seventh repetition smith started as a crash of machinepistol fire came from the doorway he twisted round schaffer was stretched full length on the floor smoke wisping from the barrel of his schmeisser we got callers boss schaffer said apologetically dont think i got any but i sure as hell started their adrenalin moving around broadsword calling danny boy smith said urgently insistently broadsword calling danny boy for gods sake why dont they answer they cant come round the corner of the passage without being sawn in half schaffer spoke comfortably from his uncomfortable horizontal position on the floor i can hold them off to christmas so whats the hurry broadsword calling danny boy broadsword calling danny boy how long do you think its going to be before someone cuts the electricity for gods sake danny boy schaffer implored why dont you answer why dont you answer danny boy calling broadsword the voice on the radio was calm and loud and clear so free from interference that it might have come from next door danny boy one hour danny boy smith interrupted one hour understood over understood you have it broadsword the voice was unmistakably that of admiral hollands over i have it smith said i have it all all sins are forgiven mother machree coming to meet you leaving now there came another staccato crash of sound as schaffer loosedoff another burst from his schmeisser admiral hollands voice on the radio said what was that static smith said he didnt bother to switch off he rose took three paces back and fired a twosecond burst from his machinepistol his face twisting in pain as the recoil slammed into his shattered hand no one would ever use that particular radio again he glanced briefly at schaffer but only briefly the americans face though thoughtful was calm and unworried there were those who might require helpful words encouragement and reassurance but schaffer was not one of them smith moved swiftly across to the window and lifted the lower sash with his left hand the moon was almost obscured behind some darkly drifting cloud a thin weak light filtered down into the halfseen obscurity of the valley below once again the snow was beginning to fall gently the air was taut brittle in the intensity of its coldness an arctic chill that bit to the bone the icy wind that gusted through the room could have come off the polar icecap they were on the east side of the castle smith realised the side remote from the cablecar header station the base of the volcanic plug was shrouded in a gloom so deep that it was impossible to be sure whether or not the guards and dobermanns were patrolling down there and for the purposes of present survival it didnt really matter smith withdrew from the window pulled the nylon from the kitbag tied one end securely to the metal leg of the radio table threw the remainder of the rope out into the night then with his left hand thoroughly scuffed and rubbed away the frozen encrusted snow on both the windowsill and for two or three feet beneath it it would he thought have to be a hypercritical eye that didnt immediately register the impression that there had been fairly heavy and recent traffic over the sill he wondered vaguely whether the rope reached as far as the ground and dismissed the thought as soon as it had occurred to him again it didnt really matter he crossed the room to where schaffer lay spreadeagled in the doorway the key was in the lock on the inside of the door and the lock he observed with satisfaction was on the same massive scale as everything else in the schloss adler he said to schaffer time to close the door lets wait till they show face again then discourage them some more schaffer suggested its been a couple of minutes since the last lad peeked his head round the corner there another peek another salvo from schaffer and it might give us another couple of minutes grace enough time to make it feasible for us to have shinned down that little rope there and made our getaway i should have thought of that an icy snowladen gust of wind blew across the room from open window through open door and smith shivered my god its bitter loss of blood schaffer said briefly then added unsympathetically and all that brandy you guzzled back there when it comes to opening pores he broke off and lay very still lowering his head a fraction to sight along the barrel of his schmeisser he said softly give me your torch boss what is it smith whispered he handed schaffer the torch discretion schaffer murmured he switched on the torch and placed it on the floor pushing it as far away from himself as he could i reckon if i were in their place id be discreet too theres a stick poking round the corner of the passage and the stick has a mirror tied to it only they havent got it angled right smith peered cautiously round the door jamb just in time to see stick and suspended mirror being withdrawn from sight presumably to make adjustments a few seconds later and the stick appeared again this time with the mirror angled at more or less fortyfive degrees mirror and stick disintegrated under the flatly staccato hammering of schaffers machinepistol schaffer stood up took careful aim at the single overhead light illuminating the passage and fired one shot now the sole light in the passage came from the torch on the floor the light from which would not only effectively conceal from the germans at the far end of the passage what was going on at the radio room door but indeed make it very difficult to decide whether or not the door itself was open or shut smith and schaffer moved back into the radio room soundlessly closed the door behind them and as soundlessly turned the key in the lock schaffer used the leverage of his schmeisser to bend the key so that it remained firmly jammed in the wards of the lock they waited at least two minutes passed then they heard the sound of excited voices at the far end of the passage followed almost at once by the sound of heavy boots pounding down the passage they moved away from the door passed inside the radio spares room leaving just a sufficient crack in the doorway to allow a faint backwash of light to filter through smith said softly mary you and mr jones for thomas there a gun in each temple he took christiansen for himself forced him to kneel and ground his gun into the back of his neck schaffer backed carraciola against a wall the muzzle of his schmeisser pressed hard against his teeth at the other end of the machinepistol schaffer smiled pleasantly his teeth a pale gleam in the near darkness the stillness inside the little room was complete the halfdozen germans outside the radio room door bore no resemblance to the elderly guard von brauchitsch had interrogated in the courtyard they were elite soldiers of the alpenkorps ruthless men who had been ruthlessly trained no one made any move to approach the door handle or lock the machinelike efficiency with which they broached that door without risk to themselves was clearly the result of a welldrilled procedure for handling situations of precisely this nature at a gesture from the oberleutnant in charge a soldier stepped forward and with two diagonal sweeps emptied the magazine of his machinepistol through the door a second used his machinepistol to stitch a neat circle in the wood reversed his gun and knocked in the wooden circle with the butt a third armed two grenades and lobbed them accurately through the hole provided while a fourth shot away the lock the soldiers pressed back on each side of the door the two flat cracks of the exploding grenades came almost simultaneously and smoke came pouring through the circular hole in the door the door was kicked open and the men rushed inside there was no longer any need to take precautions any men who had been in the same confined space as those two exploding grenades would be dead men now for a moment there was confusion and hesitation until the blue acrid smoke was partially cleared away by the powerful crossdraught then the oberleutnant locating the source of this draught with the aid of a small handtorch ran across to the open window checked at the sight of the rope disappearing over the sill leaned out the window rubbed his nowstreaming eyes and peered downwards along the beam of his torch the beam reached perhaps halfway down the side of the volcanic plug there was nothing to be seen he caught the rope in his free hand and jerked it savagely it was as nearly weightless as made no difference for a moment he focused his torch on the disturbed snow on the windowledge then swung back into the room gott in himmel he shouted theyve got away theyre down already quickly the nearest phone well now schaffer listened to the fading sound of running footsteps removed the muzzle of his schmeisser from carraciolas teeth and smiled approvingly that was a good boy gun in carraciolas back he followed smith out into the wrecked radio room and said thoughtfully it isnt going to take them too long to find out there are no footprints in the snow down there its going to take them even less time to discover that this rope is gone swiftly ignoring the stabbing pain in his right hand smith hauled the nylon in through the window were going to need it and were going to need some distractions im distracted enough as it is schaffer said take four or five plastic explosives each with different fuse length settings chuck them into rooms along the corridor there distractions coming up schaffer extracted some plastic explosives from the kitbag cut the slowburning rdx fuses off to varying lengths crimped on the chemical igniters said consider it already done and left the first three rooms he came to were locked and he wasted neither time nor the precious ammunition of his silenced luger in trying to open them but each of the next five rooms was unlocked in the first three all bedrooms he placed charges in a dresden fruit bowl under an officers cap and under a pillow in the fourth room a bathroom he placed it behind a wc and in the fifth a storeroom high up on a shelf beside some highly inflammablelooking cardboard cartons smith meanwhile had ushered the others from the still smokefilled eyewatering throatirritating atmosphere of the radio room into the comparatively purer air of the passageway beyond and was waiting the return of schaffer when his face became suddenly thoughtful at the sight of some firefighting gear a big co extinguisher buckets of sand and a firemans axe on a low platform by the passage wall you are slipping major smith marys eyes were redrimmed and her tearstreaked face white as paper but she could still smile at him distractions you said ive had the same thought myself and im only me smith gave her a halfsmile the way his hand hurt he felt he couldnt afford the other half and tried the handle of a door beside the low platform a door lettered akten raum records office such a door inevitably was locked he took the luger in his left hand placed it against the lock squeezed the trigger and went inside it certainly looked like a records office the room was heavily shelved and piled ceilinghigh with files and papers smith crossed to the window opened it wide to increase the draught then scattered large piles of paper on the floor and put a match to them the paper flared up at once the flames feet high within seconds kinda forgot this didnt you schaffer had returned and was bearing with him the large co cylinder he crossed to the window gardyloo or mind your heads or whatever the saying is the cylinder disappeared through the open window the room was already so furiously ablaze that schaffer had difficulty in finding his way back to the door again as he stumbled out his clothes and hair singed and face smokeblackened a deeptoned bell far down in the depths of the schloss adler began to ring with a strident urgency for gods sake what next schaffer said in despair the fire brigade just about smith said bitterly damn it why couldnt i have checked first now they know where we are a heatsensing device linked to an indicator what else come on they ran along the central passageway driving the prisoners in front of them dropped down a central flight of stairs and were making for the next when they heard the shouting of voices and the clattering of feet on treads as soldiers came running up from the castle courtyard quickly in behind there smith pointed to a curtained alcove hurry up oh god ive forgotten something he turned and ran back the way he had come where the hell has he schaffer broke off as he realised the approaching men were almost upon them whirled and jabbed the nearest prisoner painfully with the muzzle of his schmeisser in that alcove fast in the dim light behind the curtains he changed his machinepistol for the silenced luger dont even think of touching those curtains with the racket that bells making they wont even hear you die nobody touched the curtains jackbooted men gasping heavily for breath passed by within feet of them they clattered furiously up the next flight of stairs the one smith and the others had just descended and then the footsteps stopped abruptly from the next shouted words it was obvious that they had just caught sight of the fire and had abruptly and for the first time realised the magnitude of the task they had to cope with emergency sergeant get on that phone it was the voice of the oberleutnant who had led the breakin to the radio room fire detail at the double hoses more co cylinders where in gods name is colonel kramer corporal find colonel kramer at once the corporal didnt answer the sound of jutting heels striking the treads as he raced down the stairs was answer enough he ran by the alcove and ran down the next flight of stairs until the sound of his footfalls was lost in the metallic clamour of the alarm bell schaffer risked a peep through a crack in the curtains just as smith came running up on tiptoe where the hell have you been schaffers voice was low and fierce come on come on out of it smith said urgently no jones not down that flight of stairs you want to meet a whole regiment of alpenkorps coming up it along the passage to the west wing well use the side stairs for gods sake hurry this place will be like piccadilly circus in a matter of seconds schaffer pounded along the passage beside smith and when he spoke again the anxietyborn fierceness of tone had a certain plaintive equality to it well where the bloody hell have you been the man we left tied up in the room beside the telephone exchange the records office is directly above i just remembered i cut him free and dragged him out to the passage hed have burnt to death you did that did you schaffer said wonderingly you do think of the most goddamned unimportant things dont you its a point of view our friend lying in the passage back there wouldnt share your sentiments right down those stairs and straight ahead mary you know the door mary knew the door fifteen paces from the foot of the stairs she stopped smith spared a glance through the passage window on his left already smoke and flame were snowing through the windows and embrasures in the northeast tower of the castle in the courtyard below dozens of soldiers were running around most of them without what appeared to be any great sense of purpose or direction one man there wasnt running he was the overalled helicopter pilot and he was standing very still indeed bent low over the engine as smith watched he slowly straightened lifted his right arm and shook his fist in the direction of the burning tower smith turned away and said to mary sure this is the room two stories below the window we came in mary nodded no question this is it smith tried the door handle the room was locked the time for skeleton keys and suchlike finesse was gone he placed the barrel of his luger against the lock the corporal despatched by his oberleutnant to locate colonel kramer was faced by the same problem when he turned the handle of the gold drawingroom for when smith and the others had left there for the last time schaffer had locked the door and thoughtfully thrown the key out a convenient passage window the corporal first of all knocked respectfully no reply he knocked loudly with the same lack of result he depressed the handle and used his shoulder and all he did was to hurt his shoulder he battered at the lock area with the butt of his schmeisser but the carpenters who had built the schloss adler doors had known what they were about he hesitated then brought his machinepistol right way round and fired a burst through the lock praying to heaven that colonel kramer wasnt sleeping in a chair in direct line with the keyhole colonel kramer was sleeping all right but nowhere near the direct line of the keyhole he was stretched out on the gold carpet with a consideratelyplaced pillow under his head the corporal advanced slowly into the drawingroom his eyebrows reaching for his hair and his face almost falling apart in shocked disbelief reichsmarschall rosemeyer was stretched out beside the colonel von brauchitsch and a sergeant were sprawled in armchairs heads lolling on their shoulders while annemarie a very dishevelled and somewhat bruisedlooking annemarie was stretched out on one of the big goldlame couches like a man in a daze still totally uncomprehending the corporal approached kramer knelt by his side and then shook him by the shoulder with gentle respect at first and then with increasing vigour after some time it was borne in upon him that he could shake the colonels shoulder all night and that would be all he would have for it and then illogically and for the first time he noticed that all the men were without jackets and that everyone including annemarie had their left sleeves rolled up to the elbow he looked slowly around the drawingroom and went very still as his gaze rested on a tray with bottles beakers and hypodermic syringes slowly on the corporals face shocked incomprehension was replaced by an equally shocked understanding he took off through the doorway like the favourite in the olympics metres final schaffer tied the nylon rope round the head of the iron bedstead tested the security of the knot lifted the lower sash window pushed the rope through and peered unhappily down the valley at the far end of the village a pulsating red glow marked the smouldering embers of what had once been the railway station the lights of the village itself twinkled clearly immediately below and to the right of where he stood could be seen four patrolling guards with as many dogs kramer hadnt spoken idly when hed said the outside guards had been doubled and the ease with which he could spot them schaffer found all too readily understandable when he twisted his head and stared skywards through the thinly driving snow the moon had just emerged from behind a black bar of cloud and was sailing across a discouragingly large stretch of empty sky even the stars could be seen im going to feel a mite conspicuous out there boss schaffer said complainingly and theres a wolfpack loosedown below there wouldnt matter if they had a battery of searchlights trained on this window smith said curtly not now weve no option quickly schaffer nodded dolefully eased himself through the window grasped the rope and halted momentarily as a muffled explosion came from the eastern wing of the castle number one schaffer said with satisfaction bang goes a bowl of dresden fruit or a dresden bowl of fruit i do hope he added anxiously that theres nobody using the toilet next door to where that bang just went off smith opened his mouth to make impatient comment but schaffer was already gone fifteen feet only and he was standing on the roof of the header station smith eased himself awkwardly over the sill wrapped the rope round his right forearm took the strain with his left hand and looked at mary she gave him an encouraging smile but there was nothing encouraging about her expression when she transferred her gaze back to the three men who were lined up facing a wall their hands clasped behind their necks carnabyjones was also covering them but in his case he held the gun as if it might turn and bite him at any moment smith joined schaffer on the roof of the header station both men crouched low to minimise the chances of being spotted from below for the first ten feet out from the wall the roof was quite flat then dropped away sharply at an angle of thirty degrees smith thoughtfully regarded this steep slope and said we dont want a repeat performance of what happened to us last time we were out there we could do with a good piton to hammer into the castle wall here or the roof some sort of belay for our rope pitons we dont need look at this with his bare hands schaffer scraped at the snowencrusted roof of the header station to reveal a fine wire netting and below that iron bars covering a pane of plate glass perhaps two feet by one skylights i believe theyre called those bars look pretty firm to me he laid both hands on one of the bars and tugged firmly it remained secure smith laid his left hand on the same bar and they pulled together it still remained secure schaffer grinned in satisfaction passed the rope round the bar and made no mistake about the knot he tied smith sat down on the roof and put his hand to the rope schaffer caught his wrist and firmly broke smiths grip no you dont schaffer lifted smiths right hand the thick wrapping of bandages were already sodden saturated with blood you can win your vc next time out this time youd never make it this one is on me he paused and shook his head in wonder my god schaffer you dont know what youre saying he removed the kitbag hed been carrying round his neck crawled to the break in the roof gripped the rope and slid smoothly down the sloping surface as he approached the roof edge he turned round with infinite care until he was pointing head downwards slowly inch by almost imperceptible inch the rope above him caught securely between his feet he lowered himself still farther until his head was projecting over the edge of the roof he peered downwards he was he discovered directly above one of the cables two hundred feet below but to his left this time guards and dobermans were floundering uphill through the deep snow at the best speed they could make heading for the main entrance to the castle courtyard the word had gone out schaffer realised and every available man was being pulled in either to fight the fire or to help in the search for the men who had started the fire which meant schaffer concluded that some of the garrison must have checked the state of the ground beneath the radio room window and found there nothing but virgin and undisturbed snow he twisted his head and looked upwards there was no sign of any guard patrolling the battlements which was what he would have expected there was no point in keeping a posted lookout for an enemy without when every indication pointed to the fact that the enemy was still within schaffer eased himself downwards another perilous six inches till head and shoulders were over the edge of the roof only two things mattered now was there a winch attendant or guard inside the header station and if there were could he schaffer hold on to the rope with one hand while with the other he wriggled his luger free and shot the guard schaffer doubted it his oss training had been wideranging and intensive but no one had ever thought it necessary that they should master the techniques of a highwire circus acrobat his mouth very dry and his heart pounding so heavily as to threaten to dislodge his precarious hand and toeholds schaffer craned his head and looked inside there was neither guard nor winch attendant inside or if there were any such he was so well concealed that schaffer couldnt see him but logic said that no one would be hiding there for there was no conceivable reason why anyone should be hiding logic also said that any person who might have been there would like the patrolling guards below and the sentry on the battlements have been called inside the castle to help fight fire and enemy all schaffer could see was a cablecar heavy winching machinery and heavy banks of leadacid batteries he was soon convinced that that was all that there was to see no cause for concern but what he did see something that did dismay him considerably was that there was only one way for him to get into the station there was no possibility of his sliding down the rope on to the floor of the station for the excellent reason that the roof of the station in typically alpine eaves fashion overhung the floor by at least six feet the only way in was by dropping down on to the lujfseilbabns heavy steel cable then overhanding himself up inside the station schaffer wasted no time in considering whether this was physically possible it had to be possible there was no other way in carefully and with no little difficulty schaffer inched himself back up the rope and the slope of the roof until he was about three feet clear of the edge he eased his footgrip on the rope and swung round through є until he was once more facing up the slope with his legs now dangling over the edge he looked up the crouched figure of smith showed tension in every line although the face was as expressionless as ever schaffer lifted one hand made a circle with thumb and forefinger then eased himself over the edge until his searching feet found the cable he eased himself farther until he was sitting astride the cable transferred his grip to the cable and swung down until he was suspended by hands and feet and looked up towards the moon as a view schaffer reflected it was vastly preferable to contemplating that two hundred foot drop down into the valley below he started to climb he almost failed to make it for every six inches he made up the cable he slid back five the cable was covered by a diabolically slippery coating of oil and sheath ice and only by clenching his fists till his forearms ached could he make any kind of progress at all and the fact that the cable stretched up at fortyfive degrees made the difficult the wellnight impossible such a means of locomotion would have been suicidal for the virtually onehanded smith and quite impossible for either mary or carnabyjones once after he had made about twelve feet schaffer looked down to gauge his chances if he let go and dropped down to the floor beneath and rapidly concluded that the chances were either that he would break both legs or if he landed at all awkwardly would pitch out two hundred feet down to the valley below as schaffer later recounted it this last possibility combined with the vertiginous view of the long long way to the floor of the valley did him more good than an extra pair of arms ten seconds later sweating and gasping like a long distance runner and very close to the last stages of exhaustion he hauled himself on to the roof of the cablecar he lay there for a full minute until the trembling in his arms eased and pulse and breathing rates returned to not more than a man in a high fever might expect to have lowered himself quietly and wearily to the floor took out his luger slid the safety catch and began to make a quick check that the header station really was empty of the enemy a superfluous precaution reason told him any concealed person would have been bound both to see and hear his entry but instinct and training went deeper than reason there was no one there he looked behind winches electric motors and batteries he had the place to himself the next thing was to ensure that he continued to have the place to himself at the lower end of the sloping archway leading up to the castle courtyard the heavy iron door stood wide he passed through this doorway and padded softly up the cobbled pathway until he came to the courtyard exit here too was another iron gate as wide open as the other schaffer moved as far forward as the shadowing safety of the tunnels overhang permitted and looked cautiously around the scene before him there was certainly he had to admit plenty to be seen and under more auspicious circumstances it would have done his heart good the courtyard scene was as frenzied as the earlier glimpse they had had from the passage but this time the action was much more purposive and controlled shouting gesticulating figures were supervising the unrolling of hoses the couplingup of hydrants the relays of men carrying extinguishers and buckets of sand the main gates stood open and unguarded even the sentries must have been pressed into action not that the unguarded doors offered any warmly beckoning escape route only a suicide would have tried making his escape through a courtyard crowded with sixty or seventy scurrying alpenkorps troops over to his left the helicopter still stood forlorn and useless there was no sign of the pilot suddenly a loud flat explosion echoed inside the confining walls of the square schaffer lifted his head to locate its source saw fresh clouds of smoke billowing from an upper window in the east wing and briefly wondered which of his diversionary explosives that might be but only for a brief moment some instinct made him glance to his right and his face went very still the men hed seen floundering up the slope outside guards with the dobermann pinchers were coming through the main gate the clouds of frozen breath trailing in the air behind them evidence enough of their exhausting run uphill through that kneehigh snow schaffer backed away slowly and silently german soldiers he could cope with or avoid but dobermans were out of his class he swung the heavy iron door to careful not to make the least whisper of sound slid home two heavy bolts ran quickly down the arched passageway closed and padlocked the lower door and put the key in his pocket he looked up startled at a loud crashing of glass and the subsequent tinkle as the shattered fragments tinkled to the floor automatically the barrel of his luger followed his glance put that cannon away smith said irritably schaffer could clearly see his face now pressed close to the iron bars who do you think is up here kramer and company its my nerves schaffer explained coldly you havent been through what lieutenant schaffers just been through how are things up there carraciola and friends are face down on the roof freezing to death in the snow and mary has the schmeisser on them jones is still up there wont even put his head outside says hes no head for heights ive given up arguing with him how are things your end quiet if anyone is having any passing thoughts about the cablecar there are no signs of it both doors to the courtyard are locked theyre iron and even if someone does start having suspicious thoughts they should hold them for a while and boss the way i came in is strictly for the birds and i mean strictly what you need is wings your hand the way it is you could never make it mary and the old boy couldnt try it carraciola and the rest well who cares about carraciola and the rest what winch controls are there smith asked well now schaffer approached the winch a small lever marked normal and notfall are there batteries down there smith interrupted yeah any amount put the lever to notfall emergency they could cut off the main power from inside the castle ok its done then there are start and stop buttons a big mechanical handbrake and a gear lever affair marked forwards and backwards with a neutral position start the motor smith ordered schaffer pressed the start button and a generator whined into life building up to its maximum revolutions after perhaps ten seconds now release the brake and select forward gear if it works stop the car and try the other gear schaffer released the brake and engaged gear sliding the gear handle progressively over successive stops the car moved forward gently at first but gathering speed until it was clear of the header station roof after a few more feet schaffer stopped the car engaged reverse gear and brought the car back up into its original position he looked up at smith smooth huh lower it down till its halfway past the edge of the roof well slide down the rope on to the top of the cablecar then you can bring us up inside must be all the fish you eat schaffer said admiringly he set the car in motion im sending carraciola thomas and christiansen down first smith said i wouldnt care for any of us to be on the top of the same cablecar as that lot think you can hold them till we get down you dont improve morale by being insulting to subordinate officers schaffer said coldly i didnt know youd any left while youre doing that ill have another go at persuading juliet up there to come and join us he prodded carraciola with a far from gentle toe you first down that rope and on to the top of the cablecar carraciola straightened until he was kneeling glanced down the slope of the roof to the depths of the valley beyond youre not getting me on that lot not ever he shook his head in finality then stared up at smith his black eyes implacable in their hate go on shoot me kill me now ill kill you if you ever try to escape smith said dont you know that carraciola sure i know it but you wont kill me in cold blood just standing here youre a man of principle arent you major ethics thats the word the kind of noble sucker who risks his life to free an enemy soldier who might burn to death why dont you shoot major because i dont have to with his left hand smith grabbed carradolias hair and jerked his head back till carraciola gasping with the pain of it was staring skywards while he reversed the grip on his luger and raised it high nausea and pain flooded through him as the ends of the broken fingerbone grated together but none of this showed in his face i just knock you out tie a rope round your waist and lower you down over the edge maybe eight or ten feet schaffer eases out the car till it touches you then he climbs in the back door goes to the front door and hauls you inside you can see my right hands not too good maybe i wont be able to tie a secure enough knot round you maybe i wont be able to hold you maybe schaffer might let you go when hes hauling you inside i dont much care carraciola you doubledealing bastard tears of pain filled carraciolas eyes and his voice was low and venomous i swear to god ill live to make you wish youd never met me too late smith thrust him away contemptuously and carraciola had to grab wildly at the rope to prevent himself from sliding over the break of the roof ive been wishing that ever since i found out who and what you really are vermin soil my hands move now or i damn well will shoot you why the hell should i bother taking you back to england carraciola believed him he slid down the rope until first his feet then his hands found the security of the supporting bracket of the cablecar smith gestured with his gun towards thomas thomas went without a word ten seconds later christiansen followed him smith watched the cablecar begin to move up inside the station then looked upwards to the window from which the rope dangled mr jones im still here carnabyjoness voice had a quaver to it and he didnt as much as venture to risk a glance over the windowsill not for much longer i hope smith said seriously theyll be coming for you mr jones theyll be coming any moment now i hate to say this but i must it is my duty to warn you what will happen to you an enemy spy youll be tortured mr jones not simply everyday tortures like pulling out your teeth and toenails but unspeakable tortures i cant mention with miss ellison here and then youll finish in the gas chambers if youre still alive mary clutched his arm would they would they really do that good god no smith stared at her in genuine surprise what on earth would they want to do that for he raised his voice again youll die in a screaming agony mr jones an agony beyond your wildest nightmares and youll take a long time dying hours maybe days and screaming screaming all the time what in gods name am i to do the desperate voice from above was no longer quavering it vibrated like a broken bedspring what can i do you can slide down that rope smith said brutally fifteen feet fifteen little feet mr jones my god you could do that in a pole vault i cant the voice was a wail i simply cant yes you can smith urged grab the rope now close your eyes out over the sill and down keep your eyes closed we can catch you cant i cant oh god smith said despairingly oh my god its too late now its too what in heavens name do you mean the lights are going on along the passage smith said his voice low and tense and that window and the next theyre coming for you mr jones theyre coming now oh god when they strip you off and strap you down on the torture table two seconds later carnabyjones was over the sill and sliding down the nylon rope his eyes were screwed tightly shut mary said admiringly you really are the most fearful liar ever schaffer keeps telling me the same thing smith admitted you cant all be wrong the cablecar with the three men clinging grimly to the suspension bracket climbed slowly up into the header station and jerked to a halt one by one the three men under the persuasion of schaffers gently waving luger lowered themselves the full length of their arms and dropped the last two or three feet to the floor the last of them thomas seemed to land awkwardly exclaimed in muffled pain and fell heavily sideways as he fell his hands shot out and grabbed schaffer by the ankles schaffer immediately offbalance flung up his arms in an attempt to maintain equilibrium and before he could even begin to bring his arms down again was winded by a diving rugby tackle by christiansen he toppled backwards his back smashing into a generator with an impact that drove from his lungs what little breath had been left in them a second later and christiansen had his gun driving the muzzle cruelly into a throat gasping for air carraciola was already at the lower iron door shaking it fiercely his eye caught sight of the big padlock in its hasp he swung round ran back towards schaffer knocked aside the gun in christiansens hand and grabbed schaffer by the throat that padlock wheres the key to that bloody padlock the human voice cant exactly emulate the hiss of a snake but carraciolas came pretty close to it then that door has been locked from the inside youre the only person who could have done it where is that key schaffer struggled to a sitting position feebly pushing aside carraciolas hand i cant breathe the moaning gasping breathing lent credence to the words i cant breathe i im going to be sick where is that damned key carraciola demanded oh god i feel ill schaffer hoisted himself slowly to a kneeling position his head bent retching sounds coming from his throat he shook his head from side to side as if to clear away the muzziness then slowly raised it his eyes unfocused he mumbled what do you want what did you say the key if the need for silence hadnt been paramount carraciolas voice would have been a frustrated scream of rage halfadozen times in brutal and rapid succession he struck schaffer across the face with the palm and back of his hand where is that key easy on easy on thomas caught carraciolas hand dont be such a damned fool you want him to talk dont you the key yes the key schaffer hoisted himself wearily to his feet and stood there swaying eyes halfclosed face ashen blood trickling from both corners of his mouth the batteries there i think i hid them behind the batteries i dont know i cant think no wait the words came in short anguished gasps i didnt i meant to but i didnt he fumbled in his pockets eventually located the key and brought it out offering it vaguely in carraciolas direction carraciola the beginnings of a smile on his face reached out for the key but before he could reach it schaffer abruptly straightened and with a convulsive jerk of his arm sent the key spinning through the open end of the station to land in the valley hundreds of feet below carraciola stared after the vanished key in total incredulity then his suffused and enraged face mute evidence of his complete loss of selfcontrol stooped picked up schaffers fallen schmeisser and swung it viciously across the americans head and face schaffer fell like a tree well thomas said acidly now that weve got that out of our systems we can shoot the lock away you can commit suicide with ricochets that doors iron man carraciola had indeed got it out of his system for he was back on balance again he paused then smiled slowly what the hell are we all thinking of lets play it clever if we did get through that door the first thing wed probably collect would be a chest full of machinegun bullets remember the only people who know who we really are have bloody great doses of nembutal inside them and are liable to remain unconscious for a long time to the rest of the garrison were unknowns and to the few who saw us arrive were prisoners in both cases were automatically enemies so thomas was impatient so as i say we play it clever we go down in this cablecar and play it clever again we phone old weissner we ask him to phone the schloss adler tell him where smith is and in case smith does manage to get down to the village on the other cablecar after us we ask him to have a reception committee waiting for him at the lower station then we go to the barracks theyre bound to have a radio there and get in touch with you know who flaws nary a flaw christiansen grinned and then we all live happily ever afterwards come on what are we waiting for into the cablecar you two carraciola waited until they had boarded walked across the floor until he was directly under the smashed skylight and called boss schaffers silenced luger was in his hand on the roof above smith stiffened handed the trembling carnabyjones his eyes were still screwed shut over to the care of mary took two steps towards the skylight and stopped it was wyattturner who had said of smith that he had a builtin radar set against danger and carraciolas voice had just started it up into instantaneous operation and had it working with a clarity and precision that would have turned decca green with envy schaffer smith called softly lieutenant schaffer are you there right here boss midwest accent schaffer to the life smiths radarscope went into high and had it been geared to warning bells hed have been deafened for life he dropped to hands and knees and crawled soundlessly forward he could see the floor of the station now the first thing that came into his vision was a bank of batteries then an outflung hand then gradually the rest of the spreadeagled form of schaffer another few inches forward and he sensed as much as saw a long finger pointing in his direction and flung himself to one side the wind from the lugers shell rifled his hair down below someone cursed in anger and frustration thats the last chance youll ever have carraciola smith said from where he lay he could just see schaffers face or the bloody mask that covered his face it was impossible to tell whether he was alive or dead he looked dead wrong again merely the postponement of a pleasure were leaving now smith im going to start the motor want schaffer to get his christiansen has the schmeisser on him dont try anything you make for that control panel smith said and your first step into my line of vision will be your last ill cut you down carraciola schaffers dead i can see hes dead hes damn all of the kind dead hes just been clobbered by a gun butt ill cut you down smith said monotonously goddam it i tell you hes not dead carraciola was exasperated now im going to kill you smith said quietly if i dont the first guards through that door surely will you can see what weve done to their precious schloss adler its well alight cant you guess the orders that have gone out shoot on sight any stranger shoot on sight and shoot to kill youre a stranger carraciola for gods sake will you listen to me there was desperation in the voice now i can prove it he is alive what can you see from up there the signal strengths of smiths danger radar set began to fade he said i can see schaffers head watch it then there was a thud and a silenced luger bounced to a stop a few inches from schaffers head a moment later carraciola himself came into smiths field of vision helooked up at smith and at the schmeisser muzzle staring down at him and said you wont be needing that he stooped over schaffer pinched his nose with one hand and clamped his other hand over the mouth within seconds the unconscious man fighting for the air that would not come began to move his head and to raise feeble hands in the direction of his face carraciola took his hands away looked up at smith and said dont forget christiansen has still that schmeisser on him carraciola walked confidently across to the control panel made the generator switch released the mechanical handbrake and engaged gear pushing the lever all the way across the cablecar leapt forward with a violent jerk carraciola ran for it jumped inside turned and slammed the door of the cablecar on the roof above smith laid down his useless schmeisser and pushed himself wearily to his feet his face was bleak and bitter well thats it then mary said her voice was unnaturally calm finish all finish operation overlord and us if that matters it matters to me smith took out his silenced automatic and held it in his good left hand keep an eye on junior here no for perhaps two dazed incredulous seconds that were the longest seconds she had ever known mary had quite failed to gather smiths intention when shocked understanding did come her voice rose to a scream no no for gods sake no smith ignored the heartbroken voice the desperate clutching hand and walked to the end of the flat section of the roof at the lower edge of the steeply sloping roof section the leading edge of the cablecar had just come into view a cablecar with inside it three men who were exchanging delighted grins and thumping one another joyously on the back smith ran down the icecoated pitch of the roof reached the edge and jumped the cablecar was already seven or eight feet beyond him and almost as far below had the cablecar not been going away from him he must surely have broken both legs as it was he landed with a jarring teethrattling crash a crash that caused the cablecar to shudder and sway and his legs to buckle and slide from beneath him on the icecoated roof his injured right hand failed to find a purchase on the suspension bracket and in his blindly despairing grab with his left hand he was forced to drop his luger it slid to the edge of the roof and fell away into the darkness of the valley below smith wrapped both arms round the suspension bracket and fought to draw some whooping gasps of air into his starving lungs he had been completely winded by the fall in their own way the three men inside the cablecar were as nearly stunned as smith himself the smiles had frozen on their faces and christiansens arm was still poised in midair where it had been arrested by the sound and the shock of smiths landing on the cablecar roof carraciola predictably was the first to recover and react he snatched the schmeisser from christiansen and pointed it upwards the cablecar was now forty to fifty feet clear of the castle and the high wind was beginning to swing it pendulumlike across the sky smith weakened by the impact of the fall the pain in his hand and the loss of blood hung on grimly and dizzily to the suspension bracket his body athwart the roof of the car he felt sick and exhausted and there seemed to be a mist in front of his eyes from shoulder to knee and only inches from his body a venomous burst of machinepistol fire stitched a pattern of holes in the cablecar roof the mists cleared away from smiths eyes more quickly than he would have believed possible a schmeisser magazine held far more shells than that they would wait a second or two to see if a falling body passed any of the side windows with that violently swinging transverse movement it was virtually impossible for anyone to fall off over the leading or trailing ends of the car and if none came then they would fire again but where what would be the next area of roof chosen for treatment would the gunman fire at random or to a systematic pattern it was impossible to guess perhaps at that very moment the muzzle of the schmeisser was only two inches from the middle of his spine the very thought was enough to galvanise smith into a quick roll that stretched him out over the line of holes that had just been made it was unlikely that the gunman would fire in exactly the same place again but even that was a gamble the gunman might figure just as smith was doing and traverse the same area again but he wasnt figuring the same as smiththe next burst was three feet away towards the trailing end of the car using the suspension bracket as support smith pulled himself to his feet until he was quite vertical hanging on to the cable itself this way the possible target area was lessened by eighty per cent quickly soundlessly sliding his hands along the cable he moved forward until he was standing at the very front of the car the cablecars angle of arc through the sky was increasing with every swing of the pendulum the purchase for his feet was minimal all the strain came on his arms and by far the greater part of that on his sound left arm there was nothing smoothly progressive about the cablecars sideways motion through the sky it jumped and jerked and jarred and jolted like a dervish dancer in the last seconds before total collapse the strain on the left arm was intolerable it felt as if the shoulder sinews were being torn apart but shoulder sinews are reparable whereas the effects of a schmeisser blast at point blank range were not and it seemed to smith highly unlikely that anybody would waste a burst on the particular spot where he was standing the obvious position for any roof passenger who didnt want to be shaken off into the valley below was flat out on the roof with his arms wrapped for dear life round one of the suspension arms support brackets his reasoning was correct there were three more bursts none of which came within feet of him and then no more smith knew that he would have to return to the comparative security of the suspension arm and return there soon he was nearly gone the grip of his left hand on the cable was weakening this forced him to strengthen the grip of his right hand and the resulting agony that travelled like an electric shock from his hand up his arm clear to the right hand side of his head served only to compound the weakness he would have to get back and he would have to get back now he prayed that the schmeissers magazine was empty and then and for another reason he knew that he had no option but to go now and he knew his prayer hadnt been answered the leading door of the cablecar opened and a head and a hand appeared the head was carraciolas the hand held the schmeisser carraciola was looking upwards even as he leaned out and he saw smith immediately he leaned farther out still swung the schmeisser onehandedly until the stock rested on his shoulder and squeezed the trigger under the circumstance accurate aiming was impossiblebut at a distance of four feet accurate aiming was the last thing that mattered smith had already let go of the cable and was flinging himself convulsively backward when the first of the bullets ripped off his left hand epaulette the second grazed his left shoulder a brief burning sensation but the rest of the burst passed harmlessly over his head he landed heavily stretched out blindly located and grasped one of the suspension arms and scuttled crablike round the base of the suspension arm until he had it and what little pathetic cover it offered between him and carraciola for carraciola was coming after him and carraciola was coming to make sure he had the gun still in his hand and that gun could have very few shells indeed left in the magazine it would be no part of carraciolas plan to waste any of those shells even as smith watched carraciola seemed to rise effortlessly three feet into the air a feat of levitation directly attributable to the powerful boost given him by thomas and christiansen jackknifed forward at hip level and flattened his body on top of the cablecar roof his legsstill dangled over the leading edge a suicidal move smith thought in brief elation carraciola had made a fatal mistake with neither hand hold nor purchase on that icecoated roof he must slide helplessly over the edge at the first jerk or jolt of the cablecar but the elation was brief indeed for carraciola had made no mistake he had known what smith hadnt where to find a secure lodgement for his hand on the smooth expanse of that roof within seconds his scrabbling fingers had found safety a gash in the cablecar roof that had been torn open by one of the bursts from the schmeisser carraciolas fingers hooked securely and he pulled himself forward until he was in a kneeling position his toes hooked over the leading edge smith reached up with his wounded hand and claweddesperately for a grenade in the canvas bag slung over his left shoulder at the same time pushing himself as far back as his anchoring left hand clutched round a suspension bracket would permit at that range a grenade could do almost as much damage to himself as to carraciola his legs slid back until his feet projected over the trailing edge and he cried out in pain as a tremendous pressure a bonebreaking skin tearing pressure was applied to his shins halfway between knees and feet someone had him by the ankles and that someone seemed determined to separate his feet from the rest of his body smith twisted his head round but all he could see was a pair of hands round his ankles knuckles bonewhite in the faint wash of moonlight and no one mans weight smith realised could have caused that agonising pain in his shins his companion must had had him by the waist whether to increase the pressure or to ensure his safety if smith did slide over the end the reasons were immaterial the effect was the same he tried to draw up his legs but with a pinning weight of well over ibs any movement was quite impossible smith risked a quick glance forward but carraciola hadnt moved the cablecar was now halfway between the header station and the top pylon the pendulum swing was at its maximum and carraciola still in his kneeling position was hanging on for his life smith abandoned his attempt to reach for a grenade which could now serve no purpose whatsoever unsheathed his knife clasped the haft in the three good fingers of his right hand twisted round and tried to strike at those hands that were causing him such excruciating agony he couldnt get within fifteen inches of them his legs were breaking his left arm was breaking and his clenched grip on the support was slowly beginning to open he had only seconds to go smith knew and so he had nothing in the world to lose he changed his grip on his knife caught the tip of the blade between his broken thumb and the rest of his fingers turned and threw the knife as powerfully and as accurately as his smashed hand and paindimmed eyes would permit the stinging pain in his left ankle and the scream of pain from the trailing door were simultaneous immediately all the pressure on his ankles vanished a second later christiansen whom thomas had managed to drag back inside the cablecar was staring stupidly at the knife that transfixed his right wrist in that one instant smith had won and he had lost or so it most surely seemed for he was defenceless now carraciola had bided his time calculated his chances and flung himself forward until he had reached the safety of the suspension bracket now he pulled himself slowly to his feet his left arm roundthe suspension arm itself his left leg twined securely round one of the brackets the schmeisser pointed into smiths face only one bullet left carraciolas smile was almost pleasant i had to make sure you see perhaps he hadnt lost smith thought perhaps he hadnt lost after all because of the pinioning effect of christiansens hands on his ankles hed been unaware until now how much less difficult it had become to maintain position on that icesheathed roof unaware how much the pendulum swaying of the cablecar had been reduced and it seemed that even now carraciola was still unaware of it or if the change of motion had registered with him the reason for it had not with a conscious effort of will smith shifted his by now halfhypnotised gaze from the staring muzzle of the schmeisser to a point just over carraciolas shoulder the suspension arm of the first pylon was less than twenty feet away too bad smith carraciola steadied the barrel of his machine pistol comes to us all be seeing you look behind you smith said carraciola halfsmiled in weary disbelief that anyone should try that ancient one on him smith glanced briefly a second time over carraciolas shoulder winced and looked away the disbelief vanished from carraciolas face as if a light had been switched off some sixth sense or instantaneous flash of comprehension or just some sudden certainty of knowledge made him twist round and glance over his shoulder he cried out in terror the last sound he ever made the steel suspension arm of the pylon smashed into his back both his back and intertwined leg broke with a simultaneous crack that could have been heard a hundred yards away one second later he was swept from the roof of the cablecar but by that time carraciola was already dead from the open rearward door of the car thomas and christiansen their shocked faces mirroring their stunned disbelief watched the broken body tumbling down into the darkness of the valley below shaking like a man with the ague and moving like an old man in a dream smith slowly and painfully hauled himself forward until he was in a sitting position with an arm and leg wound round one of the after arms of the supporting bracket still in the same dreamlike slow motion he lifted his head and gazed down the valley the other cablecar moving upvalley on its reciprocal course had just passed the lowermost of the three pylons with luck his own cablecar might be the first to arrive at the central pylon with luck not of course that the question of luck entered into it any more he had no options or alternatives left he had to do what he had to do and luck was the last factor to be taken into consideration from his kitbag smith extracted two packets of plastic explosives and wedged them firmly between the roof of the car and the two after arms of the suspension bracket making sure that the tear strip igniters were exposed and ready to hand then he braced himself sitting upright against the suspension bracket using both arms and legs to anchor himself and prepared to sit it out once more as the cablecar approaching midsection of its second lap between the first and central pylons steadily increased its swaying angle of arc across the night sky it was foolish of him he knew to sit like that the snow had momentarily stopped and the full moon riding palely in an empty sky was flooding the valley with a wash of ghostly light sitting as he was he must he realised be clearly visible from either the castle or the lower station but apart from the fact that he doubted whether concealment mattered any longer he knew there was nothing he could do about it there wasnt the strength left in his one good arm to allow him to assume the prone spreadeagled position that he and schaffer had used on the way up he wondered about schaffer wondered about him in a vaguely woolly detached way for which exhaustion loss of blood and the bitter cold were almost equally responsible he wondered about the others too about the elderly man and the girl perched on top of the header station roof about the two men inside the cablecar but mary and carnabyjones were helpless to do anything to help and the chances of the unarmed thomas and christiansen carrying out another rooftop sortie were remote indeed carraciola had carried a schmeisser and they had seen what had happened to carraciola schaffer it was schaffer who mattered schaffer was feeling even more vague and woolly than smith if for different reasons he was waking slowly and painfully from a very bad dream and in this dream he could taste salt in his mouth and hear a soft urgent feminine voice calling his name calling it over and over again in normal times schaffer would have been all for soft feminine voices urgent or not but he wished that this one would stop for it was all part of the bad dream and in this bad dream someone had split his head in half and he knew the pain wouldnt go until he woke up he moaned put the palms of his hands on the floor and tried to prop himself up it took a long time it took an eternity for someone had laid one of the girders from the forth bridge across his back but at last he managed to straighten both his arms his head hanging down between them his head didnt feel right it didnt even feel like his head for apart from the fact that there seemed to be a butchers cleaver stuck in it it seemed to be stuffed with cotton wool grey and fuzzy round the edges he shook his head to clear it and this was a mistake for the top of his head fell off or so it felt to schaffer as the blinding coruscation of multicoloured lights before his eyes arranged themselves into oddly kaleidoscopic patterns he opened his eyes and the patterns dimmed and the lights began to fade gradually beneath his eyes the pattern of floorboards began to resolve themselves and on the board the outlines of hands his own hands he was awake but this was one of those bad dreams which stayed with you even when you were awake he could still taste salt the salt of blood his head still felt as if one incautious shake would have it rolling across the floor and that soft and urgent voice was still calling lieutenant schaffer lieutenant schaffer wake up lieutenant wake up can you hear me hed heard that voice before schaffer decided but he couldnt place it it must have been a long time ago he twisted his head to locate the source of the voice it seemed to come from above and the kaleidoscopic whirligig of colours were back in position again revolving more quickly than ever headshaking and headtwisting schaffer decided were contraindicated he returned his head slowly to its original position managed to get his knees under him crawled forward in the direction of some dimlyseen piece of machinery and hauled himself shakily to his feet lieutenant lieutenant schaffer im up here schaffer turned and lifted his head in an almost grotesque slow motion and this time the whole universe of brightly dancing stars was reduced to the odd constellation or two he recognised the voice from the distant past now it was that of mary ellison he even thought he recognised the pale strained face looking down from above but he couldnt be sure his eyes werent focusing as they should he wondered dizzily what the hell she was doing up there staring down at him through what appeared to be the bars of a shattered skylight his mind he dimly realised was operating with all the speed and subtle fluency of a man swimming upstream against a river of black molasses are you are you all right mary asked schaffer considered this ridiculous question carefully i expect i shall be he said with great restraint what happened they hit you with your own gun thats right schaffer nodded and immediately wished he hadnt he gingerly fingered a bruise on the back of his head in the face i must have struck my head as he broke off and turned slowly to face the door what was that a dog it sounded like a dog barking thats what i thought his voice slurred and indistinct he staggered drunkenly across to the lower iron door and put his ear to it dogs he said lots of dogs and lots and lots of hammering sledgehammers like enough he left the door and walked back to the centre of the floor still staggering slightly theyre on to us and theyre coming for us wheres the major he went after them the voice was empty of all feeling he jumped on to the top of the cablecar he did eh schaffer received the news as if smiths action had been the most natural and inevitable thing in the world how did he make out how did he make there was life back in her voice now a shocked anger at schaffers apparent callousness she checked herself and said there was a fight and i think someone fell off the roof i dont know who it was it was one of them schaffer said positively one of how can you say that the major smiths of this world dont drive over the edge of a cliff quotation from the future mrs schaffer the major smiths of this world dont fall off the roofs of cablecars quotation from the future mrs schaffers future husband youre recovering mary said coldly but i think youre right theres still someone sitting on top of the cablecar and it wouldnt be one of them would it how do you know theres someone sitting because i can see him she said impatiently its bright moonlight look for yourself schaffer looked for himself then rubbed a weary forearm across aching eyes i have news for you love he said i cant even see the damn cablecar the cablecar was ten yards away from the central pylon smith upright now stooped tore off the two friction fuses straightened and holding the cable in his left hand took up position just on the inner side of the car roof at the last moment he released his grip on the cable and stretched both arms out before him to break the impact of his body against the suspension arm the ascending car on the other cable was now almost as close to the central pylon as his own it didnt seem possible that he could make it in time the impact of the horizontal suspension arm drove the thought from his mind and all the breath from his body had it not been for the buffering effect of his outstretched arms smith was sure some of his ribs must have gone as it was he was almost completely winded but he forced himself to ignore the pain and his heaving lungs demand for oxygen swung his feet up till they rested on the lower crossgirder hooked his hands round the upper girder and made his way quickly across to the other side at least his hands and his feet moved quickly but the steel was so thickly coated in clear smooth ice that his scrabbling feet could find almost no purchase whatsoever on the lower girder he had reached no farther than the middle when the ascending car began to pass under its suspension arm for the first time that night smith blessed the brightness of the moon he took two more slipping sliding steps and launched himself towards the icecoated cable that glittered so brightly in the pale moonlight his left hand caught the cable his right arm hooked over it and the cable itself caught him high up on the chest he had made no mistake about the location of his hand and arm but his sliding takeoff had caused his body to fall short and the cable slid up under his chin with a jerk that threatened to decapitate him his legs swung out far beneath him swung back and touched the roof as he lowered himself to the full extent of his left arm he released his grip on the cable dropped on all fours and reached out blindly but successfully for one of the arms of the suspension bracket for long seconds he knelt there retching uncontrollably as he was flooded by the nausea and pain from his throat and still winded lungs then by and by the worst of it passed and he lay face down on the floor as the cablecar began to increase its pendulum swing with the increasing distance from the central pylon he would not have believed that a man could be so totally exhausted and yet still have sufficient residual strength and sufficient selfpreservation instinct to hang on to that treacherous and precarious handhold on that icecoated roof long seconds passed and some little measure of strength began to return to his limbs and body wearily he hauled himself up into a sitting position twisted round and gazed back down the valley the cablecar he had so recently abandoned was now hardly more than fifty yards from the lowermost pylon thomas and christiansen sat huddled in the middle the latter wrapping a makeshift bandage round his injured hand both fore and aft doors were still open as they were when the abortive attack on smith had been made that neither of the two men had ventured near the extremities of the car to try to close either of the doors was proof enough of the respect if not fear in which smith was now held from the roof of the cablecar came a brilliant flash of light magnesiumblinding in its white intensity simultaneously there came the sound of two sharp explosions so close together as to be indistinguishable in time the two rear supports of the suspension bracket broke and the car suspended now by only the two front supports tilted violently the front going up the rear down inside the angle of the floor of the car changed in an instant from the horizontal to at least thirty degrees christiansen was flung back towards the still open rear door he grabbed despairingly at the side but he grabbed with his wounded hand soundlessly he vanished through the open doorway and as soundlessly fell to the depths of the valley below thomas with two sound hands and faster reactions had succeeded in saving himself for the moment he glanced up and saw where the roof was beginning to buckle and break as the forward two suspension arm support brackets now subjected to a wrenching lateral pressure they had never been designed to withstand began to tear their retaining bolts free thomas struggled up the steeply inclined floor till he stood in the front doorway because of the tilt of the car now almost є as the front supports worked loose the leading edge of the roof was almost touching the car thomas reached up grabbed the cable with both hands and had just cleared his legs from the doorway when the two front supports tore free fram the roof in a rending screech of metal the cablecar fell away slowly turning end over end despite the cables violent buffeting caused by the sudden release of the weight of the car thomas had managed to hang on he twisted round and saw the suspension arm of the lowest pylon only feet away the sudden numbing of all physical and mental faculties was accurately and shockingly reflected in the frozen fear of his face the lips drawn back in a snarling rictus of terror the knuckles of the hands gleamed like burnished ivory and then suddenly there were no hands there just the suspension arm and the empty wire and a long fading scream in the night as his cablecar approached the header station smith edged well forward to clear the lip of the roof from where he crouched it was impossible to see the east wing of the schloss adler but if the columns of dense smoke now drifting across the valley were anything to go by the fire seemed to have an unshakable hold clouds were again moving across the moon and this could be both a good thing and a bad thing a good thing in that it would afford them cover and help obscure those dense clouds of smoke a bad thing in that it was bound to highlight the flames from the burning castle it could only be a matter of time smith reflected before the attention of someone in the village or the barracks beyond was caught by the fire or the smoke or he thought grimly by the increasing number of muffled explosions coming from the castle itself he wondered what might be the cause of them schaffer hadnt had the time to lay all those distractions the roof of the cablecar cleared the level of the floor of the header station and smith sagged in relief as he saw the figure standing by the controls of the winch schaffer a rather battered and bent schaffer it was true an unsteady schaffer a schaffer with one side of his face masked in blood a schaffer who from his peering and screwedup expression had obviously some difficulty in focusing his gaze but undoubtedly schaffer and as nearly a going concern as made no odds smith felt energy flow back into him he hadnt realised just how heavily he had come to depend on the american with schaffer by his side it was going to take a great deal to stop them now smith glanced up as the roof of the header station came into view mary and carnabyjones were still there pressed back against the castle wall he us ted a hand in greeting but they gave no sign in return ghosts returning from the dead smith thought wryly werent usually greeted by a wave of the hand schaffer for all the trouble he was having with his eyes and his still obviously dazed condition seemed to handle the winch controls immaculately it may have been and probably was the veriest fluke but he put the gear lever in neutral and applied the brake to bring the cablecar to rest exactly halfway in under the lip of the roof first mary and then jones came sliding down the nylon rope on to the roof of the car jones with his eyes screwed tightly shut neither of them spoke a word not even when schaffer had brought them up inside and they had slid down on to the floor of the station hurry hurry smith flung open the rear door of the cable car inside all of you he retrieved schaffers luger from the floor then whirled round as he heard the furious barking of dogs followed by the sound of heavy sledges battering against the iron door leading from the station the first of the two defences must have been carried away now the second was under siege mary and a stumbling schaffer were already inside the cablecar jones however had made no move to go he stood there smiths schmeisser in his hand listening to the furious hammering on the door his face seemed unconcerned he said apologetically im not very good at heights im afraid but this is different get inside smith almost hissed the words no jones shook his head you hear theyll be through any minute ill stay for gods sake smith shouted in exasperation im twenty years older than any of you well theres that smith nodded consideringly held out his right hand said mr jones good luck brought across his left hand and halfdragged halfcarried the dazed jones into the cablecar smith moved quickly across to the controls engaged gear all the way released the handbrake and ran after the moving car as they moved out from below the roof of the station the sound of the assault on the inner door seemed to double in its intensity in the schloss adler smith reflected there would be neither pneumatic chisels nor oxyacetylene equipment for there could be no conceivable call for either but even so it didnt seem to matter with all the best will in the world a couple of iron hasps couldnt for long withstand an attack of that nature thoughtfully smith closed the rear door schaffer was seated his elbows on his knees his head in his hands mary was kneeling on the floor joness head in her lap looking down at the handsome silveryhaired head he couldnt see her expression but was dolefully certain that she was even then preparing a homily about the shortcomings of bullies who went around clobbering elderly and defenceless american actors almost two minutes passed in complete silence before carnabyjones stirred and when he did mary herself stirred and looked up at smith to his astonishment she had a halfsmile on her face its all right she said ive counted ten in the circumstances it was the only argument to use she paused and the smile faded i thought you were gone then you werent the only one after this i retire ive used up a lifetimes luck in the past fifteen minutes youre not looking so bright yourself im not feeling so bright her face was pale and strained as she braced herself against the wild lurching of the cablecar if you want to know im seasick i dont go much on this form of travel smith tapped the roof you want to try travelling steerage on one of those he said feelingly youd never complain about firstclass travel again ah pylon number two coming up almost halfway only halfway a pause what happens if they break through that door up there reverse the gear lever and up we go like it or not like it or not carnabyjones struggled slowly to a sitting position gazed uncomprehendingly around him until he realised where he was rubbed his jaw tenderly and said to smith that was a dirty trick it was all of that smith acknowledged im sorry im not jones smiled shakily somehow i dont really think im cut out to be a hero neither am i brother neither am i schaffer said mournfully he lifted his head from his hands and looked slowly around his eyes were still glassy and only partially focusing but a little colour was returning to his right cheek the one that wasnt masked in blood our three friends what became of our three friends dead dead schaffer groaned and shook his head tell me about it sometime but not now he doesnt know what hes missing smith said unsympathetically the drama of it all escapes him which is perhaps just as well is the door up above there still standing or are the hinges or padlocks going is someone rushing towards the winch controls is there stop it marys voice was sharp highpitched and carried overtonesof hysteria stop talking like that sorry smith said contritely he reached out and touched her shoulder just whistling in the dark thats all here comes the last pylon another minute or so and were home and dry home and dry schaffer said bitterly wait till i have that savoy grill menu in my hand then ill be home and dry some people are always thinking of their stomachs smith observed at that moment he was thinking of his own and it didnt feel any too good no stomach does when it feels as if it has a solid lead ball a chilled lead ball lodged in it with an icy hand squeezing from the outside his heart was thumping slowly heavily painfully in his chest and he was having difficulty in speaking for all the saliva seemed to have evaporated from his mouth he became suddenly aware that he was unconsciously leaning backward bracing himself for themoment when the cablecar jerked to a standstill then started climbing back up to the schloss adler again ill count to ten he said to himself then if we get that far without being checked ill count to nine and then and then he caught sight of marys face a deadwhite scared and almost haggard face that made her look fifteen years older than she was and felt suddenly ashamed of himself he sat on the bench and squeezed her shoulder well be all right he said confidently all of a sudden he found it easy to speak again uncle john has just said so hasnt he you wait and see she looked up at him trying to smile is uncle john always right always smith said firmly twenty seconds passed smith rose to his feet walked to the front of the cablecar and peered down though the moon was obscured he could just dimly discern the shape of the lower station he turned to look at the others they were all looking at him not much more than a hundred feet to go smith said im going to open that door in a minute well a few seconds by that time we wont be much more than fifteen feet above the ground twenty at the most if the car stops we jump theres two or three feet of snow down there should cushion our fall enough to give an even chance of not breaking anything schaffer parted his lips to make some suitable remark thought better of it and returned head to hands in weary silence smith opened the leading door did his best to ignore the icy blast of wind that gusted in through the opening and looked vertically downwards realising that he had been overoptimistic in his assessment of the distance between cablecar and ground the distance was at least fifty feet a distance sufficient to arouse in even the most optimistic mind dismaying thoughts of fractured femurs and tibias and then he dismissed the thought for an even more dismaying factor had now to be taken into consideration in the far distance could be heard the sound of sirens in the far distance could be seen the wavering beams of approaching headlamps schaffer lifted his head the muzziness had now left him even if his sore head had not enter left reinforcements he announced this wasnt on the schedule boss radio gone telephone gone helicopter gone just oldfashioned smith pointed towards the rear window theyre using smoke signals jeez schaffer stared out the rear windows his voice awe struck for stone it sure burns good schaffer was in no way exaggerating for stone it burnt magnificently the schloss adler was well and truly alight a conflagration in which smoke had suddenly become an inconsiderable and indeed a very minor element it was wreathed in flames almost lost to sight in flames towering flames that now reached up almost to the top of the great round tower to the northeast perched on its volcanic plug halfway up the mountainside against the dimly seen backdrop of the unseen heights of the weissspitze the blazing castle its effulgence now beginning to light up the entire valley and quite drowning out the pale light of a moon again showing through was an incredibly fantastic sight from some equally incredible and fantastic fairy tale one trusts that they are well insured schaffer said he was on his feet now peering down towards the lower station how far boss and how far down thirty feet maybe twentyfive and fifteen feet down the lights of the leading cars were passing the still smouldering embers of the station we have it made lieutenant schaffer we have it made schaffer cursed and staggered as the car jerked to a violent and abrupt stop almost that is all out smith shouted all out there speaks the eternal shop steward schaffer said stand back ive got two good hands he brushed by smith clutched the door jamb with his left hand pulled mary towards him transferred his grip from waist to wrist and dropped her out through the leading door lowering her as far as the stretch of his left arm would permit when he let her go she had less than three feet to fall within three seconds he had done the same with carnabyjones the cablecar jerked and started to move back up the valley schaffer practically bundled smith out of the car wincing in pain as he momentarily took all of smiths two hundred pound weight then slid out of the doorway himself hung momentarily from the doorway at the full stretch of his arms then dropped six feet into the soft yielding snow he staggered but maintained balance smith was beside him he had fished out a plastic explosive from the bag on his back and torn off the friction fuse he handed the package to schaffer and said you have a good right arm i have a good right arm horses no baseball yes schaffer took aim and lobbed the explosive neatly through the doorway of the disappearing cablecar like that like that come on smith turned and catching mary by the arm while schaffer hustled carnabyjones along ran down the side of the lower station and into the shelter of the nearest house bare seconds before a command car followed by several trucks crammed with soldiers slid to a skidding halt below the lower station soldiers piled out of the trucks following an officer clearly identifiable as colonel weissner up the steps into the lower station the castle burned more fiercely than ever a fire obviously totally out of control suddenly there was the sharp crack of an explosion and the ascending cablecar burst into flames the car halfway up to the first pylon swung in great arcs across the valley its flames fanned by the wind and climbed steadily upwards into the sky until its flame was lost in the greater flame of the schloss adler crouched in the shelter of the house schaffer touched smiths arm sure you wouldnt like to go and burn down the station as well come on smith said the garage colonel wyattturner leaned over in the copilots seat pressed his face against the sidescreen and stared down unhappily at the ground the mosquito bomber all engines and plywood was he was well aware the fastest warplane in the world even so he hadnt been prepared for anything quite so fast as this normal flying of course imparts no sensation of speed but then wing commander carpenter wasnt engaged in normal flying he was engaged in what wyattturner regarded as highly abnormal flying and flying moreover that was liable to bring them to disaster at any second carpenter was giving a groundlevel performance of some spectacular note skimming across fields brushing treetops skirting small hills that stood in his way and wyattturner didnt like any of it one little bit what he liked even less was the appalling speed of their own moonshadow flitting over the ground beneath them and what he liked least of all was the increasing number of occasions on which plane and shadow came within almost touching distance of each other in an effort to keep his mind off what must inevitably happen when and if the gap were finally closed he withdrew his almost mesmerised stare and glanced at his watch twentyfive minutes he looked at the relaxed figure in the pilots seat at the worldweary face that contrasted so oddly with the magnificent panache of the red handlebar moustache can you make it in time i can make it carpenter said comfortably point is will they god only knows i dont see how they can both the admiral and i are convinced that theyre trapped in the schloss adler besides the whole countryside must be up in arms by this time what chance can they have and that is why you came i sent them wyattturner said emptily he glanced through the sidescreen and recoiled as plane and shadow seemed to touch as they skimmed over the top of a pine forest he said plaintively must you fly so close to the damned ground enemy radar old chap carpenter said soothingly were safer down here among the bushes smith with mary and jones behind him and schaffer bringing up the rear skirted the backs of the houses on the east side of the village street and cautiously made their way through the automobile junkyard to the rear double doors of sulzs garage smith had his skeleton keys in his hand and was just reaching for the padlock when one of the doors opened quietly inwards heidi stood there she stared at them as if they were creatures from another world then up at the burning castle then wordlessly questioningly at smith all here in black and white smith patted his tunic into the bus smith waited till they had filed through the door closed it crossed to a small barred window at the front of the garage and peered out cautiously the street was packed with a milling crowd of people most of them soldiers nearly all unarmed men who had come hurrying out from the various weinstuben to watch the burning schloss adler but there were plenty of armed soldiers nearby two truckloads not thirty yards from the garage not to mention three more truckloads even farther up the street at the foot of the lower station farther down the street a motorcycle patrol was parked outside zum wilden hirsch the one real physical obstacle in the way of their escape was a small command car manned parked directly outside the doors of sulzs garage smith looked at the car thoughtfully decided that this was an obstacle that could be overcome he withdrew from the window and crossed over to the doors to check that the four bolts were still withdrawn mary and carnabyjones had already made their way into the bus as heidi went to follow schaffer caught her by the shoulders kissed her briefly and smiled at her she looked at him in surprise well arent you glad to see me schaffer demanded ive had a terrible time up there good god girl i might have been killed not as handsome as you were two hours ago she smiled gently touched his face where carraciolas handiwork with the schmeisser had left its bloody mark and added over her shoulder as she climbed into the bus and thats as long as youve known me two hours ive aged twenty years tonight and that lady is one helluva long courtship oh god he watched in wearily resigned despair as smith climbed into the drivers seat and switched on the ignition here we go for another twenty on the floor everyone how about you heidi asked me schaffers surprise seemed genuine he smashed the front window with the butt of the schmeisser reversed the gun released the trigger and knelt on the floor im the conductor its against regulations the middle finger of smiths bloodstained bandaged hand readied for the starter button and the big diesel caught at once smith started to back towards the rear of the garage two perfectly good cars a mercedes and an opel lay in his way and by the time that smith whose expression betrayed no awareness of their presence reached the back of the garage neither were fit for anything other than the scrapheap that lay beyond the rear doors smith stopped engaged first gear revved up the engine and let in the clutch with a bang the bus jerked forward gathering speed as it went smith aimed the angled point of the massive snowplough at the junction of the double doors and for all the resistance the doors offered they might have been made of brown paper with a splintering crash that sent shattered doorplanks flying through the air like so much confetti the bus roared out into the street smith spinning the wheel violently to theright as they careened into the crowded thoroughfare crowded the thoroughfare might have been but the pedestrians the rubberneckers gazing at the funeral pyre of the schloss adler had had at least sufficient warning given them by the accelerating clamour of the postbuss diesel to fling themselves clear as the bus came crashing through the doors but the command car had no such opportunity for escape before either of the two occupants of the front seat a sergeant with his hands resting lightly on the wheel a major with a radio telephone in one hand a thin cigar with a long ash in the other were properly aware of what was happening their car was swept up and carried away on the postbuss snowplough for fifteen perhaps even twenty yards the command car was carried along precariously balanced on the broad blade of the snowplough before dropping off to one side miraculously enough it landed on even keel all four wheels still on the ground the dazed major still had the telephone in one hand the cigar in the other he hadnt even lost the ash from his cigar farther down the street outside zum wilden hirsch a group of alpenkorps motorcyclists standing just outside the door stared incredulously up the street their first reaction their immediate conclusion was either that zep salzmann the highly popular driver of the postbus had gone mad or that the accelerator had jammed on the floorboards disillusionment was rapid they heard the unmistakable sound of an engine changing up quickly through the gears and caught a brief glimpse of smith hunched over the steering wheel and of schaffer crouched behind the schmeisser sticking out through the righthand shattered windscreen then the postbuss headlamps switched on and they could see no more but they had seen enough one quick command from their sergeant and the motorcycle patrol leapt for their machines began to kick them into life but smith also had seen enough he blew a warning blast on his town horn twisted the wheel and slewed the bus into the side of the street his intentions were unmistakable and the motorcycle patrols decision to elect for discretion in lieu of suicidal valour was as immediate as it was automatic they frantically abandoned their machines and flung themselves for their lives up the steps of zum wilden hirsch there was a thunderous series of metallic bangs interspersed with the eldritch screeches of torn and tortured metal as the snowplough smashed into the motorcycles and swept them along in its giant maw as smith straightened out into the middle of the road again several of them slid off the angled blade and crashed with a great splintering of wood and buckling of metal into the boarded sidewalk the machines were no longer recognisable as motorcycles two of them however still remained perched on the blade the postbus was still accelerating with smiths accelerator foot flat on the floorboards the headlamps were flashing rapidly alternately main beam and dipped and the streets ahead were clearing with corresponding rapidity but the moment when the last few straggling pedestrians were galvanished into jumping for safety came when smith switched on the alpine horn in the mountains the alpine postbus has absolute priority over every other vehicle in the road and its penetrating and stentorian threetoned posthorn is the symbol of its total authority of its unquestioned right to complete priority at all times the sound of that horn whether the postbus is in sight or not is the signal for all vehicles or pedestrians to stop or move well into the side of the road a signal that is immediately and automatically obeyed for the absolute entitlement to the right of way of the official postbus is deeply ingrained into the minds of all alpine dwellers and has been from earliest childhood a magic wand might have made a better job of clearing that village street but not all that much better vehicles and pedestrians alike pressed into the sides of the street as if some powerful magnetic affinity had just been developed between them and the walls of the houses the expression on faces ranged from astonishment to blank incomprehension hostility there was none there had been no time for any to develop for events were moving far too swiftly and comprehension hadnt even begun to overtake the events the bus had now reached the end of the village street and still not one shot had been fired at the sharp lefthand corner at the foot of the street the two remaining motorcycles slid off the snowplough and smashed into a low stone wall two more absolute certainties smith thought inconsequentially for the automobile cemetery behind sulzs garage ahead of him now he could see the road stretch almost arrowstraight alongside the dark waters of the blau see he switched off the alpine horn button changed his mind and switched it on again that horn was worth a pair of machineguns any day dont you know any other tunes schaffer asked irritably he shivered in the icy blast from the smashed front window and sat on the floor to get what little shelter he could give me a call when you require my services a mile from now id say what do you mean a mile from now the barrack gates that guy in the command car had a radio phone he had had he smith spared him a brief glance why didnt you shoot him im a changed man boss schaffer sighed something splendid has just come into my life besides you didnt have a chance besides as you say i didnt have a chance schaffer twisted round and looked through the rear windows of the bus for signs of pursuit but the road behind them was empty for all that schaffer reflected the rearward view was one not lacking in interest the schloss adler now completely enveloped in flames a reddishwhite inferno by this time lighting up for half a mile around the startling incongruity of its snow and ice covered setting was clearly beyond saving arsonists dream or firemans nightmare the castle was finished before dawn it would be an empty and desolate shell a gaunt and blackened ruin to haunt and desecrate for generations to come the loveliest fairytale valley he had ever seen schaffer shortened his gaze and tried to locate the three others but all were on the floor under seats and completely concealed he cursed as the shaking and shuddering bus lurched violently throwing him against the righthand front door then straightened and peered at the illuminated dashboard god save us all he said piously ninety kilometres smith said patiently ah schaffer said as he watched smiths foot move quickly from accelerator to brake hoisted a wary eye over the lower edge of the shattered windscreen and whistled softly the barrack gates were barely two hundred yards away both the area around the guardhouse and the parade ground beyond were brilliantly illuminated by overhead floodlamps scores of armed soldiers seemed to be running around in purposeless confusion a totally erroneous impression as schaffer almost immediately realised they were running towards and scrambling aboard trucks and command cars and they werent wasting any time about it either a hive of activity and no mistake schaffer observed i wonder he broke off his eyes widening a giant tank came rumbling into view past the guardhouse turned right on to the road stopped swivelled є on its tracks completely blocking the road the gun turret moved fractionally until it was lined up on the headlights of the approaching bus oh my gosh schaffers shocked whisper was just audible over the fading sound of the postbuss diesel a tiger tank and thats an millimetre cannon boss its not a popgun and thats a fact smith agreed flat on the floor he reached forward pulled a switch and the eighteeninch long semaphore indicator began to wave gently up and down smith first dipped his main headlights then switched them off altogether covering the last thirty yards on sidelamps alone and praying that all those signs of peaceful normality might help to keep nervous fingers away from the firing button of the most lethal tank cannon ever devised the fingers for whatever reason left the button alone smith slowed to a walking pace turned right through the guardhouse gates and stopped taking care to keep his injured right hand well out of sight he wound down his window and leaned out left elbow over the sill as three guards led by a sergeant and all with machinepistols at the ready closed in on the drivers cab quickly smith shouted telephone surgeon to the sickbay he jerked his thumb over his shoulder colonel weissner they got him twice through the lungs for gods sake dont just stand there but but the postbus the sergeant protested we had a call from drunk by god smith swore savagely hell be courtmartialled in the morning his voice dropped menacingly and you if the colonel dies move smith engaged gear and drove off still at walking pace the sergeant reassured by the sight of a majors uniform the fact that the bus was moving into the barracks the slow speed with which it was moving and above all by the authoritative clamour of the alpine horn which smith still had not switched off ran for the nearest phone still crawling along in first gear smith carefully edged the postbus through the press of men and machines past a column of booted and gauntleted soldiers mounted on motorcycles past armoured vehicles and trucks all with engines already running some already moving towards the gates but not moving as quickly towards the gates as smith would have wished ahead of the postbus was a group of officers most of them obviously senior talking animatedly smith slowed down the bus even more and leaned from the window theyre trapped he called excitedly upstairs in zum wilden hirsch theyve got colonel weissner as hostage hurry for gods sake he broke off as he suddenly recognised one of the officers as the alpenkorps captain to whom in his temporary capacity of major bernd himmler hed spoken in zum wilden hirsch earlier that evening a second later the recognition was mutual the captains mouth fell open in total incredulity and before he had time to close it smiths foot was flat on the accelerator and the bus heading for the southern gates soldiers flinging themselves to both sides to avoid the scything sweep of the giant snowplough such was the element of surprise that fully thirty yards had been covered before most of the back windows of the bus were holed and broken the shattering of glass mingling with the sound of the ragged fusillade of shots from behind and then smith wrenching desperately on the wheel came careering through the southern gates back on to the main road giving them at least temporary protection from the sharpshooters on the parade ground but they had it seemed only changed from the frying pan to the fire temporary protection they might have obtained from one enemy but from another and far deadlier enemy they had no protection at all smith all but lost control of the bus as something struck a glancing blow low down on his cab door ricocheted off into the night with a viciously screaming whine and exploded in a white sash of snowflurried light less than fifty yards ahead the tiger tank schaffer shouted that goddamned millimetre get down smith jackknifed down and to one side of the wheel until his eyes were only an inch above the foot of the windscreen that one was low the next one the next one came through the top of the back door traversed the length of the bus and exited through the front of the roof just above the windscreen this time there was no explosion a dud schaffer said hopefully or maybe a dummy practice dummy nothing upright again smith was swinging the bus madly dangerously from side to side of the road in an attempt to confuse the tank gunners aim armourpiercing shells laddie designed to go through two inches of steel plate in a tank before they explode he winced and ducked low as a third shell took out most of the lefthand windows of the bus showering himself and schaffer with a flying cloud of shattered glass fragments just let one of those shells strike a chassis member instead of thin sheet metal or the engine block or the snowplough dont schaffer begged just let it creep up on me all unbeknownst like he paused then continued taking his time isnt he lining up for the sunday one no smith glanced in the rearview mirror and steadied the wildly swaying bus up on a steadier course never thought id be glad to see a few carloads or track loads of alpenkorps coming after me he changed into top gear and pushed the accelerator to the floor im happy to make an exception this time schaffer turned and looked through the shattered rear windows he could count at least three pairs of headlights on the road behind them with two others swinging out through the southern gates between them they effectively blotted the postbus from the view of the tank gunner happy isnt the word for it me im ecstatic tiger tanks are one thing but little itsybitsy trucks are another schaffer strode rapidly down the central aisle passing by mary heidi and carnabyjones all of whom were struggling rather shakily to their feet and looked at the crates stacked in the rear seats six crates he said to heidi and we asked for only two honey youre going to make me the happiest man alive he opened the rear door and began to empty the contents of the crate on to the road a few of the bottles just bounced harmlessly on ridges of hardpacked snow but the speed of the bus was now such that most of them shattered on impact the first of the two leading pursuit cars was within three hundred yards of the bus when it ran into the area of broken glass from schaffers point of view it was impossible to tell what exactly happened but such indications as could be gathered by longrange sight and sound were satisfying enough the headlights of the leading car suddenly began to slew violently from side to side the screeching of brakes was clearly audible above the sound of the postbuss diesel but not nearly as loud as the rending crash of metal as the second car smashed into the rear of the first for a few seconds both cars seemed locked together then they skidded wildly out of control coming to rest with the nose of the first car in the right hand ditch the tail of the second in the left hand ditch the headlamps of both cars had failed just after the moment of impact but there was more than sufficient illumination from the lamps of the first of the tracks coming up behind them to show that the road was completely blocked neat schaffer said admiringly very neat schaffer he called to smith thatll hold them boss sure itll hold them smith said grimly itll hold them for all of a minute you cant burst heavy truck tyres that way and it wont take them long to bulldoze those cars out of the way heidi heidi walked forward shivering in the icy gale blowing through both the shattered front and side windows yes major how far to the turn off a mile and to the wooden bridge what do you call it zur alten briicke another mile three minutes at the most that he raised his voice three minutes lieutenant can you do it i can do it schaffer was already lashing together packages of plastic explosives he used transparent adhesive tape leaving long streamers dangling from the bound packages he had just secured the last package in position when he lurched heavily as the postbus now clear of the blau see and running through a pine forest swung abruptly to the left on to a side road sorry smith called almost missed that one less than a mile lieutenant no panic schaffer said cheerfully he fished out a knife to start cutting the fuses to their shortest possible length then went very still indeed as he glanced through where the rear windows had once been in the middle distance were the vertically wavering beams of powerful headlights closing rapidly the cheerfulness left schaffers voice well maybe there is a little bit panic at that ive got bad news boss and i have a rear mirror how far heidi next corner while schaffer worked quickly on the fuses smith concentrated on getting the postbus round the next corner as quickly as possible without leaving the road and then they were on and round the corner and the bridge was no more than a hundred yards away it was not smith thought a bridge he would have chosen to have crossed with a bicycle much less a six ton bus had it been a bridge crossing some gently meandering stream then yes possibly but not a bridge such as this one was a fiftyfoot bridge surfaced with untied railway sleepers spanning a ravine two hundred feet in depth and supported by trestles very ancient wooden trestles which from what little he could see of them from his acute angle of approach he wouldnt have trusted to support the tables at the vicars garden party smith hit this elderly and decrepit edifice at forty miles per hour a more cautious and understandable approach might have been to crawl over it at less than walking pace but smiths conviction that the less time he spent on each ancient sleeper the better was as instantaneous as it was complete the heavy snow chains on each tyre bit into and dislodged each successive sleeper with a terrifying rumble the postbus bounced up and down as if on a giant cakewalk while the entire structure of the bridge swayed from side to side like the bridge of a destroyer at speed in a heavy crosssea it had been smiths original intention to stop in the middle of the bridge but once embarked upon the crossing he would no more have done so than dallied to pick up an edelweiss in the path of an alpine avalanche ten feet from the edge of the bridge he stamped on the brakes and skidded to a sliding halt on solid ground again in less than twenty yards schaffer had already the back door open and the two packages of plastic explosives in his hands before the bus stopped five seconds after hitting the road he was back on the bridge again skipping nimbly over a dozen dislodged sleepers until he had arrived at the main supports of the central trestle it took him less than twenty seconds to tape one package to the right hand support cross the bridge and tape the second package to the left hand support he heard the deepening roar of a rapidly approaching engine glanced up saw the swathe of unseen headlamp beams shining round the corner they had just passed tore off the ignition fuse crossed the bridge tore off the other and raced for the bus smith had already the bus in gear and was moving away when schaffer flung himself through the back doorway and was hauled inside by helping hands schaffer twisted round till he was sitting on the passageway his legs dangling through the open doorway just in time to see the headlamps of thepursuing car sweep into sight round the corner it was now less than a hundred yards from the bridge and accelerating for a brief almost panicstricken moment schaffer wondered wildly if he had cut the fuses short enough he hadnt realised the following car had been quite as close as it was and from the tense and strained expressions on the faces of the two girls and the man beside him expressions sensed rather than seen he knew that exactly the same thought was in their minds the two loud flat detonations each fractionally preceded by the brilliant white flash characteristic of the plastic explosive came within one second of each other baulks of timber and railway sleepers were hurled forty feet into the air spinning lazily around in a curious kind of slow motion many of them falling back again on to the now tottering support structure with an impact sufficient to carry away the central trestle one moment a bridge the next an empty ravine with on the far side of it the wildly swinging headlamp beams as the driver flung his car from side to side in a nothingtobelost attempt to prevent the car from sliding over the edge of the ravine it seemed certain that he must fail until the moment when the car sliding broadside on along the road struck a large rock rolled over twice and came to a halt less than six feet from the edge of the ravine schaffer shook his head in wonder rose closed the rear door sat in the back seat lit a cigarette tossed the spent match through the smashed rear window and observed youre a lucky lot to have me around all this and modesty too heidi said admiringly a rare combination schaffer acknowledged youll find lots of other pleasant surprises in store for you as we grow old together how far to this airfield now five miles perhaps eight minutes but this is the only road in with the bridge gone theres no hurry now thats as maybe schaffer is anxious to be gone tell me honey were all those beer bottles empty the ones we threw away were i just simply dont deserve you schaffer said reverently were thinking along the same lines at last heidi said acidly schaffer grinned took two beer bottles and went forward to relieve smith who moved out only too willingly with the bus still in motion smiths right hand schaffer saw hadnt a scrap of bandage left that wasnt wholly saturated in blood and die face was very pale but he made no comment three minutes later they were out of the forest running along through open farmland and five minutes after that acting on heidis directions schaffer swung the bus through a narrow gateway on the left hand side of the road the headlamps successively illuminated two small hangars a narrow cleared runway stretching into the distance and finally a bulletriddled mosquito bomber with a crumpled undercarriage aint that a beautiful sight now schaffer nodded at the damaged plane carnabyjoness transport smith nodded it began with a mosquito and it will end we hope in a mosquito this is oberhausen airfield hq of the bavarian mountain rescue pilots three cheers for the bavarian mountain rescue pilots schaffer stopped the bus facing up the length of the runway switched off the lights and turned off the engine they sat silently in the darkness waiting colonel wyattturner glanced through the sidescreen and breathed with relief as for the first time that knight the ground fell away sharply beneath the mosquito he said sarcastically losing your nerve wing commander i lost that september rd carpenter said cheerfully got to climb cant expect to see any recognition signals down among the bushes there youre sure were on the right course no question thats the weissspitze there three minutes flying time carpenter paused and went on thoughtfully looks uncommon like guy fawkes night up there dont you think the wing commander was hardly exaggerating in the far distance the silhouette of the weissspitze was but dimly seen but there was no mistaking the intensity of the great fire blazing halfway up the mountainside occasionally great gouts of red flame and what looked like gigantic fireworks could be seen soaring high above the main body of the fire explosives or boxes of ammunition going up id say carpenter said pensively thats the schloss adler of course were any of your boys carrying matches they must have been wyattturner stared impassively at the distant blaze its quite a sight its all of that carpenter agreed he touched wyattturners arm and pointed forwards and down but theres a sight thats finer far the most beautiful sight ive ever seen wyattturner followed the pointing finger less than two miles away about five hundred feet below a pair of headlamps were flashing regularly on and off once every two seconds with a conscious effort of will he looked away and glanced briefly at carpenter but almost at once was back on the flashing headlamps he stared at them hypnotically and shook his head in slow and total disbelief schaffer had the headlights switched on main beam illuminating the runway and the postbus engine running as the black squat shape of the mosquito airbrakes fully extended lined up for its approach to the runway and had the bus itself moving accelerating quickly through the gears as the mosquito sank down over the top of the bus and settled down beautifully without the slightest suspicion of a bounce within a minute schaffer brought the bus to a skidding halt only yards from the now stationary plane half a minute later with all five of them safely inside the plane carpenter had the mosquito turned through є and was standing hard on the brakes as he brought the engines up to maximum revolutions and then they were on their way gathering speed so rapidly that they were airborne two hundred yards before the end of the runway for the first mile of their climb carpenter kept the plane heading almost directly towards the blazing castle that now redly illuminated the entire valley then the funeral pyre of the schloss adler vanished for the last time as the mosquito banked and headed for the northwest and home wing commander carpenter took the mosquito up to five thousand feet and kept it there the time for dodging around among the bushes was past for on the outward journey carpenter had been concerned only that no german station pick him up long enough to form even a rough guess as to where he was going but now he didnt care if every radar station in the country knew where he was going he was going home to england mission accomplished and there wasnt a warplane in europe that could catch him wing commander carpenter pulled luxuriously at his evilsmelling briar he was well content his five newlyacquired passengers were perhaps a fraction less content they lacked carpenters wellupholstered pilots seat the interior of the mosquito made no concessions whatsoever to passenger comfort it was bleak icy cramped it didnt require much space to carry a ib bomb load the mosquitos maximum and totally devoid of seating in any form the three men and the two girls squatted uncomfortably on thin palliasses the expressions on their faces pretty accurately reflecting their acute discomfort colonel wyattturner still holding across his knees the sten gun hed had at the ready in case any trouble had developed on the ground or the flashing lights of the truck had been a german ruse was sitting sideways in the copilots seat so that he could see and talk to the pilot and the passengers at the same time he had accepted without question or apparent interest smiths brief explanation of the two girls presence as being necessary to escape gestapo vengeance colonel wyattturner had other and weightier matters on his mind smith looked up from the bleeding mangled hand that mary was rebandaging with the planes first aid kit and said to the colonel it was good of you to come in person to meet us sir it wasnt good of me at all wyattturner said frankly id have gone mad if id stayed another minute in london i had to know it was i who sent you all out here he sat without speaking for some time then went on heavily torrancesmythe gone sergeant harrod and now you say carraciola christiansen and thomas all dead a heavy price smith a terrible price my best men all of them sir smith asked softly im getting old wyattturner shook his head wearily and drew a hand across his eyes did you find out who carraciola carraciola ted carraciola never i cant believe it and christiansen smiths voice was still quiet still even and thomas and christiansen and thomas he looked consideringly at smith youve been through a lot major smith youre not well im not as well as i was smith admitted but i was well enough when i killed them you you killed them ive killed a traitor before now you know that but but traitors all three of them impossible i cant believe it i wont believe it then maybe youll believe this sir smith produced one of the notebooks from his tunic and handed it to wyattturner the names and addresses or contacts of every german agent in southern england and the names of all british agents in northwest europe who have been supplanted by german agents you will recognise carraciolas writing he wrote this under duress slowly like a man in a dream wyattturner reached out and took the notebook for three minutes he examined the contents leafing slowly almost reluctantly through the pages then finally laid the book down with a sigh this is the most important document in europe the most important document i have ever seen wyattturner sighed the nation is deeply in your debt major smith thank you sir or would have been its a great pity it will never have the chance to express its gratitude he lifted the sten from his knees and pointed it at smiths heart you will do nothing foolish will you major smith what in gods name carpenter twisted in his seat and stared at wyattturner in startled and total disbelief concentrate on your flying my dear wing commander wyattturner waved the sten gently in carpenters direction your course will do for the present well be landing at lille airport within the hour the guys gone nuts schaffers voice was a shocked whisper if he has smith said drily he went nuts some years ago ladies and gentlemen i give you the most dangerous spy in europe the most successful double agent of all time he paused for reaction but the silence remained unbroken the enormity of the revelation of wyattturners duplicity was too great for immediate comprehension smith continued colonel wyattturner you will be courtmartialled this afternoon sentenced removed to the tower then taken out blindfolded and shot at eight oclock tomorrow morning you knew wyattturners affable selfconfidence had completely deserted him and his voice low arid strained was barely distinguishable above the clamour of the engines you knew about me t knew about you smith nodded but we all knew about you didnt we colonel three years you claimed behind the german lines served with the wehrmacht and finally penetrated the berlin high command sure you did with the help of the wehrmacht and the high command but when the tide of war turned and you could no longer feed the allies with false and misleading reports about proposed german advances then you were allowed to escape back to england to feed the germans true and accurate reports about allied plans and give them all the information they required to round up british agents in northwest europe how many million francs do you have in your numbered account in zurich colonel wing commander carpenter stared straight ahead through the windscreen and said very slowly frankly old chap this is preposterous try batting an eyelid and see just how preposterous that sten gun is smith suggested he looked at wyattturner again you underestimated admiral holland im afraid hes had his suspicions about you and the four section leaders of department c for months but he was wrong about torrancesmythe guess away wyattturner had recovered his composure and most of his selfconfidence itll pass the time till we get to lille unfortunately for you there is no guesswork admiral holland recalled me and mary from italy he could no longer be sure of anyone in london you know how corruption spreads played it very clever did the admiral he told you he had his suspicions about one of his section leaders but didnt know which so when general carnaby crashed he put up to you the idea of sending the section officers to the rescue and made damn sure that you never once had the opportunity of talking to any of them in private before they took off that that was why i was called in schaffer looked as if he had been sandbagged because you couldnt trust for all we knew mi was riddled well colonel you werent too happy until holland asked you to pick the leader so you picked me holland knew you would youd only just met me for the first time but you knew from kesselrings military intelligence chief through your pal admiral canaris that i was their top double agent or thought you did holland was the only man on either side who knew i wasnt for you i was the ideal choice holland made certain that you didnt have the chance of talking to me either but you werent worried you knew that i would know what to do smith smiled bleakly im happy to say i did it must have been quite a shock to your system this afternoon when he told you what i really was you knew that you knew all that wyattturners newfound composure had vanished his voice was quiet and vicious he lifted the sten slightly what goes on smith all prearranged to force your hand we had everything except proof about you i got that proof this evening colonel kramer knew that we were coming knew we were after general carnaby he nodded towards jones incidentally meet cartwright jones an american actor what wyattturner forced out the word as if a pair of powerful hands were squeezing on his windpipe general carnaby is spending a quiet weekend at the admirals country house in wiltshire as a standin mr jones was quite admirable he had them all as deceived as that faked plane crash you will have realised by now that it was a deliberate crashlanding wyattturner tried to speak but the words failed to come his mouth was working and the colour had drained from his ruddy face and why did kramer know he knew because you had informed berlin as soon as holland had put the plan to you nobody else had the chance to and he knew that we would be in zum wilden hirsch this evening he knew because i told you on the radio broadcast this morning and you lost no time in passing the good word on are you sure heidi asked couldnt the informant have been whichever of the men carraciola or christiansen or thomas who killed torrancesmythe theres a phone box just outside the inn i know no he didnt have time i left the inn for exactly seven minutes three minutes after id left torrancesmythe did the same to follow one of the three others hed just seen leaving smithy was clever and he knew something was far wrong he how did he know schaffer demanded well never be sure i think well find that he was a highlyskilled lipreader anyway he caught the man hed seen leaving in the phone booth outside the post office before hed had time to get through to either weissner or kramer there was a fight to the death by the time the killer had dragged smithy around to the back and returned to the booth someone else was occupying it i saw him so the killer had to go back into the inn kramer it was who told weissner and the colonel here who told kramer very interesting there was a sneer in wyattturners voice but a sneer belied by the deep unease in his face fascinating in fact quite finished major smith finished smith sighed you just had to come to meet us hadnt you colonel this was the last door to life left open to you in my final broadcast i told the admiral i have it all he told you what that meant all the names all the addresses we could never have got at you through carraciola christiansen or thomas they were too close to you in mi you were too cagey and they never knew who they were working for you used intermediaries and all their names are in that book you knew theyd put the finger on you when its a choice between taking a walk to the gallows and talking well its not much of a choice is it wyattturner didnt answer he turned to carpenter and said lay off a course for lille airport dont bother smith said wyattturner lined his sten on smith give me one good reason why i shouldnt shoot you now i can do that smith nodded why do you think that admiral holland accompanied you to the airport he never has before go on wyatts voice was hard abrupt but his eyes were sick sick with the sudden certainty of defeat and death to make quite certain that you took that sten and only that sten with you tell me can you see two parallel scores where the stock meets the barrel wyattturner stared at him for a long moment then glanced down quickly at the sten there were two unmistakable parallel scratches exactly where smith had said they would be wyattturner looked up again his face contorted desperation replacing the sickness in his eyes thats right smith said i personally filed off the firing pin exactly thirtysix hours ago with his left hand smith reached awkwardly under his tunic flap and brought out his silenced luger wyattturner with his sten lined up on smiths head and the muzzle less than three feet from smiths face squeezed the trigger time and again and each convulsive contraction of his forefinger was rewarded by a dry and empty click with a stunned almost uncomprehending expression on his face wyattturner slowly lowered the sten to the floor then quickly whirled in his seat jerked open the door and threw the notebook out into the night he turned and smiled bleakly at smith the most important document in europe i believe i called it so you did smith handed his gun to schaffer reached under his tunic and brought out two more books duplicates duplicates the smile slowly faded from the heavilyjowled face leaving it frozen in defeat duplicates he whispered he looked slowly around them all and then finally back at smith who had retrieved his gun from schaffer he said are you going to shoot me no wyattturner nodded slid back the door to its widest extent and said can you really see me in the tower he stepped forward into the doorway no smith shook his head no i cant see that mind the step said schaffer his voice was cold and empty his face was carved from stone well now time to make a call smith slid shut the door scrambled painfully into the copilots seat and looked at mary the admiral must be getting worried by this time time to make a call mary repeated mechanically she stared at him as if seeing a ghost how can you sit there just after how can you be so calm because its no shock to me silly i knew he was going to die you knew of course of course she murmured now then smith went on deliberately briskvoiced as he took her hand you realise what this means dont you do i realise what what means she was still ashenfaced you and i are all washed up smith explained patiently finished in italy in northwest europe i wont even be allowed to fight as a soldier because if i were captured id still be shot as a spy so so for us the war is over for the first time we can think of ourselves ok he squeezed her hand and she smiled shakily in reply ok wing commander may i use your radio so thats the way he went admiral holland telephone in hand and standing by the big transceiver in his london operations hq looked old and very very tired maybe its all for the best smith and you have all the information you want smiths voice crackled over the earphone everything sir magnificent magnificent i have all the police forces in the country alerted as soon as we get that book theres a car waiting for you at the airport see you in an hour yes sir theres one thing sir a small thing i want to get married this morning you what grey bushy eyebrows lifted towards the mane of white hair i want to get married smith explained slowly and patiently to miss mary ellison but you cant holland protested this morning impossible there are such things as banns permits the registrars office will be shut today after all ive done for you smith interrupted reproachfully blackmail sir you play on an old mans gratitude downright blackmail holland banged down the phone smiled tiredly and picked up another phone operator put me through to the forgery section wing commander carpenter his pipe well alight and by his elbow a cup of coffee newly poured from a vacuum flask was his old imperturbable self again smith talked quietly to mary while jones had his eyes closed and appeared to be asleep farther aft in the fuselage schaffer had his arm around heidi who was making no attempt to fight him off right schaffer said so we go to this pub tonight see you said the savoy grill heidi reminded him a rose by any other name so we go to this pub and well have pate smoked trout sirloin of aberdeenangus aberdeenangus heidi looked at him in amusement forgotten the war havent you forgotten rationing more like a sirloin of horse meat honey schaffer took her hands and spoke severely and earnestly honey dont ever again mention that word to me im allergic to horses you eat them heidi gazed at him in astonishment in montana i fall off them schaffer said moodily everywhere the end
