the crystal world by jg ballard copyright by jg ballard by day fantastic birds flew through the petrified forest and jeweled crocodiles glittered like heraldic salamanders on the banks of the crystalline river by night the illuminated man raced among the trees his arms like golden cartwheels his head like a spectral crown contents i equinox the dark river the jeweled orchid mulatto on the catwalks a drowned man the crystallized forest the crash ii the illuminated man mirrors and assassins the summer house serena the mask the white hotel duel with a crocodile saraband for lepers the prismatic sun i equinox the dark river above all the darkness of the river was what impressed dr sanders as he looked out for the first time across the open mouth of the matarre estuary after many delays the small passenger steamer was at last approaching the line of jetties but although it was ten oclock the surface of the water was still gray and sluggish leaching away the somber tinctures of the collapsing vegetation along the banks at intervals when the sky was overcast the water was almost black like putrescent dye by contrast the straggle of warehouses and small hotels that constituted port matarre gleamed across the dark swells with a spectral brightness as if lit less by solar light than by some interior lantern like the pavilions of an abandoned necropolis built out on a series of piers from the edges of the jungle this pervading auroral gloom broken by sudden inward shifts of light dr sanders had noticed during his long wait at the rail of the passenger deck for two hours the steamer had sat out in the center of the estuary now and then blowing its whistle at the shore in a halfhearted way but for the vague sense of uncertainty induced by the darkness over the river the few passengers would have been driven mad with annoyance apart from a french military landing craft there seemed to be no other vessels of any size berthed along the jetties as he watched the shore dr sanders was almost certain that the steamer was being deliberately held off though the reason was hard to see the steamer was the regular packet boat from libreville with its weekly cargo of mail brandy and automobile spare parts not to be postponed for more than a moment by anything less than an outbreak of the plague politically this isolated corner of the cameroon republic was still recovering from an abortive coup ten years earlier when a handful of rebels had seized the emerald and diamond mines at mont royal fifty miles up the matarre river despite the presence of the landing crafta french military mission supervised the training of the local troopslife in the nondescript port at the river mouth seemed entirely normal watched by a group of children a jeep was at that moment being unloaded people wandered along the wharves and through the arcades in the main street and a few outriggers loaded with jars of crude palm oil drifted past on the dark water toward the native market to the west of the port nevertheless the sense of unease persisted puzzled by the dim light dr sanders turned his attention to the inshore areas following the river as it made a slow clockwise turn to the southeast here and there a break in the forest canopy marked the progress of a road but otherwise the jungle stretched in a flat olivegreen mantle toward the inland hills usually the forest roof would have been bleached to a pale yellow by the sun but even five miles inland dr sanders could see the dark green arbors towering into the dull air like immense cypresses somber and motionless touched only by faint gleams of light someone drummed impatiently at the rail sending a stir down its length and the halfdozen passengers on either side of dr sanders shuffled and muttered to one another glancing up at the wheelhouse where the captain gazed absently at the jetty apparently unperturbed by the delay dr sanders turned to father balthus who was standing a few feet away on his left the lighthave you noticed it is there an eclipse expected the sun seems unable to make up its mind the priest was smoking steadily his long fingers drawing the cigarette half an inch from his mouth after each inhalation like sanders he was gazing not at the harbor but at the forest slopes far inland in the dull light his thin scholars face seemed tired and fleshless during the threeday journey from libreville he had kept to himself evidently distracted by some private matter and only began to talk to his table companion when he learned of dr sanderss post at the fort isabelle leper hospital sanders gathered that he was returning to his parish at mont royal after a sabbatical month but there seemed something a little too plausible about this explanation which he repeated several times in the same automatic phrasing unlike his usual hesitant stutter however sanders was well aware of the dangers of imputing his own ambiguous motives for coming to port matarre to those around him even so at first dr sanders had suspected that father balthus might not be a priest at all the selfimmersed eyes and pale neurasthenic hands bore all the signatures of the impostor perhaps an expelled novice still hoping to find some kind of salvation within a borrowed soutane however father balthus was entirely genuine whatever that term meant and whatever its limits the first officer the steward and several of the passengers recognized him complimented him on his return and generally seemed to accept his isolated manner an eclipse father balthus flicked his cigarette stub into the dark water below the steamer was now overrunning its own wake and the veins of foam sank down through the deeps like threads of luminous spittle i think not doctor surely the maximum duration would be eight minutes in the sudden flares of light over the water reflected off the sharp points of his cheeks and jaw a harder profile for a moment showed itself conscious of sanderss critical eye father balthus added as an afterthought to reassure the doctor the light at port matarre is always like this very heavy and penumbral do you know bцcklins painting island of the dead where the cypresses stand guard above a cliff pierced by a hypogeum while a storm hovers over the sea its in the kunstmuseum in my native basel he broke off as the steamers engines drummed into life were moving at last thank god for that you should have warned me balthus dr sanders took his cigarette case from his pocket but the priest had already palmed a fresh cigarette into his cupped hand with the deftness of a conjurer balthus pointed with it to the jetty where a substantial reception committee of gendarmerie and customs officials was waiting for the steamer now what nonsense is this dr sanders watched the shore whatever balthuss private difficulties the priests lack of charity irritated him half to himself sanders said dryly perhaps theres a question of credentials not mine doctor father balthus turned a sharp downward glance upon sanders and im certain your own are in order the other passengers were leaving the rail and going below to collect their baggage with a smile at balthus dr sanders excused himself and began to make his way down to his cabin dismissing the priest from his mind within half an hour they would have disappeared their separate ways into the forest and whatever awaited them theresanders felt in his pocket for his passport reminding himself not to leave it in his cabin the desire to travel incognito with all its advantages might well reveal itself in some unexpected way as dr sanders reached the companionway behind the funnelhouse he could see down into the afterdeck where the steerage passengers were pulling together their bundles and cheap suitcases in the center of the deck partly swathed in a canvas awning was a large redandyellowhulled speedboat part of the cargo consignment for port matarre taking his ease on the wide bench seat behind the steering helm one arm resting on the raked glass and chromium windshield was a small slimly built man of about forty wearing a white tropical suit that emphasized the rim of dark beard which framed his face his black hair was brushed down over his bony forehead and with his small eyes gave him a taut and watchful appearance this man ventresshis name was about all dr sanders had managed to learn about himwas the doctors cabinmate during the journey from libreville he had roamed about the steamer like an impatient tiger arguing with the steerage passengers and crew his moods switching from a kind of ironic humor to sullen disinterest when he would sit alone in the cabin gazing out through the porthole at the small disc of empty sky dr sanders had made one or two attempts to talk to him but most of the time ventress ignored him keeping to himself whatever reasons he had for coming to port matarre however the doctor was well inured by now to being avoided by those around him shortly before they embarked a slight contretemps more embarrassing to his fellow passengers than to himself had arisen over the choice of a cabinmate for dr sanders his fame having preceded him no one could be found to share a cabin with the assistant director of the fort isabelle leper hospital at this point ventress had stepped forward knocking on dr sanderss door suitcase in hand he had nodded at the doctor and asked simply is it contagious after a pause to examine this whitesuited figure with his bearded skulllike facesomething about him reminded sanders that the world was not without those who for their own reasons wished to catch the diseasedr sanders said the disease is contagious as you ask yes but years of exposure and contact are necessary for its transmission the period of incubation may be twenty or thirty years like death good with a gleam of a smile ventress stepped into the cabin he extended a bony hand and clasped sanderss firmly his strong fingers feeling for the doctors grip what our timorous fellow passengers fail to realize doctor is that outside your colony there is merely another larger one later as he looked down at ventress lounging in the speedboat on the afterdeck dr sanders pondered on this cryptic introduction the faltering light still hung over the estuary but ventresss white suit seemed to focus all its intense hidden brilliancy just as father balthuss clerical garb had reflected the darker tones the steerage passengers milled around the speedboat but ventress appeared to be uninterested in them or in the approaching jetty with its waiting throng of customs and police instead he was looking out across the deserted starboard rail into the mouth of the river and at the distant forest stretching away into the haze his small eyes were halfclosed as if he were deliberately merging the view in front of him with some inner landscape within his mind sanders had seen little of ventress during the voyage upcoast but one evening in the cabin searching through the wrong suitcase in the dark he had felt the butt of a heavycaliber automatic pistol wrapped in the harness of a shoulder holster the presence of this weapon had immediately resolved some of the enigmas that surrounded ventresss small brittle figure doctor ventress called up to him waving one hand lightly as if reminding sanders that he was daydreaming a drink sanders before the bar closes dr sanders began to refuse but ventress had halfturned his shoulder veering off on another tack look for the sun doctor its there you cant walk through these forests with your head between your heels i shant try to are you going ashore of course theres no hurry here doctor this is a landscape without time leaving him dr sanders made his way to the cabin the three suitcases ventresss expensive one in polished crocodile skin and his own scuffed workaday bags were already packed and waiting beside the door sanders took off his jacket and then bathed his hands in the washbasin drying them lightly in the hope that the soaps pungent scent might make him seem less of a pariah to the examining officials however sanders realized only too well that by now after fifteen years in africa ten of them at the fort isabelle hospital any chance he may once have had of altering the outward aspect of himself his image to the world at large had long since gone the workstained cotton suit slightly too small for his broad shoulders the striped blue shirt and black tie the strong head with its gray uncut hair and trace of beardall these were the involuntary signatures of the physician to the lepers as unmistakable as sanderss own scarred but firm mouth and critical eye opening the passport sanders compared the photograph taken eight years earlier with the reflection in the mirror at a glance the two men seemed barely recognizablethe first with his straight earnest face his patent moral commitment to the lepers all too obviously on top of his work at the hospital looked more like the dedicated younger brother of the other some remote and rather idiosyncratic country doctor sanders looked down at his faded jacket and calloused hands knowing how misleading this impression was and how much better he understood if not his present motives at least those of his younger self and the real reasons that had sent him to fort isabelle reminded by the birth date in the passport that he had now reached the age of forty sanders tried to visualize himself ten years ahead but already the latent elements that had emerged in his face during the previous years seemed to have lost momentum ventress had referred to the matarre forests as a landscape without time and perhaps part of its appeal for sanders was that here at last he might be free from the questions of motive and identity that were bound up with his sense of time and the past the steamer was now barely twenty feet from the jetty and through the porthole dr sanders could see the khakiclad legs of the reception party from his pocket he took out a wellthumbed envelope and drew from it a letter written in paleblue ink that had almost penetrated the soft tissue both envelope and letter were franked with a censors stamp and panels which sanders assumed contained the address had been cut out as the steamer bumped against the jetty dr sanders read through the letter for the last time on board thursday january th my dear edward at last we are here the forest is the most beautiful in africa a house of jewels i can barely find words to describe our wonder each morning as we look out across the slopes still halfhidden by the mist but glistening like st sophia each bough a jeweled semidome indeed max says i am becoming excessively byzantinei wear my hair to my waist even at the clinic and affect a melancholy expression although in fact for the first time in many years my heart sings both of us wish you were here the clinic is small with about twenty patients fortunately the people of these forest slopes move through life with a kind of dreamlike patience and regard our work for them as more social than therapeutic they walk through the dark forest with crowns of light on their heads max sends his best wishes to you as i do we remember you often the light touches everything with diamonds and sapphires my love suzanne as the metal heels of the boarding party rang out across the deck over his head dr sanders read again the last line of the letter but for the unofficial but firm assurances he had been given by the prefecture in libreville he would not have believed that suzanne clair and her husband had come to port matarre so unlike the somber light of the river and jungle were her descriptions of the forest near the clinic their exact whereabouts no one had been able to tell him or for that matter why a sudden censorship should have been imposed on mail leaving the province when sanders became too persistent he was reminded that the correspondence of people under a criminal charge was liable to censorship but as far as suzanne and max clair were concerned the suggestion was grotesque thinking of the small intelligent microbiologist and his wife tall and darkhaired with her high forehead and calm eyes dr sanders remembered their sudden departure from fort isabelle three months earlier sanderss affair with suzanne had lasted for two years kept going only by his inability to resolve it in any way his failure to commit himself fully to her made it plain that she had become the focus of all his uncertainties at fort isabelle for some time he had suspected that his reasons for serving at the leper hospital were not altogether humanitarian and that he might be more attracted by the idea of leprosy and whatever it unconsciously represented than he imagined suzannes somber beauty had become identified in his mind with this dark side of the psyche and their affair was an attempt to come to terms with himself and his own ambiguous motives on second thought sanders recognized that a far more sinister explanation for their departure from the hospital was at hand when suzannes letter arrived with its strange and ecstatic vision of the forestin maculoanesthetic leprosy there was an involvement of nervous tissuehe had decided to follow them forgoing his inquiries about the censored letter in order not to warn suzanne of his arrival he took a months leave from the hospital and set off for port matarre from suzannes description of the forest slopes he guessed the clinic to be somewhere near mont royal possibly attached to one of the frenchowned mining settlements with their overzealous security men however the activity on the jetty outsidethere were half a dozen soldiers moving about near a parked staff car indicated that something more was afoot as he began to fold suzannes letter smoothing the petallike tissue the cabin door opened sharply jarring his elbow with an apology ventress stepped in nodding to sanders i beg your pardon doctor my bag he added the customs people are here annoyed to be caught reading the letter again by ventress dr sanders stuffed envelope and letter into his pocket for once ventress appeared not to notice this his hand rested on the handle of his suitcase one ear cocked to listen to the sounds from the deck above no doubt he was wondering what to do with the pistol a thorough baggage search was the last thing any of them had expected deciding to leave ventress alone so that he could slip the weapon through the porthole dr sanders picked up his two suitcases well goodbye doctor ventress was smiling his face even more skulllike behind the beard he held the door open its been very interesting a great pleasure to share a cabin with you dr sanders nodded and perhaps something of a challenge too m ventress i hope all your victories come as easily touchй doctor ventress saluted him then waved as sanders made his way down the corridor but i gladly leave you with the last laughthe old man with the scythe eh without looking back dr sanders climbed the companionway to the saloon aware of ventress watching him from the door of the cabin the other passengers were sitting in the chairs by the bar father balthus among them as a prolonged harangue took place between the first officer two customs officials and a police sergeant they were consulting the passenger list scrutinizing everyone in turn as if searching for some missing passenger as dr sanders lowered his two bags to the floor he caught the phrase no journalists allowed and then one of the customs men beckoned him over dr sanders he asked putting a particular emphasis into the name as if he half hoped it might be an alias from libreville university he lowered his voice the physics department may i see your papers dr sanders pulled out his passport a few feet to his left father balthus was watching him with a sharp eye my name is sanders of the fort isabelle lйproserie after apologizing for their mistake the customs men glanced at each other and then cleared dr sanders chalking up his suitcases without bothering to open them a few moments later he walked down the gangway on the jetty the native soldiers lounged around the staff car the rear seat remained vacant presumably for the missing physicist from libreville university as he handed his suitcases to a porter with hotel deurope stenciled across his peaked cap dr sanders noticed that a far more thorough inspection was being made of the baggage of those leaving port matarre a group of thirty to forty steerage passengers was herded together at the far end of the jetty and the police and customs men were searching them one by one most of the natives carried bedrolls with them and the police were unwinding these and squeezing the padding by contrast with this activity the town was nearly deserted the arcades on either side of the main street were empty and the windows of the hotel deurope hung listlessly in the dark air the narrow shutters like coffin lids here in the center of the town the faded white faзades made the somber light of the jungle seem even more pervasive looking back at the river as it turned like an immense snake into the forest dr sanders felt that it had sucked away all but a bare residue of life as he followed the porter up the steps into the hotel he saw the blackrobed figure of father balthus farther down the arcade the priest was walking swiftly his small traveling bag held in one hand he turned between two columns then crossed the road and disappeared among the shadows in the arcade facing the hotel at intervals sanders saw him again his dark figure lit by the sunlight the white columns of the arcade framing him like the shutter of a defective stroboscopic device then for no apparent reason he crossed the street again the skirt of his black robe whipping the dust around his heels his high face passed sanders without turning like the pale halfremembered profile of someone glimpsed in a nightmare sanders pointed after him wheres he off to he asked the porter the priesthe was on the steamer with me to the seminary the jesuits are still there still what do you mean sanders moved toward the swinging doors but at that moment a darkhaired young frenchwoman stepped out as her face was reflected in the moving panes sanders had a sudden glimpse of suzanne clair although the young woman was in her early twenties at least ten years younger than suzanne she had the same wide hips and sauntering stride the same observant gray eyes as she passed sanders she murmured pardon then returning his stare with a faint smile she set off in the direction of an army lorry that was reversing down a side road sanders watched her go her trim white suit and metropolitan chic seemed out of place in the dingy light of port matarre whats going on here sanders said have they found a new diamond field the explanation seemed to make sense of the censorship and the customs search but something about the porters studied shrug made him doubt it besides the references in suzannes letter to diamonds and sapphires would have been construed by the censor as an open invitation to join in the harvest the clerk at the reception desk was equally evasive to sanderss annoyance the clerk insisted on showing him the weekly tariff despite his assurances that he would be setting off for mont royal the following day doctor you understand there is no boat the service has been suspended it will be cheaper for you if i charge you by the weekly tariff but as you wish all right dr sanders signed the register as a precaution he gave as his address the university at libreville he had lectured several times at the medical school and mail would be forwarded from there to fort isabelle the deception might be useful at a later date what about the railway he asked the clerk or the bus service there must be some transport to mont royal theres no railway the clerk snapped his fingers diamonds you know doctor not difficult to transport perhaps you can make inquiries about the bus dr sanders studied the mans thin oliveskinned face his liquid eyes roved around the doctors suitcases and then out through the arcade to the forest canopy overtopping the roofs across the street he seemed to be waiting for something to appear dr sanders put away his pen tell me why is it so dark in port matarre its not overcast and yet one can hardly see the sun the clerk shook his head when he spoke he seemed to be talking more to himself than to sanders its not dark doctor its the leaves theyre taking minerals from the ground it makes everything look dark all the time this notion seemed to contain an element of truth from the windows of his room overlooking the arcades dr sanders gazed out at the forest the huge trees surrounded the port as if trying to crowd it back into the river in the street the shadows were of the usual density following at the heels of the few people who ventured out through the arcades but the forest was without contrast of any kind the leaves exposed to the sunlight were as dark as those below almost as if the entire forest were draining all light from the sun in the same way that the river had emptied the town of its life and movement the blackness of the canopy the olive hues of the flat leaves gave the forest a somber heaviness emphasized by the motes of light that flickered within its aerial galleries preoccupied dr sanders almost failed to hear the knock on his door he opened it to find ventress standing in the corridor his whitesuited figure and sharp skull seemed to personify the bonelike colors of the deserted town what is it ventress stepped forward he held an envelope in his hand i found this in the cabin after you had gone doctor i thought i should return it to you dr sanders took the envelope feeling in his pocket for suzannes letter in his hurry he had evidently let it slip to the floor he pushed the letter into the envelope beckoning ventress into the room thank you i didnt realize ventress glanced around the room since disembarking from the steamer he had changed noticeably the laconic and offhand manner had given way to a marked restlessness his compact figure held together as if all the muscles were opposing each other contained an intense nervous energy that sanders found almost uncomfortable his eyes roved about searching the shabby alcoves for some hidden perspective may i take something in return doctor before sanders could answer ventress had stepped over to the larger of the two suitcases on the slatted stand beside the wardrobe with a brief nod he released the catches and raised the lid from beneath the folded dressing gown he withdrew his automatic pistol wrapped in its shoulder holster harness before dr sanders could protest he had slipped it away inside his jacket what the devil dr sanders crossed the room he pulled the lid of the suitcase into place youve got a bloody nerve ventress gave him a weak smile then started to walk past sanders to the door annoyed sanders caught his arm and pulled the man almost off his feet ventresss face shut like a trap with an agile swerve he feinted sideways on his small feet and wrenched himself away from sanders as sanders came forward again ventress seemed to debate whether to use his pistol and then raised a hand to pacify the doctor sanders i apologize of course but there was no other way try to understand me it was those idiots on board i was taking advantage of rubbish you were taking advantage of me ventress shook his head vigorously youre wrong sanders i assure you i have no prejudice against your particular calling far from it believe me doctor i understand you your whole all right sanders pulled back the door now get out ventress however stood his ground he seemed to be trying to bring himself to say something as if aware that he had exposed some private weakness of sanderss and was doing his best to repair it then he gave a small shrug and left the room bored by the doctors irritation after he had gone dr sanders sat down in the armchair with his back to the window ventresss ruse had annoyed him not merely because of the assumption that the customs men would avoid contaminating themselves by touching his baggage the smuggling of the pistol unknown to himself seemed to symbolize in sexual terms as well all his hidden motives for coming to port matarre in quest of suzanne clair that ventress with his skeletal face and white suit should have exposed his awareness of these still concealed motives was all the more irritating he ate an early lunch in the hotel restaurant the tables were almost deserted and the only other guest was the darkhaired young frenchwoman who sat by herself writing into a dictation pad beside her salad now and then she glanced at sanders who was struck once again by her marked resemblance to suzanne clair perhaps because of her raven hair or the unusual light in port matarre her smooth face seemed paler in tone than sanders remembered suzannes as if the two women were cousins separated by some darker blood on suzannes side as he looked at the girl he could almost see suzanne beside her reflected within some halfscreened mirror in his mind when she left the table she nodded to sanders picked up her pad and went out into the street pausing in the lobby on the way after lunch sanders began his search for some form of transport to take him to mont royal as the desk clerk has stated there was no railway to the mining town a bus service ran twice daily but for some reason had been discontinued at the depot near the barracks on the eastern outskirts of the town dr sanders found the booking office closed the timetables peeled off the notice boards in the sunlight and a few natives slept on the benches in the shade after ten minutes a ticket collector wandered in with a broom sucking on a piece of sugar cane he shrugged when dr sanders asked him when the service would be resumed perhaps tomorrow or the next day sir who can tell the bridge is down wheres this where myanga ten kilometers from mont royal steep ravine the bridge just slid away risky there sir dr sanders pointed to the compound of the military barracks where half a dozen trucks were being loaded with supplies bales of barbed wire were stacked on the ground to one side next to some sections of metal fencing they seem busy enough how are they going to get through they sir are repairing the bridge with barbed wire dr sanders shook his head tired of this evasiveness what exactly is going on up there at mont royal the ticket collecter sucked his sugar cane going on he repeated dreamily nothings going on sir dr sanders strolled away pausing by the barrack gates until the sentry gestured him on across the road the dark tiers of the forest canopy rose high into the air like an immense wave ready to fall across the empty town well over a hundred feet above his head the great boughs hung like halffurled wings the trunks leaning toward him dr sanders was tempted to cross the road and approach the forest but there was something minatory and oppressive about its silence he turned and made his way back to the hotel an hour later after several fruitless inquiries he called at the police prefecture near the harbor the activity by the steamer had subsided and most of the passengers were aboard the speedboat was being swung out on a davit over the jetty coming straight to the point dr sanders showed suzannes letter to the african charge captain perhaps you could explain captain why it was necessary to delete their address these are close friends of mine and i wish to spend a fortnights holiday with them now i find that theres no means of getting to mont royal and an atmosphere of mystery surrounds the whole place the captain nodded pondering over the letter on his desk occasionally he prodded the tissue with a steel ruler as if he were examining the pressed petals of some rare and perhaps poisonous blossom i understand doctor its difficult for you but why is the censorship in force at all dr sanders pressed is there some sort of political disturbance has a rebel group captured the mines im naturally concerned for the wellbeing of dr and madame clair the captain shook his head i assure you doctor there is no political trouble at mont royalin fact there is hardly anyone there at all most of the workers have left why ive noticed that here the towns empty the captain stood up and went over to the window he pointed to the dark fringe of the jungle crowding over the rooftops of the native quarter beyond the warehouses the forest doctor do you see it frightens them its so black and heavy all the time he went back to his desk and fiddled with the ruler sanders waited for him to make up his mind what to say in confidence i can explain that there is a new kind of plant disease beginning in the forest near mont royal what do you mean sanders cut in a virus disease like tobacco mosaic yes thats it the captain nodded encouragingly although he seemed to have little idea of what he was talking about however he kept a quiet eye on the rim of jungle in the window anyway its not poisonous but we have to take precautions some experts will look at the forest send samples to librevilleyou understand it takes time he handed back suzannes letter i will find out your friends address you come back in another day all right will i be able to go to mont royal dr sanders asked the army hasnt closed off the area no the captain insisted you are quite free he gestured with his hands enclosing little parcels of air just small areas you see its not dangerous your friends are all right we dont want people rushing there trying to make trouble at the door dr sanders asked how long has this been going on he pointed to the window the forest is very dark here the captain scratched his forehead for a moment he looked tired and withdrawn about one year longer perhaps at first no one bothered the jeweled orchid on the steps outside dr sanders saw the young frenchwoman who had taken lunch at the hotel she carried a businesslike handbag and wore a pair of dark glasses that failed to disguise the inquisitive look in her intelligent face she watched dr sanders as he walked past her any news sanders stopped what about the emergency is that what they call it youre luckier than i i havent heard that term the young woman brushed this aside she eyed sanders up and down as if unsure who he might be you can call it what you like she said matteroffactly if it isnt an emergency now it soon will be she came over to sanders lowering her voice do you want to go to mont royal doctor sanders began to walk off the young woman following him are you a police spy he asked or running an underground bus service or both perhaps neither listen she stopped him when they had crossed the road to the first of the curio shops that ran down to the jetties between the warehouses she took off her sunglasses and gave him a frank smile im sorry to prythe clerk at the hotel told me who you werebut im stuck here myself and i thought you might know something ive been in port matarre since the last boat i can believe it dr sanders strolled on eyeing the stands with their cheap ivory ornaments small statuettes in an imitation oceanic style the native carvers had somehow picked up at many removes from european magazines port matarre has more than a passing resemblance to purgatory tell me are you on official business the young woman touched his arm she had replaced her sunglasses as if this gave her some sort of advantage in her interrogation you gave your address as the university at libreville in the hotel register the medical school dr sanders said to put your curiosity at rest if thats possible im simply here on holiday what about you in a quieter voice after a confirmatory glance at sanders she said im a journalist i work freelance for a bureau that sells material to the french illustrated weeklies a journalist dr sanders looked at her with more interest during their brief conversation he had avoided looking at her put off partly by her sunglasses which seemed to emphasize the strange contrasts of light and dark in port matarre and partly by her echoes of suzanne clair i didnt realize im sorry i was offhand but ive been getting nowhere today can you tell me about this emergencyill accept your term for it the young woman pointed to a bar at the next corner well go there its quieterive been making a nuisance of myself all week with the police as they settled themselves in a booth by the window she introduced herself as louise peret although prepared to accept dr sanders as a fellow conspirator she still wore her sunglasses screening off some inner sanctum of herself her masked face and cool manner seemed to sanders as typical in their way of port matarre as ventresss strange garb but already he sensed from the slight movement of her hands across the table toward him that she was searching for some point of contact theyre expecting a physicist from the university she said a dr tatlin i think though its difficult to check from here to begin with i thought you might be tatlin a physicist that doesnt make sense according to the police captain these affected areas of the forest are suffering from a new virus disease have you been trying to get to mont royal all week not exactly i came here with another man from the bureau an american called anderson when we left the boat he went off to mont royal in a hired car to take photographs i was to wait here so i could get a story out quickly did he see anything well four days ago i spoke to him on the telephone but the line was bad i could hardly hear a thing all he said was something about the forest being full of jewels but it was meant as a joke you know she gestured in the air a figure of speech exactly if he had seen a new diamond field he would have said so definitely anyway the next day the telephone line was broken and theyre still trying to repair iteven the police cant get through dr sanders ordered two brandies accepting a cigarette from louise he looked out through the window at the jetties along the river the last of the cargo was being loaded aboard the steamer and the passengers stood at the rail or sat passively on their luggage looking down at the deck its difficult to know how seriously to take this sanders said obviously something is going on but it could be anything under the sun then what about the police and the army convoys and the customs men out there this morning dr sanders shrugged officialdomif the telephone lines are down they probably know as little as we do what i cant understand is why you and this american came here in the first place by all accounts mont royal is even more dead than port matarre anderson had a tip that there was some kind of trouble near the mineshe wouldnt tell me what it was really his story you seebut we knew the army had sent in reserves tell me doctor are you still going to mont royal to your friends if i can there must be some way after all its only fifty miles at a pinch one could walk it louise laughed not me just then a blackgarbed figure strode past the window heading off toward the market father balthus louise said his mission is near mont royali checked up on him too theres a traveling companion for you i doubt it dr sanders watched the priest walk briskly away from them his thin face lifted as he crossed the road his head and shoulders were held stiffly but behind him his hands moved and twisted with a life of their own father balthus is not one to make a penitential progressi think he has other problems on his mind dr sanders stood up finishing his brandy however its a point i think ill have a word with the good father ill see you back at the hotelperhaps we can have dinner together of course she waved to him as he went out and then sat back against the window her face motionless and without expression a hundred yards away dr sanders caught sight of the priest balthus had reached the outskirts of the native market and was moving among the first of the stalls turning from left to right as if looking for someone dr sanders followed at a distance the market was almost empty and he decided to keep the priest under observation for a few minutes before approaching him now and then when father balthus glanced about sanders saw his lean face the thin nose raised critically as he peered above the heads of the native women dr sanders glanced down at the stalls pausing to examine the carved statuettes and curios the small local industry had made full use of the waste products of the mines at mont royal and many of the teak and ivory carvings were decorated with fragments of calcite and fluorspar picked from the refuse heaps ingeniously worked into the statuettes to form miniature crowns and necklaces many of the carvings were made from lumps of impure jade and amber and the sculptors had abandoned all pretense to christian imagery and produced squatting idols with pendulous abdomens and grimacing faces still keeping father balthus under scrutiny dr sanders examined a large statuette of a native deity in which two crystals of calcium fluoride formed the eyes the mineral phosphorescing in the sunlight nodding to the stall holder he complimented her on the piece making the most of her opportunity she gave him a wide smile and then drew back a strip of faded calico that covered the rear of the stall my that is a beauty dr sanders reached forward to take the ornament she had exposed but the woman held back his hands glittering below her in the sunlight was what appeared to be an immense crystalline orchid carved from some quartzlike mineral the entire structure of the flower had been reproduced and then embedded within the crystal base almost as if a living specimen had been conjured into the center of a huge cutglass pendant the internal faces of the quartz had been cut with remarkable skill so that a dozen images of the orchid were refracted one upon the other as if seen through a maze of prisms as dr sanders moved his head a continuous font of light poured from the jewel dr sanders reached into his pocket for his wallet and the woman smiled again and drew the cover back to expose several more of the ornaments next to the orchid was a spray of leaves attached to a twig carved from a translucent jadeike stone each of the leaves had been reproduced with exquisite craftsmanship the veins forming a pale lattice beneath the crystal the spray of seven leaves faithfully rendered down to the axillary buds and the faint warping of the twig seemed characteristic more of some medieval japanese jewelers art than of the crude massive sculpture of africa next to the spray was an even more bizarre piece a carved tree fungus that resembled a huge jeweled sponge both this and the spray of leaves shone with a dozen images of themselves refracted through the faces of the surrounding mount bending forward dr sanders placed himself between the ornaments and the sun but the light within them sparkled as if coming from some interior source before he could open his wallet there was a shout in the distance a disturbance had broken out near one of the stalls the stall holders ran about in all directions and a womans voice cried out in the center of this scene stood father balthus arms raised above his head as he held something in his hands black robes lifted like the wings of a revenging bird wait for me sanders called over his shoulder to the stall owner but she had covered up her display sliding the tray out of sight among the stacks of palm leaves and baskets of cocoa meal at the back of the stall leaving her dr sanders ran through the crowd toward father balthus the priest now stood alone surrounded by a circle of onlookers holding in his upraised hands a large native carving of a crucifix brandishing it like a sword over his head he waved it from left to right as if semaphoring to some distant peak every few seconds he stopped and lowered the carving to inspect it his thin face tense and perspiring the statuette a cruder cousin of the jeweled orchid dr sanders had seen was carved from a paleyellow gemstone similar to chrysolite the outstretched figure of the christ embedded in a sheath of prismlike quartz as the priest waved the statuette in the air shaking it in a paroxysm of anger the crystals seemed to deliquesce the light pouring from them as from a burning taper balthus dr sanders pushed through the crowd watching the priest the faces were half averted keeping an eye open for the police as if the people were aware of their own complicity in whatever act of lиsemajestй father balthus was now punishing the priest ignored them and continued to shake the carving then lowered it from the air and felt the crystalline surface balthus what on earth sanders began but the priest shouldered him aside whirling the crucifix like a propeller he watched its light flashing away intent only on exorcising whatever powers it held for him there was a shout from one of the stall holders and dr sanders saw a native police sergeant approaching cautiously in the distance immediately the crowd began to scatter panting from his efforts father balthus let one end of the crucifix fall to the ground still holding it like a blunted sword he looked down at its dull surface the crystalline sheath had vanished into the air obscene obscene he muttered to dr sanders as the latter took his arm and propelled him through the stalls sanders paused to toss the carving onto the blue sheet covering the owners stall the shaft fashioned from some kind of polished wood felt like a stick of ice he pulled a fivefranc note from his wallet and stuffed it into the stall owners hands then pushed father balthus in front of him the priest was staring up at the sky and at the distant forest beyond the market deep within the great boughs the leaves flickered with the same hard light that had flared from the cross balthus cant you see sanders took the priests hand in a firm grip when they reached the wharf the pale hand was as cold as the crucifix it was meant as a compliment there was nothing obscene thereyouve seen a thousand jeweled crosses the priest at last seemed to recognize him his narrow face stared sharply at the doctor he pulled his hand away you obviously dont understand doctor that cross was not jeweled dr sanders watched him stride off head and shoulders held stiffly with a fierce selfsufficient pride the slim hands behind his back twisting and fretting like nervous serpents later that day as he and louise peret had dinner together in the deserted hotel dr sanders said i dont know what the good fathers motives are but im certain his bishop wouldnt approve of them you think he may havechanged sides louise asked laughing at this sanders replied that may be putting it too strongly but i suspect that professionally speaking he was trying to confirm his doubts rather than allay them that cross in the market drove him into a frenzyhe was literally trying to shake it to death but why ive seen those native carvings theyre beautiful but just ordinary pieces of jewelry no louise thats the point as balthus knew theyre not ordinary by any means theres something about the light they give outi didnt get a chance to examine one closelybut it seems to come from inside them not from the sun a hard intense light you can see it all over port matarre i know louises hand strayed to the sunglasses that lay beside her plate safely within reach like some potent talisman at intervals she automatically opened and closed them when you first arrive here everything seems dark but then you look at the forest and see the stars burning in the leaves she tapped the glasses thats why i wear these doctor is it sanders picked up the glasses and held them in the air one of the largest pairs he had seen their frames were almost three inches deep where did you get them theyre huge louise they divide your face into two halves louise shrugged she lit a cigarette with a nervous flourish its march doctor the day of the equinox the equinox yes of coursewhen the sun crosses the equator and day and night are the same length sanders pondered this these divisions into dark and light seemed everywhere around them in port matarre in the contrasts between ventresss white suit and balthuss dark soutane in the white arcades with their shadowed infills and even in his thoughts of suzanne clair the somber twin of the young woman watching him across the table with her frank eyes at least you can choose doctor thats one thing nothing is blurred or gray now she leaned forward why did you come to port matarre these friends are you really looking for them sanders turned away from her level gaze its too difficult to explain i he debated whether to confide in her and then with an effort pulled himself together sitting up he touched her hand look tomorrow we must try to hire a car or a boat if we share expenses it will give us longer in mont royal ill gladly come with you but do you think its safe for the time being whatever the police think im sure its not a virus growth he felt the emerald in the gilt ring on louises finger and added in a small way im something of an expert in these matters without moving her hand from his touch louise said quietly im sure you are doctor i spoke briefly this afternoon to the steward on the steamer she added my aunts cook is now a patient at your lйproserie sanders hesitated louise its not my lйproserie dont think im committed to it as you say perhaps we have a firm choice now they had finished their coffee sanders stood up and took louises arm perhaps because of her resemblance to suzanne he seemed to understand her movements as her hips and shoulders touching his own as if familiar intimacies were already beginning to repeat themselves louise avoided his eyes but her body remained close to him as they moved between the tables they walked out into the empty lobby the desk clerk sat asleep with his head leaning against the small switchboard to their left the brass rails of the staircase shone in the damp light the limp fronds of the potted palms trailing onto the worn marble steps still holding louises arm and feeling her fingers take his hand sanders glanced out through the entrance in the shadows of the arcade he caught a glimpse of the shoes and trousers of a man leaning against a column its too late to go out louise said sanders looked down at her aware that for once all the inertia of sexual conventions and his own reluctance to involve himself intimately with others had slipped away in addition he felt that the past day at port matarre the ambivalent atmosphere of the deserted town in some way placed them at a pivotal point below the dark and white shadows of the equinox at these moments of balance any act was possible as they reached his door louise drew her hand away and stepped forward into the darkened room sanders followed her and closed the door louise turned toward him the pale light from the neon sign below illuminating one side of her face and mouth knocking her glasses to the floor as their hands brushed sanders held her in his arms freeing himself for the moment from suzanne clair and the dark image of her face that floated like a dim lantern before his eyes shortly after midnight as sanders lay asleep across the pillow on his bed he woke to feel louise touch his shoulder louise he reached up and put his arm around her waist but she disengaged his hand what is it the window go to the window and look up to the southeast what sanders gazed at her serious face beckoning him across the room in the moonlight of course louise she waited by the bed as he crossed the faded carpet and unlatched the mosquito doors peering upward he stared into the starfilled sky in front of him at an elevation of fortyfive degrees he picked out the constellations taurus and orion passing them was a star of immense magnitude a huge corona of light borne in front of it and eclipsing the smaller stars in its path at first sanders failed to recognize this as the echo satellite its luminosity had increased by at least tenfold transforming the thin pinpoint of light that had burrowed across the night sky for so many faithful years into a brilliant luminary outshone only by the moon all over africa from the liberian coast to the shores of the red sea it would now be visible a vast aerial lantern fired by the same light he had seen in the jeweled flowers that afternoon thinking lamely that perhaps the balloon might be breaking up forming a cloud of aluminum like a gigantic mirror dr sanders watched the satellite setting in the southeast as it faded the dark canopy of the jungle flickered with a million points of light beside him louises white body glittered in a sheath of diamonds the black surface of the river below spangled like the back of a sleeping snake mulatto on the catwalks in the darkness the worn columns of the arcade receded toward the eastern fringes of the town like pale ghosts overtopped by the silent canopy of the forest sanders stopped outside the entrance of the hotel and let the night air play on his creased suit the faint odor of louises scent still clung to his face and hands he stepped out into the road and looked up at his window unsettled by the image of the satellite which had crossed the night sky like a warning beacon sanders had left the narrow highceilinged hotel room and decided to go out for a walk as he set off along the arcade toward the river now and then passing the huddled form of a native asleep inside a roll of corrugated paper he thought of louise with her quick smile and nervous hands and her obsessional sunglasses for the first time he felt convinced of the complete reality of port matarre already his memories of the lйproserie and suzanne clair had faded in some ways his journey to mont royal had lost its point if anything it would have made more sense to take louise back to fort isabelle and try to work out his life afresh there in terms of her rather than suzanne yet the need to find suzanne clair whose distant presence like a baleful planet hung over the jungle toward mont royal still remained for louise too he sensed that there were other preoccupations she had told him something of her unsettled background a childhood in one of the french communities in the congo and later of some kind of humiliation during the revolt against the central government after independence when she and several other journalists had been caught in the rebel province of katanga by mutinous gendarmerie for louise as well as for himself port matarre with its empty light was a neutral point a dead zone on the african equator to which they had both been drawn however nothing achieved there between themselves or anyone else would necessarily have any lasting value at the end of the street opposite the lights of the halfempty police prefecture sanders turned right along the river and walked toward the native market the steamer had sailed for libreville and the main wharves were deserted the gray hulls of four landing craft tied together in pairs below the market was the native harbor a maze of small piers and catwalks this waterborne shanty town of some two hundred boats and rafts was occupied at night by the stall holders in the market a few fires burned from the tin stoves in the steering wells lighting up the sleeping cubicles beneath the curved rattan roofs one or two men sat on the catwalks above the boats and a small group were playing dice at the end of the first pier but otherwise the floating cantonment was silent its cargo of jewelry eclipsed by the night the bar which louise and he had visited the previous afternoon was still open in the alleyway opposite the entrance two african youths in blue denims were lounging around an abandoned motorcar one of them sitting on the hood against the windscreen as sanders entered the bar they watched him with studied casualness the bar was almost empty at the far end a european plantation manager and his african foreman were talking to two of the local halfcaste traders sanders carried his whisky to a booth by the window and looked out across the river calculating when the satellite would make a second traverse he was thinking again of the jeweled leaves he had seen in the market that afternoon when someone touched his shoulder and murmured dr sanders youre up late doctor sanders turned to find the small whitesuited figure of ventress gazing down at him with his familiar ironic smile remembering their brush the previous day sanders said no ventress early im a day ahead of you ventress nodded eagerly as if glad to see sanders gaining an advantage over him even if only a verbal one although he was standing he seemed to sanders to have shrunk in size his jacket tightly buttoned across his narrow chest thats good sanders very good ventress glanced around the deserted booths can i join you for a moment well sanders made no effort to be agreeable the incident with the automatic pistol reminded him of the element of calculation in everything ventress did after the past few hours with louise the last person he wanted near him was ventress with his manic rhythms could you my dear sanders dont let me embarrass you ill stand oblivious of sanderss halfturned shoulder ventress carried on how sensible of you doctor the nights in port matarre are far more interesting than the days dont you agree sanders looked around at this uncertain of ventresss point the man watching from the opposite arcade as he and louise made their way up the staircase might well have been ventress in a sense astronomy isnt one of your hobbies by any chance ventress asked he leaned over the table with his mock smile i saw the satellite if thats what youre driving at sanders said tell me how do you account for itthe sudden increase in magnitude ventress nodded sagely a large question doctor to answer it i would needliterally i fearall the time in the world before sanders could question him the door opened and one of the african youths he had seen by the car outside entered a quick glance passed between himself and ventress and the youth slipped out again with a short bow at sanders ventress turned and pulled his crocodileskin suitcase from the booth behind sanders he paused on his way out and whispered at sanders all the time in the world remember that doctor wondering what it was that ventress felt the need to hide behind these riddles dr sanders finished his whisky ventresss white figure suitcase in hand disappeared into the darkness near the piers the two africans moving quickly ahead of him sanders gave him five minutes to make his departure assuming that ventress was about to leave by boat whether hired or stolen for mont royal although he would soon be following ventress there sanders was glad to be left alone in port matarre ventresss presence in some way added an unnecessary random element to the already confused patterns of arcade and shadow like a chessgame in which both players suspected that there was a concealed piece on the board as he walked past the abandoned motorcar sanders noticed that some sort of commotion was going on in the center of the native harbor many of the fires had been doused others were being fanned to life and the flames danced in the disturbed water as the boats shifted and moved about the overhead catwalks that crisscrossed the piers swayed under the weight of running men swinging themselves along the handrails as they swerved after each other like shuttles sanders moved closer to the edge of the water then he saw ventresss small white figure darting about in the center of the chase like a spider trapped in a collapsing web ventress shouted to the youth carrying his suitcase along the catwalk ten yards in front of him a tall crophaired mulatto in a khaki bushshirt was swarming towards them a length of weighted hosepipe in his scarred hand behind ventress the second youth had been beaten to the floor of the catwalk by two men in dark sweatshirts knives flashed in their hands and the youth kicked at them and leapt sideways through the catwalk like a wriggling fish about to be gutted he landed on a boat below a long gash torn down the side of his denims holding the blood against his leg with one hand he scrambled across the next boat to the pier then ran off among the bales of cocoa meal on the catwalk above ventress shouted again and the youth carrying the suitcase lifted the bag and feinted with it as the mulatto swung the hosepipe at his head tossing the suitcase through the air in front of him the youth slid below the rail and vaulted down on to the second rank of boats moored against the pier crushing the rattan roof as he landed the hovel collapsed in a mкlйe of blankets and upturned petrol cans there was a vivid glimmer as a cache of crystalline jewelry was exposed to the fires in the other boats watching the brilliant jewels reflected in the broken water of the harbor as the lines of boats slipped from their moorings sanders heard the hard detonation of a gunshot sound out above the noise the automatic pistol in his hand ventress crouched down on the catwalk he fired again at the mulatto with the truncheon as the mulatto backed away up a gangway to the wharf ventress glanced over his shoulder at the two men behind him both now motionless against the handrail their dark bodies almost invisible holstering the pistol ventress lowered himself off the edge of the catwalk and leapt down on to the deck of the boat below ignoring the boats owner a small grayhaired african trying to gather together the harvest of jeweled leaves scattered around him in the well of the boat ventress upended the trestle roof covered by a blanket his two assistants had vanished among the boats between the next two piers but ventress seemed intent only on finding the suitcase one by one he moved along the boats kicking back the calico awnings his pistol holding off the owners as he stepped from one boat to the next a jeweled wake lay behind him the three men on the catwalk above were reflected in the flaring light giving up the hunt for his suitcase ventress pushed through the stall holders he climbed up on to the pier at its far end a small motorboat lay moored by a single line to a sawnoff pile ventress reached the end of the pier cast off the line and climbed into the boat for a moment he worked at the controls and the starting motor whined above the noise a second later there was a jolting explosion from the bow locker of the boat and a vivid geyser of flame lifted into the dark air knocked back against the tiller ventress looked up at the flames burning across the deck panels in front of the shattered windscreen as the boat drifted back across the pier he managed to pull himself together and jumped up on to the floating box frame that served as a gangway pushing past the few africans watching from the shore sanders climbed on to the pier and ran towards ventress hurt by the explosion the whitesuited man had not seen the pale outline of a large motorcruiser that had been waiting out on the river some twenty yards from the end of the pier standing at the helm on the bridge from where he had watched the pursuit across the catwalks was a tall broadshouldered man in a dark suit his long face partly hidden behind the white shaft of the radio mast on the deck below him was what appeared to be a yachtclub starting cannon its squat polished barrel gleaming in the light as the burning motorboat drifted past the end of the pier the flames subsided and the cruiser and its watching owner sank once again into the darkness halfway along the pier sanders saw the cropheaded mulatto swing down from the catwalk in front of him he had thrown away the truncheon and a thin silver blade flickered in his huge hand he crept up behind ventress who sat numbly on the edge of the pier watching the burning motorboat move into the shallows ventress running hard sanders caught up with the mulatto and in his rush knocked the man off balance recovering with the speed of a snake the mulatto lunged round and drove his shaved head at sanders hitting him in the chest he bent down to retrieve his knife his white eyes swinging from ventress to the doctor and back again a hundred yards along the shore a signal flare rose into the air over the harbor its muffled light burned with a dull glow a siren began to wail its noise mounting over the warehouses a police truck stopped at the foot of the next pier and its headlights illuminated the last of the crystalline jewels now being hidden away beneath the awnings the burning motorboat had drifted against one of the catwalk supports and the tarstreaked wood had caught fire the flames flaring along the dry timbers sanders lunged with one foot at the mulatto then wrenched at a halfloose timber sticking from the pier the mulatto peered at the police truck he seized the knife then ran straight past sanders along the pier and dived down among the boats on the far side ventress sanders knelt beside him and brushed at the cinders that had burned themselves into the fabric of the mans suit can you walk the police are here ventress stood up his eyes clearing behind the beard his small face seemed completely closed he appeared to have no idea what had happened and held on to sanderss arm like an old man behind them out on the river there was a muted roar and white water broke behind the stern of the waiting cruiser as it moved away ventress came to life still holding sanderss arm but this time guiding him he began to run along the pier head down doctor we cant wait here his head swivelled from left to right as he watched the burning catwalk now dividing itself as it collapsed into the water when they reached the bank and moved behind the small crowd standing on the slope he turned to sanders my thanks doctor i was almost out of time myself there before sanders could reply ventress darted off among the stacks of gasoline drums in the entrance to one of the warehouses sanders followed him and saw ventress disappear behind the abandoned motorcar in the harbor the fires had burned themselves out the charred sections of the catwalk steamed and spat in the dark air the police moved along the other catwalks with their machetes cutting them one by one into the water the stall holders below shouting as they paddled their boats out of the way sanders walked back to his hotel avoiding the arcades disturbed from their sleep the mendicants sat up in their cardboard wrappings and wheedled at him as he went past their eyes shining from the dark columns louise had returned to her room switching off the light sanders sat down in the chair by the window the last traces of louises scent dissolved in the air as he watched the dawn lift over the distant hills of mont royal illuminating the serpentine course of the river as if revealing a secret pathway a drowned man the next morning the body of a drowned man was taken from the river at port matarre shortly after ten oclock dr sanders and louise peret walked down to the harbor by the native market in the hope of hiring one of the boatmen to take them upriver to mont royal the harbor was almost empty and most of the boats had moved across the river to the settlements on the far bank the wrecked catwalks lay in the water like the skeletons of halfdrowned lizards one or two of the fishermen poking around among them the market was quiet either as a result of the incident the previous night or because father balthuss scene with the jeweled cross had dissuaded the owners of the curio stalls from putting in an appearance despite the compacted glitter of the forest during the night by day the jungle had become dark and somber again as if the foliage were recharging itself from the sun this pervading sense of unease convinced sanders of the need to leave for mont royal with louise as soon as possible as they walked along he watched for any signs of the mulatto and his two assistants however from the scale of the attack upon ventresswithout doubt the armed motorcruiser and its watching helmsman had played some part in the attempted murder sanders assumed that the wouldbe assassins were by now a safe distance from the police during the short walk from the hotel sanders had halfexpected to hear ventress whisper to him from the shadows within the arcade but there had been no signs of him in the town however improbable the unrelieved heaviness of the light over port matarre convinced sanders that the whitesuited figure had already left to louise he pointed out the jumble of wrecked catwalks and the charred hulk of the motorboat lying in the shallows and described the attack by the mulatto and his men perhaps he was trying to steal some jewelry from the boats louise suggested they may just have been defending themselves no it was more than thatthis mulatto was really after ventress if the police hadnt arrived wed both have ended up face down in the river how horrible for you louise took his arm as if barely convinced of sanderss physical identity in the nexus of uncertainty at port matarre but why should anyone attack him ive no ideayou didnt find anything out about ventress no i was following you most of the time i havent even seen this small man with a beard you make him sound very sinister sanders laughed at this holding her shoulders for a few steps he said my dear louise you have a bluebeard complexlike all women as a matter of fact ventress isnt in the least sinister on the contrary hes rather naive and vulnerable like bluebeard i suppose well not quite but the way he talks in riddles all the timeits as if hes frightened of revealing himself id say he knew something about this crystallizing process but why shouldnt he tell you directly how could it have any bearing on his own situation sanders paused glancing down at the sunglasses which louise still carried in her hand doesnt it with all of us louise there are white shadows as well as black behind us in port matarrewhy god alone knows still of one thing im sure theres no actual physical danger from this process or ventress would have warned me if anything he was encouraging me to go to mont royal louise shrugged perhaps it would suit him to have you there perhaps they had passed the main piers of the native harbor and sanders stopped and spoke to the halfcastes who owned the small group of fishing boats moored along the bank they shook their heads when he mentioned mont royal or seemed too unreliable to trust he rejoined louise no good theyre the wrong kind of boats anyway is that the ferry over there louise pointed a hundred yards along the bank where half a dozen people stood at the waters edge near a landing stage two men armed with poles were steering in a large skiff when louise and dr sanders approached they saw that the boatmen were bringing in the floating body of a dead man the group of onlookers moved back as the body prodded by the two poles was beached in the shallows after a pause someone stepped forward and pulled it on to the damp mud for a few moments everyone looked down at it as the muddy water ran off the drenched clothing and drained from the blanched cheeks and eyes oooohh with a shudder louise turned and backed away stumbling a few feet up the bank to the landing stage leaving her dr sanders bent down to inspect the body that of a muscular fairskinned european of about thirty it appeared to have suffered no external physical injuries from the extent to which the dye had run from the leather belt and boots it was plain that the man had been immersed in water for four or five days and sanders was surprised to find that rigor mortis had still not occurred the joints and tissues were malleable the skin firm and almost warm what most attracted his attention however like that of the rest of the watching group was the mans right arm from the elbow to the finger tips it was enclosed byor more precisely had effloresced intoa mass of translucent crystals through which the prismatic outlines of the hand and fingers could be seen in a dozen multicolored reflections this huge jeweled gauntlet like the coronation armor of a spanish conquistador was drying in the sun its crystals beginning to emit a hard vivid light dr sanders looked over his shoulder someone else had joined the watching group looking down at them from the top of the bank his dark robe held below his hunched shoulders like the wings of a huge carrion bird was the tall figure of father balthus his eyes were fixed on the dead mans jeweled arm a small tic in one corner of his mouth was fluttering as if some blasphemous requiem for the dead man was discharging itself below the surface of the priests consciousness then with an effort he turned on one heel and walked off along the river toward the town dr sanders stood up as one of the watermen came forward he stepped through the circle of onlookers and made his way to louise peret is that anderson the american you recognized him louise shook her head the cameraman matthieu they went off in the car together she looked up at sanders her face contorted his arm what happened to it dr sanders moved her away from the group of people looking down at the body as the jeweled light discharged itself from the crystalline tissues fifty yards away father balthus was striding past the native harbor the fishermen stepping out of his path sanders gazed around trying to take his bearings its rime to find out somewhere weve got to get hold of a boat louise straightened her handbag searching for her pencil and shorthand pad edward i thinki must get this story out id like to go to mont royal with you but with a dead man its not just guesswork any more louise dr sanders held her arm already he sensed that the physical bond between them was slippinglouises eyes were turned away from him toward the body on the shore as if she understood that there was little point in her going with sanders to mont royal and that his real motives for wanting to sail upriver his quest for an end to all suzanne clair stood for in his mind concerned him alone yet sanders felt reluctant to let her go however fragmentary their relationship it offered at least an alternative to suzanne louise if we dont leave this morning well never get away from here once the police find that body theyll put a cordon around the whole of mont royal if not port matarre as well he hesitated and then added that man had been in the water for at least four days probably carried downstream all the way from mont royal yet he died only half an hour ago what do you mean precisely that he was still warm do you understand when i say we must leave for mont royal now the story you want will be there and youll be the first sanders broke off aware that their conversation was being overheard they were walking along the quay and to their right twenty feet away a motorboat moved slowly through the water keeping pace with them sanders recognized the redandyellow craft brought to port matarre on the steamer standing at the controls one hand lightly on the steering helm was a raffishlooking man with a droll handsome face he eyed dr sanders with a kind of amiable curiosity as if balancing the advantages and drawbacks of becoming involved with him dr sanders motioned to louise to stop the helmsman cut his engine and the motorboat drifted in an arc toward the bank dr sanders walked down to it leaving louise on the quay a fine boat you have there sanders said to the helmsman the tall man made a deprecating gesture then gave sanders an easy smile im glad you appreciate it doctor he pointed to louise peret i can see you have a good eye mlle peret is a colleague of mine im more interested in boats just now this one traveled with me on the steamer from libreville then you know doctor its a fine craft as you say it could take you to mont royal in four or five hours excellent indeed dr sanders glanced at his watch what would you charge for such a trip captain aragon the tall man took a partly smoked cheroot from behind his ear and gestured with it at louise for one or both of you doctor louise called down still uncertain im not sure for the two of us dr sanders said turning his back on the young woman well want to go today within half an hour if possible now how much for a few minutes they argued over the price then agreed aragon started his motor and shouted ill see you at the next pier doctor in an hour the tide will have turned it will carry us half the way at noon their suitcases stowed away in the locker behind the engine they set off upriver in the speedboat dr sanders sat beside aragon in the front seat while louise peret her dark hair flowing behind her in the slipstream sat in one of the bucket seats behind as they swept up the brown tidal river the arcs of spray rainbowing behind them sanders felt the oppressive silence that had pervaded port matarre lift for the first time since his arrival the deserted arcades of which they had a last glimpse as they headed out into the main channel and the somber forest seemed to recede into the background separated from him by the roar and speed of the motorboat they passed the police wharf a corporal lounging there with his squad watched them sweep by on a wake of foam the powerful motor lifted the craft high out of the water and aragon leaned forward watching the surface for any floating logs there were few other craft about one or two native outriggers moved along by the edge of the banks half hidden by the overhanging foliage a mile from port matarre they passed the private jetties owned by the cocoa plantations the empty lighters lay unattended under the idle cranes weeds sprang between the tracks of the smallgauge railways and climbed up the gantries of the storage silos everywhere the forest hung motionless in the warm air and the speed and spray of the motorboat seemed to dr sanders like an illusionist trick the flickering shutter of a defective cinecamera half an hour later when they reached the tidal limits of the river some ten miles inland aragon slowed down so that they could watch the water more closely dead trees and large pieces of bark drifted past now and then they came across sections of abandoned wharves that had been pulled off their moorings by the current the river seemed untended and refusestrewn carrying the litter of deserted towns and villages this is quite a boat captain dr sanders complimented aragon as the latter changed fuel tanks to preserve the balance of the craft aragon nodded steering the boat past the remains of a floating hut faster than the police launches doctor im sure it is what do you use it for diamond smuggling aragon turned his head casting a sharp eye at sanders despite the latters reserved manner aragon seemed already to have made his own judgment of the doctors character he shrugged sadly so i hoped doctor but too late now why do you say that aragon looked up at the dark forest draining all light from the air youll see doctor well soon be there when were you last at mont royal captain sanders asked he glanced back at louise she leaned forward to catch aragons replies holding her hair against her cheek not for five weeks the police took my old boat do you know whats going on up there have they found a new mine aragon gave a laugh at this and then steered the boat at a large white bird sitting on a log in their path with a cry it took off straight over their heads its huge wings working like ungainly oars you could say that doctor but not in the way you mean he added before sanders could question him further i really saw nothing i was on the river it was during the night you saw the dead man in the harbor this morning aragon paused for half a minute before replying at last he said el dorado the man of gold and jewels in an armor of diamonds theres an end many would wish for doctor perhaps he was a friend of mlle peret of mlle with a grimace aragon sat forward over the helm shortly after one thirty when they were almost halfway to mont royal they stopped by a derelict jetty that jutted out into the river from an abandoned plantation sitting on the soft beams over the water they ate their lunch of ham and rolls followed by cafй royal nothing moved across the river or along the banks and to sanders it seemed that the entire area had been deserted perhaps because of this any conversation between them had lapsed aragon sat by himself staring out at the water that swept past the marked slope of his forehead and his lean face with its pointed cheekbones had given him a sharp piratical look along the waterfront at port matarre but here surrounded on all sides by the oppressive jungle he seemed less sure of himself more like some triggernerved forest guide why he had chosen to take sanders and louise to mont royal remained obscure but sanders guessed that he was drawn back to this focal area by motives as uncertain as his own louise had also withdrawn into herself as she smoked her cigarette after the meal she avoided sanderss eyes deciding to leave her alone for the time being sanders walked away along the pier picking his way across the broken boards until he reached the bank the forest had reentered the plantation and the giant trees hung silently in lines one dark cliff behind another in the distance he could see the ruined plantation house creepers entwined through the rafters of the outbuildings ferns overgrew the garden of the house running up to the doors and sprouting through the planks of the porch avoiding this mournful wreck sanders strolled around the perimeter of the garden following the faded stones of a pathway he passed the wire screen of a tennis court the mesh covered by creepers and moss and then reached the drained basin of an ornamental fountain sanders sat down on the balustrade and took out his cigarettes he was looking across at the plantation house a few minutes later when he sat forward with a start watching him from an upstairs window of the house was a tall paleskinned woman with a white mantilla covering her head and shoulders the dark creepers clustering at the window around her sanders threw away his cigarette and ran forward through the ferns he reached the porch and kicked back the dusty frame of the door then made his way toward the wide staircase here and there his shoes sank through the balsalike boards but the marble steps were still firm the house had been stripped of its furniture and he crossed the landing upstairs to the bedroom in which he had seen the woman louise with a laugh she turned to face him the puffy remains of an old lace curtain falling from one hand to the floor shaking her hair lightly she smiled at sanders did i frighten you im sorry louisethat was a damn silly thing to do with an effort sanders controlled himself his moment of recognition fading how the devil did you get up here louise sauntered around the room looking at the patches left behind the pictures that had been removed as if visiting some spectral gallery i walked of course she turned to face him her eyes sharpening whats the matterdid i remind you of someone sanders went over to her perhaps you did louise its difficult enough without any practical jokes it wasnt meant as a joke she took his arm her ironic smile gone edward im sorry i shouldnt have never mind sanders held her face to his shoulder recovering himself in the physical contact with louise for gods sake louise all this will be over once we reach mont royalbefore i had no choice of course she drew him away from the window aragonhe can see us here the lace curtain lay on the floor at their feet the mantilla sanders had seen from the drained fountain in the garden as louise began to kneel down on it holding his hands he shook his head then kicked it away into the corner later when they returned to the motorboat aragon met them halfway down the pier we should leave doctor he said the boat is exposed heresometimes they patrol the river of course how many soldiers are there in the mont royal area sanders asked four or five hundred perhaps more a battalion thats a lot of men captain he offered aragon a cigarette from his case as louise walked on ahead that incident in the native harbor last nightdid you see it no i heard this morningthose market boats are always catching fire perhaps there was an attack on a man i knowa european called ventress he looked up at aragon there was a large motorcruiser with a cannon on the deckyou may have seen it on the river aragons face gave nothing away he shrugged vaguely it could belong to one of the mining companies i havent met this ventress before sanders could move on he added remember doctor there are many interests in mont royal that wish to stop people from going into the forestor leaving it i can see that by the way that drowned man in the harbor this morningwhen you saw him was he lying on a raft by any chance aragon inhaled slowly on the cigarette watching sanders with some respect thats a good guess doctor and as for this armor of light was he covered with the crystals from head to foot aragon gave him a grimace of a smile revealing a gold eyetooth he tapped it with his forefinger coveredis that the right word my tooth is the whole gold doctor i take the point sanders gazed down at the brown water sweeping past the polished timbers of the jetty louise waved to him from her place in the boat but he was too preoccupied to reply you see captain im wondering whether this man matthieu he was called was dead in the absolute sense when you saw him if say in the choppy open water of the harbor he had been knocked from the raft but still held on in some way with one handthat would explain a lot it might have very important consequences you see what i mean aragon smoked his cigarette watching the crocodiles that lay in the shallows below the opposite bank then he threw the halfsmoked cigarette into the water i think we should set off for mont royal now the army here is not very intelligent they have other things to think about but you may well be right mile peret thinks there is a physicist on the way if so he should be able to prevent any more tragic accidents just before they started off aragon turned to dr sanders and said i was wondering doctor why you were so eager to go to mont royal the remark seemed by way of apology for earlier suspicions but sanders found himself laughing defensively with a shrug he said two of my closest friends are in the affected zone as well as louises american colleague naturally were worried about them the automatic temptation of the army will be to seal off the entire area and see what happens they were loading barbed wire and fencing in the barracks at port matarre yesterday for anyone trapped within the cordon it could be like being frozen solid inside a glacier the crystallized forest five miles from mont royal the river narrowed to little more than a hundred yards in width aragon reduced the speed of their craft to a few knots steering between the islands of rubbish that drifted by and avoiding the creepers that hung far out over the water from the high jungle walls on either side sitting forward dr sanders searched the forest but the great trees were still dark and motionless they emerged into a more open stretch where part of the undergrowth along the righthand bank had been cut back to provide a small clearing as dr sanders pointed to a collection of derelict outbuildings there was a tremendous blare of noise from the forest canopy above them as if a huge engine had been mounted in the topmost branches and a moment later a helicopter soared past above the trees it disappeared from view its noise reverberating off the foliage the few birds around them flickered away into the darkness of the forest and the idling crocodiles submerged into the barkstained water as the helicopter hovered into view again a quarter of a mile ahead of them aragon cut the throttle and began to turn the craft toward the bank but sanders shook his head we might as well carry on captain we cant make it on foot through the forest the farther we can go upriver the better as they continued down the center of the channel the helicopter continued to circle overhead sometimes swinging up to a height of eight or nine hundred feet as if to take a better look at the winding river at other times soaring low over the water fifty yards in front of them the wheels almost touching the surface then abruptly it zoomed away and carried out a wide circuit of the forest rounding the next bend where the river widened into a small harbor they found that a pontoon barrage stretched across the channel from one bank to the next on the right along the wharves were the warehouses bearing the names of the mining companies two landing craft and several military launches were tied up and native soldiers moved about unloading equipment and drums of fuel in the clearing beyond a substantial military camp had been set up the lines of tents ran off between the trees partly hidden by the gray festoons of moss large piles of metal fencing lay about and a squad of men were painting a number of black signs with luminous paint halfway across the pontoon barrage a french sergeant with an electric megaphone called to them pointing to the wharves a droite a droite a group of soldiers waited by the jetty leaning on their rifles aragon hesitated turning the boat in a slow spiral what now doctor sanders shrugged well have to go in theres no point in trying to cut and run for it if im going to find the clairs and louise is to get her story well have to do it on the armys terms they coasted in toward the wharf between the two landing craft and aragon threw the lines up to the waiting soldiers as they climbed up on to the wooden deck the sergeant with the megaphone walked down the barrage you made good time doctor the helicopter only just caught up with you he pointed between the warehouses to a small landing field by the camp with a roar of noise throwing up a tremendous fountain of dust the helicopter was coming in to land you knew we were coming i thought the telephone line was down correct but we have a radio you know doctor the sergeant smiled amiably his relaxed good humor uncharacteristic of the military in its dealings with civilinns suggested to sanders that perhaps the events in the forest near by for once had made these soldiers only too glad to see their fellow men whether in uniform or out the sergeant greeted louise and aragon consulting a slip of paper mile peret monsieur aragon would you come this way captain radek would like a word with you doctor certainly tell me sergeant if you have a radio how is it that the police at port matarre have no idea whats going on what is going on doctor thats a question many people are trying to solve at this moment as for the police at port matarre we tell them as little as we think good for them were not eager to spread rumors you know they set off toward a large metal hut that formed the battalions headquarters dr sanders looked back at the river along the barrage across the channel two young soldiers walked to and fro with large butterfly nets in their hands fishing methodically at the water that ran through the wire mesh hanging from the pontoons more amphibious craft were moored against the wharf on the upstream side of the barrage their crews sitting at the ready the two landing craft sat low in the water loaded almost to capacity with huge crates and bales a random selection of household effectsrefrigerators airconditioners and the likeand units of machinery and office cabinets as they reached the edge of the landing strip dr sanders saw that the main runway consisted of a section of the port matarremont royal highway half a mile away the road had been sealed off by lines of fiftygallon drums painted with blackandwhite stripes beyond this point the forest sloped slowly upwards giving way to the blue hills of the mining area lower down by the river the white rooftops of the town shone in the sunlight above the jungle two other aircraft highwing military monoplanes were parked off the runway the rotors of the helicopter had stopped and drooped downwards over the heads of a group of four or five civilians stepping unsteadily out of the cabin as he reached the door of the hut dr sanders recognized the blackgarbed figure walking across the dusty ground edward louise held his arm whos that over there the priest balthus sanders turned to the sergeant as the latter opened the door whats he doing here the sergeant paused for a moment watching sanders his parish is here doctor near the town surely we have to let him in of course sanders collected himself his sharp reaction to the arrival of the priest made him realize how far he already identified himself with the forest he pointed to the civilians still finding their landlegs and the others agriculture experts they arrived at port matarre by flying boat this morning sounds like a big operation have you seen the forest sergeant the sergeant held up his hand captain radek will explain doctor he ushered dr sanders across the corridor then opened a door into a small waiting room and beckoned to louise and aragon mlleplease make yourself comfortable i will have some coffee brought to you but sergeant i have to louise began to remonstrate with the sergeant but sanders put his hand on her shoulder louise its best if you wait here ill find out all i can aragon waved to sanders well see you later doctor ill keep an eye on your suitcases captain radek was waiting for dr sanders in his office a doctor in the army medical corps he was plainly glad to find another physician in the neighborhood sit down doctor its a pleasure to see you first of all to put your mind at rest may i say that an inspection party will be leaving for the area in half an hour and i have arranged for us to go with them thank you captain what of mlle peret she im sorry doctor but that wont be possible radek placed his hands palmdownwards on the metal desk as if trying to draw some kind of resolution from its hard surface a tall slimly built man with somewhat weak eyes he seemed anxious to come to a personal understanding with sanders the pressure of events making it necessary to dispense with the usual preliminaries of friendship im afraid we are keeping all journalists out of the area for the time being its not my decision but im sure you understand perhaps i should add that there are a number of matters i cannot confide to you our operations in this area evacuation plans and so forthbut i will be as frank as possible professor tatlin flew here direct from libreville this morninghe is at the inspection site nowand im sure he will be glad of your opinion ill be glad to give it dr sanders said its not exactly my field of specialty radek made a limp gesture with one hand then let it fall back onto the desk in a quiet voice out of deference to any feelings sanders might have he said who knows doctor it seems to me that the business here and your own specialty are very similar in a way one is the dark side of the other im thinking of the silver scales of leprosy that give the disease its name he straightened up now tell me have you seen any of the crystallized objects some flowers and leaves sanders decided not to mention the dead man that morning however frank and likeable the young army doctor might seem sanderss first priority was to reach the jungle if they suspected him even of some remote complicity in matthieus death he might well find himself sidetracked into an endless military investigation the native market is full of them theyre selling them as curios radek nodded this has been going on for some timenearly a year in fact first it was costume jewelry then small carvings and holy objects recently theres been quite a trade herethe natives were taking cheap carvings into the active zone leaving them there overnight and going back the next day for them unfortunately some of the stuff the jewelry in particular had a tendency to dissolve the rapid movement dr sanders queried i noticed that a curious effect the discharge of light disconcerting to some of the wearers radek smiled it didnt matter with the costume jewelry but some of the native miners started using the same technique on the small diamonds they smuggled out as you know the diamond mines here dont produce gemstones and everyone was naturally surprised when these huge rocks began to reach the market the share prices on the paris bourse climbed to fantastic heights thats how it all started a man was sent to investigate and ended up in the river there were vested interests there still are we arent the only people trying to keep this quiet the mines here have never been particularly profitable radek seemed about to reveal something and then changed his mind perhaps aware of sanderss withdrawn manner well i think i can tell you in confidence of course that this is not the only affected area in the world at this moment at least two other sites existone in the florida everglades and the other in the pripet marshes of the soviet union naturally both are under intensive investigation then the effect is understood dr sanders asked radek shook his head not at all the soviet team is under the leadership of lysenko as you can imagine he is wasting the russians time he believes that noninherited mutations are responsible and that because there is an apparent increase in tissue weight crop yields can also be increased radek laughed wearily id like to see some of those tough russians trying to chew a piece of this crystallized glass what is tatlins theory in general he agrees with the american experts i spoke to him at the site this morning radek opened a drawer and tossed something from it across the desk to sanders it lay there like crystallized leather giving off a soft light thats a piece of bark i show to visitors dr sanders pushed it back across the desk thank you but i saw the satellite last night radek nodded to himself he scooped the bark back into the drawer with his ruler and closed it obviously glad to have this exhibit out of sight he brushed his fingers together the satellite yes an impressive sight venus now has two lamps not only two either apparently at the mount hubble observatory in the states they have seen distant galaxies efflorescing radek paused collecting his energies with an effort tatlin believes that this hubble effect as they call it is closer to a cancer than anything elseand about as curablean actual proliferation of the subatomic identity of all matter its as if a sequence of displaced but identical images of the same object were being produced by refraction through a prism but with the element of time replacing the role of light there was a knock on the door the sergeant put his head through the inspection party is ready to leave sir good radek stood up and took his cap from the peg well have a look doctor i think youll be impressed five minutes later the party of visitors some dozen in number set off in one of the amphibian craft father balthus was not among them and sanders assumed that he had left for his mission by road however when he asked radek why they were not approaching mont royal by the highway the captain told him that the road was closed in response to sanderss request the captain arranged to make contact by field telephone with the clinic where suzanne and max clair were working the owner of the mine near by a swedishamerican by the name of thorensen would tell them of sanderss arrival and with luck max would be at the wharf to meet him when they landed radek had heard nothing of andersons whereabouts however he explained to louise before they embarked we ourselves have had great difficulty in taking photographsthe crystals look like wet snow in paris theyre still scepticalso he may be hanging about somewhere waiting for a convincing picture as he took his seat near the driver in the bow of the amphibian dr sanders waved to louise peret who was watching from the wharf on the other side of the pontoonbarrage he had promised to return with max for her after they had visited the affected area but even so louise had made a halfhearted attempt to stop him going at all edward wait till i can come with youits too dangerous for you my dear im in good handsthe captain will see everything is all right theres no danger mlle peret radek assured her i will bring him back i didnt mean she embraced sanders hurriedly and walked back to where aragon sat in the speedboat talking to two of the soldiers the presence of the barrage seemed to mark off one section of the forest from the other a point beyond which they entered a world where the normal laws of the physical universe were suspended the mood of the party was subdued and the officials and french experts sat in a group at the stern as if to place the maximum possible distance between themselves and whatever was to face them ahead for ten minutes they moved forward the green walls of the forest slipping past on either side they met a convoy of motor launches harnessed together behind a landing craft all of them were crammed with cargo their decks and cabin roofs loaded with household possessions of every kind perambulators and mattresses washing machines and bundles of linen so that there were only a few inches of freeboard amidships the solemnfaced french and belgian children sat with suitcases on their knees above the freight their parents gazed expressionlessly at sanders and his companions as they passed the last of the craft moved by dragged through the disturbed water sanders turned and watched it go youre evacuating the town he asked radek it was halfempty when we came the affected zone moves about from one place to another its too dangerous for them to stay they were rounding a bend as the river widened in its approach to mont royal and the water ahead was touched by a roseate sheen as if reflecting a distant sunset or the flames of a silent conflagration the sky however remained a bland limpid blue devoid of all clouds they passed below a small bridge where the river opened into a wide basin a quarter of a mile in diameter with a gasp of surprise they all craned forward staring at the line of jungle facing the whiteframed buildings of the town the long arc of trees hanging over the water seemed to drip and glitter with myriads of prisms the trunks and branches sheathed by bars of yellow and carmine light that bled away across the surface of the water as if the whole scene were being reproduced by some overactive technicolor process the entire length of the opposite shore glittered with this blurred kaleidoscope the overlapping bands of color increasing the density of the vegetation so that it was impossible to see more than a few feet between the front line of trunks the sky was clear and motionless the sunlight shining uninterruptedly upon this magnetic shore but now and then a stir of wind crossed the water and the scene erupted into cascades of color that rippled away into the air around them then the coruscation subsided and the images of the individual trees reappeared each sheathed in its armor of light foliage glowing as if loaded with deliquescing jewels moved to astonishment like everyone else in the craft dr sanders stared at this spectacle his hands clasping the rail in front of him the crystal light dappled his face and suit transforming the pale fabric into a brilliant palimpsest of colors the craft moved in a wide arc toward the quay where a group of launches were being loaded with equipment and they came within some twenty yards of the trees the hatchwork of colored light across their clothes transforming them for a moment into a boatload of harlequins there was a round of laughter at this more in relief than amusement then several arms pointed to the waterline and they could see that the process had not affected the vegetation alone extending outwards for two or three yards from the bank were the long splinters of what appeared to be crystallizing water the angular facets emitting a blue and prismatic light washed by the wake from their craft the splinters were growing in the water like crystals in a chemical solution accreting more and more material to themselves so that along the bank there was a congested mass of rhomboidal spears like the barbs of a reef sharp enough to slit the hull of their craft a hubbub of speculation broke out in the launch during which only dr sanders and radek remained silent the captain was gazing up at the overhanging trees encrusted by the translucent lattice through which the sunlight was reflected in rainbows of primary colors unmistakably each tree was still alive its leaves and boughs filled with sap dr sanders was thinking of suzanne clairs letter she had written the forest is a house of jewels for some reason he felt less concerned to find a socalled scientific explanation for the phenomenon he had just seen the beauty of the spectacle had turned the keys of memory and a thousand images of childhood forgotten for nearly forty years filled his mind recalling the paradisal world when everything seemed illuminated by that prismatic light described so exactly by wordsworth in his recollections of childhood the magical shore in front of him seemed to glow like that brief spring dr sanders radek touched his arm we must go now of course sanders pulled himself together the first passengers were disembarking from the gangway at the stern as he walked back between the seats dr sanders started with surprise pointing to a bearded man in a white suit who was crossing the gangway there ventress doctor radek caught up with him peering solicitously into sanderss eyes as if aware of the forests impact are you unwell not at all i thought i recognized someone he watched ventress sidestep past the officials and make off down the quay his bony skull held stiffly above his shoulders a faint multicolored dappling still touched his suit as if the light from the forest had contaminated the fabric and set off the process anew without a backward glance he stepped between two warehouses and disappeared among the sacks of cocoa meal sanders stared after him unsure whether he had in fact seen ventresshad the whitesuited figure been some kind of hallucination set off by the prismatic forest it seemed impossible for ventress to have smuggled himself aboard the craft even by masquerading as one of the agriculture experts though sanders had been so distracted by the prospect of seeing the affected zone for the first time that he had not bothered to look closely at his fellow passengers do you wish to rest doctor radek asked we can pause for a moment if you like they stopped by one of the metal bollards sander sat down on it still thinking of the elusive figure of ventress and its real significance again sanders felt the sense of confusion which the strange light in port matarre had generated a confusion in some way symbolized by ventress and his skulllike face yet however much ventress had seemed to reflect the flaring halflight in the town sanders was sure that here at mont royal the whitesuited man would really come into his own captain without thinking sanders said radek i wasnt entirely frank with you doctor radeks eyes were watching sanderss he nodded slowly as if he already knew what sanders would say dont misunderstand me sanders pointed to the forest glowing across the water im glad youre here radek before i was thinking only of myself i had to leave fort isabelle i do understand you doctor radek touched his arm we must follow the party now as they walked along the wharf radek said in his low voice outside this forest everything seems polarized does it not divided into black and white wait until you reach the trees doctorthere perhaps these things will be reconciled for you the crash their party was divided into several smaller groups each accompanied by two ncos they moved off past the short queue of cars and trucks which the last of the european townsfolk were using to bring their possessions to the wharf the families those of the french and belgian minetechnicians waited their turn patiently flagged on by the military police the streets of mont royal were deserted and the entire native popula tion appeared to have long since vanished into the forest the houses stood empty in the sunlight shutters sealed across the windows and soldiers paced up and down past the closed banks and stores the sidestreets were packed with abandoned cars indicating that the river was the only route of escape from the town as they walked down to the control post the jungle glowing two hundred yards away to their left a large chrysler with a dented fender swerved down the street and came to a halt in front of them a tall man with blond hair his doublebreasted blue suit unbuttoned climbed out he recognized radek and waved him over this is thorensen radek explained one of the mineowners it looks as if he hasnt been able to contact your friends however he may have news the tall man rested one hand on the roof of the car and scanned the surrounding rooftops the collar of his white shirt was open and he scratched in a bored way at his neck although of powerful build there was something weak and selfcentered about his long fleshy face radek he shouted i havent got all day is this sanders he jerked his head at the doctor then nodded to him look i got hold of them for youtheyre at the mission hospital near the old bourbon hotelhe and his wife were supposed to come down here ten minutes ago he phoned that his wifes gone off somewhere he has to look for her gone off somewhere dr sanders repeated what does that mean how would i know thorensen climbed into the car forcing his huge body into the seat as if loading in a sack of meal anyway he said hed be down here at six oclock ok radek thank you thorensen well be here then with a nod thorensen jerked the car into reverse backing it across the street in a cloud of dust he set off at speed almost running down a passing soldier a rough diamond sanders commented if i can use the term here do you think he did get on to the clairs radek shrugged probably thorensen isnt exactly reliable but he owed me a small favor for some medicines a difficult man always up to some game of his own but hes been useful to us the other mineowners have gone but thorensen still has his big boat sanders looked around remembering the attack on ventress in the harbor at port matarre a large motorcruiser with an ornamental cannon ornamental that doesnt sound like thorensen radek laughed i cant remember his boatwhy do you ask i thought id seen him before what do we do now nothing the bourbon hotel is about three miles from here its an old ruin if we go there we might not get back in time its strangesuzanne clair going off like that perhaps she had a patient to see you think it was something to do with your coming here i hope not sanders buttoned his jacket we might as well take a look at the forest until max gets here following the visiting party they turned down the next sidestreet they approached the forest which stood back on either side of the road a quarter of a mile away the vegetation was sparser the grass growing in clumps along the sandy soil in the open space a mobile laboratory had been set up in a trailer and a platoon of soldiers was wandering about taking cuttings from the trees which they laid like fragments of stained glass on a line of trestle tables the main body of the forest circled the eastern perimeter of the town cutting off the highway to port matarre and the south splitting up into twos and threes they crossed the verge and began to walk among the glacй ferns which rose from the brittle ground the sandy surface seemed curiously hard and annealed small spurs of fused sand protruding from the newly formed crust a few yards from the trailer two technicians were spinning several of the encrusted branches in a centrifuge there was a continuous glimmer as splinters of light glanced out of the bowl and vanished into the air all over the inspection area as far as the perimeter fence under the trees the soldiers and visiting officials turned to watch when the centrifuge stopped the technicians peered into the bowl where a handful of limp branches their blanched leaves clinging damply to the metal bottom lay stripped of their sheaths without comment one of the technicians showed dr sanders and radek the empty liquor receptacle underneath twenty yards from the forest a helicopter prepared for takeoff its heavy blades rotated like drooping scythes sending up a blaze of light from the disturbed vegetation with an abrupt lurch it made a labored takeoff swinging sideways through the air and then moved across the forest roof its churning blades gaining little purchase on the air the soldiers and the visiting party stopped to watch the vivid discharge of light that radiated from the blades like st elmos fire then with a harsh roar like the bellow of a stricken animal it slid backwards through the air and plunged tailfirst toward the forest canopy a hundred feet below the two pilots visible at their controls sirens sounded from the staff cars parked around the inspection area and there was a concerted rush toward the forest as the aircraft disappeared from view as they raced along the road dr sanders felt its impact with the ground a glow of light pulsed through the trees the road led toward the point of the crash a few houses looming at intervals at the ends of empty drives the blades crystallized while it was near the trees radek shouted as they climbed over the perimeter fence you could see the crystals deliquescing lets hope the pilots are all right a sergeant blocked their way beckoning back sanders and the other civilians who were crowding along the fence radek shouted to the sergeant who let sanders go past and then detached half a dozen of his men the soldiers ran ahead of radek and dr sanders stopping every twenty yards to peer through the trees they were soon within the body of the forest and had entered an enchanted world the crystal trees around them were hung with glasslike trellises of moss the air was markedly cooler as if everything was sheathed in ice but a ceaseless play of light poured through the canopy overhead the process of crystallization was more advanced the fences along the road were so heavily encrusted that they formed a continuous palisade a white frost at least six inches thick on either side of the palings the few houses between the trees glistened like wedding cakes their white roofs and chimneys transformed into exotic minarets and baroque domes on a lawn of green glass spurs a childs tricycle glittered like a fabergй gem the wheels starred into brilliant jasper crowns the soldiers were still ahead of dr sanders but radek had fallen behind limping along and pausing to feel the soles of his boots by now it was obvious to sanders why the highway to port matarre had been closed the surface of the road was now a carpet of needles spurs of glass and quartz five or six inches high that reflected the colored light from the leaves above the spurs tore at sanderss shoes forcing him to move hand over hand along the verge sanders come back doctor the brittle echoes of radeks voice like a faint cry in an underground grotto reached sanders but he stumbled on along the road following the intricate patterns that revolved and expanded over his head like jeweled mandalas behind him an engine roared and the chrysler he had seen with thorensen plunged along the road the heavy tires cutting through the crystal surface twenty yards ahead it rocked to a halt its engine stalled and thorensen jumped out with a shout he waved sanders back down the road now a tunnel of yellow and crimson light formed by the forest canopies overhead get back theres another wave coming glancing around wildly as if searching for someone he set off at a run after the soldiers dr sanders rested by the chrysler a marked change had come over the forest as if dusk had begun to fall everywhere the glacй sheaths which enveloped the trees and vegetation had become duller and more opaque the crystal floor underfoot was occluded and gray turning the needles into spurs of basalt the brilliant panoply of colored light had gone and a dim amber glow moved across the trees shadowing the sequined floor at the same time it had become considerably colder leaving the car dr sanders began to make his way back down the roadradek was still shouting soundlessly to him but the cold air blocked his path like a refrigerated wall turning up the collar of his tropical suit sanders retreated to the car wondering whether to take refuge inside it the cold deepened numbing his face and making his hands feel brittle and fleshless somewhere he heard thorensens hollow shout and he caught a glimpse of a soldier running at full speed through the icegray trees on the right of the road the darkness enveloped the forest masking the outlines of the trees and then extended in a sudden sweep across the roadway dr sanderss eyes smarted with pain and he brushed away the crystals of ice that had formed over the eyeballs as his sight cleared he saw that everywhere around him a heavy frost was forming accelerating the process of crystallization the spurs in the roadway were over a foot in height like the spines of a giant porcupine and the lattices of moss between the trees were thicker and more translucent so that the trunks seemed to shrink into a mottled thread the interlocking leaves formed a continuous mosaic the windows of the car were covered by a heavy frost dr sanders reached for the door handle but his fingers were stung by the intense cold you there come on this way the voice echoed down a drive behind him looking around as the darkness deepened dr sanders saw the burly figure of thorensen waving to him from the portico of a mansion near by the lawn between them seemed to belong to a less somber zone the grass still retaining its vivid liquid sparkle as if this enclave were preserved intact like an island in the eye of a hurricane dr sanders ran up the drive toward the house here the air was at least ten degrees warmer reaching the porch he searched for thorensen but the mineowner had run off again into the forest uncertain whether to follow him sanders watched the approaching wall of darkness slowly cross the lawn the glittering foliage overhead sinking into its pall at the bottom of the drive the chrysler was now encrusted by a thick layer of frozen glass its windshield blossoming into a thousand fleurdelis crystals quickly making his way around the house as the zone of safety moved off through the forest dr sanders crossed the remains of an old vegetable garden where waisthigh plants of green glass rose around him like exquisite sculptures waiting as the zone hesitated and veered off he tried to remain within the center of its focus for the next hour he stumbled through the forest his sense of direction lost driven from left to right by the occluding walls he had entered an endless subterranean cavern where jeweled rocks loomed out of the spectral gloom like huge marine plants the sprays of grass forming white fountains several times he crossed and recrossed the road the spurs were almost waisthigh and he was forced to clamber over the brittle stems once as he rested against the trunk of a bifurcated oak an immense multicolored bird erupted from a bough over his head and flew off with a wild screech aureoles of light cascading from its red and yellow wings at last the storm subsided and a pale light filtered through the stainedglass canopy again the forest was a place of rainbows a deep iridescent light glowing around him he walked down a narrow roadway which wound toward a large colonial house standing like a baroque pavilion on a rise in the center of the forest transformed by the frost it seemed an intact fragment of versailles or fontainebleau its pilasters and friezes spilling from the wide roof like sculptured fountains the road narrowed avoiding the slope which led up to the house but its annealed crust blunted like halffused quartz offered a more comfortable surface than the crystal teeth of the lawn fifty yards ahead dr sanders came across what was unmistakably a jeweled rowing boat set solidly into the roadway a chain of lapis lazuli mooring it to the verge he realized that he was walking along a small tributary of the river and that a thin stream of water still ran below the crust this vestigial motion in some way prevented it from erupting into the spurlike forms of the rest of the forest floor as he paused by the boat feeling the crystals along its sides a huge fourlegged creature halfembedded in the surface lurched forwards through the crust the loosened pieces of lattice attached to its snout and shoulders shaking like a transparent cuirass its jaws mouthed the air silently as it struggled on its hooked legs unable to clamber more than a few inches from the hollow trough in its own outline now filling with a thin trickle of water invested by the glittering light that poured from its body the crocodile resembled a fabulous armorial beast its blind eyes had been transformed into immense crystalline rubies it lunged toward him again and dr sanders kicked its snout scattering the wet jewels that choked its mouth leaving it to subside once more into a frozen posture dr sanders climbed the bank and limped across the lawn to the mansion whose fairy towers loomed above the trees although out of breath and very nearly exhausted he had a curious premonition of hope and longing as if he were some fugitive adam chancing upon a forgotten gateway to the forbidden paradise high in an upstairs window the bearded man in the white suit watched him the shotgun in his hands pointed at sanderss chest ii the illuminated man mirrors and assassins two months later when describing the events of this period in a letter to dr paul derain director of the fort isabelle leper hospital sanders wrote but what most surprised me paul was the extent to which i was prepared for the transformation of the forestthe crystalline trees hanging like icons in those luminous caverns the jeweled casements of the leaves overhead fused into a lattice of prisms through which the sun shone in a thousand rainbows the birds and crocodiles frozen into grotesque postures like heraldic beasts carved from jade and quartzwhat was really remarkable was the extent to which i accepted all these wonders as part of the natural order of things part of the inward pattern of the universe true to begin with i was as startled as everyone else making his first journey up the matarre river to mont royal but after the initial impact of the forest a surprise more visual than anything else i quickly came to understand it knowing that its hazards were a small price to pay for its illumination of my life indeed the rest of the world seemed drab and inert by contrast a faded reflection of this bright image forming a gray penumbral zone like some halfabandoned purgatory all this my dear paul the very absence of surprise confirms my belief that this illuminated forest in some way reflects an earlier period of our lives perhaps an archaic memory we are born with of some ancestral paradise where the unity of time and space is the signature of every leaf and flower its obvious to everyone now that in the forest life and death have a different meaning from that in our ordinary lacklustre world here we have always associated movement with life and the passage of time but from my experience within the forest near mont royal i know that all motion leads inevitably to death and that time is its servant it is perhaps our unique achievement as lords of this creation to have brought about the separation of time and space we alone have given to each a separate value a distinct measure of their own which now define and bind us like the length and breadth of a coffin to resolve them again is the greatest aim of natural scienceas you and i have seen paul in our work on the virus with its semianimate crystalline existence halfin and halfout of our own timestream as if intersecting it at an angle often i think that in our microscopes examining the tissues of those poor lepers in our hospital we were looking upon a minuscule replica of the world i was to meet later in the forest slopes near mont royal however all these belated efforts have now been brought to an end as i write to you here within the quiet and emptiness of the hotel deurope at port matarre i see a report in a twoweekold issue of parissoir that the whole of the florida peninsula in the united states with the exception of a single highway to tampa has been closed and that to date some three million of the states inhabitants have been resettled in other parts of the country but apart from the estimated losses in realestate values and hotel revenues the news of this extraordinary human migration has prompted little comment such is mankinds innate optimism our conviction that we can survive any deluge or cataclysm that most of us unconsciously dismiss the momentous events in florida with a shrug confident that some means will be found to avert the crisis when it comes and yet paul it now seems obvious that the real crisis is long past tucked away on the back page of the same issue of parissoir is the short report of the sighting of another double galaxy by observers of the hubble institute on mount palomar the news is summarized in less than a dozen lines and without comment although the implication is inescapable that yet another focal area has been set up somewhere on the surface of the earth in the templefilled jungles of cambodia or the haunted amber forests of the chilean highland but it is still only a year since the mount palomar astronomers identified the first double galaxy in the constellation andromeda the great oblate diadem that is probably the most beautiful object in the physical universe the island galaxy m without doubt these random transfigurations throughout the world are a reflection of distant cosmic processes of enormous scope and dimensions first glimpsed in the andromeda spiral we now know that it is time which is responsible for the transformation the recent discovery of antimatter in the universe inevitably involves the conception of antitime as the fourth side of this negatively charged continuum where antiparticle and particle collide they not only destroy their own physical identities but their opposing timevalues eliminate each other subtracting from the universe another quantum from its total store of time it is random discharges of this type set off by the creation of antigalaxies in space which have led to the depletion of the timestore available to the materials of our own solar system just as a supersaturated solution will discharge itself into a crystalline mass so the supersaturation of matter in our continuum leads to its appearance in a parallel spatial matrix as more and more time leaks away the process of supersaturation continues the original atoms and molecules producing spatial replicas of themselves substance without mass in an attempt to increase their foothold upon existence the process is theoretically without end and it may be possible eventually for a single atom to produce an infinite number of duplicates of itself and so fill the entire universe from which simultaneously all time has expired an ultimate macrocosmic zero beyond the wildest dreams of plato and democritus in parenthesis reading this over my shoulder louise comments that i may be misleading you paul by minimizing the dangers we all experienced within the crystalline forest its certainly true that they were very real at the time as the many tragic deaths there testify and that first day when i was trapped in the forest i understood nothing of these matters beyond those which ventress confided to me in his ambiguous and disjointed way but even then as i walked away from that jeweled crocodile up the sloping lawn towards the whitesuited man watching me from the window his shotgun pointed at my chest lying back on one of the glassembroidered chesterfields in the bedroom upstairs dr sanders rested after his chase through the forest as he climbed the staircase he had slipped on one of the crystallizing steps and momentarily winded himself standing at the top of the staircase ventress had watched him clamber to his feet the glacй panels splintering under his hands ventresss small face the tight skin now mottled by veinlike colors was without expression his eyes gazed down showing not even a flicker of response as sanders grappled for his balance at the banisters when sanders at last reached the landing ventress motioned him toward the floor with a curt gesture he then took up his position at the window driving the butt of the shotgun through the broken panes as they annealed themselves dr sanders brushed the frost off his suit picking at the crystal splinters embedded like needles in his hands the air in the house was cold and motionless but as the storm subsided moving away across the forest the process of vitrification seemed to diminish everything in the highceilinged room had been transformed by the frost several plateglass windows appeared to have been fractured and then fused together above the carpet and the ornate persian patterns swam below the surface like the floor of some perfumed pool in the arabian nights all the furniture was covered by the same glacй sheath the arms and legs of the straightbacked chairs against the walls embellished by exquisite curlicues and helixes the imitation louis xv pieces had been transformed into huge fragments of opalescent candy whose multiple reflections glowed like giant chimeras in the cutglass walls through the doorway opposite dr sanders could see into a small dressingroom he assumed he was sitting in the principal bedroom of an official residence maintained for some visiting government dignitary or the president of one of the mine companies although elaborately furnishedstraight from the catalogues of a paris or london department storethe room was devoid of all personal possessions for some reason the large double beda fourposter sanders guessed from the patch on the ceilinghad been removed and the other furniture pushed to one side by ventress he still stood by the open window peering down at the stream where the jeweled boat and the crocodile lay embalmed his thin beard gave him a fevered and haunted aspect halfbent over his shotgun he pressed closer to the window ignoring the sections of crystal sheath that he dislodged from the heavy brocaded curtain dr sanders began to stand up but ventress waved him back rest yourself doctor well be here for some time his voice had become harder and the gloss of ironic humor was absent he glanced away from his gunbarrel when did you last see thorensen the mineowner sanders pointed through the window after we ran to search for the helicopter are you looking for him in a manner of speaking what was he doing dr sanders turned up the collar of his jacket brushing away the fine spurs of frost that covered the material he was running around in circles like the rest of us completely lost lost ventress let out a derisive snort the mans as cunning as a pig he knows every dell and cranny of this forest like the back of his hand when sanders stood up and approached the window ventress beckoned him away impatiently keep away from the window doctor with a brief gleam of his old ironic humor he added i dont want to use you as a decoy just yet ignoring this warning sanders glanced down at the empty lawn like footsteps in dewcovered grass the dark prints of his shoes crossed the sequined surface merging into the palegreen slope as the process of crystallization continued although the main wave of activity had moved off the forest was still vitrifying itself the absolute silence of the jeweled trees seemed to confirm that the affected area had multiplied many times in size a frozen calm extended as far as he could see as if he and ventress were lost somewhere in the grottoes of an immense glacier to emphasize their proximity to the sun everywhere there was the same corona of light the forest was an endless labyrinth of glass caves sealed off from the remainder of the world and lit by subterranean lamps ventress relaxed for a moment raising one foot to the windowsill he surveyed dr sanders a long journey doctor but one worth making sanders shrugged i havent reached the end of it yet by any meansive still got to find my friends however i agree with you its an extraordinary experience theres something almost rejuvenating about the forest do you of course doctor ventress turned back to the window silencing sanders with one hand the frost glimmered on the shoulders of his white suit in a faint palimpsest of colors he peered down at the crystal vegetation along the stream after a pause he said my dear sanders youre not the only one to feel these things let me assure you youve been here before sanders asked do you meandйjв vu ventress looked round his small features almost hidden behind the beard dr sanders hesitated i meant literally he said ventress ignored this weve all been here before doctor as everyone will soon find outif theres time he pronounced the word with a peculiar inflexion of his own drawing it out like the tolling of a bell he listened to the last echoes reverberate away among the crystal walls like a fading requiem however i feel thats something were all running out of doctordo you agree dr sanders tried to massage some warmth into his hands his fingers felt brittle and fleshless and he looked at the empty fireplace behind him wondering whether this ornate recess guarded on either side by a large gilt dolphin had been fitted with a chimney flue yet despite the cold air in the house he felt less chilled than invigorated running out of time he repeated i havent thought about it yet whats your explanation isnt it obvious doctor doesnt your own specialty the dark side of the sun we see around us here provide a clue surely leprosy like cancer is above all a disease of time a result of overextending oneself through that particular medium dr sanders nodded as ventress spoke watching the mans skulllike face come alive as he discussed this element that he appeared on the surface at least to despise its a theory he agreed when ventress had finished not not scientific enough ventress threw his head back in a louder voice he declaimed look at the viruses doctor with their crystalline structure neither animate nor inanimate and their immunity to time he swept a hand along the sill and scooped up a cluster of the vitreous grains then scattered them across the floor like smashed marbles you and i will be like them soon sanders and the rest of the world neither living nor dead at the end of this tirade ventress turned away and resumed his scrutiny of the forest a muscle flickered in his left cheek like distant lightning marking the end of a storm why are you looking for thorensen dr sanders asked are you after his diamond mine dont be a fool ventress swore over his shoulder thats the last thinggemstones are no rarity in this forest doctor with a comtemptuous gesture he scraped a mass of crystals from the material of his suit if you want ill pluck you a necklace of hope diamonds what are you doing here dr sanders asked evenly in this house thorensen lives here what incredulously sanders looked again at the ornate furniture and gilded mirrors thinking of the burly man in the blue suit at the wheel of the dented chrysler i saw him for only a few moments but it doesnt seem in character precisely ive never seen such bad taste ventress nodded to himself and believe me as an architect ive seen plenty the whole house is a pathetic joke he pointed to one of the marquetry divans with a spiral bolster that had transformed itself into a brilliant parody of a rococo cartouche the helix twisting like the overgrown horns of a goat louis nineteen perhaps carried away by his jibes at the absent thorensen ventress had turned his back on the window looking past him dr sanders saw the crocodile trapped in the stream lift on its weak legs as if snapping at a passerby interrupting ventress sanders pointed down at it but another voice anticipated him ventress the shout an angry challenge came from the crystal shrubbery along the lefthand margins of the lawn a second later a shot roared out into the cold air as ventress swung round pushing sanders away with one hand the bullet crashed into the ceiling over their heads bringing down a huge latticelike section that splintered around their feet into a mass of flattened needles ventress flinched back and then blindly fired off a shot at the shrubbery the report echoed around the petrified trees shaking loose their vivid colors keep down ventress scuttled along the floor to the next window then worked the barrel of the shotgun through the frosted panes after his initial moment of stunned panic he had recovered his wits and even seemed to seize on this chance of a confrontation he peered down at the garden then stood up when the cracking of a distant tree appeared to mark the retreat of their hidden assailant ventress walked across to sanders who was standing with his back to the wall beside the window all right hes gone sanders hesitated before moving he glanced around the trees at the edges of the lawn trying not to expose more than a glimpse of himself at the far end of the lawn framed between two oaks a white gazebo had been transformed by the frost into a huge crystal crown its glass casements winked like inlaid jewels as if something were moving behind them ventress however stood openly in front of the window surveying the scene below was that thorensen sanders asked of course this brief passageatarms seemed to have relaxed ventress the shotgun cradled loosely in his elbow he strolled around the room now and then pausing to examine the puncture left by the bullet in the ceiling for some reason he obviously assumed that sanders had taken his side in this private duel perhaps because sanders had already saved him from the attack in the native harbor at port matarre sanderss actions however had been little more than reflex as ventress no doubt was aware patently ventress was not a man who ever felt under much obligation to other people whatever they might have done for him and sanders guessed that in fact ventress had sensed some spark of kinship during their voyage by steamer from libreville and that he would plunge his entire sympathy or hostility upon such a chance encounter the movement inside the gazebo had ended sanders stepped forward from his hiding place behind the window the attack on you in port matarrewere those thorensens men ventress shrugged you might well be right doctor dont worry ill look after you youll have your work cut outthose thugs meant business from what the army captain at the base told me the diamond companies dont intend to let anything get in their way ventress shook his head exasperated by sanderss obtuseness doctor you persist in finding the most trivial reasonsobviously you have no idea of your real motives for the last time i am not interested in thorensens damned diamondsand nor is thorensen the matter between us he broke off staring vaguely through the window his face for the first time showing any sign of fatigue in a distracted voice more to himself he went on believe me i respect thorensen however crude he understands that we have the same aim its a question of method ventress swung on his heel wed better leave now he announced theres no point in staying where are you going mont royal if thats possible it wont be ventress pointed through the window the storm center is directly between here and the town your only hope is to reach the river and follow it back to the army base whom are you looking for a former colleague of mine and his wife do you know the bourbon hotel its some distance from the town their mission hospital is near the hotel bourbon ventress screwed up his face sounds like the wrong centuryyoure out of time again sanders he made for the door its an old ruin god only knows where youll have to stay with me until we reach the edge of the forest then work your way back to the army base testing each step they went down the crystallizing staircase halfway down ventress who was in the lead stopped and beckoned sanders forward my pistol he patted his shoulder holster ill follow you see if you notice anything from the door as he retraced his steps sanders walked across the empty hail he paused among the jeweled pillars uneager whatever ventresss instructions to expose himself in the wide doorway with its colonnaded portico from the center of the hail the garden and trees beyond were silent and he turned and waited among the pillars by the alcove on his left dozens of reflections of himself glowing in the glasssheathed walls and furniture involuntarily sanders raised his hands to catch the rainbows of light that ran around the edges of his suit and face a legion of el dorados all bearing his own features receded in the mirrors more images of himself as the man of light than he could have hoped for he studied a reflection of himself in profile noticing how the bands of color softened the drawn lines of his mouth and eyes blurring the residue of time there that had hardened the tissues like the scales of leprosy itself for a moment he seemed twenty years younger the ruddy overlay of colors on his cheeks more skilful than the palette of any rubens or titian turning his attention to the reflection facing his own sanders noticed with surprise that among these prismatic images of himself refracted from the sun he had found one darker twin the profile and features were obscured but the skin was almost ebony in color reflecting the mottled blues and violets of the opposite end of the spectrum somehow menacing in this company of light the somber figure stood motionlessly with its head turned away from him as if aware of its negative aspect in its lowered hand a lance of silver light flared like a star in a chalice abruptly sanders leapt behind the pillar on his left as the negro hiding in the alcove lunged forward across him the knife flashed in the air past sanderss face its white light diving among the reflections that swerved like drunken suns around the two men the colors bleeding off their arms and legs sanders kicked at the negros hand halfrecognizing one of the thugs he had seen on the catwalk at port matarre crouching down his bony pointed face almost between his knees the negro feinted with the knife sanders moved back toward the staircase and then saw the giant mulatto in the bushshirt watching from behind a bookcase in the drawing room a colt automatic in his scarred hand the frost outside had given his dark face a luminous sheen before sanders could shout up to ventress a shot roared out through the air over his head ducking down he saw the negro with the knife knocked to the floor his heels kicking in pain the punctured lattice on the wall behind him slid and shattered across a divan and the negro picked himself up and raced like a wounded animal through the entrance a second shot followed him from the staircase and ventress moved down from his vantage point behind the banister his tight face hidden behind the stock of the shotgun he beckoned sanders away from the entrance to the drawing room the mulatto hiding by the bookcase ran across the room firing once as he stopped below the chandelier the impact of the explosion showering the light from the cutglass pendants like rain over his cropped head he shouted at a tall whiteskinned man in a leather jerkin who stood by the far wall with his back to the staircase opening a safe over the ornamental fireplace covering him the mulatto fired through the door the man by the safe dragged a small strongbox from the upper shelf as ventress upended the mahogany hall stand across the archway the strongbox fell to the floor and dozens of rubies and sapphires scattered between the tall mans feet ignoring ventress who was trying to get in a shot at the mulatto he bent down and scooped some of the stones into his big hands then he and the mulatto turned and ran for the french windows crushing aside the light frames with their shoulders leaping over his barricade ventress entered the drawing room darting in and out of the overstuffed settees and armchairs as his quarry disappeared through the trees ventress reached the windows then reloaded his gun with the shells in his pocket and fired a parting shot over the lawn he moved the barrel in sanderss direction as the latter stepped over the hall stand into the room right doctor all clear ventress was breathing rapidly his small shoulders moving about in an excess of nervous energy whats the matter he didnt touch you did he sanders went over to him he pushed aside the gunbarrel which ventress still held toward him he stared down at the bearded mans bony face and overexcited eyes ventress you knew they were here all alongyou were bloody well using me as a decoy he broke off ventress was paying no attention to him and was peering left and right through the french windows sanders turned away a sense of limp calm coming over his fatigue he noticed the jewels sparkling on the floor i thought you said thorensen wasnt interested in gemstones ventress turned to look at sanders and then down at the floor below the safe halfdropping his shotgun he bent over and began to touch the stones where they lay as if puzzled to find them there he absently pocketed a few of them then gathered the rest together and stuffed them into his trousers he went back to the windows youre right sanders of course he said in a flat voice but i was thinking of your safety believe me then he snapped lets get out of here as they made their way across the lawn ventress lagged behind a second time sanders stopped looking back at the house which loomed behind them among the trees like a giant wedding cake ventress was staring at the handful of gemstones in his hand the bright sapphires slipped between his fingers and lay on the sequined grass behind him illuminating his footprints as he entered the dark vaults of the forest the summer house for an hour they moved along the fossilized stream ventress remained in the lead the shotgun held warily in front of him his movements neat and deliberate while sanders limped behind now and then they passed a powercruiser embedded in the crust or a vitrified crocodile reared upwards and grimaced at them soundlessly its mouth choked with jewels as it shifted in a fault of colored glass always ventress was on the lookout for thorensen which of them was searching for the other sanders could not discover nor the subject of their blood feud although thorensen had twice attacked him ventress almost seemed to be encouraging thorensen deliberately exposing himself as if trying to trap the mineowner cant we get back to mont royal dr sanders shouted his voice echoing among the vaults were going deeper into the forest the town is cut off my dear sanders dont worry ill take you there in due course ventress leapt nimbly over a fissure in the surface of the stream below the mass of dissolving crystals a thin stream of fluid rilled down a buried channel led by this whitesuited figure with his preoccupied gaze they moved on through the forest sometimes in complete circles as if ventress were familiarizing himself with the topography of his jeweled twilight world whenever dr sanders sat down to rest on one of the vitrified trunks and brushed away the crystals forming on the soles of his shoes despite their constant movement ventress would wait impatiently watching sanders with ruminative eyes as if deciding whether to abandon him to the forest the air was always icy the dark shadows closing and unfolding around them then as they pressed on into the forest leaving the stream in the hope of joining the river lower down its course they came across the wreck of the crashed helicopter at first as they passed the aircraft lying like an emblazoned fossil in a small hollow to the left of their path dr sanders failed to recognize it ventress stopped with a somber expression he pointed to the huge machine and sanders remembered the helicopter plunging into the forest half a mile from the inspection site the four twisted blades veined and frosted like the wings of a giant dragonfly had already been overgrown by the trellises of crystals hanging downwards from the nearby trees the fuselage of the craft partly buried in the ground had blossomed into an enormous translucent jewel in whose solid depths like emblematic knights mounted in the base of a medieval ring stone the two pilots sat frozen at their controls their silver helmets gave off an endless fountain of light you wont help them now a rictus of pain twisted ventresss mouth averting his face he began to move away come on sanders or youll soon be like them the forest is changing all the time wait sanders climbed over the fossilized undergrowth kicking away pieces of the glasslike foliage he pulled himself around the dome of the cockpit canopy ventress theres a man here together they climbed down into the floor of the hollow below the starboard side of the helicopter stretched out over the serpentine roots of a giant oak across which he had been trying to drag himself was the crystallized body of a man in military uniform his chest and shoulders were covered by a huge cuirass of jeweled plates the arms enclosed in the same gauntlet of annealed prisms that sanders had seen on the man dragged from the river at port matarre ventress its the army captain radek sanders gazed into the visor that covered the mans head now an immense sapphire carved in the shape of a conquistadors helmet refracted through the prisms that had efiloresced from the mans face his features seemed to overlay one another in a dozen different planes but dr sanders could still recognize the weakchinned face of captain radek the physician in the army medical corps who had first taken him to the inspection site he realized that radek had gone back after all probably searching for sanders when he failed to emerge from the forest and instead had found the two pilots in the helicopter now rainbows glowed in the dead mans eyes ventress sanders remembered the drowned man in the harbor at port matarre he pressed his hands against the crystal breastplate trying to detect any signs of warmth within hes still alive inside this help me to get him out of here when ventress stood up shaking his head over the glittering body sanders shouted ventress i know this man gripping his shotgun ventress began to climb out of the hollow sanders youre wasting your time he shook his head his eyes roving between the trees around them leave him there hes made his own peace pushing past him sanders straddled the crystalline body and tried to lift it from the hollow the weight of the body was enormous and he could barely move one of the arms part of the head and shoulder and the entire length of the right arm had annealed themselves to the crystal outgrowths from the base of the oak as sanders began to kick at the winding roots trying to free the body ventress shouted in warning wrenching at the body sanders managed to jerk it free several pieces of the crystal sheath fell from the face and shoulders with a cry ventress jumped down into the hollow he held sanderss arm tightly for gods sake he began but when sanders pushed him aside he gave up and turned away after a pause his small bitter eyes watching sanders he stepped forward and helped him lift the jeweled body from the hollow a hundred yards ahead they reached the bank of the stream the tributary had expanded into a channel some ten yards in width in the center the fossilized crust was only a few inches thin and they could see the running water below leaving radeks glistening body on the bank where it lay with arms outstretched slowly deliquescing dr sanders snapped a large bough off one of the trees and began to break the crust over the water as he drove the branch downwards the crystals fractured easily and within a few minutes he had opened a circular aperture three or four yards wide he dragged the branch over to the bank where radek lay bending down he lifted the body on to the branch and lashed radeks shoulders to it with his belt with luck the timber would support radeks head above the water long enough for him to regain consciousness as the crystals dissolved in the moving current ventress made no comment but continued to watch sanders with his bitter eyes propping his shotgun against a tree he helped sanders carry the body to the aperture above the water each holding one end of the bough they lowered radek feetfirst into the water the stream moved quickly and they watched the body swirl away down the white tunnel the washed crystals on radeks arms and legs glimmered below the water his halfsubmerged head resting on the bough dr sanders limped across to the bank he sat down on the marbled sand picking at the sharp needles that pierced his palms and fingers theres a chance thats all but worth taking he said ventress was standing a few feet away from him theyll be watching downriver perhaps theyll see him ventress walked up to sanders his small body was held stiffly his bearded chin tucked in the muscles of his bony face moved his mouth soundlessly as if he were composing his reply with great care he said sanders you were too late one day youll know what you took away from that man dr sanders looked up what do you mean irritably he snapped ventress i owed that man something ventress ignored this just remember doctorif you ever find me like that leave me do you understand they moved off through the forest neither speaking to the other sanders sometimes failing fifty yards behind ventress several times he thought ventress had abandoned him but always the whitesuited figure his hair and shoulders covered with a fine fur of frost appeared into view before him although exasperated by ventresss callousness and lack of sympathy for radek sanders sensed that there might be some other explanation for his behavior at last they reached the fringes of a small clearing bounded on three sides by the fractured dancing floor of an inlet to one side of the river on the opposite bank a highgabled summer house pushed its roof toward the sky through a break in the overhead canopy from the single spire a slender web of opaque strands extended to the surrounding trees like a diaphanous veil investing the glass garden and the crystalline summer house with a marble sheen almost sepulchral in its intensity as if reinforcing this impression the windows on to the veranda around the house were encrusted with elab orate scrolllike patterns like the ornamented casements of a tomb waving sanders back ventress approached the fringes of the garden his shotgun raised before him for the first time since sanders had known him ventress seemed uncertain of himself he gazed across at the summer house like an explorer venturing upon some strange and enigmatic shrine in the depths of the jungle high above him its wings pinioned by the glass canopy a golden oriole flexed slowly in the afternoon light the ripples of its liquid aura circling outwards like the rays of a cruciform sun ventress drew himself together after waiting for any sign of movement from the summer house he darted from tree to tree then crossed the frozen surface of the river with a feline step ten yards from the summer house he stopped again distracted by the glowing oriole in the canopy above his head its ventresstake him a shot roared into the clearing its report echoing around the brittle foliage startled ventress crouched down on the steps of the summer house peering up at its sealed windows from the edge of the clearing fifty yards behind him appeared a tall blondhaired man in a black leather jerkin the mineowner thorensen revolver in hand he raced toward the summer house he stopped and fired again at ventress the roar of the explosion reverberating around the clearing behind dr sanders the crystal trellises of the moss suspended from the trees frosted and collapsed like the collapsing walls of a house of mirrors the back door of the summer house opened a naked african his left leg and the left side of his chest and waist covered with white surgical plaster stepped out on to the veranda a rifle in his hands moving stiffly he leaned himself against a pillar then fired off a shot at ventress crouching on the steps leaping down from the veranda ventress made off like a hare across the river bent almost double as he darted over the faults in the surface with a last backward glance his thin bearded face contorted with fear he raced toward the trees thorensens burly figure lagging behind him then as ventress reached the bend in the inlet where it widened in its approach toward the river the cropheaded figure of the mulatto rose from his hiding place among the sprays of swamp grass growing like silver fans from the edge of the bank his immense black body etched clearly against the surrounding forest by its white outline of frost leapt forward like a bull about to gore a fleeing matador ventress passed within a few feet of him and the mulatto whipped one arm and tossed a steel net through the air over ventresss head knocked off balance ventress sidestepped and fell then slid ten yards across the frozen surface his startled face peering through the open mesh with a satisfied grunt the mulatto pulled a long panga from his belt and lumbered forward to the small figure lying like a trussed animal in front of him ventress kicked at the net trying to free the shotgun ten feet away the mulatto slashed the air experimentally then ran forward to deliver the coup de grace thorensen call him back sanders shouted the rapidity with which all this had happened left sanders standing by the edge of the clearing his ears ringing with the explosions he shouted again at thorensen who was waiting arms akimbo below the steps of the summer house his long face was half averted as if he preferred to take no part in this final moment still lying on his back on the ground ventress had partly freed himself from the net letting go of the shotgun he pulled the net around his waist the mulatto towered over him the panga raised behind his head with an epileptic twist ventress managed to move a few feet away the mulatto roared with laughter then let out a bellow of anger the crystal surface had given way beneath his huge feet and he sank up to his knees through the crust with a heave he lifted himself on to the surface on one leg then sank through it again as he pulled out the other ventress kicked the net away and the mulatto reached forward and slashed at the ice a few inches from his heels ventress stumbled to his feet the shotgun was still entangled in the net and he seized the bundle and ran off across the surface sliding in and out of the halfcrystallized patches behind him the mulatto charged like a berserk sea lion through the collapsing crust hacking it out of his way with blows of the panga ventress was out of reach here where the inlet widened the deeper channel of water running below to join the river was covered only by a thin crust the surface frosted under ventresss feet but the winding lanes of firm ice held beneath his small figure within twenty yards he had reached the shore and darted away among the trees as a final shot rang out after him from the bandaged african on the veranda of the summer house dr sanders stood in the center of the clearing he watched the mulatto wallowing in his trough of halfdamp crystals slashing at them angrily and sending up a shower of rainbowing light you come here thorensen gestured sanders toward him with his revolver the leather jerkin he wore over his blue suit made his large frame seem trimmer and more muscular below the blond hair his long face wore an expression of sullen moodiness when sanders approached he scrutinized him warily what are you doing with ventress arent you one of the visiting party i saw you on the quay with radek dr sanders was about to speak when thorensen held up his hand with a gesture at the african on the veranda who moved his rifle to cover sanders thorensen walked off in the direction of the mulatto ill see you in a minutedont try to run for it the mulatto had climbed up on to the firmer surface near the summer house as thorensen approached he began to gesticulate and shout waving his panga at the broken surface as if trying to cover up his failure to catch ventress thorensen nodded then dismissed him with a bored wave walking forward across the surface he began to test the halfformed crystals with his feet for several minutes he paced up and down gazing in the direction of the river as if marking out the dimensions of the subterranean channels he returned to sanders the damp crystals on his shoes giving off glimmers of colored light he listened in a distracted way as sanders explained how he had been trapped in the forest after the crash of the helicopter sanders described his accidental meeting with ventress and subsequently the discovery of radeks body remembering ventresss bitter protests at the time sanders stressed his reasons for this apparent attempt to drown a dead man thorensen nodded dourly maybe he has a chance as if to reassure sanders he added you did the right thing the mulatto and the naked african halfswathed in surgical tape were sitting on the steps of the veranda the mulatto was honing his panga while the other rested his rifle on his one bare knee scanning the forest he had the slim intelligent face of a young clerk or junior foreman and now and then glanced at sanders with the look of a man who recognized another member however remote of the same educated caste sanders remembered him as the knifewielding attacker whose dark reflection he had confused with his own in the hall of mirrors at thorensens house thorensen was gazing over one shoulder at the windows of the summer house only halfaware of sanders standing beside him sanders noticed that unlike ventresss suit and his own clothes thorensens leather jerkin was unaffected by the frost can you take me back to the army post he asked thorensen ive been trying to get out of the forest for hours do you know the bourbon hotel a morose frown twisted thorensens long face the armys a long way off the freeze is spreading all through the forest he pointed across the river with his revolver what about ventress the bearded man where did you meet him sanders explained himself again neither thorensen nor the mulatto recognized him as ventresss defender during the attack at port matarre he was taking shelter in a house near the river your house he said why were you shooting at him is he some sort of criminaltrying to steal from your mine there was a laugh at this from the young african with the rifle thorensen nodded without expression his manner was furtive and shifty as if unsure of himself and what to do with sanders worse than that hes a madman completely crazy he turned and started to walk up the steps waving to sanders as if prepared to let him make his own way into the forest youd better be careful theres no knowing what the forest is going to do keep moving but circle around on yourself wait a minute sanders called after him i want to rest here i need a map ive got to find this bourbon hotel a map what good is a map now thorensen hesitated glancing up at the summer house as if worried that sanders might in some way defile its luminous whiteness as the doctors arms fell limply to his sides thorensen shrugged and beckoned his two men to follow him thorensen sanders stepped forward he pointed to the young african with the bandaged leg let me look at his dressing and make him more comfortable im a doctor the three men on the veranda turned together even the big mulatto watching sanders with interest a note of calculation crossed his bilious eyes thorensen was looking down at sanders as if recognizing him for the first time a doctor yes radek saidi remember all right doctor sanders ive nothing with me no drugs or thats ok doctor thorensen said thats good in fact he nodded to himself as if still uncertain to invite sanders into the summer house then he relented right doctor you can come in for five minutes i might want to ask you for something dr sanders climbed the steps onto the veranda the summer house consisted of a single circular room and a small kitchen and store at the rear heavy shutters had been placed over the windows now locked to the casements by the interstitial crystals and the only light entered through the door thorensen glanced around at the forest and then holstered his pistol as the two africans made their way round to the back thorensen turned the door handle through the frosted panes dr sanders saw the dim outlines of a high fourposter bed obviously that removed from the bedroom in the mansion where he and ventress had sheltered from the storm gilded cupids played about the mahogany canopy pipes to their lips and four naked caryatids with upraised arms formed the corner posts thorensen cleared his throat mrsventress he explained at last in a low voice serena they gazed down at the occupant of the bed who lay back on a large satin bolster a febrile hand on the silk counterpane at first dr sanders thought he was looking at an elderly woman probably ventresss mother and then realized that in fact she was little more than a child a young woman in her early twenties her long platinum hair lay in a white shawl over her shoulders her thin highcheeked face raised to the scanty light once she might have had a nervous porcelain beauty but her wasted skin and the fading glow of light in her halfclosed eyes gave her the appearance of someone preternaturally aged reminding dr sanders of his patients in the childrens ward at the hospital near the lйproserie in the last minutes before their death thorensen her voice cracked in the amber gloom its getting cold again cant you light a fire the wood wont burn serena its all turned into glass thorensen stood at the foot of the bed peering down at the young woman in his leather jacket he looked like a policeman uneasily on duty in a sickroom he unzipped the jacket i brought these for you serena theyll help you he leaned forward hiding something from dr sanders and then spilled several handfuls of red and blue gemstones across the counterpane rubies and sapphires of many sizes they glittered in the thinning afternoon light with a fevered power thorensen thank you the girls free hand scuttled across the counterpane to the stones her childlike face had become almost vulpine with greed an expression of surprising craftiness came into her eyes and sanders sensed why the burly mineowner treated her with such deference seizing a handful of the jewels she brought them up to her neck and pressed them tightly against her skin where the bruises formed like fingerprints their contact seemed to revive her and she stirred her legs several of the jewels slipping to the floor she gazed up at dr sanders and then turned to thorensen what were you shooting at she asked after an interval there was a gun going off it gave me a headache just a crocodile serena there are some smart crocodiles around here i have to watch them the young woman nodded with a hand still clutching the jewels she pointed at sanders whos he whats he doing here hes a doctor serena captain radek sent him hes all right but you said i didnt need any doctors you dont serena i know that dr sanders here was just looking by to see one of the men during this labored catechism thorensen kneaded the lapels of his jacket looking everywhere around the room but at serena sanders moved closer to the bed assuming that thorensen would now let him examine the young woman her tubercular breathing and severe anemia needed little further diagnosis but he reached forward to take her wrist doctor on some kind of confused impulse thorensen pulled him back from the bed he made an uncertain gesture with one hand then waved sanders toward the kitchen door i think later doctorright he turned quickly to the young woman you get some rest now serena but thorensen i need more of these you only brought me a few today her hand like a claw searched the counterpane for the jewels the handfuls that thorensen and the mulatto had taken from the wallsafe earlier that afternoon sanders was about to protest but the young woman turned away from them and seemed to subside into sleep the jewels lying like scarabs on the white skin of her breast thorensen nudged sanders with his elbow they stepped into the kitchen before he closed the door thorensen looked down at the young woman with wistful eyes as if frightened that she might dissolve into dust if he left her only halfaware of sanders he said well have something to eat at the far end of the kitchen by the door the mulatto and the naked african sat on a bench halfasleep over their weapons the kitchen was almost empty a disconnected refrigerator stood on the cold stove thorensen opened the door and began to empty the remainder of the jewels from his pockets on to the shelves where they lay like cherries among the halfdozen cans of corned beef and beans a light glacй frost covered the enamel exterior of the refrigerator as everything else in the kitchen but the inner walls of the cabinet remained unaffected who is she dr sanders asked as thorenson prised the lid off a can youve got to get her away from here she needs careful treatment this is no place for doctor thorensen raised a hand to silence sanders he seemed always to be concealing something his eyes fractionally lowered below sanderss shes mywife now he said with curious emphasis as if still trying to establish the fact in his mind serena shes safer here as long as i watch out for ventress but hes only trying to save her for gods sake man hes insane thorensen shouted with sudden force the two negroes at the other end of the kitchen turned to look at him he spent six months in a strait jacket he isnt trying to help serena he just wants to take her back to his crazy house in the middle of the swamp as they ate forking the cold meat straight from the can he told sanders something of ventress this strange and melancholy architect who had designed many of the new government buildings in lagos and accra and then two years earlier abruptly abandoned his work in disgust he had married serena when she was seventeen after bribing her parents a poor french colonial couple in libreville within a few hours of seeing her in the street outside his office as he left it for the last time he had then carried her away to a grotesque folly he had built on a waterlogged island among the crocodiles in the swamps ten miles to the north of mont royal where the matarre river expanded into a series of shallow lakes according to thorensen ventress had rarely spoken to serena after the marriage and prevented her from leaving the house or seeing anyone except a blind negro servant apparently he saw his young bride in a sort of preraphaelite dream caged within his house like the lost spirit of his imagination thorensen had found her there already tubercular on one of his hunting trips when his powercruiser had broken its propeller shaft and was beached on the island he visited her several times during ventresss long absences and she finally escaped with him after the house had caught fire thorensen sent her off to a sanatorium in rhodesia and his own great mansion at mont royal filled with its imitation antiques had been prepared for her homecoming after her disappearance and the first moves toward the annulment of the marriage ventress had gone berserk and spent some time as a voluntary patient at an asylum now he had returned with the singleminded ambition of abducting serena and taking her off once more to his ruined house in the swamps thorensen seemed convinced that ventresss morbid and lunatic presence was responsible for serenas lingering malaise however when sanders asked to see her again in the hope that he would be able to persuade thorensen to remove her from the frozen forest the mineowner demurred shes all right here he told sanders doggedly dont worry but thorensen how much longer do you think shell last here the whole forest is crystallizing dont you realize shes all right thorensen insisted he stood up and looked down at the table his stooped figure with its blond hair like a gallows in the dusk doctor ive been in this forest a long time the only chance she has is here puzzled by this cryptic remark and whatever private meaning it had for thorensen sanders sat down at a chair by the table a siren sounded in the dusk from the direction of the river its echoes reflected off the brittle foliage around the summer house thorensen spoke to the mulatto and came back to sanders ill leave you in their hands doctor ill be back in a short while he took a roll of surgical tape from the shelf beside the cooker and then beckoned to the injured african kagwa let the doctor look at you after thorensen had gone sanders examined the shotwounds in the africans leg and chest and cleaned the rough lint pads a dozen pellets had penetrated the mans skin but the wounds already seemed half healed inert punctures that showed no tendency to bleed or fester youre lucky he told the african when he had finished im surprised you can walk at all he added i saw you this afternoonin the mirrors at thorensens house the youth smiled amicably it was monsieur ventress we were looking for doctor theres much hunting in this forest eh youre rightthough i doubt if any of you really know what youre after sanders noticed the mulatto was watching him with more than usual interest tell me he asked kagwa deciding to make the most of the young mans easygoing manner do you work for thorensen at his mine the mine is closed doctor but i was number one in charge of technical stores he nodded with some pride for the whole mine an important job sanders pointed toward the bedroom door beyond which the young woman lay mrs ventressserena i think thorensen called her shes got to be moved from here youre an intelligent man mr kagwa you realize that a few more days here and shell be as good as dead kagwa turned away from the doctor and smiled to himself he looked down at the bandages on his leg and chest and touched them wistfully good as deada fascinating phrase doctor i understand what you say but its best now for madame ventress to stay here barely controlling his voice sanders said for gods sake kagwa shell die havent you grasped that what on earth is thorensen playing at kagwa raised his hands to restrain sanders turning on his strong leg he leaned the other against the table you are speaking doctor in medical terms listen he insisted when sanders tried to remonstrate i am not giving you any juju magic i am an educated african but many strange things happen in this forest doctor you will he broke off as the mulatto barked something at him and went out onto the veranda they could hear thorensen approaching with two or three men their boots crushing the brittle foliage along the bank as sanders moved toward the door kagwa touched his arm a warning smile held the doctors attention remember doctor walk one way through the forest but look two ways then rifle in hand he limped off on his white leg thorensen greeted sanders on the veranda he clumped up the steps zipping up his leather jacket in the tomblike coldness of the summer house still here doctor ive got a couple of guides for you he pointed to the two africans who stood at the bottom of the steps members of the crew of his motorcruiser they wore jeans and blue denim shirts one had a white peaked cap pulled down across his forehead both carried carbines and were scanning the forest with marked interest my boat is moored near here thorensen explained id send you back by river if the engine hadnt seized up anyway theyll get you to mont royal in no time with this he strode off into the kitchen and a moment later sanders heard him enter the bedroom surrounded by the glistening figures of the four africans etched in hoar frost against the darkness sanders waited for thorensen to reappear then he turned and followed his guides leaving thorensen and serena ventress barricaded together in the sepulchre of the summer house as they entered the forest he looked back at the veranda where the young african kagwa was still watching him his dark body almost exactly bisected by the white bandages reminded sanders of louise peret and her references to the day of the equinox thinking over his brief conversation with kagwa he began to realize thorensens motives for trying to keep serena venrress within the affected zone fearing that she might die he preferred this halfanimate immolation within the crystal vaults to her physical death in the world outside perhaps he had seen insects and birds pinioned alive inside their prisms and misguidedly decided that this offered the one means of escape for his dying bride following a path that skirted the inlet they set off toward the inspection site which sanders estimated to be some threequarters of a mile downriver with luck an army unit would be stationed at the nearest margins of the affected zone and the soldiers would be able to retrace his steps and rescue the mineowner and serena ventress the two guides moved along at a rapid pace barely pausing to choose their direction one in front of sanders and the other wearing the peaked cap ten yards behind after fifteen minutes when they had covered very nearly a mile and yet were still within the main body of the forest sanders realized that the sailors real task was not to guide him to safety at all in turning him out into the forest thorensen was no doubt using him in ventresss phrase as a decoy confident that the architect would try to reach sanders for news of his abducted wife when for the second time they entered a small glade between two groups of forest oaks sanders stopped and walked back to the sailor in the peaked cap he started to remonstrate with him but the man shook his head and beckoned sanders on with his carbine five minutes later sanders found that he was alone the pathway ahead was deserted he made his way back to the glade where the shadows shone emptily on the forest floor the guides had disappeared into the undergrowth sanders glanced over his shoulder at the dark grottoes around the glade listening for any footsteps but the sheaths of the trees sang and crackled as the forest cooled in the darkness above through the lattices that stretched across the glade he could see the fractured bowl of the moon around him in the vitreous walls the reflected stars glittered like fireflies he pressed on along the path his clothes had begun to glow in the dark the frost that covered his suit spangled by the starlight spurs of crystal grew from the dial of his wristwatch imprisoning the hands within a medallion of moonstone a hundred yards behind him the roar of a shotgun drummed through the trees a carbine fired twice in reply and a confused medley of running feet shouts and gunfire reached sanders as he crouched behind a trunk abruptly everything fell quiet again sanders waited searching the darkness around him a few fragmentary halfformed noises came down the pathway there was a brief shout cut off by a second blast from the shotgun as if far away an africans voice cried plaintively sanders made his way back through the trees five yards from the path in a hollow among the roots of an oak he found the dying figure of one of his guides the man halfsat against the trunk knocked back across the roots by the force of the gunbiast he watched sanders approach with vague eyes one hand touching the blood that ran from his shattered chest ten feet away lay his peaked cap the imprint of a small foot stamped into its crown sanders knelt down beside him the african looked away his wet eyes were staring through an interval in the trees at the distant river its petrified surface stretched like white ice to the jeweled forest on the opposite shore a siren sounded from the direction of the summer house realizing that thorensen and his men would make short work of him sanders stood up the african was dying quietly at his feet leaving him sanders crossed the path and set off toward the river when he reached the bank he could see the motorcruiser moored in a pooi of clear water a quarter of a mile away at the mouth of a small creek that wound off past a ruined jetty a searchlight shone from the bridge playing on the white surface that swept past the open water down the channel of the river crouching down sanders ducked in and out of the grass growing from the edges of the bank his running shadow illuminated by the sweeping searchlight flickered ahead of him among the vitrified trees the dark image speckled by the jeweled light half a mile downriver the channel had widened into a broad glacier across the surface sanders could see the distant rooftops of mont royal like a causeway of frozen gas it flowed on through the darkness riven by deep faults at its bottom ran the icy water of the original channel sanders peered over the edges of the fissures hoping for some sign of captain radeks body stranded on the beaches of ice below forced to leave the river when the surface broke up into a succession of giant cataracts he approached the outskirts of mont royal the frosted outline of the picket fence and the debris of military equipment marked the site of the former inspection area the laboratory trailer and the tables and equipment near by had been enveloped by the intense frost the branches in the centrifuge had blossomed again into brilliant jeweled sprays sanders picked up a discarded helmet now a glass porcupine and drove it through a window of the trailer in the darkness the whiteroofed houses of the mining town gleamed like the funerary temples of a necropolis their cornices were ornamented with countless spires and gargoyles linked together across the roads by the expanding tracery a frozen wind moved through the deserted streets waisthigh forests of fossil spurs the abandoned cars embedded within them like armored saurians on an ancient ocean floor everywhere the process of transformation was accelerating sanderss feet were encased in huge crystal slippers these spurs enabled him to walk along the sharp edges of the roadway but soon the opposing needles would fuse together and lock him to the ground the eastern entrance to the town was sealed by the forest and the erupting roadway sanders limped back to the river hoping to climb the series of cataracts and make his way back to the base camp to the south as he scaled the first of the crystal blocks he could hear the underground streams beneath the moraine sluicing away into the open river a long crevice with an overhanging sill ran diagonally across the cataract and led him into a series of galleries like the aerial terraces of a cathedral beyond these the icefalls spilled away onto a white beach that seemed to mark the southern limits of the affected zone the vents of the buried channels lay among the icefalls and a clear stream of moonlit water ran between the blocks and opened into a shallow river at least ten feet below the original course sanders walked along the frozen beach looking at the vitrified forest on either side already the trees were duller the crystal sheaths lying in patches against the sides of the trunk like halfmelted ice fifty yards along the ice beach which narrowed as the water swept past it sanders saw a mans dark figure standing beneath one of the overhanging trees with a tired wave sanders began to run toward him wait he called afraid that the man might sidestep into the forest over here ten yards from him sanders slowed to a walk the man had not moved from beneath the tree head down he was carrying a large piece of driftwood across his shouldersa soldier sanders decided foraging for firewood as sanders drew up to him the man stepped forward in a gesture that was at once defensive and aggressive the light from the icefalls illuminated his ravaged body radekgood god appalled sanders stumbled back almost tripping over a halfexposed root in the ice radek the man hesitated like a wounded animal uncertain whether to surrender or attack across his shoulders he still carried the wooden yoke which sanders had fastened there the left side of his body gave a painful heave as if he were trying to throw off this incubus but he was unable to raise his hands to the buckle behind his head the right side of his body seemed to hang loosely suspended from the wooden crosstree like a longdead corpse a huge wound had been torn across the shoulder the flesh bared to the elbow and sternum the raw face from which a single eye gazed at sanders still ran with blood that fell to the white ice below recognizing the belt with which he had fastened the wooden spar to radeks shoulders dr sanders moved forward gesturing to the man as if to pacify him he remembered ventresss warning and the pieces of crystal that he had torn away from the body when he dragged radek from the helicopter then too he remembered aragon tapping his eyetooth and saying covered my tooth is the whole gold doctor radek let me help sanders edged forward as radek hesitated believe me i wanted to save you still trying to shift the wooden spar from his shoulders radek gazed down at sanders unformed thoughts seemed to cross his face and then the one blinking eye came into focus radek sanders raised a hand to restrain him unsure whether radek would charge him or bolt like a wounded beast into the forest with a shambling step radek drew nearer a gruntlike noise came from his throat he moved again almost toppled by the swinging spar take me he began there was another lurching stride he held out a bloody arm like a scepter take me back he struggled on the heavy spar swinging his shoulders from left to right one foot flapping on to the ice his face lit by the jeweled light from the forest sanders watched him as he jerked forward the arm held out as if to clasp sanderss shoulder already however he seemed to have forgotten sanders his attention fixed on the light from the icefalls sanders moved out of his way ready to let him go by with a sudden sidestep radek swung the wooden beam and drove sanders in front of him take me radek winded by the blow sanders stumbled ahead like an onlooker driven towards some bloody golgotha by its intended victim one lurching stride after another his pace quickening as the prismatic light of the forest mingled again with his blood radek pressed on the beam across his shoulders cutting off sanderss escape sanders ran towards the icefalls twenty yards from the first of the blocks where the clear streams of the subterranean channels ran across his feet as dark and cool as his memories of the world beyond he turned and raced down into the shallows radek let out his stricken cry for the last time and sanders plunged to his shoulders into the river and swam away across the silver water the mask some hours later as he walked dripping through the edges of the illuminated forest sanders came to a wide road deserted in the moonlight in the distance he saw the outlines of a white hotel with its long faзade and tumbled columns it looked like a floodlit ruin to the left of the road the forest slopes moved upwards to the blue hills above mont royal this time as he approached the man standing beside a landrover in the empty forecourt of the hotel his wave was answered by a ready shout a second figure patrolling the ruined hotel ran across the drive a searchlight on the roof of the car was played on to the road in front of dr sanders the two natives wearing the uniform of the local hospital service came forward to meet him in the light from the forest their liquid eyes watched dr sanders as they helped him into the car their dark fingers feeling at the drenched fabric of his suit dr sanders sat back too tired to identify himself to the men one of them climbed into the drivingseat and switched on the cars radio transmitter as he spoke into the microphone his eyes stared at the crystals still dissolving on dr sanderss shoes and wristwatch the white light sparkled faintly in the dark cabin the last of the crystals on the dial of the wristwatch gave out their light and faded and with a sudden movement the hands began to turn the road marked the final boundary of the affected zone and to dr sanders the darkness around him seemed absolute the black air inert and empty after the endless glimmer of the vitrified forest the trees along the road the ruined hotel and even the two men with him appeared to be shadowy images of themselves replicas of illuminated originals in some distant land at the source of the petrffied river despite his relief at escaping from the forest this feeling of flatness and unreality of being in the slack shallows of a spent world filled sanders with a sense of failure and disappointment a car approached along the road the driver signalled with the searchlight on the landrover and the car turned and came to a halt beside them a tall man wearing an army battledress over his civilian clothes jumped out he peered through the window at sanders and then nodded at the native driver dr sanders he asked are you all right aragon sanders opened his door and started to get out but aragon motioned him back captainid almost forgotten is louise with you mademoiselle peret aragon shook his head shes with the other visitors at the camp doctor we thought you might come out this way ive been watching the road aragon moved aside so that the light from his cars headlamps showed more of sanderss face he looked into sanderss eyes as if trying to assess the inner impact of the forest youre lucky to be here doctor many of the soldiers are feared lost in the forestthey think captain radek is dead the affected area is spreading out in all directions its many times the previous size the driver in aragons car cut his engine as the headlamps faded sanders sat forward louiseshes safecaptain id like to see her tomorrow doctor she will come to your friends clinic you must see them first she understands that dr clair and his wife are at the clinic now they will look after you he went back to his car it turned and made off at speed down the dark road five minutes later after a short drive down a side turning past an old mineworks the landrover entered the compound of the mission hospital a few oil lamps burned in the outbuildings and several native families huddled by their carts in the yard reluctant to take shelter indoors the men sat in a group by the empty fountain in the center the smoke from their cheroots forming white plumes in the darkness is dr clair here sanders asked the driver and mrs clair they both here sir the driver glanced across at sanders still unsure of this apparition that had materialized from the crystalline forest you dr sanders sir he ventured as they parked thats it theyre expecting me yes sir dr clair in mont royal yesterday for you but trouble in the town sir he go away i know everything went crazyim sorry i missed him as sanders climbed out of the car a familiar rotund figure in a white cotton jacket shortsighted eyes below a domed forehead hurried down the steps toward him edward my dear chap for heavens sake he took sanderss arm where on earth have you been sanders felt himself relaxing for the first time since his arrival at port matarre indeed since his departure from the lйproserie at fort isabelle max i wish i knewits good to see you he shook clairs hand holding it in a tight grip its been insane herehow are you max and hows suzanneis she shes fine fine hold on a moment leaving sanders on the steps clair went back to the native drivers by the landrover and patted each of them on the shoulder he looked around at the other natives in the compound waving to them as they squatted on their bundles in the dim light of the flares half a mile away beyond the roofs of the outbuildings an immense pall of silver light glowed in the night sky above the forest suzanne will be thrilled to see you edward max said as he rejoined sanders he seemed more preoccupied than sanders had remembered him weve talked about you a lotim sorry about yesterday afternoon suzanne had promised to visit one of the mine dispensaries when thorensen contacted me we got our lines crossed the excuse was a palpably lame one and max smiled apologetically they entered an inner courtyard and walked across to a long chalet at the far end sanders stopped glancing through the windows of the empty wards somewhere a generator hummed and a few electric light bulbs glowed at the ends of corridors but the hospital seemed deserted maxi made an appalling blunder sanders spoke rapidly hoping that suzanne would not appear and interrupt him half an hour from then as the three of them relaxed over their drinks in the comfort of the clairs lounge radeks tragedy would cease to seem real this man radeka captain in the medical corps i found him in the center of the forest completely crystallized you know what i mean max nodded his eyes looking sanders up and down with a more than usually watchful gaze sanders went on i thought the only way of saving him was to immerse him in the riverbut i had to tear him loose some of the crystals came off i didnt realize edward max took his arm and tried to steer him along the path theres no sanders pushed his hand away max i found him later id torn half his face and chest away for gods sake max clenched his fist yours wasnt the first mistake dont reproach yourself max i dontunderstand me it wasnt just that sanders hesitated the point ishe wanted to go back he wanted to go back into the forest and be crystallized again he knew max he knew lowering his head clair moved away a few paces he glanced at the darkened french windows of the chalet where the tall figure of his wife watched them from the halfopened door suzannes there he said shes pleased to see you edward but almost vaguely as if distracted by matters other than those which sanders had described he added youll want a change of clothes i have a suit that will fit youone of the european patients deceased if you dont mind that and something to eat its damned cold in the forest sanders was looking at suzanne clair instead of coming forward to greet him she had retreated into the darkness of the lounge and at first sanders wondered whether some residue of their old embarrassment still remained although sanders felt that his past affair with suzanne if anything bound max and himself together far more than it separated them max seemed distant and nervous almost as if he resented sanderss arrival but sanders could see the smile of greeting on suzannes face she was wearing a night robe of black silk that made her tall figure seem almost invisible against the shadows in the lounge the pale lantern of her face floating like a nimbus above it suzanneits wonderful to see you sanders took her hand with a laugh i was frightened you might both have been swallowed by the forest how are you very happy edward still holding sanderss arm suzanne turned to face her husband delighted that youve come youll be able to share the forest with us now my dear i think the poor man has had more than his fair share already max bent down behind the sofa against the bookshelf and switched on the desk lamp that had been placed on the floor the dim light illuminated the gold lettering on the leather spines of his books but the rest of the room remained in darkness do you realize that hes been trapped in the forest since late yesterday afternoon trapped turning away from sanders suzanne went over to the french windows and closed the door she looked out at the brilliant night sky over the forest and then sat down in a chair near the blackwood cabinet against the far wall is that quite the word to use i envy you edward it must have been a wonderful experience well accepting a drink from max who was now halffilling his own glass from the whisky decanter sanders leaned against the mantelpiece hidden in the shadows by the cabinet suzanne was still smiling at him but this reflection of her former good humor seemed overlaid by the ambiguous atmosphere in the lounge he wondered whether this was due to his own fatigue but there seemed something out of key in their meeting as if some unseen dimension had been let obliquely into the room he was still wearing the clothes in which he had swum the river but max made no move toward helping him to change sanders raised his glass to suzanne i suppose one could call it wonderful he said its a matter of degreei was unprepared for everything here how marvelousyoull never forget it suzanne sat forward she wore her long black hair in an unusual manner well forward over her face so that it concealed her cheeks tell me about it all edward i my dear max held up his hand give the poor man time to catch his breath besides hell want a meal now and then to get to bed we can discuss it all over breakfast to sanders he explained suzanne spends a lot of time wandering through the forest wandering sanders repeated what do you mean only through the fringes edward suzanne said were on the edge of the forest here but theres enoughive seen those jeweled vaults with animation she said a few mornings ago when i went out before dawn my slippers were beginning to crystallize my feet were turning into diamonds and emeralds with a smile max said my dear youre the princess in the enchanted wood max i was suzanne nodded her eyes gazing at her husband as he looked down at the carpet she turned to sanders edward we could never leave here now sanders shrugged i understand suzanne but you may have to the affected area is spreading god only knows what the source of all this is but there doesnt seem much prospect of stopping it why try suzanne looked up at sanders shouldnt we be grateful to the forest for giving us such a bounty max finished his drink suzanne youre moralizing like some missionary all edward wants at this moment is a change of clothes and a meal he went over to the door ill be with you in a moment edward theres a room ready for you help yourself to another drink when he had gone sanders said to suzanne as he filled his glass with soda you must be tired im sorry to have kept you up not at all i sleep during the day nowmax and i decided we should keep the dispensary open round the clock aware that the explanation was not wholly convincing she added to be frank i prefer the night one can see the forest better thats true youre not frightened of it suzanne why should i be its so easy to be more frightened of ones feelings than of the things that prompt them the forest isnt like thative accepted it and all the fears that go with them in a quieter voice she added im glad youre here edward im afraid max doesnt understand whats happening in the foresti mean in the widest senseto all our ideas of time and mortality how can i put it life like a dome of manycolored glass stains the white radiance of eternity im sure you understand carrying his glass sanders walked across the darkened room although his eyes had become accustomed to the dim light suzannes face still remained hidden in the shadows behind the blackwood cabinet the faintly quizzical smile that had hovered about her mouth since his arrival was still there almost beckoning to him as he drew closer to her he realized that this slight upward inclination of the mouth was not a smile at all but a facial rictus caused by the nodular thickening of the upper lip the skin of her face had a characteristic dusky appearance which she had managed to hide by her long hair and a lavish use of powder despite this camouflage he could see the nodular lumps all over her face and in the lobe of her left ear as she drew back fractionally in her chair raising her shoulder already after his years of experience at the leper hospital he recognized the beginnings of the socalled leonine mask confused by this discovery although he had halfanticipated it since suzannes first letter to him from mont royal sanders moved away across the room hoping suzanne had failed to notice the telltale way in which he had spilt some of his drink on to the carpet his first feelings of anger at this crime of nature against someone who had already spent much of her own life trying to cure others of the disease gave way to a sense of relief as if this particular disaster were one for which both of them were psychologically well prepared he realized that he had been waiting for suzanne to catch the disease that for him this had probably been her one valid role even their affair had been an unconscious attempt to bring about this very end it was himself and not the poor devils in the lйproserie who had been the real source of infection for suzanne sanders finished his drink and put it down then turned to face suzanne despite their previous closeness he found it almost impossible to express himself to her after a pause he said lamely i was sorry you left fort isabelle at the time suzanne in fact it was an effort to stop myself following you straightaway im glad you came though it may seem a strange choice to some people but i understand who could blame you for trying to escape from the dark side of the sun suzanne shook her head either puzzled by this cryptic reference or preferring not to understand it what do you mean sanders hesitated although she appeared to be smiling suzanne was in fact trying to control this involuntary movement of her mouth her once elegant face was twisted by a barely concealed scowl he gestured i was thinking of our patients at fort isabelle for them its nothing to do with them edward youre tired and i have to be at the dispensary i mustnt keep your supper any longer with a brisk movement suzanne stood up her slim figure taller than sanders her powdered face looked down at him with the skulllike intensity he remembered in ventress then once again the deformed smile supervened good night edward well see you at breakfast you have so much to tell us sanders stopped her at the door suzanne what is it edward she halfclosed the door shutting out the light from the corridor that cut across her face sanders fumbled for something to say and in a kind of halfremembered reflex raised his arms to embrace her then as much attracted as repelled by her injured face but knowing that he must first understand his own motives he turned away theres nothing to tell you suzanne he said youve seen everything here in the forest not everything edward suzanne told him one day you must take me there the white hotel the next morning wearing the dead mans clothes sanders met louise peret he had spent the night in one of the four empty chalets that formed the sides of a small courtyard behind the clairs bungalow the remainder of the european medical staff had left the hospital and before breakfast sanders wandered through the deserted chalets trying to prepare himself for the coming meeting with suzanne the few books and magazines left behind on the shelves and the unused cans in the kitchen were like the residue of a distant world his new suit had been the property of a belgian engineer at one of the mines the man roughly his own age he assumed from the cut of the trousers and jacket had died some weeks earlier of pneumonia in the pockets of the jacket sanders found small pieces of bark and a few dried leaves sanders speculated whether the man had caught his final chill while gathering these oncecrystallized objects from the forest suzanne clair did not appear at breakfast when sanders arrived at the clairs bungalow and was shown into the diningroom by the houseboy max clair greeted him with a raised forefinger suzanne is sleeping he told sanders she had quite a night poor deara lot of natives are hanging around in the bush hoping to reap themselves a harvest of diamonds i suppose theyve brought their sick with them incurables for the most part what about you edward how do you feel this morning well enough sanders said thanks for the suit by the way your own is dry now max said one of the boys pressed it earlier this morning if you want to change thats all right this one is warmer anyway sanders felt the blue serge fabric the darker material in some way seemed more appropriate to his present meeting with suzanne than his cotton tropical suit a fitting disguise for this nether world where she slept by day and appeared only at night max ate his breakfast with relish working with both hands at his grapefruit since their meeting the previous night he had relaxed completely almost as if suzannes absence gave him his first chance to lower his guard with sanders at the same time sanders guessed that he had been deliberately allowed his few minutes alone with suzanne to make his own brief judgment if any on why she and max had come to mont royal edward you havent told me yet about your visit to the site yesterday what exactly happened sanders glanced across the table puzzled by maxs air of detachment youve probably seen as much as i havethe whole forest is vitrifying by the way do you know thorensen at all our telephone line goes through his mine office ive met him a few timesthat suit belonged to one of his engineers hes always up to some private game of his own what about this woman living with himserena ventress i take it their affair is common gossip here not at allventress you say her name is probably some cocotte he picked up in a libreville dancehall not exactly sanders decided to say no more as they finished breakfast he described his arrival at port matarre and the journey to mont royal concluding with his visit to the inspection site at the end as they walked out past the empty wards on either side of the courtyard he hinted at professor tatlins explanation of the hubble effect and what he himself felt to be its real significance max however seemed to have little interest in all this obviously he regarded the crystallizing forest as a freak of nature that would soon exhaust itself and let him get on with the job of nursing suzanne sanderss oblique references to her he sidestepped deftly with some pride he showed sanders around the hospital pointing out the additional wards and xray facilities which he and suzanne had introduced during their short stay believe me edward its been quite a job though i wouldnt take too much credit for ourselves the mine companies provide most of the patients and consequently most of the money they were walking along the perimeter fence on the eastern side of the hospital in the distance beyond the singlestory buildings they could see the full extent of the forest its soft light shining like a stainedglass canopy in the morning sun although still held back by the perimeter road near the bourbon hotel the affected zone seemed to have spread several miles downriver extending itself through the forested areas along the banks two hundred feet above the jungle the air seemed to glitter continuously as if the crystallizing atoms were deliquescing in the wind and being replaced by those rising from the forest below the sounds of shouting and the thwacks of bamboo canes distracted sanders fifty yards away a group of hospital porters were moving through the trees on the other side of the fence they were driving back a throng of natives that sanders noticed sitting in the shadows under the branches in what seemed to be a show of strength the porters blew their whistles and beat the ground around the natives feet looking beneath the trees sanders realized that there were at least two hundred of the natives hunched together in small groups around their bundles and sticks gazing out at the distant forest with dead eyes all of them appeared to be crippled or diseased with deformed faces and skeletonlike shoulders and arms those driven back retreated a few yards into the trees dragging their sick with them but the others sat their ground they seemed unaware of the sticks and whistles sanders guessed that they were not drawn to the hospital by any hopes of help and attention but regarded it merely as a temporary shield between the forest and themselves max who the devil sanders stepped over the wire fence the nearest group was twenty yards from him the dark bodies almost invisible in the refuse and undergrowth below the trees some mendicant tribe max explained following sanders over the fence he acknowledged the salute of one of the porters dont worry about them they move around here all the time believe me they dont really want help but max sanders walked a few paces across the clearing the natives had so far watched him without expression but now as he approached them they at last showed some reaction an old man with a puffy head crouched down as if to shrink from sanderss gaze another with mutilated hands hid them between his knees there seemed to be no children but here and there sanders saw a small bundle strapped to the back of a crippled woman everywhere there was the same stirring movement as they shifted slowly in their places little more than their shoulders moving as if aware that there was no possibility of hiding themselves max these are clair took his arm he started to pull sanders back to the fence yes edward they are theyre lepers they follow you across the world dont they im sorry we cant do anything for them but max sanders swung round he pointed to the deserted wards within the compound the hospitals empty why have you turned them out we havent clair looked away from the trees they come from a small camphardly a lйproserie which one of the catholic fathers kept going when he left they just drifted off into the bush it was badly run anyway all he did for them was say a few prayers and not many of those if what ive heard is true now theyve come backits the light from the forest i suppose but why not take some of them in youve got enough room for a few dozen cases edward were not equipped to deal with them even if we wanted to it wouldnt work believe me ive got to think of suzanne we all have our difficulties you know of course sanders collected himself i understand max youve both done more than your share max climbed the fence into the compound the porters had moved along the trees and were now driving back the last of the lepers rapping the older ones and cripples over their legs when they were slow to move ill be in my surgery edward perhaps we can have a drink at eleven let one of the porters know if you go out sanders waved to him then walked away along the clearing the porters had completed their job and were going back to the gatehouse canes over their shoulders the lepers had retreated into the deep shadows almost out of sight but sanders could feel their eyes staring through him at the forest beyond the one link between this barely recognizable residue of humanity and the world around it doctor dr sanders sanders turned to see louise peret coming toward him from an army staff car parked by the entrance she waved to the french lieutenant watching from the driving window he saluted her with a flourish and drove off louisearagon said you were coming this morning louise reached him smiling broadly she took his arm i almost didnt recognize you edward this suit its like a disguise i feel i need it now with a halflaugh sanders pointed to the trees twenty yards from them but louise failed to notice the lepers sitting in the shadows aragon told me youd been caught in the forest she went on glancing critically at sanders but you seem all in one piece ive been talking to dr tatlin the physicist hes explained all his theories about the forestvery complicated believe me all about the stars and time youll be amazed when i tell you im sure i will happy to listen to her blithe chatter sanders slipped his arm through hers and steered her along the clearing toward the group of chalets at the rear of the hospital after the antiseptic odors and the atmosphere of illness and compromise with life louises brisk stride and fresh body seemed to come from a forgotten world her white skirt and blouse shone against the dust and the somber trees with their hidden audience feeling her hips against his own sanders almost believed for a moment that he was walking away with her for ever from mont royal the hospital and the forest louise with a laugh he broke into her rapid rйsumй of her evening at the army base for gods sake shut up you may not realize it but youre giving me a catalogue of all the exchange officers at the camp im not what do you mean hey where are you taking me coffeefor you a drink for me well go to my chalet maxs houseboy will bring some over for us louise hesitated all right but what about suzanne sanders shrugged shes asleep what now she always sleeps during the dayat night she has to run the dispensary to tell the truth ive hardly seen her he added hastily aware that this was not necessarily the answer louise wanted to hear it was pointless coming herethe whole thing has been a complete anticlimax louise nodded at this good she said as if only halfconvinced perhaps thats as it should be and your friendthe husband before sanders could reply louise had stopped and taken his arm startled she pointed under the trees here away from the road and the gatehouse the lepers had been driven back only a few yards and their watching faces were plainly visible edward there those people what are they theyre human sanders said evenly with faint sarcasm he added dont be frightened im not but what are they doing my god there are hundreds of them they were here all the time we were talking i dont suppose they bothered to listen sanders motioned louise through a gap in the fence poor devils theyre just sitting there spellbound how do you mean by me sanders laughed aloud at this taking louises arm again he held it tightly my dear what have those frenchmen been doing to you im spellbound by you but im afraid those people are only interested in the forest they walked across the small courtyard and entered sanderss chalet he rang the bell for the clairs houseboy and then ordered some coffee for louise and whisky and soda for himself when these arrived they settled themselves in the lounge sanders switched on the overhead fan and removed his jacket taking off your disguise now louise asked youre right sanders pulled up the footstool and sat down in front of the settee im glad youre here louise you make the place seem less like an unmade grave he reached forward and took the coffee cup and saucer from her hands he rose to sit down beside her and then walked over to the window which looked out on to the clairs bungalow he lowered the plastic blind edward for a man so uncertain of his real nature you can be very calculating louise watched him with amusement as he sat down on the settee beside her pretending to hold off his arm she asked are you still testing yourself my dear a woman likes to know her proper role at all times this one most of all when sanders said nothing she pointed to the blind i thought you said she was asleep or do the vampires here fly by day as she laughed sanders put his hand firmly on her chin day and nightdo they mean much any longer they ate lunch together in the chalet afterwards sanders described his experiences in the forest i remember louise when i first arrived in port matarre you told me it was the day of the spring equinox of course it hadnt occurred to me before but i realize now just how far everything in the world outside the forest was being divided into light and darkyou could see it perfectly in port matarre that strange light in the arcades and in the jungle around the town and even in the people there dark and light twins of each other looking back they all seem to pair offventress with his white suit and the mineowner thorensen with his black gang theyre fighting each other now over this dying woman somewhere in the forest then there are suzanne and yourselfyou havent met her but shes your exact opposite very elusive and shadowy when you arrived this morning louise it was as if youd stepped out of the sun again theres balthus that priest with his deathmask face though god alone knows who his twin is perhaps you edward you may be righti suppose hes trying to free himself from whats left of his faith just as im trying to escape from fort isabelle and the lйproserieradek pointed that out to me poor fellow but this division edward into black and white why theyre what you care to make them are they i suspect it goes deeper than that there may well be some fundamental distinction between light and dark that we inherit from the earliest living creatures after all the response to light is a response to all the possibilities of life itself for all we know this division is the strongest one there isperhaps even the only onereinforced everyday for hundreds of millions of years in its simplest sense time keeps this going and now that time is withdrawing were beginning to see the contrasts in everything more clearly its not a matter of identifying any moral notions with light and darki dont take sides between ventress and thorensen isolated now theyre both grotesques but perhaps the forest will bring them together there in that place of rainbows nothing is distinguished from anything else and suzanneyour dark ladywhat does she mean for you edward im not sureobviously she stands in some way for the lйproserie and whatever that meansthe dark side of the equinox believe me i recognize now that my motives for working at the lйproserie werent altogether humanitarian but merely accepting that doesnt help me of course theres a dark side of the psyche and i suppose all one can do is find the other face and try to reconcile the twoits happening out there in the forest how long are you staying louise asked in mont royal another few days i cant leave straightaway from my point of view coming here has been a complete failure but ive hardly seen either of them and they may need my help edward louise walked over to the window pulling on the blind she raised the blades so that they let in the afternoon light silhouetted against the sun her white suit and pale skin became suddenly dark as she played with the string opening and closing the blind her slim figure was lit and then eclipsed like an image in a solar shutter edward theres an army launch going back to port matarre tomorrow in the afternoon ive decided to go but louise i must go she faced him her chin raised theres no hope of finding andersonhe must be dead by nowand i owe it to the bureau to get my story out story my dear youre thinking in terms of trivialities sanders went over to the whisky decanter on the bare sideboard louise id hoped you could stay on with me he broke off aware that louise was putting him to the test and not wanting to upset her whatever his references to suzanne he knew that he would have to stay with her and max for the time being if anything suzannes leprosy had increased his need to remain with her despite her aloofness the previous night sanders knew that he was the only person to understand the real nature of her affliction and its meaning for them both to louise as she picked up her handbag he said ill ask max to call the base and send a car for you during the rest of the afternoon sanders remained in the chalet watching the corona of light that lay over the distant forest behind him beyond the perimeter fence the lepers had moved forward again through the trees as the afternoon light faded the brilliance of the sun was still held within the crystal forest and the old men and women came to the edge of the trees and waited there like nervous wraiths after dusk suzanne appeared again whether she had really been asleep or like sanders sitting in her room behind drawn blinds he had no means of knowing but at dinner she seemed even more withdrawn than at their previous meeting eating with a kind of compulsive nervousness as if forcing down food that lacked all flavor she had finished each of the courses when sanders and max were still talking over their wine the black velvet curtain behind herobviously placed against this single window for sanderss benefitmade her dark robe almost invisible in the dim light and from the far end of the table where she had placed sanders even the white powdered mask of her face seemed a veiled blur did max take you on a tour of our hospital she asked i hope you were impressed very sanders said it has no patients he added im surprised you need to spend any time at all in the dispensary quite a number of the natives come along during the night max explained during the daytime theyre hanging around near the forest one of the drivers told me that theyre starting to take their sick and dying into the affected area a kind of instant mummification i suppose but far more splendid suzanne said like a fly in the amber of its own tears or a fossil millions of years old making a diamond of its body for us i hope the army let them through they cant stop them max rejoined if these people want to commit suicide its their affair the army is too busy anyway evacuating themselves he turned to sanders its almost comical edward as soon as they put the camp down somewhere they have to uproot the whole thing and back off another quarter of a mile how fast is the area spreading about a hundred feet a day or more according to the army radio network things are getting to the panic stage in the focal area in florida half the state has been evacuated already the zone there extends from the everglades swamps all the way to miami suzanne raised her glass at this can you imagine that edward an entire city all those hundreds of white hotels transformed into stained glassit must be like venice in the days of titian and veronese or rome with dozens of st peters max laughed suzanne you make it sound like the new jerusalem before you could turn around im afraid youd find yourself an angel in a rose window after dinner sanders waited for clair to leave and give him a few moments alone with suzanne but max took a chess set from the blackwood cabinet and set up the pieces as he and sanders played the opening moves suzanne excused herself and slipped out sanders waited an hour for her to come back at ten oclock he resigned his game and said good night to max leaving him mulling over the possibilities of the end game unable to sleep sanders wandered around his chalet drinking what was left of the whisky in the decanter in one of the empty rooms he found a stack of french illustrated magazines and leafed through the pages scanning the bylines of the articles for louises name on an impulse he left the chalet and went out into the darkness he walked toward the perimeter fence twenty yards from the wire he could see the lepers sitting under the trees in the moonlight they had come forward on to the open ground exposing themselves to the moonlight like bathers under a midnight sun one or two were shuffling about through the lines of people halfasleep on the ground or squatting on their bundles hiding himself in the shadows behind the chalet sanders turned and followed their gaze the vast outspill of light rose from the forest its extent broken only by the dim white form of the bourbon hotel sanders walked back into the compound crossing the courtyard he made his way to the perimeter fence as it turned in the direction of the ruined hotel which was now hidden by the intervening trees a path led toward it through the trees passing the abandoned mineworks sanders stepped over the fence then walked through the dark air toward the hotel ten minutes later as he stood at the top of the wide steps that led down among the tumbled columns he saw suzanne clair walking in the moonlight below him in a few places the affected zone had crossed the highway and small patches of the scrub along the roadside had begun to vitrify their drab leaves gave off a faint luminescence suzanne walked among them her long robe sweeping across the brittle ground sanders could see that her shoes and the train of her robe were beginning to crystallize the minute prisms glancing in the moonlight sanders made his way down the steps his feet cutting at the shards of marble between the columns turning suzanne saw him approach for a moment she flinched toward the road then recognized him and hurried up the weedgrown drive edward sanders reached out to take her hands afraid that she might stumble but suzanne slipped past and pressed herself to his chest sanders embraced her feeling her dark hair against his cheek her waist and shoulders were like ice the silk robe chilling his hands suzanne i thought you might be here he tried to move her away so that he could see her face but she still held on to him with the strong grip of a dancer moving with her partner through an intricate step her eyes were turned away so that she seemed to speak from the ruins beyond his left shoulder edward i come here every night she pointed to the upper stories of the white hotel i was there yesterday i watched you come out of the forest do you know edward your clothes were glowing sanders nodded then walked with her up the drive to the steps as if straightening her hair suzanne held one hand to her forehead between them the other clasping his own hand to her cold waist does max know youre here sanders asked he may send one of the houseboys to keep an eye on you my dear edward suzanne laughed for the first time max has no idea hes asleep poor manhe realizes hes living on the edges of a nightmare she stopped checking herself in case sanders might guess that this referred to her own condition the forest that is hes never understood what it means you do edward i could see that straightaway perhaps they climbed the steps past the drums of the toppled columns and entered the great hail high above the cupola over the staircase had fallen through and sanders could see a cluster of stars but the light from the forest below cast the hall into almost complete darkness immediately he felt suzanne relax taking his hand she guided him past the shattered chandelier at the foot of the staircase they walked up to the second floor and then turned into a corridor on their left through the broken panels sanders saw the wormeaten hulks of tall wardrobes and collapsed bedposts like the derelict monuments in some mausoleum to the hotels forgotten past here we are suzanne stepped through a locked door whose central panels had fallen in in the room beyond the empire furniture was in place a desk stood in the corner by the window and a mirrorless dressing table framed the forest below dust and wormwood lay on the floor small footprints winding through them suzanne sat down on one side of the bed opening her robe with the placid gestures of a wife returning home with her husband what do you think of it edward my pied a terre or is it nearer the clouds than that sanders glanced around the dusty room looking for some personal trace of suzanne apart from the footprints on the floor there was nothing of her there as if she dwelled like a ghost among the empty chambers of the white hotel i like the room he said it has a magnificent view of the forest i only come here in the evening and then the dust looks like moonlight sanders sat down on the bed beside her he glanced up at the ceiling halfafraid that at any moment the hotel might crumble and collapse into a dustfilled pit carrying suzanne and himself down into its maw he waited for the darkness to clear aware of the contrast between suzanne and this room in the derelict hotel with its moonlit empire furniture and the functional but sunfilled chalet where he and louise had made love that morning louises body had lain beside him like a piece of the sun a golden odalisque trapped for pharaoh in his tomb as now in turn he held suzannes cold body in his arms his hands avoiding her face which lay beside him in the darkness its pale lantern like a closing moon he remembered ventresss were running out of time sanders as time withdrew his relationship with suzanne drained of everything but the image of leprosy and whatever this stood for in his mind had begun to dissolve into the dust that surrounded them wherever they moved outside the forest suzanne he sat up beside her trying to massage some warmth into his hands her breasts had been like goblets of ice tomorrow im going back to port matarre its time for me to leave what suzanne drew the robe across herself sealing the white outline of her body into the darkness but edward i thought youd sanders took her hand my dear apart from everything i owe max there are my patients at isabelle i cant just leave them they were my patients as well the forest is spreading everywhere theres no more you or i can do for them perhaps noti may only be thinking of myself againand you suzanne while he spoke she had left the bed and now stood in front of him the dark robe brushing the dust from the floor stay with us for a week edward derain wont mind he knew you were coming here in a week in a week we may all have to go believe me suzanne ive been trapped in the forest she walked toward him her face raised in a shaft of moonlight as if about to kiss him on the mouth then he realized that this was far from being a romantic gesture at last suzanne was showing him her face edward just now do you know to whom you made love to sanders touched her shoulder with one hand trying to reassure her suzanne i do know last night what she turned away from him hiding her face again what do you mean sanders followed her across the room im sorry suzanne it may sound hollow comfort but i carry those lesions as much as you do before he could reach her she had slipped through the door he picked up his jacket and saw her moving swiftly down the long corridor to the staircase when he reached the entrance hail she was more than fifty yards ahead of him running through the tumbled columns her dark gown like an immense veil as she moved along the crystalline pathways away from the white hotel duel with a crocodile at midnight as he lay halfasleep in his room at the rear of the chalet dr sanders heard the sounds of a distant commotion from the compound of the hospital almost too tired to sleep and yet sufficiently exhausted not to listen more closely he ignored the raised voices and the flickering beam of the landrovers searchlight carried over the roof and reflected off the tall trees outside later the noise began again the engine of an antiquated truck was being handstarted in the compound as it coughed and sneezed and the voices chattered around it he heard more footsteps running in and out of the chalets all the servants seemed to be up wandering in and out of the rooms across the courtyard and slamming the cupboard doors when he saw someone with a torch inspecting the vegetation outside his window sanders climbed from his bed and dressed in the diningroom of the chalet he found one of the houseboys looking through the open window into the forest whats going on dr sanders asked what the devil are you doing in here wheres dr clair the houseboy pointed toward the compound dr clair with truck sir trouble in forest he go to look what sort of trouble sanders walked over to the window is the forest moving nearer no sir not moving dr clair say you sleep sir wheres mrs clair is she around no sir mrs clair busy now what do you mean dr sanders pressed i thought she was on night duty come on man what is it the houseboy hesitated his lips soundlessly forming the polite formulas which max had left him for sanderss benefit he was about to blurt something out when the sound of footsteps crossed the courtyard sanders went to the door as max clair came toward him followed by two porters max whats going onare you starting to evacuate clair stopped in front of him his mouth was clenched his chin lowered so that the sweat on his domed head shone in the torchlight edwardhave you got suzanne in there with you what sanders stepped back from the door beckoning clair inside my dear fellow shes gone where i wish we knew clair walked up to the door he glanced inside the chalet uncertain whether to take advantage of sanderss gesture she went off a couple of hours ago god only knows whereyou havent seen her not since earlier this evening sanders began to button the sleeves of his shirt come on max lets go after her ciair held up his hand not you edward i have enough problems believe me there are one or two settlements up in the hills he said unconvincingly she may have gone to visit the sickbays you stay here and keep things togetherill take the landrover and a couple of men the others can go in the truck and keep an eye on the bourbon hotel sanders began to argue with him but clair turned and strode off sanders followed him into the drive and watched him climb into the car sanders turned to the houseboy so shes gone back into the forestpoor woman the houseboy glanced at him you know sir no but im certain all the same each of us has something we cant bear to be reminded of tell the driver of the truck to wait he can give me a lift down to the hotel the houseboy held his arm you going sirto the forest of course shes there somewherethats a judgment on myself i have to acknowledge the antiquated engine of the truck had come to life its din throbbing all over the hospital as sanders climbed over the tailboard it started off and made a slow circuit of the fountain half a dozen of the native orderlies sat up behind the driver they reached the main highway five minutes later then rumbled on through the darkness towards the white hulk of the bourbon hotel the truck stopped in the weedgrown drive its searchlight playing on the forest as it swept across the crystalline trees like an immense tipping of broken glass the white prisms glittered as far away as the river half a mile to the south jumping down from the tailboard dr sanders went over to the driver none of the men had seen suzanne leave but from their careful watch over the forest they obviously all assumed that she had entered it however from the confused mкlйe around the vehicle it was equally plain that they had no intention of following suzanne when sanders pressed the driver he made some muttered reference to the white phantoms that patrolled its inner reachesglimpses perhaps of ventress and thorensen in pursuit of each other or of radek stumbling toward his lost grave five minutes later when he saw that the search party was no closer to forming itselfthe driver insisted on remaining by his searchlight and the other men had moved off to the bourbon hotel and squatted down with their cheroots among the fallen columnsdr sanders set off alone along the highway to his left the glitter of the forest threw the cold moonlight across the macadam at his feet and lit up the entrance to a small sideroad that ran toward the river sanders looked down this narrow defile that led away into the illuminated world for a moment he hesitated listening to the fading voices of the natives then he pressed his hands into his pockets and moved along the verges of the road picking his way among the glass spurs that rose more and more thickly around him in fifteen minutes he reached the river and crossed a ruined bridge that tilted down on to the frozen surface like a jeweled web its girders hung with silver the white surface of the river wound away around the frosted trees the few craft along the banks were now so heavily encrusted that they were barely recognizable their light seemed darker and more intense as if they were sealing their brilliance within themselves by this time his suit had begun to glow again in the dark the fine frost forming crystal spurs on the fabric everywhere the process of crystallization was more advanced and his shoes were enclosed within bowls of prisms mont royal was empty limping in and out of the deserted streets the white buildings looming around him like sepulchers he reached the harbor standing on the jetty he could see across the frozen surface of the river to the cataract in the distance even higher now it formed an impenetrable barrier between himself and the lost army somewhere to the south shortly before dawn he walked back through the town in the hope of finding the summer house where thorensen and his dying bride were sheltering he passed a small patch of pavement that remained clear of all growth below the broken window of one of the mine depositories handfuls of looted stones were scattered across the pavement ruby and emerald rings topaz brooches and pendants intermingled with countless smaller stones and industrial diamonds this abandoned harvest glittered coldly in the moonlight as he stood among the stones sanders noticed that the crystal outgrowths from his shoes were dissolving melting like icicles exposed to sudden heat pieces of the crust fell away and deliquesced vanishing into the air then he realized why thorensen had brought the jewels to the young woman and why she had seized on them so eagerly by some optical or electromagnetic freak the intense focus of light within the stones simultaneously produced a compression of time so that the discharge of light from the surfaces reversed the process of crystallization perhaps it was this gift of time which accounted for the eternal appeal of precious gems as well as of all baroque painting and architecture their intricate crests and cartouches occupying more than their own volume of space so seemed to contain a greater ambient time providing that unmistakable premonition of immortality sensed within st peters or the palace at nymphenburg by contrast the architecture of the twentieth century characteristically one of rectangular unornamented faзades of simple euclidean space and time was that of the new world confident of its firm footing in the future and indifferent to those pangs of mortality which haunted the mind of old europe dr sanders knelt down and filled his pockets with the stones cramming them into his shirt and cuffs he sat back against the front of the depository the semicircle of smooth pavement like a miniature patio at whose edges the crystal undergrowth glittered with the intensity of a spectral garden pressed to his cold skin the hard faces of the jewels seemed to warm him and within a few seconds he fell into an exhausted sleep he woke into brilliant sunshine in a street of temples where rainbows spangled the gilded air with a blaze of colors shielding his eyes he lay back and looked up at the rooftops their gold tiles inlaid with row upon row of colored gems like pavilions in the temple quarter of bangkok a hand pulled at his shoulder trying to sit up sanders found that the semicircle of clear pavement had vanished and his body lay sprawled in a bed of sprouting needles the growth had been most rapid in the entrance to the depository and his right arm was encased in a mass of crystalline spurs three or four inches long that reached almost to his shoulder inside this frozen gauntlet almost too heavy to lift his fingers were outlined in a maze of rainbows sanders dragged himself to his knees tearing away some of the crystals he found the bearded man in the white suit crouching behind him his shotgun in his hands ventress with a cry sanders raised his jeweled arm in the sunlight the faint nodes of the gemstones he had stuffed into his cuff shone in the effloresced tissues of his arm like inlaid stars ventress for gods sake his shout distracted ventress from his scrutiny of the lightfilled street his small face with its bright eyes was transfigured by strange colors that mottled his skin and drew out the pale blues and violets of his beard his suit radiated a thousand bands of color he knelt down beside sanders trying to replace the strip of crystals torn from his arm before he could speak there was a roar of gunfire and the glass trellis encrusted to the doorway shattered in a shower of fragments ventress flinched behind sanders then pulled himself through the window as another shot was fired down the street they ran past the looted counters into a strong room where the door of a safe stood open on to a jumble of metal cash boxes ventress snapped back the lids on the empty trays and then began to scoop together the few small jewels scattered across the floor stuffing them into sanderss empty pockets he pulled him through a window into the rear alley and from there into the adjacent street transformed by the overhead lattices into a tunnel of vermilion light they stopped at the first turning and ventress beckoned to the forest fifty yards away run run anywhere through the forest its all you can do he pushed sanders forward with the butt of his shotgun whose breech was now encrusted by a mass of silver crystals like a medieval flintlock sanders raised his arm the jeweled spurs danced in the sunlight like a swarm of fireflies my arm ventress its reached my shoulder run nothing else can help you ventresss illuminated face flickered with anger almost as if he were impatient of sanderss refusal to accept the forest dont waste the stones they wont last you forever forcing himself to run sanders set off toward the forest where he entered the first of the caves of light he whirled his arm like a clumsy propeller and felt the crystals recede slightly with luck he soon reached a small tributary of the river that wound in from the harbor and hurled himself like a wild man along its petrified surface for hours he raced through the forest all sense of time lost to him if he stopped for more than a minute the crystal bands would seize his neck and shoulder and he forced himself on only pausing to slump exhausted on the glass beaches then he pressed the jewels to his face warding off the glacй sheath but their power faded and as the facets blunted they turned into nodes of unpolished silica meanwhile those embedded within the crystal tissues of his arm shone with undiminished brilliance at last as he ran through the trees at the edge of the river his arm whirling before him he saw the gilt spire of the summer house stumbling across the fused sand he made his way toward it by now the vitrification of the forest had sealed the small pavilion into the surrounding trees and only the steps and the doorway above remained clear but for sanders it still held a faint hope of sanctuary the casements and jointing of the balcony were ornamented with the heraldic devices of some bizarre baroque architecture sanders stopped a few yards from the steps and looked up at the sealed door he turned and gazed back across the widening channel of the river its jeweled surface glowed in the sunlight marbled like the pink crust of a salt lake two hundred yards away thorensens motorcruiser still sat in its pool of clear water at the confluence of the subterranean streams as he watched two men moved about on the foredeck of the cruiser they were partly hidden by the starting cannon in front of the mast but one of them bands of surgical tape dividing his naked body into black and white halves sanders recognized as kagwa thorensens assistant sanders walked a few steps toward the cruiser debating whether to reach the edge of the petrified surface and swim across the pooi although the crystals might begin to dissolve in the water he feared that the weight of his arm would first sink him to the bottom there was a flash of light from the muzzle of the cannon a moment later as the ground shifted slightly sanders caught a glimpse of a threeinch ball crossing the air toward him with a sharp whistle it passed over his head and crashed into the petrified trees twenty yards from the summer house then the loud boom of the explosion reached him from the cruiser reflected off the hard surface of the river the echoes rolled around the walls of the forest drumming at sanderss head uncertain which way to move he ran toward a patch of undergrowth near the steps of the summer house kneeling down he tried to conceal his arm among the crystalline fronds the two natives on board the cruiser were reloading the cannon the big mulatto down on one knee as he worked the ramrod in and out of the barrel sanders the low voice little more than a harsh whisper came from a few yards on sanderss left he looked around peering up at the sealed door of the summer house then below the steps a hand reached out and waved at him here under the house sanders ran over to the steps in the narrow hollow below the platform of the summer house ventress was crouching behind one of the stilts shotgun in hand get down before they take another shot at you as sanders slid backwards through the small interval ventress seized one shoe and hauled him in twisting his foot with an irritable flourish lie down by god sanders you take your chances his mottled face pressed toward sanders as he lay against the side of the hollow then ventress looked out again at the river and the distant cruiser his flintlock lay in front of him its ornamented barrel following every movement as the light outside varied its patterns sanders gazed around the hollow wondering if thorensen had taken serena with him and abandoned the summer house hoping to trap ventress there or whether the latter had reached the pavilion first after the attack that morning in the streets of mont royal the wooden boards over their heads had vitrified into a rocklike glass but the outlines of a trapdoor could still be seen in the center on the ground below a steel bayonet lay among a few shards laboriously chipped from the edges of the trapdoor ventress pointed curtly to the trapdoor you can have a go in a moment its damned hard work sanders sat forward lifting his arm he turned over so that he could see across the river serenayour wifeis she still here ventress looked up at the beams over their heads ill be with her soon its been a long search checking himself he peered along his barrel examining the sprays of frozen grass that skirted the banks before he spoke again so you saw her sanders only for a minute i told thorensen to get her out of here leaving his gun ventress scrambled across to sanders kneeling in the hollow like a luminous mole he peered into sanderss eyes sanders tell mei havent seen her yet my god he drummed on the wooden beams sending a dead echo through the platform shesall right sanders said most of the time shes asleep how did you get here his mind elsewhere ventress stared at him then he crawled back to his shotgun he beckoned sanders forward he pointed to the bank fifty feet away lying face upwards among the grass the spurs of frost from his crystallizing body merging him into the undergrowth was one of thorensens men poor thorensen ventress murmured one by one theyre leaving him hell be alone soon sanders there was another flash from the cannon on board the cruiser the craft backed slightly in the water and the steel ball arched through the air striking the trees a hundred yards from the summer house as the boom of the explosion drummed around the river shaking the rails of the balcony sanders noticed the light driven from his arm in a series of soft pulses the surface of the river shifted and settled itself blades of carmine light lancing into the air kagwa and the mulatto knelt down by the cannon again and began to reload it sanders said bad shooting but serenaif shes here why are they trying to hit the summer house theyre not my dear fellow ventress was watching the undergrowth along the banks as if taking no chances that thorensen might not try to steal up on the summer house during the distractions of the artillery display after a moment apparently satisfied he relaxed he has other plans for his big gun his idea is to loosen the river with the noisethen he can bring his boat right up to the summer house and blast me out of here sure enough during the next hour a series of dull explosions punctuated the still air the two negroes worked away at the cannon and at intervals of five minutes or so there was a brief flash and one of the steel balls flew across the river as they rebounded off the bank and trees the echoes of the reports struck vivid red lanes through the petrified surface each time sanderss jeweled arm and ventresss suit shed rainbows of light around them what are you doing here sanders ventress asked during one of the lulls there were no signs of thorensen and kagwa and the mulatto worked without supervision ventress had crawled back to the trapdoor and was chipping away with the bayonet now and then pausing to press his head to the platform and listen for any sounds above i thought youd got out the wife of a colleague of mine at isabellesuzanne clairran off into the forest last night it was partly my fault sanders looked down at the crystal sheath on his arm no longer having to carry its great weight around he found that he was less frightened of its monstrous appearance although the crystalline tissues were as cold as ice and no movement of his hand or fingers was possible the nerves and sinews seemed to have taken on a new life of their own glowing like the hard compacted light they emitted only along the forearm where he had torn away the strip of crystals was there any marked sensation but even here it was less one of pain than a feeling of warmth as the crystals annealed themselves another explosion boomed across the river ventress threw the bayonet away he scuttled back to his place near the steps sanders watched the cruiser it still remained at its mooring in the mouth of the creek but kagwa and the mulatto had left the cannon and gone below evidently the last round had been fired ventress pointed with a bony finger at the small trail of exhaust from the stern the cruiser began to swing round as it turned and the cabin windows altered their angle they could both see a tall blondhaired man behind the wheel thorensen ventress crept forward his small body crouching with knees pressed against his chest sanders picked up the bayonet in his left hand the cruiser was moving astern the smoke of the exhaust drifting along its hull it stopped and straightened out full ahead the cruiser surged forward its bows lifting through the placid water an interval of fifty yards separated it from the nearest edge of the petrified crust as it changed course selecting one of the faults exposed by the bombardment sanders remembered thorensen testing the lanes through the collapsing surface when ventress had escaped from the mulatto moving at twenty knots the cruiser bore down on the edge of the pool then drove through the thin crystals like an icebreaker scattering surface ice out of its path within thirty yards its speed fell off a few huge floes piled up across its bows and the cruiser slewed sideways and came to a stop there was a flurry of activity on the bridge as the men inside wrestled with the controls and ventress leveled his gun at the cabin windows three hundred feet away the cruiser was well out of range around it immense faults had appeared in the surface of the river the vivid carmine light bled off into the surrounding ice the trees along the bank were still shaking with the impact shedding the light from their boughs like liquid blossoms after a pause the cruiser backed off a few feet then retraced its path down the lane fifty yards back in the entrance to the pool it stopped and aligned its bows as it drove forward again lifting on the exposed water ventress reached into his jacket from the shoulder holster he drew out the automatic pistol sanders had smuggled through the customs take it ventress leveled his shotgun at the approaching cruiser shouting at sanders across the breech watch the bank on your side ill look out for thorensen this time the smooth advance of the cruiser was checked more abruptly hitting the heavier floes it scattered half a dozen of the giant crystal blocks across the surface then rammed to a half with a fifteendegree list its engine racing the men on board were flung to the floor of the cabin and it was several minutes before the cruiser righted itself and made a slow reverse passage down the channel the next time it approached more slowly its bows first loosening the surface then driving the crystal blocks out of their way sanders crouched behind one of the wooden stilts waiting for the mulatto to fire the cannon before the cruiser came within close range of ventress it was now only seventyfive yards from the summer house its bridge high in the air above them ventress however seemed composed watching the banks for any surprise attack the ground shook beneath the summer house as the cruiser drove again and again into the crystal pack the smoke of its exhaust hung around them fouling the crisp air each time it came a few yards closer its bows splintering into white spars already the cruiser had been enveloped by a fine frost and the mulatto knocked out the crystallizing windows of the cabin with a rifle butt the deck rails were hung with fine spurs ventress maneuvered about trying to get a shot in at the men in the cabin but their heads were hidden behind the broken panes jerked up on to the surface the blocks of damp crystals were scattered out of the cruisers way and the first pieces skated across to the steps of the summer house sanders ventress halfstood his face and chest exposed theyre landlocked thirty yards away its shattered bows rooted in a fault between two floes the cruiser was heaving from side to side its engine roared and faded then whined and fell silent immobile the cruiser sat in front of them the fine frost already transforming it into a bizarre wedding cake once or twice it rocked slightly as if an oar or a grappling line was being worked from a stern porthole ventress kept his shotgun leveled at the cabin ten feet away on his right sanders held the automatic pistol in one hand his other arm on the ground beside him glowing in its own crystal life together they waited for thorensen to make a move for half an hour the cruiser was silent the frost thickening on its decks spiral crests formed around the windows of the cabin and ornamented the deck rails and portholes the shattered bows bristled like the tusks of a frozen whale below the bridge the cannon was transformed into a medieval firing piece its breech embellished with exquisite horns and crests the afternoon light was fading sanders watched the bank on his right where the vivid colors had become more somber as the sun sank behind the trees into the west then among the white sprays of grass he saw a long silverbodied creature shuffling along the bank ventress crouched beside him peering through the dim light they watched the jeweled snout and hooked forelegs in their crystal armor the crocodile sidled slowly on its stomach in its ancient reptilian motion fully fifteen feet long it seemed to propel itself more with its tail than by its legs the left foreleg hung in the air frozen within the crystal armour as it moved the light poured from the glacй eyes and from the halfopened mouth choked with jewels it stopped as if sensing the two men under the summer house and then slid forward five feet away it stopped for a second time jaws working weakly its body crushing the grass in its path feeling a remote sympathy for this monster in its armor of light unable to understand its own transfiguration sanders watched the blank eyes above the opening mouth then as the jeweled teeth glittered at him sanders realized that he was looking into a gun barrel cutting off an involuntary shout sanders lowered his head then moved a few feet away from the pillar as he raised his head he saw the mouth of the crocodile open the gun barrel came forward below the upper row of teeth and then fired once at the shadow of the wooden pillar in the roar of the gun flame sanders steadied the automatic pistol on the notched surface of his crystal arm and fired at the crocodiles head it twisted sideways the barrel searching for him inside the jeweled skin sanders could see a mans elbows and knees on the ground sanders fired again at the thorax and abdomen of the carapace with a galvanic heave the huge beast rose into the air on its hind legs and hovered there like a jeweled saurian then it fell over on to its side exposing the open slit from the lower jaw to the abdomen strapped inside the body of the mulatto lay face up in the dusk his black skin illuminated by the crystal ship moored like a ghost behind him feet raced along the opposite bank with a shout ventress rose on his knees and fired the shotgun there was a shrill cry and the halfbandaged figure of kagwa fell among the sprays of grass ten yards from the summer house he rose to his feet and stumbled past the house no longer aware of what he was doing for a moment the last daylight on his dark skin made him seem almost as white as the small figure of ventress the second shot caught him in the chest knocking him away across the bank he lay on his face in the edge of the shadows sanders waited in the hollow as ventress reloaded his shotgun he scuttled about peering at the two bodies for a few minutes there was silence and then he touched sanders on the shoulder with the shotgun right doctor sanders looked up at his expressionless face what do you mean its time for you to go doctor thorensen and i are alone now as sanders climbed to his feet hesitating to expose himself ventress said thorensen will understand get out of the forest sanders you arent ready to come here yet as he spoke ventresss suit was covered with the jeweled scales of the crystals that had formed there so sanders took his leave of ventress outside the white ship had begun to merge into the torn surface of the river as he walked away from the summer house along the bank leaving behind the three dead men one still in his crocodile skin sanders saw nothing of thorensen a hundred yards from the house where the river turned he looked back but ventress was hidden below his platform above him the faint light of a lantern shone in the glazed windows at last late that afternoon when the deepening ruby light of dusk settled through the forest sanders entered a small clearing where the deep sounds of an organ reverberated among the trees in the center was a small church its slim spire fused to the branches of the surrounding trees by the crystal tracery raising his jeweled arm to light the oaken doors sanders drove them back and entered the nave above him refracted by the stainedglass windows a brilliant glow of light poured down upon the altar listening to the organ sanders leaned against the altar rail and extended his arm to the gold cross set with rubies and emeralds immediately the sheath slipped and began to dissolve like a melting sleeve of ice as the crystals deliquesced the light poured from his arm like an overflowing fountain turning his head to watch dr sanders father batthus sat at the organ his thin fingers drawing from the pipes their unbroken music which soared away through the stained panels of the windows to the distant dismembered sun saraband for lepers for the next three days sanders remained with balthus as the last crystal spurs dissolved from the tissues of his arm all day he knelt beside the organ working the footbellows with his jeweled arm as the crystals dissolved the wound he had torn in his arm ran with blood again washing the pale prisms of his exposed tissues at dusk when the sun sank in a thousand fragments into the western night father balthus would leave the organ and stand out on the porch looking up at the spectral trees his slim scholars face and calm eyes their composure belied by the nervous movements of his hands like the false calm of someone recovering from an attack of fever would gaze at sanders as they ate their small supper on a footstool beside the altar sheltered from the embalming air by the jewels in the cross this emblem had been the joint gift of the mining companies and the immense span of the crosspiece at least five or six feet carried its freight of precious stones like the boughs of the crystallized trees in the forest the rows of emeralds and rubies between which the smaller diamonds of mont royal traced starlike patterns ran from one end of the crosspiece to the other the jewels emitted a hard continuous light so intense that the stones seemed fused together into a cruciform specter at first sanders thought that balthus regarded his survival as an example of the almightys intervention and made some token expression of gratitude at this balthus smiled ambiguously why he had returned to the church sanders could only guess by now it was surrounded on all sides by the crystal trellises as if overtopped by the mouth of an immense glacier from the door of the chancel sanders could see the outbuildings of the native school and dormitory that max clair had described presumably the home of the tribe of lepers abandoned by their priest sanders mentioned his meeting with the lepers but balthus seemed uninterested in his former parishioners or their present fate even sanderss presence barely impinged upon his isolation preoccupied with himself he sat for hours at the organ or wandered among the empty pews one morning however balthus found a blind python searching at the door of the porch its eyes had been transformed into enormous jewels that rose from its forehead like crowns balthus knelt down and picked up the snake then entwined its long body around his arms he carried it down the aisle to the altar and lifted it up to the cross he watched it with a wry smile when its sight returned it slid away among the pews on the third day sanders woke to the early morning light and found balthus alone celebrating the eucharist lying on the pew pulled up to the altar rail sanders watched him without moving but the priest stopped and walked away stripping off his vestments over breakfast he confided you probably wonder what i was doing but it seemed a convenient moment to test the validity of the sacrament he gestured at the prismatic colors pouring through the stainedglass windows the original scriptural scenes had been transformed into paintings of bewildering abstract beauty in which the dismembered fragments of the faces of joseph and jesus mary and the disciples floated on the liquid ultramarine of the refracted sky it may sound heretical to say so but the body of christ is with us everywhere here he touched the thin shell of crystals on sanderss arm in each prism and rainbow in the ten thousand faces of the sun he raised his thin hands jeweled by the light so you see i fear that the church like its symbolhere he pointed to the crossmay have outlived its function sanders searched for an answer im sorry perhaps if you left here no balthus insisted annoyed by sanderss obtuseness cant you understand once i was a true apostatei knew god existed but could not believe in him he laughed bitterly at himself now events have overtaken me for a priest there is no greater crisis to deny god when he can be seen to exist in every leaf and flower with a gesture he led sanders down the nave to the open porch he pointed up to the domeshaped lattice of crystal beams that reached from the rim of the forest like the buttresses of an immense cupola of diamond and glass embedded at various points were the almost motionless forms of birds with outstretched wings golden orioles and scarlet macaws shedding brilliant pools of light the bands of color moved through the forest the reflections of the melting plumage enveloping them in endless concentric patterns the overlapping arcs hung in the air like the votive windows of a city of cathedrals everywhere around them sanders could see countless smaller birds butterflies and insects joining their cruciform haloes to the coronation of the forest father balthus took sanderss arm in this forest we see the final celebration of the eucharist of christs body here everything is transfigured and illuminated joined together in the last marriage of space and time toward the end as they stood side by side with their backs to the altar his conviction seemed to fail him as the deep frost penetrated the church the aisle transformed itself into an occluding tunnel of glass pillars with an expression almost of panic balthus watched the keys of the organ manual sealing themselves together as they merged into one another and sanders knew that he was searching for some means of escape then at last he rallied he seized the cross from the altar and wrenched it from its stand with a sudden anger born of absolute conviction he pressed the cross into sanderss arms he dragged sanders to the porch and propelled him to one of the narrowing vaults through which they could see the distant surface of the river go get away from here find the river when sanders hesitated trying to control the heavy scepter with his bandaged arm balthus shouted fiercely tell them i ordered you to take it sanders last saw him standing arms outstretched to the approaching walls in the posture of the illuminated birds his eyes filled with relief at the first circles of light conjured from his upraised palms the crystallization of the forest was now almost complete only the jewels in the cross allowed sanders to make his way through the vaults between the trees holding the shaft in his hands he moved the crosspiece along the trellises that hung everywhere like webs of ice looking for the weaker panels that would dissolve in the light as they slid to the ground at his feet he stepped through the openings pulling the cross with him when he reached the river he searched for the bridge he had found when he entered the forest for the second time but the prismatic surface extended away in a wide bend its light obliterating the few landmarks he might otherwise have recognized above the banks the foliage glowed like painted snow the only movement coming from the slow traverse of the sun here and there a soft blur below the bank revealed itself as the illuminated specter of a lighter or river launch but nothing else seemed to retain any trace of its previous identity sanders followed the bank avoiding the faults in the surface and the waisthigh needles that grew together on the upper slopes he came to the mouth of a small stream and began to walk along it too tired to climb over the cataracts in its path although his three days with father balthus had rested him sufficiently to realize that some way still remained out of the forest the absolute silence of the vegetation along the banks and the deep prismatic glow almost convinced him that the entire earth had been transformed and that any progress through this crystal world had become pointless at this time however he discovered that he was no longer alone in the forest whenever the overhead canopy of trees gave way to the open sky along the bed of the stream or in the small clearings he passed the halfcrystallized bodies of men and women fused against the trunks of the trees looking up at the refracted sun most of them were elderly couples seated together with their bodies fusing into one another as they merged with the trees and the jeweled undergrowth the only young man he passed was a soldier in field uniform sitting on a fallen trunk by the edge of the stream his helmet had blossomed into an immense carapace of crystals a solar umbrella that enclosed his face and shoulders below the soldier the surface of the stream was traversed by a deep fault at its bottom a narrow channel of water still flowed washing the submerged legs of three soldiers who had set out to ford the stream at this point and were now embalmed in its crystal walls now and then their legs stirred in a slow liquid way as if the men roped together around their waists were forever marching through this glacier of crystals their faces lost in the blur of light around them there was a distant movement through the forest and the sound of voices sanders hurried on clasping the heavy cross to his chest fifty yards away in a clearing between two groves of trees a troupe of people dressed like harlequins were moving through the forest dancing and shouting to one another sanders caught up with them and stopped at the edge of the clearing trying to count the scores of darkskinned men and women of all ages some of them with small children who were taking part in this graceful saraband they were wandering in a loose procession small groups breaking away to dance around single trees or bushes there were well over a hundred of them passing through the forest with no evident route in mind their arms and faces were transformed by the crystal growth and already their drab loincloths and robes were beginning to frost and jewel as sanders stood by his cross a small party came over to him in a series of leaps and jumps then gamboled around him like newly admitted entrants to paradise serenading an attendant archangel an old man with a deformed lightfilled face passed sanders gesturing at his fingerless hands as the jeweled light poured from his stunted joints sanders remembered the lepers seated beneath the trees near the mission hospital during the previous days the whole tribe had entered the forest they danced away from him on their crippled legs holding their children by the hands grotesque rainbows dazzling their faces as the lepers moved off sanders followed behind them dragging the cross in both hands through the trees he saw the train of the procession but they seemed to vanish as quickly as they appeared as if eager to familiarize themselves with every tree and grove in their newfound paradise however for no reason the entire troupe then turned and came round again as if delighted to take a last look at sanders and his cross as they went by sanders caught a glimpse of a tall darkrobed woman at their head calling to the others in a clear voice her pale arms and face already shone with the crystal light of the forest she turned to look back and sanders shouted over the bobbing heads suzanne suzanne here but the woman and the remainder of the troupe had scattered again among the trees hobbling along sanders found the last remnants of their meager baggage lying on the groundrag shoes and broken baskets begging bowls with their few grains of rice already half fused to the vitrified ground once sanders came across the halfcrystallized body of a small child who had fallen behind and been unable to keep up with the others lying down to rest it had become fused to the ground sanders listened to the voices fading away among the trees the childs parents somewhere among them then he lowered the cross over the child and waited as the crystals deliquesced from its arms and legs freed again the childs deformed hands clasped the air with a start it clambered to its feet and ran off through the trees the dissolving light pouring from its head and shoulders sanders was still following the procession lost far away in the distance when he reached the summer house where thorensen and serena ventress had first taken refuge it was now dusk and the jewels of the cross shone faintly in the failing light already the cross had lost much of its power and most of the smaller diamonds and rubies had faded to blunted nodes of carbon and corundum only the large emeralds still burned strongly against the white hulk of thorensens cruiser trapped in its fault in front of the summer house sanders walked along the bank past the crystal remains of the mulatto in his crocodile skin the two had become merged the man himself halfwhite and halfblack fusing with the dark jeweled beast their own outlines were still visible as they effloresced through each others tissues the face of the mulatto shone through the superimposed jaws and eyes of the great crocodile the door of the summer house was open sanders climbed the steps and walked into the chamber he looked down at the bed in whose frosted depths like swimmers asleep on the bottom of an enchanted pool serena and the mineowner lay together thorensens eyes were closed and the delicate petals of a blood red rose blossomed from the hole in his breast like an exquisite marine plant beside him serena slept quietly the unseen motion of her heart sheathing her body in a faint amber glow the palest residue of life although thorensen had died trying to save her she lived on in her own halfdeath something glittered in the dusk behind sanders he turned to see a brilliant chimera a man with incandescent arms and chest race past among the trees a cascade of particles diffusing in the air behind him he flinched back behind the cross but the man had vanished whirling himself away among the crystal vaults as his luminous wake faded sanders heard his voice echoing across the frosted air the plaintive words jeweled and ornamented like everything else in that transmogrified world serena serena the prismatic sun two months later as he completed his letter to dr paul derain director of the leper hospital at fort isabelle in the quiet of his hotel bedroom at port matarre sanders wrote it seems hard to believe paul here in this empty hotel that the strange events of that phantasmagoric forest ever occurred yet in fact i am little more than forty miles as the crow flies from the focal area ten miles to the south of mont royal and if i need any reminder there is the barely healed wound on my arm according to the bartender downstairsim glad to say that he at least is still at his post the forest is now advancing at the rate of some four hundred yards each day one of the visiting journalists talking to louise claims that at this rate of progress at least a third of the earths surface will be affected by the end of the next decade and a score of the worlds capital cities petrified beneath layers of prismatic crystal as miami has already beenno doubt you have seen reports of the abandoned resort as a city of a thousand cathedral spires a vision materialized from st john the divine to tell the truth however the prospect causes me little worry as i have said paul its obvious to me now that its origins are more than physical when i stumbled out of the forest into an army cordon five miles from mont royal two days after seeing the helpless phantom that had once been ventress the gold cross clutched in my arms i was determined never to visit the forest again by one of those ludicrous inversions of logic i found myself far from acclaimed as a hero standing summary trial before a military court and charged with looting the gold cross had apparently been stripped of its jewelsthe generous benefaction of the mining companiesand in vain did i protest that these vanished stones had been the price of my survival only the intercession of max clair and louise peret saved me at our suggestion a patrol of soldiers equipped with jeweled crosses entered the forest in an attempt to find suzanne and ventress but they were forced to retreat whatever my feelings at the time however i know now that i shall one day return to the forest at mont royal each night the fractured disc of the echo satellite passes overhead illuminating the midnight sky like a silver chandelier and i am convinced paul that the sun itself has begun to effloresce at sunset when its disc is veiled by the crimson dust it seems to be crossed by a distinctive latticework a vast portcullis that will one day spread outwards to the planets and the stars halting them in their courses as the example of that brave apostate priest who gave the cross to me illustrates there is an immense reward to be found in that frozen forest there the transfiguration of all living and inanimate forms occurs before our eyes the gift of immortality a direct consequence of the surrender by each of us of our own physical and temporal identities however apostate we may be in this world there perforce we become apostles of the prismatic sun so when my recovery is complete i shall return to mont royal with one of the scientific expeditions passing through here it should not be too difficult to arrange my escape and then i shall return to the solitary church in that enchanted world where by day fantastic birds fly through the petrified forest and jeweled crocodiles glitter like heraldic salamanders on the banks of the crystalline rivers and where by night the illuminated man races among the trees his arms like golden cartwheels and his head like a spectral crown putting down his pen as louise peret entered the room dr sanders folded the letter and placed it in an old envelope from derain in which he had written asking for sanderss plans louise came over to the desk by the window and put her hand on sanderss shoulder she wore a clean white dress that emphasized the drabness of the rest of port matarredespite the transformation of the forest only a few miles away here at the mouth of the river the vegetation still retained its somber appearance although the motes of light that flickered within the foliage marked the crystallization soon to come are you still writing to derain she asked its a long letter theres a lot to say sanders sat back clasping her hand as he looked out at the deserted arcade below a few military landing craft were moored against the police jetty and beyond them the dark river swept away into the interior the main military base was now at one of the large government plantations ten miles upriver here an airfield had been constructed and the many hundreds of scientists and technicians not to mention journalists still trying to gain some understanding of the advancing forest were flown in directly so bypassing port matarre once again the riverside town was half deserted the native market had closed down the stall holders with their crystallized ornaments had been put out of business by the forests own overabundant economy however now and then during his walks around port matarre sanders would see some solitary mendicant hanging around near the barracks or police prefecture an old blanket in his basket hiding some grotesque offering of the foresta crystallized parrot or rivercarp and once the head and thorax of a baby are you resigning then louise asked i think you should reconsiderweve talked my dear one cant reconsider things to a hundred places of decimals somewhere ones got to make a decision sanders took the letter from his pocket and tossed it on to the desk not to hurt louise who had stayed with him in the hotel since his rescue he said actually i havent made up my mind yet im just using the letter to work the whole thing out louise nodded looking down at him sanders noticed that she had begun to wear her sunglasses again unconsciously revealing her own private decision about sanders and his future and their own inevitable separation however minor dishonesties such as this were merely the price of their own tolerance of one another have the police any news about anderson sanders asked during their first month in port matarre louise had gone down to the prefecture every morning in the hope of getting some news about her lost colleague partly sanders guessed to justify her extended stay with him in the hotel that she could now dispense with this small squaring of her conscience meant that she had made other arrangements they might have heard somethingyou never know you havent been down no hardly anyone is entering the zone now louise shrugged i suppose its worth trying of course sanders stood up leaning on the injured arm and then put on his jacket how is it louise asked your arm it seems all right now sanders patted the elbow i think its healed louise its been good of you to look after me you know that louise regarded him from behind her sunglasses a brief smile not without affection touched her lips what more could i do she laughed at this and then strolled to the door i must go up to my room and change enjoy your walk sanders followed her to the door and then held her arm for a moment when she had gone he stood by the door listening to the few sounds in the almost empty hotel sitting down at the desk again he read through his letter to paul derain thinking about louise at the same time he realized that he could hardly blame her for deciding to leave him sanders had in fact forced her out not so much by his behavior at port matarre but simply by not being wholly therehis real identity still moved through the forests of mont royal during his journey downriver in the ambulance craft with louise and max clair and his subsequent convalescence at port matarre he had felt like the empty projection of a self that still wandered through the forest with the jeweled cross in his arms reanimating the lost children he passed like a deity on his day of creation louise knew nothing of this and assumed that he was searching for suzanne there was a knock on the door and max clair let himself into the room greeting sanders with a wave he put his surgical bag down on a chair since his arrival in port matarre he had been helping at the clinic run by the jesuit fathers on several occasions the latter had made an attempt to see sanders for the purpose he guessed of questioning him about father balthuss selfimmolation within the forest obviously they suspected that his real concern had not been for his parish morning to you edwardi hope im not disturbing your meditation for the day ive finished when max glanced toward the halfopen door of the bathroom sanders said louise is upstairs now whats the news today no ideai havent got time to hang around the police station were much too busy at the clinic theyre coming in from every hedge and byway what do you expecttheres a doctor there now sanders shook his head bring a doctor into a place like port matarre and you immediately create a major health problem well max glanced at sanders over his glasses unsure how serious he was being i dont know about that we certainly are busy edward as a matter of fact now that your arm is better we thoughtthe fathers principallythat you might come and give us a hand just a couple of mornings a week to start with the fathers would be grateful to you i dare say sanders looked out at the distant forest id like to help you max of course as it happens im rather busy at present but youre not youre just sitting here all day look its routine largely nothing to take your mind off higher things a few maternity cases pellagra he added quietly yesterday a couple of cases of leprosy came ini thought you might be interested sanders turned and studied maxs face with its bright shortsighted eyes below the domed head the element of guile if any in this last remark was hard to assess for some time sanders had suspected that max had known all along that suzanne would run away into the forest after seeing sanders and that his own pointless search among the hill settlements had been a deliberate means of making sure that no one stopped her during their time in port matarre max rarely referred to suzanne although his wife by now would be frozen like an icon somewhere within the crystal forest yet maxs last reference to the lepers unless intended to provoke him into returning to the forest suggested that in fact max had no idea of the significance of the forest for suzanne and sanders that for both of them the only final resolution of the imbalance within their minds their inclination toward the dark side of the equinox could be found within that crystal world two cases of leprosy im not interested in the least before max could speak sanders went on frankly max im not sure whether im still qualified to help you what of course you are in absolute terms it seems to me max that the whole profession of medicine may have been supersededi dont think the simple distinction between life and death has much meaning now rather than try to cure those patients you should put them into a launch and send them upriver to mont royal max stood up he made a gesture of helplessness and then said cheerfully ill come back tomorrow keep an eye on yourself when he had gone sanders completed his letter adding a final paragraph and farewell sealing it into a fresh envelope he addressed it to derain and propped it against the inkwell he then took out his checkbook and signed one of the checks he slipped these into a second envelope on which he wrote louises name as he stood up buttoning his jacket he noticed louise and max talking in the street outside the hotel recently he had often seen them together in the foyer of the hotel or at the door of the restaurant he waited until their conversation ended and then went down to the foyer at the desk he paid the previous weeks bills for himself and louise and settled their accounts for a further fortnight after exchanging a few pleasantries with the portuguese owner sanders went out for his usual prelunch stroll usually his walk took him down to the river he strolled through the deserted arcades noticing as he did each morning the strange contrasts between light and shadow despite the apparent absence of direct sunlight in port matarre at the corner opposite the police prefecture he flexed his injured arm for the last time against one of the pillars somewhere in the crystalline streets of mont royal were the missing fragments of himself living on in their own prismatic medium thinking of captain radek and of suzanne clair sanders reached the waterfront and walked down along the deserted jetties almost all the native boats had gone and the settlements on the other side of the river had been abandoned one craft however as usual still patrolled the empty waterfront three hundred yards away sanders could see the redandyellow speedboat in which he and louise had first made their journey to mont royal the tall figure of aragon stood at the helm letting the boat drift on the tide every morning he would watch sanders walk by but the two men never spoke to one another sanders walked toward him feeling the wallet in his jacket as he reached aragon the latter waved to him then started his motor and moved off puzzled by this sanders walked on and then saw that aragon was taking the craft downriver to the point of the bank where the crystallized body of matthieu had been cast up two months earlier sanders caught up with the boat and then walked down the bank toward it for a moment the two men regarded each other a fine boat you have there captain sanders said at last repeating the phrase he had first used to aragon half an hour later as they moved off upriver sanders leaned back in his seat when they passed the central wharves in the choppy water the spray broke unevenly the fallen rainbows carried away in the dark wake behind them in the street between the arcades an old negro was standing in the dust with a white shield in his hand waiting for the boat to go past on the police jetty louise peret stood next to max clair her eyes hidden by the sunglasses she watched sanders without waving as the boat sped on up the deserted river about the author jg ballard born in in shanghai and educated at cambridge university is widely known for his
