walt whitman frontispiece facing page anne gilchrist facsimile of a typical whitman letter facsimile of one of anne gilchrists letters to walt whitman in the text pages preface probably there are few who today question the propriety of publishing the loveletters of eminent persons a generation after the deaths of both parties to the correspondence when one recalls the published loveletters of abelard of dorothy osborne of lady hamilton of mary wollstonecraft of margaret fuller of george sand bismarck shelley victor hugo edgar allan poe and to mention only one more illustrious example of the brownings one must needs look upon this form of presenting biographical material as a wellestablished if not a valuable convention of letters as to the particular set of letters presented to the reader in this volume a word of explanation and history may be required most of these letters are from anne gilchrist to walt whitman a few are replies to her letters and a few are letters from her children to whitman mrs gilchrist died in when two years later her son herbert harlakenden gilchrist was collecting material for his interesting biography of his mother whitman was asked for the letters that she had written to him or rather for extracts from them in reply to this request the poet said i do not know that i can furnish any good reason but i feel to keep these utterances exclusively to myself but i cannot let your book go to press without at least saying and wishing it put on record that among the perfect women i have met and it has been my unspeakably good fortune to have had the very best for mother sisters and friends i have known none more perfect in every relation than my dear dear friend anne gilchrist but since whitman carefully preserved them for twenty years refusing to destroy them as he had destroyed such other written matter as he did not care to have preserved it would appear that he intended that so beautiful a tribute to the poetry that he had written no less than to the personality of the poet should be included in that complete biography which is being slowly written by many hands of americas most unique man of genius in any case when these letters came into my hands in the apportionment of whitmans literary legacy under the will which named me as one of his three literary executors there were but three things which i could honourably do with them rather on closer analysis there seemed to be but one to leave them in my will or to place them in some public repository would have been to shift a responsibility which was evidently mine to the shoulders of others who perhaps would be in possession of fewer facts in the light of which to discharge that responsibility to destroy them would be to do what whitman should have done if it was to be done at all and to erase forever one of the finest tributes that either the man or the poet ever received one of the most touching selfrevelations that a noble soul ever poured out on paper the remaining alternative was to edit and publish them after keeping them a proper length of time for the benefit not only of the general reader but as an aid to the future biographer who from the proper perspective will write the life of americas great poet and prophet in this determination my judgment has been confirmed by that of the few sympathetic friends who during the twentyfive years that the letters have been in my possession have been allowed to read them it is a matter of regret that so few of whitmans letters to mrs gilchrist are available those included in this volume sometimes in fragmentary form have been taken from loose copies found among his papers after his death or in a few instances are reprinted from herbert harlakenden gilchrists anne gilchrist or horace traubels with walt whitman in camden acknowledgment of these latter is made in each instance but though whitmans letters printed in this correspondence will not compare with mrs gilchrists in point of number enough are presented to suggest the tenor of them all as a matter of fact the first loveletter from anne gilchrist to walt whitman was in the form of an essay written in his defense called an englishwomans estimate of walt whitman for that reason this wellknown essay is reprinted in this volume and a confession of faith in reality an amplification of the estimate written several years after the publication of the latter is included the reader who desires to follow the story of this friendship in a chronological order will do well to read at least the former of these tributes before beginning the letters indebtedness is acknowledged to prof emory halloway of brooklyn new york for valuable suggestions t b h introduction undoubtedly mrs gilchrists estimate of walt whitman published in the boston radical in may was the finest as it was the first public tribute ever paid to the poet by a woman whitman himself so considered it the proudest word that ever came to me from a woman if not the proudest word of all from any source but a finer tribute was to follow in the sacred privacy of the loveletters which are now made public forty years and more after they were written the purpose of this introduction is not to interpret those letters but to sketch the story in the light of which they are to be read and since both anne gilchrist and walt whitman have had sympathetic and painstaking biographers it will not be necessary here to mention at length the already known facts of their respective lives the story naturally begins with whitman he was born at west hills long island new york on may his father was of english descent and came of a family of sailors and farmers his mother to whom he himself attributed most of his personal qualities was of excellent hollandic stock moving to brooklyn while still in frocks he there passed his boyhood and youth but took many summer trips to visit relatives in the country he early left the public school for the printing offices of local newspapers picking enough general knowledge to enable him when about seventeen years of age to teach schools in the rural districts of his native island very early in life he became a writer chiefly of short prose tales and essays which were accepted by the best new york magazines his literary and journalistic work was not confined to the metropolis but took him for a few months in so far away from home as new orleans in besides writing for and editing newspapers he was engaged in housebuilding the trade of his father although this was it is said a profitable business he gave it up to write poetry and issued his first volume leaves of grass in the book had been written with great pains according to a preconceived plan of the author to be stated in the preface and it was finally set up by his own hands for want of a publisher only as he tells us after many doings and undoings leaving out the stock poetical touches its publication was the occasion of probably the most voluminous controversy of american letters mostly abuse ridicule and condemnation in whitmans brother george who had volunteered in the union army was reported badly wounded in the fredericksburg fight walt going at once to the war front in virginia found that his brothers wound was not serious enough to require his ministrations but gradually he became engaged in nursing other wounded soldiers until this work as a volunteer hospital missionary in washington engrossed the major part of his time this continued until and for some years after the end of the war whitmans own needs were supplied by occasional literary work and from his earnings as a clerk first in the interior and later in the attorney generals department he had gone to washington a man of strong and majestic physique but his untiring devotion fidelity and vigilance in nursing the sick and wounded soldiers in the army hospitals in and about washington was soon to shatter that constitution which was ever a marvel to its possessor and to condemn him to pass the last two decades of his life in unaccustomed invalidism the history of the civil war in america presents no instance of nobler fulfilment of duty or of sublimer sacrifice meanwhile his muse was not neglected his book had gone through four editions and with the increment of the noble war poetry of drum taps had become a volume of size at a very early period leaves of grass had been hailed as an important literary contribution by a few of the best thinkers in this country and in england but generally speaking nearly all literary persons received it with much criticism and many qualifications in washington devoted disciples like william douglas oconnor and john burroughs never varied in their uncompromising adherence to the book and its author this appreciation only by the few was likewise encountered in england the book had made a stir among the literary classes but its importance was not at all generally recognized men like john addington symonds edward dowden and william michael rossetti were however almost unrestricted in their praise it was william rossetti who planned in to bring out in england a volume of selections from whitmans poetry in the belief that it was better to leave out the poems that had provoked such adverse criticism in order to get whitman a foothold among those who might prefer to have an expurgated edition whitmans attitude toward the plan at the time is given in a letter which he wrote to rossetti on december i cannot and will not consent of my own volition to countenance an expurgated edition of my pieces i have steadily refused to do so under seductive offers here in my own country and must not do so in another country it appeared however that rossetti had already advanced his project and whitman graciously added if before the arrival of this letter you have practically invested in and accomplished or partially accomplished any plan even contrary to this letter i do not expect you to abandon it at loss of outlay but shall bona fide consider you blameless if you let it go on and be carried out as you may have arranged it is the question of the authorization of an expurgated edition proceeding from me that deepest engages me the facts of the different ways one way or another way in which the book may appear in england out of influences not under the shelter of my umbrage are of much less importance to me after making the foregoing explanation i shall i think accept kindly whatever happens for i feel indeed know that i am in the hands of a friend and that my pieces will receive that truest brightest of light and perception coming from love in that all other and lesser requisites become pale the rossetti selections duly appeared with what momentous influence upon the two persons whose friendship we are tracing will presently be shown on june anne gilchrist writing to rossetti said i was calling on madox brown a fortnight ago and he put into my hands your edition of walt whitmans poems i shall not cease to thank him for that since i have had it i can read no other book it holds me entirely spellbound and i go through it again and again with deepening delight and wonder how can one refrain from expressing gratitude to you for what you have so admirably done to this rossetti promptly responded your letter has given me keen pleasure this morning that glorious man whitman will one day be known as one of the greatest sons of earth a few steps below shakespeare on the throne of immortality what a tearingaway of the obscuring veil of use and wont from the visage of man and of life i am doing myself the pleasure of at once ordering a copy of the selections for you which you will be so kind as to accept genuine i e enthusiastic appreciators are not so common and must be cultivated when they appear anybody who values whitman as you do ought to read the whole of him at a later date rossetti gave mrs gilchrist a copy of the complete leaves of grass in acknowledging which she said the gift of yours i have not any words to tell you how priceless it will be to me this lengthy letter was later at rossettis solicitation worked over for publication as the estimate of walt whitman to which reference has already been made anne gilchrist was primarily a woman of letters though her natural bent was toward science and philosophy her marriage threw her into association with artists and writers of belles lettres she was born in london on february she came of excellent ancestry and received a good education particularly in music she had a profoundly religious nature although it appears that she was never a believer in many of the orthodox christian doctrines very early in life she recognized the greatness of such men as emerson and comte in at the age of twentythree she married alexander gilchrist two months her junior though of limited means he possessed literary ability and was then preparing for the bar his early writings secured for him the friendship of carlyle who for years lived next door to the gilchrists in cheyne row this friendship led to others and the gilchrists were soon introduced into that supreme literary circle which included ruskin herbert spencer george eliot the rossettis tennyson and many another great mind of that illustrious age within ten years of their marriage the gilchrists had four children in whom they were very happy but in the year when anne was thirtythree years of age her husband died it was a terrible blow but she faced the future unflinchingly and reared her children giving to each of them a profession at the time of her husbands death his life of william blake was nearing completion with the assistance of william and gabriel rossetti mrs gilchrist finished the work on this excellent biography and it was published by macmillan whitman has paid a fitting tribute to the pluck exhibited in this achievement do you know much of blake said whitman to horace traubel who records the conversation in his remarkable book with walt whitman in camden you know this is mrs gilchrists book the book she completed they had made up their minds to do the work her husband had it well under way he caught a fever and was carried off mrs gilchrist was left with four young children alone her perplexities were great have you noticed that the time to look for the best things in best people is the moment of their greatest need look at lincoln he is our proudest example he proved to be big as bigger than any emergency his grasp was a giants grasp made dark things light made hard things easy mrs gilchrist belonged to the same noble breed seized the reins was competent her head was clear her hand was firm the circumstances under which she first read whitmans poetry have been narrated when in whitman became aware of the rossetti correspondence he felt greatly honoured and through rossetti he sent his portrait to the as yet anonymous lady in acknowledging this communication his english friend has a grateful word from the lady to return i gave your letter and the second copy of your portrait to the lady you refer to and need scarcely say how truly delighted she was she has asked me to say that you could not have devised for her a more welcome pleasure and that she feels grateful to me for having sent to america the extracts from what she had written since they have been a satisfaction to you early in the estimate appeared in the radical still more than a year before mrs gilchrist addressed her first letter to whitman he welcomed the essay and its author as a new and peculiarly powerful champion of leaves of grass to rossetti he wrote i am deeply touched by these sympathies and convictions coming from a woman and from england and am sure that if the lady knew how much comfort it has been to me to get them she would not only pardon you for transmitting them but approve that action i realize indeed of this smiling and emphatic well done from the heart and conscience of a true wife and mother and one too whose sense of the poetic as i glean from your letter after flowing through the heart and conscience must also move through and satisfy science as much as the esthetic that i had hitherto received no eulogium so magnificent concerning this experience whitman said to horace traubel at a much later period you can imagine what such a thing as her estimate meant to me at that time almost everybody was against me the papers the preachers the literary gentlemen nearly everybody with only here and there a dissenting voice when it looked on the surface as if my enterprise was bound to fail then this wonderful woman such things stagger a man i had got so used to being ignored or denounced that the appearance of a friend was always accompanied with a sort of shock there are shocks that knock you up shocks that knock you down mrs gilchrist never wavered from her first decision i have that sort of feeling about her which cannot easily be spoken of love strong personal love too reverence respect you see it wont go into words all the words are weak and formal speaking again of her first criticism of his work he said i remember well how one of my noblest best friends one of my wisest cutest profoundest most candid critics how mrs gilchrist even to the last insisted that leaves of grass was not the mouthpiece of parlours refinements no but the language of strength power passion intensity absorption sincerity he claimed a closer relationship to her than he allowed to rossetti rossetti mentions mrs gilchrist well he had a right to almost as much right as i had a sort of brothers right she was his friend she was more than my friend i feel like hamlet when he said forty thousand brothers could not feel what he felt for ophelia after all we were a family a happy family the few of us who got together going with love the same way we were a happy family the crowd was on the other side but we were on our side we a few of us just a few and despite our paucity of numbers we made ourselves tell for the good cause from these expressions it is quite clear that whitmans attitude toward mrs gilchrist was at first that of the unpopular prophet who finds a worthy and welcome disciple in an unexpected place and that he should have so felt was but natural for she had been drawn to him as she confided to him in one of her letters by what he had written rather than and not by her knowledge of the man there can be no doubt however that on mrs gilchrists part something more than the friendship of her newfound liberator was desired when she read the leaves of grass she was fortyone years of age in the full vigour of womanhood to her the reading meant a new birth causing her to pour out her soul to the prophet and poet across the seas with a freedom and abandon that were phenomenal this was in the first letter printed in this volume under date of september and about the time that whitman had sent to his new supporter a copy of his poems perhaps the strongest reason why whitman did not reply to passion with passion lies in the fact that his heart was so far as attachments of that sort were concerned already bestowed elsewhere i am indebted to professor holloway for the information that whitman was in the unfortunate lover of a certain lady whose previous marriage to another while it did not dim their mutual devotion did serve to keep them apart to her whitman wrote that heartwrung lyric of separation out of the rolling ocean the crowd this suggests that there was probably a double tragedy so ironical is the fate of the affections anne gilchrist and walt whitman both passionately yearning for personal love yet unable to quench the one desire in the other but if there could not be between them the love which leads to marriage there could be a noble and tender and lifelong friendship over this whitmans loss of his magnificent health to be followed by an invalidism of twenty years had no power in whitman was stricken with paralysis which rendered him so helpless that he had to give up his work and finally his position and to go to live for the rest of his life in camden new jersey mrs gilchrists affection for him did not waver when this trial was made of it indeed his illness had the effect as these letters show of quickening the desire which she had had for several years since of coming to live in america that she might be near him to lighten his burdens and if she could not hope to cherish him as a wife that she might at least care for him as a mother whitman it will be noted strongly advised against this plan just why he wished to keep her away from america is unclear possibly because he dared not put so idealistic a friendship and discipleship to the test of personal acquaintance with a prematurely broken old man nevertheless on august mrs gilchrist set sail with three of her children for philadelphia they arrived in september from that date until the spring of the gilchrists kept house at north twentysecond street philadelphia where whitman was a frequent and regular visitor it is interesting to note that mrs gilchrists appreciation of whitman did not lessen after she had met and known him in the intimacy of that teatable circle which at her house discussed the same great variety of topics literature religion science politics that had enlivened the oconnor breakfast table in washington she shall describe it and him herself in a letter to rossetti under date of december she writes but i need not tell you that our greatest pleasure is the society of mr whitman who fully realizes the ideal i had formed from his poems and brings such an atmosphere of cordiality and geniality with him as is indescribable he is really making slow but i trust steady progress toward recovery having been much cheered and no doubt that acted favourably upon his health by the sympathy manifested toward him in england and the pleasure of finding so many buyers of his poems there it must be a deep satisfaction to you to have been the channel through which this help and comfort flowed and a year later she writes to the same correspondent we are having delightful evenings this winter how often do i wish you could make one in the circle around our tea table where sits on my right hand every evening but sunday walt whitman he has made great progress in health and recovered powers of getting about during the year we have been here nevertheless the lameness the dragging instead of lifting the left leg continues and this together with his white hair and beard give him a look of age curiously contradicted by his face which has not only the ruddy freshness but the full rounded contours of youth nowhere drawn or wrinkled or sunk it is a face as indicative of serenity and goodness and of mental and bodily health as the brow is of intellectual power but i notice he occasionally speaks of himself as having a wounded brain and of being still quite altered from his former self whitman on his part thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon sunshine of such friendly hospitality for he considered mrs gilchrist even more gifted as a conversationalist than as a writer for hints of the sort of talk that flowed with mrs gilchrists tea i must refer the reader to her sons realistic biography after two years of residence in philadelphia the gilchrists went to dwell in boston and later in new york city and met the leaders in the two literary capitals from these addresses the letters begin again after the natural interruption of two years it is at this time that the first letters from herbert and beatrice gilchrist were written these are given in this volume to complete the chain and to show how completely they were in sympathy with their mother in their love and appreciation of whitman from new york they all sailed for their old home in england on june whitman came the day before to wish them good voyage the chief reason for the return to england seems to have been the desire to send beatrice to berne to complete her medical education after the return to england or rather while they are still en route at glasgow the letters begin again several years of literary work yet remained to mrs gilchrist the chief writings of these years were a new edition of the blake a life of mary lamb for the eminent women series an article on blake for the dictionary of national biography several essays including three glimpses of a new england village and the confession of faith she was beginning a careful study of the life and writings of carlyle with the intention of writing a life of her old friend to reply to the aspersions of freude this last work was however never completed for early in some malady which rendered her breathing difficult had already begun to cast the shadow of death upon her but her faith long schooled in the optimism of leaves of grass looked upon the steadily approaching end with calmness on november she died when whitman was informed of her death by herbert gilchrist he could find words for only the following brief reply th december camden united states america dear herbert i have received your letter nothing now remains but a sweet and rich memory none more beautiful all time all life all the earth i cannot write anything of a letter today i must sit alone and think walt whitman later in conversations with horace traubel which the latter has preserved in his minute biography of whitman he was able to express his regard for mrs gilchrist more fully a supreme character of whom the world knows too little for its own good if her sayings had been recorded i do not say she would pale but i do say she would equal the best of the women of our century add something as great as any to the testimony on the side of her sex and at another time oh she was strangely different from the average entirely herself as simple as nature true honest beautiful as a tree is tall leafy rich full free is a tree yet free as she was by nature bound by no conventionalisms she was the most courageous of women more than queenly of high aspect in the best sense she was not cold she had her passions i have known her to warm up to resent something that was said some impeachment of good things great things of a person sometimes she had the largest charity the sweetest fondest optimism she was a radical of radicals enjoyed all sorts of high enthusiasms was exquisitely sensitized belonged to the times yet to come her vision went on and on this searching interpretation of her character wants only her artist sons description of her personal appearance to make the final picture complete a little above the average height she walked with an even light step brown hair concealed a full and finely chiselled brow and her hazel eyes bent upon you a bright and penetrating gaze whilst conversing her face became radiant as with an experience of golden years humour was present in her conversation flecks of sunshine such as sometimes play about the minds of deeply religious natures her animated manner seldom flagged and charmed the taciturn to talking in his or her best humour once when speaking to walt whitman of the beauty of the human speaking voice he replied the voice indicates the soul hers with its varied modulations and blended tones was the tenderest most musical voice ever to bless our ears her death was a longlasting shock to whitman she was a wonderful woman a sort of human miracle to me her taking off was a great shock to me i have never quite got over it she was near to me she was subtle her grasp on my work was tremendous so sure so all around so adequate if this sounds a trifle selfcentred in its criticism not so was the poem which in memory of her he wrote as a fitting epitaph from the poet she had loved going somewhere my sciencefriend my noblest womanfriend now buried in an english grave and this a memoryleaf for her dear sake ended our talk the sum concluding all we know of old or modern learning intuitions deep of all geologies histories of all astronomy of evolution metaphysics all is that we all are onward onward speeding slowly surely bettering life life an endless march an endless army no halt but it is duly over the world the race the soul in space and time the universes all bound as is befitting each all surely going somewhere the letters of anne gilchrist and walt whitman a womans estimate of walt whitman from letters by anne gilchrist to w m rossetti june i am very sure you are right in your estimate of walt whitman there is nothing in him that i shall ever let go my hold of for me the reading of his poems is truly a new birth of the soul i shall quite fearlessly accept your kind offer of the loan of a complete edition certain that great and divinely beautiful nature has not could not infuse any poison into the wine he has poured out for us and as for what you specially allude to who so well able to bear it i will say to judge wisely of it as one who having been a happy wife and mother has learned to accept all things with tenderness to feel a sacredness in all perhaps walt whitman has forgotten or through some theory in his head has overridden the truth that our instincts are beautiful facts of nature as well as our bodies and that we have a strong instinct of silence about some things july i think it was very manly and kind of you to put the whole of walt whitmans poems into my hands and that i have no other friend who would have judged them and me so wisely and generously i had not dreamed that words could cease to be words and become electric streams like these i do assure you that strong as i am i feel sometimes as if i had not bodily strength to read many of these poems in the series headed calamus for instance in some of the songs of parting the voice out of the sea the poem beginning tears tears c there is such a weight of emotion such a tension of the heart that mine refuses to beat under it stands quite still and i am obliged to lay the book down for a while or again in the piece called walt whitman and one or two others of that type i am as one hurried through stormy seas over high mountains dazed with sunlight stunned with a crowd and tumult of faces and voices till i am breathless bewildered half dead then come parts and whole poems in which there is such calm wisdom and strength of thought such a cheerful breadth of sunshine that the soul bathes in them renewed and strengthened living impulses flow out of these that make me exult in life yet look longingly towards the superb vistas of death those who admire this poem and dont care for that and talk of formlessness absence of metre c are quite as far from any genuine recognition of walt whitman as his bitter detractors not of course that all the pieces are equal in power and beauty but that all are vital they grew they were not made we criticise a palace or a cathedral but what is the good of criticising a forest are not the hithertoaccepted masterpieces of literature akin rather to noble architecture built up of material rendered precious by elaboration planned with subtile art that makes beauty go hand in hand with rule and measure and knows where the last stone will come before the first is laid the result stately fixed yet such as might in every particular have been different from what it is therefore inviting criticism contrasting proudly with the careless freedom of nature opposing its own rigid adherence to symmetry to her willful dallying with it but not such is this book seeds brought by the winds from north south east and west lying long in the earth not resting on it like the stately building but hid in and assimilating it shooting upwards to be nourished by the air and the sunshine and the rain which beat idly against that each bough and twig and leaf growing in strength and beauty its own way a law to itself yet with all this freedom of spontaneous growth the result inevitable unalterable therefore setting criticism at naught above all things vital that is a source of evergenerating vitality such are these poems roots and leaves themselves alone are these scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and from the pondside breast sorrel and pinks of love fingers that wind around tighter than vines gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as the sun is risen breezes of land and love breezes set from living shores out to you on the living sea to you o sailors frostmellowed berries and thirdmonth twigs offered fresh to young persons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up lovebuds put before you and within you whoever you are buds to be unfolded on the old terms if you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and bring form colour perfume to you if you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowers fruits tall branches and trees and the music takes good care of itself too as if it could be otherwise as if those large melodious thoughts those emotions now so stormy and wild now of unfathomed tenderness and gentleness could fail to vibrate through the words in strong sweeping longsustained chords with lovely melodies winding in and out fitfully amongst them listen for instance to the penetrating sweetness set in the midst of rugged grandeur of the passage beginning i am he that walks with the tender and growing night i call to the earth and sea half held by the night i see that no counting of syllables will reveal the mechanism of the music and that this rushing spontaneity could not stay to bind itself with the fetters of metre but i know that the music is there and that i would not for something change ears with those who cannot hear it and i know that poetry must do one of two things either own this man as equal with her highest completest manifestors or stand aside and admit that there is something come into the world nobler diviner than herself one that is free of the universe and can tell its secrets as none before i do not think or believe this but see it with the same unmistakable definiteness of perception and full consciousness that i see the sun at this moment in the noonday sky and feel his rays glowing down upon me as i write in the open air what more can you ask of the works of a mans mouth than that they should absorb into you as food and air to appear again in your strength gait face that they should be fibre and filter to your blood joy and gladness to your whole nature i am persuaded that one great source of this kindling vitalizing power i suppose the great source is the grasp laid upon the present the fearless and comprehensive dealing with reality hitherto the leaders of thought have except in science been men with their faces resolutely turned backwards men who have made of the past a tyrant that beggars and scorns the present hardly seeing any greatness but what is shrouded away in the twilight underground past naming the present only for disparaging comparisons humiliating distrust that tends to create the very barrenness it complains of bidding me warm myself at fires that went out to mortal eyes centuries ago insisting in religion above all that i must either look through dead mens eyes or shut my own in helpless darkness poets fancying themselves so happy over the chill and faded beauty of the past but not making me happy at all rebellious always at being dragged down out of the free air and sunshine of today but this poet this athlete full of rich words full of joy takes you by the hand and turns you with your face straight forwards the present is great enough for him because he is great enough for it it flows through him as a vast oceanic tide lifting up a mighty voice earth the eloquent dumb great mother is not old has lost none of her fresh charms none of her divine meanings still bears great sons and daughters if only they would possess themselves and accept their birthright a richer not a poorer heritage than was ever provided before richer by all the toil and suffering of the generations that have preceded and by the further unfolding of the eternal purposes here is one come at last who can show them how whose songs are the breath of a glad strong beautiful life nourished sufficingly kindled to unsurpassed intensity and greatness by the gifts of the present each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy o the joy of my soul leaning poised on itself receiving identity through materials and loving them observing characters and absorbing them o my soul vibrated back to me from them o the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides the leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds the moist fresh stillness of the woods the exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak and all through the forenoon o to realize space the plenteousness of all that there are no bounds to emerge and be of the sky of the sun and moon and the flying clouds as one with them o the joy of suffering to struggle against great odds to meet enemies undaunted to be entirely alone with them to find how much one can stand i used to think it was great to disregard happiness to press on to a high goal careless disdainful of it but now i see that there is nothing so great as to be capable of happiness to pluck it out of each moment and whatever happens to find that one can ride as gay and buoyant on the angry menacing tumultuous waves of life as on those that glide and glitter under a clear sky that it is not defeat and wretchedness which come out of the storm of adversity but strength and calmness see again in the pieces gathered together under the title calamus and elsewhere what it means for a man to love his fellowman did you dream it before these evangelpoems of comrades and of love speak with the abiding penetrating power of prophecy of a new and superb friendship speak not as beautiful dreams unrealizable aspirations to be laid aside in sober moods because they breathe out what now glows within the poets own breast and flows out in action toward the men around him had ever any land before her poet not only to concentrate within himself her life and when she kindled with anger against her children who were treacherous to the cause her life is bound up with to announce and justify her terrible purpose in words of unsurpassable grandeur as in the poem beginning rise o days from your fathomless deeps but also to go and with his own hands dress the wounds with his powerful presence soothe and sustain and nourish her suffering soldiers hundreds of them thousands tens of thousands by day and by night for weeks months years i sit by the restless all the dark night some are so young some suffer so much i recall the experience sweet and sad many a soldiers loving arms about this neck have crossed and rested many a soldiers kiss dwells on these bearded lips kisses that touched with the fire of a strange new undying eloquence the lips that received them the most transcendent genius could not untaught by that experience sweet and sad have breathed out hymns for her dead soldiers of such ineffably tender sorrowful yet triumphant beauty but the present spreads before us other things besides those of which it is easy to see the greatness and beauty and the poet would leave us to learn the hardest part of our lesson unhelped if he took no heed of these and would be unfaithful to his calling as interpreter of man to himself and of the scheme of things in relation to him if he did not accept all if he did not teach the great lesson of reception neither preference nor denial if he feared to stretch out the hand not of condescending pity but of fellowship to the degraded criminal foolish despised knowing that they are only laggards in the great procession winding along the roads of the universe the farbehind to come on in their turn knowing the amplitude of time how could he roll the stone of contempt off the heart as he does and cut the strangling knot of the problem of inherited viciousness and degradation and if he were not bold and true to the utmost and did not own in himself the threads of darkness mixed in with the threads of light and own it with the same strength and directness that he tells of the light and not in those vague generalities that everybody uses and nobody means in speaking on this head in the worst germs of all that is in the best in the best germs of all that is in the worst the brotherhood of the human race would be a mere flourish of rhetoric and brotherhood is naught if it does not bring brothers love along with it if the poets heart were not a measureless ocean of love that seeks the lips and would quench the thirst of all he were not the one we have waited for so long who but he could put at last the right meaning into that word democracy which has been made to bear such a burthen of incongruous notions by god i will have nothing that all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms flashing it forth like a banner making it draw the instant allegiance of every man and woman who loves justice all occupations however homely all developments of the activities of man need the poets recognition because every man needs the assurance that for him also the materials out of which to build up a great and satisfying life lie to hand the sole magic in the use of them all of the right stuff in the right hands hence those patient enumerations of every conceivable kind of industry in them far more than you estimated in them far less also far more as a means next to nothing as an end whereas we are wont to take it the other way and think the result something but the means a weariness out of all come strength and the cheerfulness of strength i murmured not a little to say the truth under these enumerations at first but now i think that not only is their purpose a justification but that the musical ear and vividness of perception of the poet have enabled him to perform this task also with strength and grace and that they are harmonious as well as necessary parts of the great whole nor do i sympathize with those who grumble at the unexpected words that turn up now and then a quarrel with words is always more or less a quarrel with meanings and here we are to be as genial and as wide as nature and quarrel with nothing if the thing a word stands for exists by divine appointment and what does not so exist the word need never be ashamed of itself the shorter and more direct the better it is a gain to make friends with it and see it in good company here at all events poetic diction would not serve not pretty soft colourless words laid by in lavender for the special uses of poetry that have had none of the wear and tear of daily life but such as have stood most as tell of human heartbeats as fit closest to the sense and have taken deep hues of association from the varied experiences of life those are the words wanted here we only ask to seize and be seized swiftly overmasteringly by the great meanings we see with the eyes of the soul listen with the ears of the soul the poor old words that have served so many generations for purposes good bad and indifferent and become warped and blurred in the process grow young again regenerate translucent it is not mere delight they give us that the sweet singers with their subtly wrought gifts their mellifluous speech can give too in their degree it is such life and health as enable us to pluck delights for ourselves out of every hour of the day and taste the sunshine that ripened the corn in the crust we eat i often seem to myself to do that out of the scorn of the present came skepticism and out of the large loving acceptance of it comes faith if now is so great and beautiful i need no arguments to make me believe that the nows of the past and of the future were and will be great and beautiful too i know i am deathless i know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the carpenters compass i know i shall not pass like a childs carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night i know i am august i do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood my foothold is tenoned and mortised in granite i laugh at what you call dissolution and i know the amplitude of time no array of terms can say how much i am at peace about god and death you argued rightly that my confidence would not be betrayed by any of the poems in this book none of them troubled me even for a moment because i saw at a glance that it was not as men had supposed the heights brought down to the depths but the depths lifted up level with the sunlit heights that they might become clear and sunlit too always for a woman a veil woven out of her own soul never touched upon even with a rough hand by this poet but for a man a daring fearless pride in himself not a mockmodesty woven out of delusions a very poor imitation of a womans do they not see that this fearless pride this complete acceptance of themselves is needful for her pride her justification what is it all so ignoble so base that it will not bear the honest light of speech from lips so gifted with the divine power to use words then what hateful bitter humiliation for her to have to give herself up to the reality do you think there is ever a bride who does not taste more or less this bitterness in her cup but who put it there it must surely be mans fault not gods that she has to say to herself soul look another way you have no part in this motherhood is beautiful fatherhood is beautiful but the dawn of fatherhood and motherhood is not beautiful do they really think that god is ashamed of what he has made and appointed and if not surely it is somewhat superfluous that they should undertake to be so for him the fullspread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul of a woman above all it is true that instinct of silence i spoke of is a beautiful imperishable part of nature too but it is not beautiful when it means an ignominious shame brooding darkly shame is like a very flexible veil that follows faithfully the shape of what it covers beautiful when it hides a beautiful thing ugly when it hides an ugly one it has not covered what was beautiful here it has covered a mean distrust of a mans self and of his creator it was needed that this silence this evil spell should for once be broken and the daylight let in that the dark cloud lying under might be scattered to the winds it was needed that one who could here indicate for us the path between reality and the soul should speak that is what these beautiful despised poems the children of adam do read by the light that glows out of the rest of the volume light of a clear strong faith in god of an unfathomably deep and tender love for humanity light shed out of a soul that is possessed of itself natural life of me faithfully praising things corroborating for ever the triumph of things now silence may brood again but lovingly happily as protecting what is beautiful not as hiding what is unbeautiful consciously enfolding a sweet and sacred mystery august even as the mystery of death the dawn as the setting kindred grandeurs which to eyes that are opened shed a hallowing beauty on all that surrounds and preludes them o vast and wellveiled death o the beautiful touch of death soothing and benumbing a few moments for reasons he who can thus look with fearlessness at the beauty of death may well dare to teach us to look with fearless untroubled eyes at the perfect beauty of love in all its appointed realizations now none need turn away their thoughts with pain or shame though only lovers and poets may say what they will the lover to his own the poet to all because all are in a sense his own none need fear that this will be harmful to the woman how should there be such a flaw in the scheme of creation that for the two with whom there is no complete life save in closest sympathy perfect union what is natural and happy for the one should be baneful to the other the utmost faithful freedom of speech such as there is in these poems creates in her no thought or feeling that shuns the light of heaven none that are not as innocent and serenely fair as the flowers that grow would lead not to harm but to such deep and tender affection as makes harm or the thought of harm simply impossible far more beautiful care than man is aware of has been taken in the making of her to fit her to be his mate god has taken such care that he need take none none that is which consists in disguisement insincerity painful hushingup of his true grand initiating nature and as regards the poets utterances which it might be thought however harmless in themselves would prove harmful by falling into the hands of those for whom they are manifestly unsuitable i believe that even here fear is needless for her innocence is folded round with such thick folds of ignorance till the right way and time for it to accept knowledge that what is unsuitable is also unintelligible to her and if no dark shadow from without be cast on the white page by misconstruction or by foolish mystery and hiding away of it no hurt will ensue from its passing freely through her hands this is so though it is little understood or realized by men wives and mothers will learn through the poet that there is rejoicing grandeur and beauty there wherein their hearts have so longed to find it where foolish men traitors to themselves poorly comprehending the grandeur of their own or the beauty of a womans nature have taken such pains to make her believe there was none nothing but miserable discrepancy one of the hardest things to make a child understand is that down underneath your feet if you go far enough you come to blue sky and stars again that there really is no down for the world but only in every direction an up and that this is an allembracing truth including within its scope every created thing and with deepest significance every part faculty attribute healthful impulse mind and body of a man each and all facing towards and related to the infinite on every side is what we grown children find it hardest to realize too novalis said we touch heaven when we lay our hand on the human body which if it mean anything must mean an ample justification of the poet who has dared to be the poet of the body as well as of the soul to treat it with the freedom and grandeur of an ancient sculptor not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy of the muse i say the form complete is worthier far these are not parts and poems of the body only but of the soul o i say now these are soul but while novalis who gazed at the truth a long way off up in the air in a safe comfortable german fashion has been admiringly quoted by high authorities the great american who has dared to rise up and wrestle with it and bring it alive and full of power in the midst of us has been greeted with a very different kind of reception as has happened a few times before in the world in similar cases yet i feel deeply persuaded that a perfectly fearless candid ennobling treatment of the life of the body so inextricably intertwined with so potent in its influence on the life of the soul will prove of inestimable value to all earnest and aspiring natures impatient of the folly of the longprevalent belief that it is because of the greatness of the spirit that it has learned to despise the body and to ignore its influences knowing well that it is on the contrary just because the spirit is not great enough not healthy and vigorous enough to transfuse itself into the life of the body elevating that and making it holy by its own triumphant intensity knowing too how the body avenges this by dragging the soul down to the level assigned itself whereas the spirit must lovingly embrace the body as the roots of a tree embrace the ground drawing thence rich nourishment warmth impulse or rather the body is itself the root of the soul that whereby it grows and feeds the great tide of healthful life that carries all before it must surge through the whole man not beat to and fro in one corner of his brain o the life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh for the sake of all that is highest a truthful recognition of this life and especially of that of it which underlies the fundamental ties of humanity the love of husband and wife fatherhood motherhood is needed religion needs it now at last alive to the fact that the basis of all true worship is comprised in the great lesson of reception neither preference nor denial interpreting loving rejoicing in all that is created fearing and despising nothing i accept reality and dare not question it the dignity of a man the pride and affection of a woman need it too and so does the intellect for science has opened up such elevating views of the mystery of material existence that if poetry had not bestirred herself to handle this theme in her own way she would have been left behind by her plodding sister science knows that matter is not as we fancied certain stolid atoms which the forces of nature vibrate through and push and pull about but that the forces and the atoms are one mysterious imperishable identity neither conceivable without the other she knows as well as the poet that destructibility is not one of natures words that it is only the relationship of things tangibility visibility that are transitory she knows that body and soul are one and proclaims it undauntedly regardless and rightly regardless of inferences timid onlookers aghast think it means that soul is body means death for the soul but the poet knows it means body is soul the great whole imperishable in life and in death continually changing substance always retaining identity for if the man of science is happy about the atoms if he is not baulked or baffled by apparent decay or destruction but can see far enough into the dimness to know that not only is each atom imperishable but that its endowments characteristics affinities electric and other attractions and repulsions however suspended hid dormant masked when it enters into new combinations remain unchanged be it for thousands of years and when it is again set free manifest themselves in the old way shall not the poet be happy about the vital whole shall the highest force the vital that controls and compels into complete subservience for its own purposes the rest be the only one that is destructible and the love and thought that endow the whole be less enduring than the gravitating chemical electric powers that endow its atoms but identity is the essence of love and thought i still i you still you certainly no man need ever again be scared by the dark hush and the little handful of refuse you are not scattered to the winds you gather certainly and safely around yourself sure as life holds all parts together death holds all parts together all goes onward and outward nothing collapses what i am i am of my body and what i shall be i shall be of my body the body parts away at last for the journeys of the soul science knows that whenever a thing passes from a solid to a subtle air power is set free to a wider scope of action the poet knows it too and is dazzled as he turns his eyes toward the superb vistas of death he knows that the perpetual transfers and promotions and the amplitude of time are for a man as well as for the earth the man of science with unwearied selfdenying toil finds the letters and joins them into words but the poet alone can make complete sentences the man of science furnishes the premises but it is the poet who draws the final conclusion both together are swiftly and surely preparing a future greater than all the past but while the man of science bequeaths to it the fruits of his toil the poet this mighty poet bequeaths himself death making him really undying he will stand as nigh as the nighest to these men and women for he taught them in words which breathe out his very heart and soul into theirs that love of comrades which like the softborn measureless light makes wholesome and fertile every spot it penetrates to lighting up dark social and political problems and kindling into a genial glow that great heart of justice which is the lifesource of democracy he the beloved friend of all initiated for them a new and superb friendship whispered that secret of a godlike pride in a mans self and a perfect trust in woman whereby their love for each other no longer poisoned and stifled but basking in the light of gods smile and sending up to him a perfume of gratitude attains at last a divine and tender completeness he gave a faithcompelling utterance to that wisdom which is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things and of the excellence of things happy america that he should be her son one sees indeed that only a young giant of a nation could produce this kind of greatness so full of the ardour the elasticity the inexhaustible vigour and freshness the joyousness the audacity of youth but i for one cannot grudge anything to america for after all the young giant is the old english giant the great english race renewing its youth in that magnificent land mexicanbreathed arcticbraced and girding up its loins to start on a new career that shall match with the greatness of the new home a confession of faith of genius in the fine arts wrote wordsworth the only infallible sign is the widening the sphere of human sensibility for the delight honour and benefit of human nature genius is the introduction of a new element into the intellectual universe or if that be not allowed it is the application of powers to objects on which they had not before been exercised or the employment of them in such a manner as to produce effects hitherto unknown what is all this but an advance or conquest made by the soul of the poet is it to be supposed that the reader can make progress of this kind like an indian prince or general stretched on his palanquin and borne by slaves no he is invigorated and inspirited by his leader in order that he may exert himself for he cannot proceed in quiescence he cannot be carried like a dead weight therefore to create taste is to call forth and bestow power a great poet then is a challenge and summons and the question first of all is not whether we like or dislike him but whether we are capable of meeting that challenge of stepping out of our habitual selves to answer that summons he works on natures plan nature who teaches nothing but supplies infinite material to learn from who never preaches but drives home her meanings by the resistless eloquence of effects therefore the poet makes greater demands upon his reader than any other man for it is not a question of swallowing his ideas or admiring his handiwork merely but of seeing feeling enjoying as he sees feels enjoys the messages of great poems to each man and woman are says walt whitman come to us on equal terms only then can you understand us we are no better than you what we enclose you enclose what we enjoy you may enjoy no better than you potentially that is but if you would understand us the potential must become the actual the dormant sympathies must awaken and broaden the dulled perceptions clear themselves and let in undreamed of delights the wonderworking imagination must respond the ear attune itself the languid soul inhale large draughts of love and hope and courage those empyreal airs that vitalize the poets world no wonder the poet is long in finding his audience no wonder he has to abide the inexorable tests of time which if indeed he be great slowly turns the handful into hundreds the hundreds into thousands and at last having done its worst grudgingly passes him on into the ranks of the immortals meanwhile let not the handful who believe that such a destiny awaits a man of our time cease to give a reason for the faith that is in them so far as the suffrages of his own generation go walt whitman may like wordsworth tell of the love the admiration the indifference the slight the aversion and even the contempt with which his poems have been received but the love and admiration are from even a smaller number the aversion the contempt more vehement more universal and persistent than wordsworth ever encountered for the american is a more daring innovator he cuts loose from precedent is a very columbus who has sailed forth alone on perilous seas to seek new shores to seek a new world for the soul a world that shall give scope and elevation and beauty to the changed and changing events aspirations conditions of modern life to new aims new methods therefore let not the reader approach these poems as a judge comparing testing measuring by what has gone before but as a willing learner an unprejudiced seeker for whatever may delight and nourish and exalt the soul neither let him be abashed nor daunted by the weight of adverse opinion the contempt and denial which have been heaped upon the great american even though it be the contempt and denial of the capable the cultivated the recognized authorities for such is the usual lot of the pioneer in whatever field in religion it is above all to the earnest and conscientious believer that the reformer has appeared a blasphemer and in the world of literature it is equally natural that the most careful student that the warmest lover of the accepted masterpieces should be the most hostile to one who forsakes the methods by which or at any rate in company with which those triumphs have been achieved but said the wise goethe i will listen to any mans convictions you may keep your doubts your negations to yourself i have plenty of my own for heartfelt convictions are rare things therefore i make bold to indicate the scope and source of power in walt whitmans writings starting from no wider ground than their effect upon an individual mind it is not criticism i have to offer least of all any discussion of the question of form or formlessness in these poems deeply convinced as i am that when great meanings and great emotions are expressed with corresponding power literature has done its best call it what you please but my aim is rather to suggest such trains of thought such experience of life as having served to put me en rapport with this poet may haply find here and there a reader who is thereby helped to the same end hence i quote just as freely from the prose especially from democratic vistas and the preface to the first issue of leaves of grass as from his poems and more freely perhaps from those parts that have proved a stumblingblock than from those whose conspicuous beauty assures them acceptance fifteen years ago with feelings partly of indifference partly of antagonism for i had heard none but ill words of them i first opened walt whitmans poems but as i read i became conscious of receiving the most powerful influence that had ever come to me from any source what was the spell it was that in them humanity has in a new sense found itself for the first time has dared to accept itself without disparagement without reservation for the first time an unrestricted faith in all that is and in the issues of all that happens has burst forth triumphantly into song the rapture of the hallelujah sent from all that breathes and is rings through these poems they carry up into the region of imagination and passion those vaster and more profound conceptions of the universe and of man reached by centuries of that indomitably patient organized search for knowledge that skilful crossquestioning of things called science o truth of the earth i am determined to press my way toward you sound your voice i scale the mountains i dive in the sea after you cried science and the earth and the sky have answered and continue inexhaustibly to answer her appeal and now at last the day dawns which wordsworth prophesied of the man of science he wrote seeks truth as a remote and unknown benefactor he cherishes and loves it in his solitude the poet singing a song in which all human beings join with him rejoices in the presence of truth as our visible friend and hourly companion poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge it is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all science it is the first and last of all knowledge it is immortal as the heart of man if the labours of men of science should ever create any material revolution direct or indirect in our condition and in the impressions which we habitually receive the poet will then sleep no more than at present he will be ready to follow the steps of the man of science not only in those general indirect effects but he will be at his side carrying sensation into the midst of the objects of science itself if the time should ever come when what is now called science thus familiarized to man shall be ready to put on as it were a form of flesh and blood the poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration and will welcome the being thus produced as a dear and genuine inmate of the household of man that time approaches a new heaven and a new earth await us when the knowledge grasped by science is realized conceived as a whole related to the world within us by the shaping spirit of imagination not in vain already for this poet have they pierced the darkness of the past and read here and there a word of the earths history before human eyes beheld it each word of infinite significance because involving in it secrets of the whole a new anthem of the slow vast mystic dawn of life he sings in the name of humanity i am an acme of things accomplishd and i am an encloser of things to be my feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs on every step bunches of ages and larger bunches between the steps all below duly travelld and still i mount and mount rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me afar down i see the huge first nothing i know i was even there i waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist and took my time and took no hurt from the fetid carbon long i was huggd close long and long immense have been the preparations for me faithful and friendly the arms that have helpd me cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen for room to me stars kept aside in their own rings they sent influences to look after what was to hold me before i was born out of my mother generations guided me my embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it for it the nebula cohered to an orb the long slow strata piled to rest it on vast vegetables gave it sustenance monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care all forces have been steadily employd to complete and delight me now on this spot i stand with my robust soul not in vain have they pierced space as well as time and found a vast similitude interlocking all i open my scuttle at night and see the farsprinkled systems and all i see multiplied as high as i can cypher edge but the rim of the farther systems wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding outward and outward and for ever outward my sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels he joins with his partners a group of superior circuit and greater sets follow making specks of the greatest inside them there is no stoppage and never can be stoppage if i you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaces were this moment reduced back to a pallid float it would not avail in the long run we should surely bring up again where we now stand and as surely go as much farther and then farther and farther not in vain for him have they penetrated into the substances of things to find that what we thought poor dead inert matter is in clerk maxwells words a very sanctuary of minuteness and power where molecules obey the laws of their existence and clash together in fierce collision or grapple in yet more fierce embrace building up in secret the forms of visible things each stock and stone a busy group of ariels plying obediently their hidden tasks why who makes much of a miracle as to me i know of nothing else but miracles to me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle every cubic inch of space is a miracle every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same every spear of grass the frames limbs organs of men and women and all that concerns them all these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles the natural is the supernatural says carlyle it is the message that comes to our time from all quarters alike from poetry from science from the deep brooding of the student of human history science materialistic rather it is the current theology that is materialistic in comparison science may truly be said to have annihilated our gross and brutish conceptions of matter and to have revealed it to us as subtle spiritual energetic beyond our powers of realization it is for the poet to increase these powers of realization he it is who must awaken us to the perception of a new heaven and a new earth here where we stand on this old earth he it is who must in walt whitmans words indicate the path between reality and the soul above all is every thought and feeling in these poems touched by the light of the great revolutionary truth that man unfolded through vast stretches of time out of lowly antecedents is a rising not a fallen creature emerging slowly from purely animal life as slowly as the strata are piled and the ocean beds hollowed whole races still barely emerged countless individuals in the foremost races barely emerged the wolf the snake the hog yet lingering in the best but new ideals achieved and others come in sight so that what once seemed fit is fit no longer is adhered to uneasily and with shame the conflicts and antagonisms between what we call good and evil at once the sign and the means of emergence and needing to account for them no supposed primeval disaster no outside power thwarting and marring the divine handiwork the perfect fitness to its time and place of all that has proceeded from the great source in a word that evil is relative is that which the slowly developing reason and conscience bid us leave behind the prowess of the lion the subtlety of the fox are cruelty and duplicity in man silent and amazed when a little boy i remember i heard the preacher every sunday put god in his statements as contending against some being or influence says the poet and elsewhere faith very old now scared away by science by the daylight science lets in upon our miserable inadequate idolatrous conceptions of god and of his works and on the sophistications subterfuges moral impossibilities by which we have endeavoured to reconcile the irreconcilable the coexistence of omnipotent goodness and an absolute power of evil faith must be brought back by the same power that caused her departure restored with new sway deeper wider higher than ever and what else indeed at bottom is science so busy at for what is faith faith to borrow venerable and unsurpassed words is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen and how obtain evidence of things not seen but by a knowledge of things seen and how know what we may hope for but by knowing the truth of what is here and now for seen and unseen are parts of the great whole all the parts interdependent closely related all alike have proceeded from and are manifestations of the divine source nature is not the barrier between us and the unseen but the link the communication she too has something behind appearances has an unseen soul she too is made of innumerable energies knowledge is not faith but it is faiths indispensable preliminary and starting ground faith runs ahead to fetch glad tidings for us but if she start from a basis of ignorance and illusion how can she but run in the wrong direction suppose said that impetuous lover and seeker of truth clifford suppose all moving things to be suddenly stopped at some instant and that we could be brought fresh without any previous knowledge to look at the petrified scene the spectacle would be immensely absurd crowds of people would be senselessly standing on one leg in the street looking at one anothers backs others would be wasting their time by sitting in a train in a place difficult to get at nearly all with their mouths open and their bodies in some contorted unrestful posture clocks would stand with their pendulums on one side everything would be disorderly conflicting in its wrong place but once remember that the world is in motion is going somewhere and everything will be accounted for and found just as it should be just so great a change of view just so complete an explanation is given to us when we recognize that the nature of man and beast and of all the world is going somewhere the maladaptions in organic nature are seen to be steps toward the improvement or discarding of imperfect organs the baneful strife which lurketh inborn in us and goeth on the way with us to hurt us is found to be the relic of a time of savage or even lower condition going somewhere that is the meaning then of all our perplexities that changes a mystery which stultified and contradicted the best we knew into a mystery which teaches allures elevates which harmonizes what we know with what we hope by it we begin to see by the glad light and breathe the sweet air of futurity the scornful laughter of carlyle as he points with one hand to the baseness ignorance folly cruelty around us and with the other to the still unsurpassed poets sages heroes saints of antiquity whilst he utters the words progress of the species touches us no longer when we have begun to realize the amplitude of time when we know something of the scale by which nature measures out the years to accomplish her smallest essential modification or development know that to call a few

great future before it we may well believe already we see the indications but that the individual has is quite another matter we can but balance probabilities here and the probabilities are very heavy on the wrong side the poets must throw in weighty matter indeed to turn the scale the other way be it so but ponder a moment what science herself has to say bearing on this theme what are the widest deepest facts she has reached down to indestructibility amidst ceaseless change and seeming decay all the elements all the forces if indeed they be not one and the same which operate and substantiate those changes imperishable neither matter nor force capable of annihilation endless transformations disappearances new combinations but diminution of the total amount never missing in one place or

combination and disappears as oxygen if it pass through a thousand combinations animal vegetable mineral if it lie hid for a thousand years and then be evolved it is oxygen with its first qualities neither more nor less so then out of the universe is no door continuity again is one of natures irrevocable words everything the result and outcome of what went before no gaps no jumps always a connecting principle which carries forward the great scheme of things as a related whole which subtly links past and present like and unlike nothing breaks with its past it is not says helmholtz the definite mass of substance which now constitutes the body to which the continuance of the individual is attached just as the flame remains the same in appearance and continues to exist with the same form and structure although it draws every moment fresh combustible vapour and fresh oxygen from the air into the vortex of its ascending current and just as the wave goes on in unaltered form and is yet being reconstructed every moment from fresh particles of water so is it also in the living being for the material of the body like that of flame is subject to continuous and comparatively rapid change a change the more rapid the livelier the activity of the organs in question some constituents are renewed from day to day some from month to month and others only after years that which continues to exist as a particular individual is like the wave and the flame only the form of motion which continually attracts fresh matter into its vortex and expels the old the observer with a deaf ear recognizes the vibration of sound as long as it is visible and can be felt bound up with other heavy matter are our senses in reference to life like the deaf ear in this respect you are not thrown to the winds you gather certainly and safely around yourself it is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and father it is to identify you it is not that you should be undecided but that you should be decided something long preparing and formless is arrived and formd in you you are henceforth secure whatever comes or goes o death the voyage of death the beautiful touch of death soothing and benumbing a few moments for reasons myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burnd or reduced to powder or buried my real body doubtless left me for other spheres my voided body nothing more to me returning to the purifications farther offices eternal uses of the earth yes they go their way those dismissed atoms with all their energies and affinities unimpaired but they are not all the will the affections the intellect are just as real as those affinities and energies and there is strict account of all nothing slips through there is no door out of the universe but they are qualities of a personality of a self not of an atom but of what uses and dismisses those atoms if the qualities are indestructible so must the self be the little heap of ashes the puff of gas do you pretend that is all that was shakespeare the rest of him lives in his works you say but he lived and was just the same man after those works were produced the world gained but he lost nothing of himself rather grew and strengthened in the production of them still farther those faculties with which we seek for knowledge are only a part of us there is something behind which wields them something that those faculties cannot turn themselves in upon and comprehend for the part cannot compass the whole yet there it is with the irrefragable proof of consciousness who should be the mouthpiece of this whole who but the poet the man most fully possessed of his own soul the man of the largest consciousness fullest of love and sympathy which gather into his own life the experiences of others fullest of imagination that quality whereof wordsworth says that it in truth is but another name for absolute power and clearest insight amplitude of mind and reason in her most exalted mood let walt whitman speak for us and i know i am solid and sound to me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow all are written to me and i must get what the writing means i know i am deathless i know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by the carpenters compass i know i shall not pass like a childs carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night i know i am august i do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood i see that the elementary laws never apologize i reckon i behave no prouder than the level i plant my house by after all i exist as i am that is enough if no other in the world be aware i sit content and if each one and all be aware i sit content one world is aware and by far the largest to me and that is myself and whether i come to my own today or in ten thousand or ten million years i can cheerfully take it now or with equal cheerfulness i can wait my foothold is tenond and mortisd in granite i laugh at what you call dissolution and i know the amplitude of time what lies through the portal of death is hidden from us but the laws that govern that unknown land are not all hidden from us for they govern here and now they are immutable eternal of and in all these things i have dreamd that we are not to be changed so much nor the law of us changed i have dreamd that heroes and good doers shall be under the present and past law and that murderers drunkards liars shall be under the present and past law for i have dreamd that the law they are under now is enough and the law not to be eluded is the law of consequences the law of silent teaching that is the meaning of disease pain remorse slow to learn are we but success is assured with limitless beneficence as our teacher with limitless time as our opportunity already we begin to know the universe itself as a road as many roads as roads for travelling souls for ever alive for ever forward stately solemn sad withdrawn baffled mad turbulent feeble dissatisfied desperate proud fond sick accepted by men rejected by men they go they go i know that they go but i know not where they go but i know they go toward the best toward something great the whole universe indicates that it is good going somewhere and if it is impossible for us to see whither as in the nature of things it must be how can we be adequate judges of the way how can we but often grope and be full of perplexity but we know that a smooth path a paradise of a world could only nurture fools cowards sluggards joy is the great unfolder but pain is the great enlightener the great stimulus in certain directions alike of man and beast how else could the selfpreserving instincts and all that grows out of them have been evoked how else those wonders of the moral world fortitude patience sympathy and if the lesson be too hard comes death come the sureenwinding arms of death to end it and speed us to the unknown land man is only weak through his mistrust and want of hope wrote wordsworth but mans mistrust of himself is at bottom mistrust of the central fount of power and goodness whence he has issued here comes one who plucks out of religion its heart of fear and puts into it a heart of boundless faith and joy a faith that beggars previous faiths because it sees that all is good not part bad and part good that there is no flaw in the scheme of things no primeval disaster no counteracting power but orderly and sure growth and development and that infinite goodness and wisdom embrace and ever lead forward all that exists are you troubled that he is an unknown god that we cannot by searching find him out why it would be a poor prospect for the universe if otherwise if embryos that we are we could compass him in our thoughts i hear and behold god in every object yet understand god not in the least it is the double misfortune of the churches that they do not study god in his works man and nature and their relations to each other and that they do profess to set him forth that they worship therefore a god of mans devising an idol made by mens minds it is true not by their hands but none the less an idol leaves are not more shed out of trees than bibles are shed out of you says the poet they were the best of their time but not of all time they need renewing as surely as there is such a thing as growth as surely as knowledge nourishes and sustains to further development as surely as time unrolls new pages of the mighty scheme of existence nobly has george sand too written everything is divine even matter everything is superhuman even man god is everywhere he is in me in a measure proportioned to the little that i am my present life separates me from him just in the degree determined by the actual state of childhood of our race let me content myself in all my seeking to feel after him and to possess of him as much as this imperfect soul can take in with the intellectual sense i have the day will come when we shall no longer talk about god idly nay when we shall talk about him as little as possible we shall cease to set him forth dogmatically to dispute about his nature we shall put compulsion on no one to pray to him we shall leave the whole business of worship within the sanctuary of each mans conscience and this will happen when we are really religious in what sense may walt whitman be called the poet of democracy it is as giving utterance to this profoundly religious faith in man he is rather the prophet of what is to be than the celebrator of what is democracy he writes is a word the real gist of which still sleeps quite unawakened notwithstanding the resonance and the many angry tempests out of which its syllables have come from pen or tongue it is a great word whose history i suppose remains unwritten because that history has yet to be enacted it is in some sort younger brother of another great and often used word nature whose history also waits unwritten political democracy now taking shape is the house to live in and whilst what we demand of it is room for all fair chances for all none disregarded or left out as of no account the main question the kind of life that is to be led in that house is altogether beyond the ken of the statesmen as such and is involved in those deepest facts of the nature and destiny of man which are the themes of walt whitmans writings the practical outcome of that exalted and allaccepting faith in the scheme of things and in man toward whom all has led up and in whom all concentrates as the manifestation the revelation of divine power is a changed estimate of himself a higher reverence for a loftier belief in the heritage of himself a perception that pride not humility is the true homage to his maker that noblesse oblige is for the race not for a handful that it is mankind and womankind and their high destiny which constrain to greatness which can no longer stoop to meanness and lies and base aims but must needs clothe themselves in the majesty of honest dealing majestic because demanding courage as good as the soldiers selfdenial as good as the saints for everyday affairs and walk erect and fearless a law to themselves sternest of all lawgivers looking back to the palmy days of feudalism especially as immortalized in shakespeares plays what is it we find most admirable what is it that fascinates it is the noble pride the lofty selfrespect the dignity the courage and audacity of its great personages but this pride this dignity rested half upon a true half upon a hollow foundation half upon intrinsic qualities half upon the ignorance and brutishness of the great masses of the people whose helpless submission and easily dazzled imaginations made steppingstones to the elevation of the few and hedged round kings with a specious kind of divinity but we have our faces turned toward a new day and toward heights on which there is room for all by god i will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms is the motto of the great personages the great souls of today on the same terms for that is natures law and cannot be abrogated the reaping as you sow but all shall have the chance to sow well this is pride indeed not a pride that isolates but that can take no rest till our common humanity is lifted out of the mire everywhere a pride that cannot stretch too far because sympathy stretches with it whoever you are claim your own at any hazard these shows of the east and west are tame compared to you these immense meadows these interminable rivers you are immense and interminable as they these furies elements storms motions of nature throes of apparent dissolution you are he or she who is master or mistress over them master or mistress in your own right over nature elements pain passion dissolution the hopples fall from your ankles you find an unfailing sufficiency old or young male or female rude low rejected by the rest whatever you are promulges itself through birth life death burial the means are provided nothing is scanted through angers losses ambition ignorance and ennui what you are picks its way this is indeed a pride that is calming and excellent to the soul that dissolves poverty from its need and riches from its conceit and humility is there then no place for that virtue so much praised by the haughty humility is the sweet spontaneous grace of an aspiring finely developed nature which sees always heights ahead still unclimbed which outstrips itself in eager longing for excellence still unattained genuine humility takes good care of itself as men rise in the scale of being for every height climbed discloses still new heights beyond or it is a wise caution in fortunes favourites lest they themselves should mistake as the unthinking crowd around do the glitter reflected back upon them by their surroundings for some superiority inherent in themselves it befits them well if there be also due pride pride of humanity behind but to say to a man be humble is like saying to one who has a battle to fight a race to run you are a poor feeble creature you are not likely to win and you do not deserve to say rather to him hold up your head you were not made for failure you were made for victory go forward with a joyful confidence in that result sooner or later and the sooner or the later depends mainly on yourself what christ appeared for in the moralspiritual field for humankind namely that in respect to the absolute soul there is in the possession of such by each single individual something so transcendent so incapable of gradations like life that to that extent it places all being on a common level utterly regardless of the distinctions of intellect virtue station or any height or lowliness whatever is the secret source of that deathless sentiment of equality which how many able heads imagine themselves to have slain with ridicule and contempt as johnson kicking a stone imagined he had demolished idealism when he had simply attributed to the word an impossible meaning true inequality is one of natures words she moves forward always by means of the exceptional but the moment the move is accomplished then all her efforts are toward equality toward bringing up the rear to that standpoint but social inequalities class distinctions do not stand for or represent natures inequalities precisely the contrary in the long run they are devices for holding up many that would else gravitate down and keeping down many who would else rise up for providing that some should reap who have not sown and many sow without reaping but literature tallies the ways of nature for though itself the product of the exceptional its aim is to draw all men up to its own level the great writer is hungry for equals day and night for so only can he be fully understood the meal is equally set all are invited therefore is literature whether consciously or not the greatest of all forces on the side of democracy carlyle has said there is no grand poem in the world but is at bottom a biography the life of a man walt whitmans poems are not the biography of a man but they are his actual presence it is no vain boast when he exclaims camerado this is no book who touches this touches a man he has infused himself into words in a way that had not before seemed possible and he causes each reader to feel that he himself or herself has an actual relationship to him is a reality full of inexhaustible significance and interest to the poet the power of his book beyond even its great intellectual force is the power with which he makes this felt his words lay more hold than the grasp of a hand strike deeper than the gaze or the flash of an eye to those who comprehend him he stands nigher than the nighest america has had the shaping of walt whitman and he repays the filial debt with a love that knows no stint her vast lands with their varied brilliant climes and rich products her political scheme her achievements and her failures all have contributed to make these poems what they are both directly and indirectly above all has that great conflict the secession war found voice in him and if the reader would understand the true causes and nature of that war ostensibly waged between north and south but underneath a tussle for supremacy between the good and the evil genius of america for there were just as many secret sympathizers with the secessionslavepower in the north as in the south he will find the clue in the pages of walt whitman rarely has he risen to a loftier height than in the poem which heralds that volcanic upheaval rise o days from your fathomless deeps till you loftier and fiercer sweep long for my soul hungering gymnastic i devourd what the earth gave me long i roamd the woods of the north long i watchd niagara pouring i traveld the prairies over and slept on their breast i crossd the nevadas i crossd the plateaus i ascended the towering rocks along the pacific i saild out to sea i saild through the storm i was refreshd by the storm i watchd with joy the threatening maws of the waves i markd the white combs where they careerd so high curling over i heard the wind piping i saw the black clouds saw from below what arose and mounted o superb o wild as my heart and powerful heard the continuous thunder as it bellowd after the lightning noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky these and such as these i elate saw saw with wonder yet pensive and masterful all the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me yet there with my soul i fed i fed content supercilious twas well o soul twas a good preparation you gave me now we advance our latent and ampler hunger to fill now we go forth to receive what the earth and the sea never gave us not through the mighty woods we go but through the mightier cities something for us is pouring now more than niagara pouring torrents of men sources and rills of the northwest are you indeed inexhaustible what to pavements and homesteads here what were those storms of the mountains and sea what to passions i witness around me today was the sea risen was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds lo from deeps more unfathomable something more deadly and savage manhattan rising advancing with menacing front cincinnati chicago unchaind what was that swell i saw on the ocean behold what comes here how it climbs with daring feet and hands how it dashes how the true thunder bellows after the lightning how bright the flashes of lightning how democracy with desperate vengeful port strides on shown through the dark by those flashes of lightning yet a mournful wail and low sob i fancied i heard through the dark in a lull of the deafening confusion thunder on stride on democracy stride with vengeful stroke and do you rise higher than ever yet o days o cities crash heavier heavier yet o storms you have done me good my soul prepared in the mountains absorbs your immortal strong nutriment long had i walkd my cities my country roads through farms only half satisfied one doubt nauseous undulating like a snake crawld on the ground before me continually preceding my steps turning upon me oft ironically hissing low the cities i loved so well i abandond and left i sped to the certainties suitable to me hungering hungering hungering for primal energies and natures dauntlessness i refreshd myself with it only i could relish it only i waited the bursting forth of the pent fire on the water and air i waited long but now i no longer wait i am fully satisfied i am glutted i have witnessd the true lightning i have witnessd my cities electric i have lived to behold man burst forth and warlike america rise hence i will seek no more the food of the northern solitary wilds no more on the mountain roam or sail the stormy sea but not for the poet a soldiers career to sit by the wounded and soothe them or silently watch the dead was the part he chose during the whole war he remained with the army but only to spend the days and nights saddest happiest of his life in the hospital tents it was a beautiful destiny for this lover of men and a proud triumph for this believer in the people for it was the people that he beheld tried by severest tests he saw them of their own choice fighting dying for their own idea insolently attacked by the secessionslavepower from the workshop the farm the store the desk they poured forth officered by men who had to blunder into knowledge at the cost of the wholesale slaughter of their troops he saw them tried long and long by hopelessness mismanagement defeat advancing unhesitatingly through incredible slaughter sinewy with unconquerable resolution he saw them by tens of thousands in the hospitals tried by yet drearier more fearful tests the wound the amputation the shattered face the slow hot fever the long impatient anchorage in bed he marked their fortitude decorum their religious nature and sweet affection finally newest most significant sight of all victory achieved the cause the union safe he saw them return back to the workshop the farm the desk the store instantly reabsorbed into the peaceful industries of the land a pause the armies wait a million flushd embattled conquerors wait the world too waits then soft as breaking night and sure as dawn they melt they disappear plentifully supplied lastneeded proof of democracy in its personalities ratifying on the broadest scale wordsworths haughty claim for average man such is the inherent dignity of human nature that there belong to it sublimities of virtue which all men may attain and which no man can transcend but aware that peace and prosperity may be even still severer tests of national as of individual virtue and greatness of mind walt whitman scans with anxious questioning eye the america of today he is no smoothtongued prophet of easy greatness i am he who walks the states with a barbd tongue questioning every one i meet who are you that wanted only to be told what you knew before who are you that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense he sees clearly as any the incredible flippancy the blind fury of parties the lack of great leaders the plentiful meanness and vulgarity the labour question beginning to open like a yawning gulf we sail a dangerous sea of seething currents all so dark and untried it seems as if the almighty had spread before this nation charts of imperial destinies dazzling as the sun yet with many a deep intestine difficulty and human aggregate of cankerous imperfection saying lo the roads the only plans of development long and varied with all terrible balks and ebullitions you said in your soul i will be empire of empires putting the history of oldworld dynasties conquests behind me as of no account making a new history a history of democracy i alone inaugurating largeness culminating time if these o lands of america are indeed the prizes the determinations of your soul be it so but behold the cost and already specimens of the cost thought you greatness was to ripen for you like a pear if you would have greatness know that you must conquer it through ages must pay for it with proportionate price for you too as for all lands the struggle the traitor the wily person in office scrofulous wealth the surfeit of prosperity the demonism of greed the hell of passion the decay of faith the long postponement the fossillike lethargy the ceaseless need of revolutions prophets thunderstorms deaths new projections and invigorations of ideas and men yet i have dreamed merged in that hiddentangled problem of our fate whose long unravelling stretches mysteriously through time dreamed portrayed hinted already a little or a larger band a band of brave and true unprecedented yet armd and equipt at every point the members separated it may be by different dates and states or south or

achievers in all art a new undying order dynasty from age to age transmitted a band a class at least as fit to cope with current years our dangers needs as those who for their time so long so well in armour or in cowl upheld and made illustrious that farbackfeudal priestly world of that band is not walt whitman the pioneer of that new world literature say are not his poems the beginning a rude beginning if you will he claims no more and no less but whatever else they may lack they do not lack vitality initiative sublimity they do not lack that which makes life great and death with its transfers and promotions its superb vistas exhilarating a resplendent faith in god and man which will kindle anew the faith of the world poets to come orators singers musicians to come not today is to

his face leaving it to you to prove and define it expecting the main things from you anne gilchrist illustration anne gilchrist photogravure from a painting by her son made in letter i walt whitman to w m rossetti and anne gilchrist washington december dear mr rossetti your letter of last summer to william oconnor with the passages transcribed from a ladys correspondence had been shown me by him and copy lately furnished me which i have just been rereading i am deeply touched by these sympathies and convictions coming from a woman and from england and am sure that if the lady knew how much comfort it has been to me to get them she would not only pardon you for transmitting them to mr oconnor but approve that action i realize indeed of this emphatic and smiling well done from the heart and conscience of a true wife and mother and one too whose sense of the poetic as i glean from your letter after flowing through the heart and conscience must also move through and satisfy science as much as the esthetic that i had hitherto received no eulogium so magnificent i send by same mail with this same address as this letter two photographs taken within a few months one is intended for the lady if i may be permitted to send it her and will you please accept the other with my respects and love the picture is by some criticised very severely indeed but i hope you will not dislike it for i confess to myself a perhaps capricious fondness for it as my own portrait over some scores that have been made or taken at one time or another i am still employed in the attorney generals office my p o address remains the same i am quite well and hearty my new editions considerably expanded with what suggestions c i have to offer presented i hope in more definite form will probably get printed the coming spring i shall forward you early copies i send my love to moncure conway if you see him i wish he would write to me if the pictures dont come or get injured on the way i will try again by express i want you to loan this letter to the lady or if she wishes it give it to her to keep walt whitman letter ii anne gilchrist to walt whitman september dear friend at last the beloved books have reached my hand but now i have them my heart is so rent with anguish my eyes so blinded i cannot read in them i try again and again but too great waves come swaying up suffocate me i will struggle to tell you my story it seems to me a death struggle when i was eighteen i met a lad of nineteen who loved me then and always for the remainder of his life after we had known each other about a year he asked me to be his wife but i said that i liked him well as my friend but could not love him as a wife should love felt deeply convinced i never should he was not turned aside but went on just the same as if that conversation had never passed after a year he asked me again and i deeply moved by and grateful for his steady love and so sorry for him said yes but next day terrified at what i had done and painfully conscious of the dreary absence from my heart of any faintest gleam of true tender wifely love said no again this too he bore without desisting at the end of some months once more asked me with passionate entreaties then dear friend i prayed very earnestly and it seemed to me that that i should continue to mar thwart his life so was not right if he was content to accept what i could give i knew i could lead a good and wholesome life beside him his aims were noble his heart a deep beautiful true poets heart but he had not the poets great brain his path was a very arduous one and i knew i could smooth it for him cheer him along it it seemed to me gods will that i should marry him so i told him the whole truth and he said he would rather have me on those terms than not have me at all he said to me many times ah annie it is not you who are so loved that is rich it is i who so love and i knew this was true felt as if my nature were poor barren beside his but it was not so it was only slumbering undeveloped for dear friend my soul was so passionately aspiring it so thirsted pined for light it had not power to reach alone and he could not help me on my way and a woman is so made that she cannot give the tender passionate devotion of her whole nature save to the great conquering soul stronger in its powers though not in its aspirations than her own that can lead her forever forever up and on it is for her soul exactly as it is for her body the strong divine soul of the man embracing hers with passionate love so alone the precious germs within her soul can be quickened into life and the time will come when man will understand that a womans soul is as dear and needful to his and as different from his as her body to his body this was what happened to me when i had read for a few days nay hours in your books it was the divine soul embracing mine i never before dreamed what love meant not what life meant never was alive before no words but those of new birth can hint the meaning of what then happened to me the first few months of my marriage were dark and gloomy to me within and sometimes i had misgivings whether i had judged aright but when i knew there was a dear baby coming my heart grew light and when it was born such a superb child all gloom fear forever vanished i knew it was gods seal to the marriage and my heart was full of gratitude and joy it was a happy and a good life we led together for ten short years he ever tender and affectionate to me loving his children so working earnestly in the wholesome bracing atmosphere of poverty for it was but just possible with the most strenuous frugality and industry to pay our way i learned to cook to turn my hand to all household occupation found it bracing healthful cheerful now i think it more even now that i understand the divineness sacredness of the body i think there is no more beautiful task for a woman than ministering all ways to the health comfort enjoyment of the dear bodies of those she loves no material that will work sweeter more beautifully into that making of a perfect poem of a mans life which is her true vocation in my children took scarlet fever badly i thought i should have lost my dear oldest girl then my husband took it and in five days it carried him from me i think dear friend my sorrow was far more bitter though not so deep as that of a loving tender wife as i stood by him in the coffin i felt such remorse i had not could not have been more tender to him such a conviction that if i had loved him as he deserved to be loved he would not have been taken from us to the last my soul dwelt apart unmated his soul dwelt apart unmated i do not fear the look of his dear silent eyes i do not think he would even be grieved with me now my youngest was then a baby i have had much sweet tranquil happiness much strenuous work and endeavour raising my darlings in may came the voice over the atlantic to me o the voice of my mate it must be so my love rises up out of the very depths of the grief tramples upon despair i can wait any time a lifetime many lifetimes i can suffer i can dare i can learn grow toil but nothing in life or death can tear out of my heart the passionate belief that one day i shall hear that voice say to me my mate the one i so much want bride wife indissoluble eternal it is not happiness i plead with god for it is the very life of my soul my love is its life dear walt it is a sweet precious thing this love it clings so close so close to the soul and body all so tenderly dear so beautiful so sacred it yearns with such passion to soothe and comfort fill thee with sweet tender joy it aspires as grandly as gloriously as thy own soul strong to soar soft tender to nestle and caress if god were to say to me see he that you love you shall not be given to in this life he is going to set sail on the unknown sea will you go with him never yet has bride sprung into her husbands arms with the joy with which i would take thy hand spring from the shore understand aright dear love the reason of my silence i was obeying the voice of conscience i thought i was to wait for it is the instinct of a womans nature to wait to be sought not to seek and when that may june i was longing so irrepressibly to write i resolutely restrained myself believing if i were only patient the right opening would occur and so it did through rossetti and when he liking what i said suggested my printing something it met and enabled me to carry into execution what i was brooding over for i had and still have a strong conviction that it was necessary for a woman to speak that finally and decisively only a woman can judge a man only a man a woman on the subject of their relations what is blameless what is good in its effect on her is good however it may have seemed to men she is the test and i never for a moment feared any hard words against myself because i know these things are not judged by the intellect but by the unerring instincts of the soul i knew any man could not but feel that it would be a happy and ennobling thing for him that his wife should think feel as i do on that subject knew that what had filled me with such great and beautiful thoughts towards men in that writing could not fail to give them good happy thoughts towards women in the reading the cause of my consenting to rossettis urgent advice that i should not put my name he so kindly solicitous yet not altogether understanding me it aright was that i did not rightly understand how it might be with my dear boy if it came before him i thought perhaps he was not old enough to judge and understand me aright nor young enough to let it altogether alone but it has been very bitter hateful to me this not standing to what i have said as it were with my own personality better because of my utter love and faithfulness to the cause longing to stand openly and proudly in the ranks of its friends for the lower reason that my nature is proud and as defiant as thine own and immeasurably disdains any faintest appearance of being afraid of what i had done and my darling above all because i love thee so tenderly that if hateful words had been spoken against me i could have taken joy in it for thy dear sake there never yet was the woman who loved that would not joyfully bare her breast to wrest the blows aimed at her beloved i know not what fiend made me write those meaningless words in my letter it is pleasantest to me c but it was not fear or faithlessness it is not pleasantest but hateful to me now let me come to beautiful joyous things again o dear walt did you not feel in every word the breath of a womans love did you not see as through a transparent veil a soul all radiant and trembling with love stretching out its arms

my love for my children my hopes aspirations for them all taking new shape new height through this great love my soul has staked all upon it in dull dark moods when i cannot as it were see thee still still always a dumb blind yearning towards thee still it comforts me to touch to press to me the beloved books like a child holding some hand in the dark it knows not whose but knows it is enough knows it is a dear strong comforting hand do not say i am forward or that i lack pride because i tell this love to thee who have never sought or made sign of desiring to seek me oh for all that this love is my pride my glory source of sufferings and joys that cannot put themselves into words besides it is not true thou hast not sought or loved me for when i read the divine poems i feel all folded round in thy love i feel often as if thou wast pleading so passionately for the love of the woman that can understand thee that i know not how to bear the yearning answering tenderness that fills my breast i know that a woman may without hurt to her pride without stain or blame tell her love to thee i feel for a certainty that she may try me for this life my darling see if i cannot so live so grow so learn so love that when i die you will say this woman has grown to be a very part of me my soul must have her loving companionship everywhere in all things i alone she alone are not complete identities it is i and she together in a new divine perfect union that form the one complete identity i am yet young enough to bear thee children my darling if god should so bless me and would yield my life for this cause with serene joy if it were so appointed if that were the price for thy having a perfect child knowing my darlings would all be safe happy in thy loving care planted down in america let me have a few words directly dear friend i shall get them by the middle of november i shall have to go to london about then or a little later to find a house for us i only came to the old home here from which i have been absent most four years to wind up matters and prepare for a move for there is nothing to be had in the way of educational advantages here it has been a beautiful survey for the children but it is not what they want now but we leave with regret for it is one of the sweetest wildest spots in england though only miles from london goodbye dear friend anne gilchrist letter iv walt whitman to anne gilchrist washington d c november to a g earls colne halsted essex eng i have been waiting quite a while for time and the right mood to answer your letter in a spirit as serious as its own and in the same unmitigated trust and affection but more daily work than ever has fallen to me to do the present season and though i am well and contented my best moods seem to shun me i wish to give to it a day a sort of sabbath or holy day apart to itself under serene and propitious influences confident that i could then write you a letter which would do you good and me too but i must at least show without further delay that i am not insensible to your love i too send you my love and do you feel no disappointment because i now write so briefly my book is my best letter my response my truest explanation of all in it i have put my body and spirit you understand this better and fuller and clearer than any one else and i too fully and clearly understand the loving letter it has evoked enough that there surely exists so beautiful and a delicate relation accepted by both of us with joy letter v anne gilchrist to walt whitman november dear friend your long waited for letter brought me both joy pain but the pain was not of your giving i gather from it that a long letter which i wrote you sept th after i had received the precious packet a letter in which i opened all my heart to you never reached your hands nor yet a shorter one which tortured by anxiety suspense about its predecessor i wrote oct it too written out of such stress intensity of painful emotion as wrenches from us inmost truth i cannot face the thought of these words of uttermost trust love having fallen into other hands can both be simply lost could any man suffer a base curiosity to make him so meanly treacherously cruel it seems to cut and then burn me i was not disappointed at the shortness of your letter i do not ask nor even wish you to write save when you are inwardly impelled desirous of doing so i only want leave and security to write freely to you your book does indeed say all book that is not a book for the first time a man complete godlike august standing revealed the only way possible through the garment of speech do you know dear friend what it means for a woman what it means for me to understand these poems it means for her whole nature to be then first kindled quickened into life through such love such sympathy such resistless attraction that thenceforth she cannot choose but live die striving to become worthy to share this divine mans life to be his dear companion closer nearer dearer than any man can be for ever so her soul stakes all on this it is the meaning the fulfilment the only perfect development consummation of her nature of her passionate high immortal aspirations her soul to mate with his for ever ever o i know the terms are obdurate i know how hard to attain to this greatness the grandest lot ever aspired to by woman i know too my own shortcomings faults flaws you might not be able to give me your great love yet to take me to your breast with joy but i can wait i can grow great beautiful through sorrow suffering working struggling yearning loving so all alone as i have done now nearly three years it will be three in may since i first read the book first knew what the word love meant love hope are so strong in me my souls high aspirations are of such tenacious passionate intensity are so conscious of their own deathless reality that what would starve them out of any other woman only makes them strike out deeper roots grow more resolute sturdy in me i know that greatness will not ripen for me like a pear but i could face i could joyfully accept the fiercest anguish the hardest toil the longest sternest probation to make me fit to be your mate so that at the last you should say this is the woman i have waited for the woman prepared for me this is my dear eternal comrade wife the one i so much want life has no other meaning for me than that all things have led up to help prepare me for that death is more welcome to me than life if it means that if thou dear sailor thou sailing upon thy endless cruise takest me on board me daring all with thee steering for the deep waters bound where mariner has not yet dared to go hand in hand with thee nestled close one with thee ah that word enough was like a blow on the breast to me breast that often often is so full of yearning tenderness i know not how to draw my breath the tie between us would not grow less but more beautiful dear friend if you knew me better if i could stand as real near to you as you do to me but i cannot like you clothe my nature in divine poems so make it visible to you ah foolish me i thought you would catch a glimpse of it in those words i wrote i thought you would say to yourself perhaps this is the voice of my mate and would seek me a little to make sure if it were so or not o the sweet dreams i have fed on these three years nearly pervading my waking moments influencing every thought action i was so sure so sure if i waited silently patiently you would send me some sign so full of joyful hope i could not doubt nor fear when i lay dying as it seemed i was still full of the radiant certainty that you would seek me would not lose me that we should as surely find one another there as here and when the ebb ceased life began to flow back into me o never doubting but it was for you never doubting but that the sweetest noblest closest tenderest companionship ever yet tasted by man woman was to begin for us here now then came the long long waiting the hope deferred each morning so sure the book would come with it a word from you that should give me leave to speak no longer to shut down in stern silence the love the yearning the thoughts that seemed to strain crush my heart i knew what that means if thou wast not gifted to sing thou wouldst surely die i felt as if my silence must kill me sometimes then when the book came but with it no word for me alone there was such a storm in my heart i could not for weeks read in it i wrote that long letter out in the autumn fields for dear lifes sake i knew i might and must speak then then i felt relieved joyful buoyant once more then again months of heartwearying disappointment as i looked in vain for a lettero the anguish at times the scalding tears the feeling within as if my heart were crushed doubled up but always afterwards saying to myself if this suffering is to make my love which was born grew up blossomed all in a moment strike deep root down in the dark cold penetrate with painful intensity every fibre of my being make it a love such as he himself is capable of giving then welcome this anguish these bitter deferments let its roots be watered as long as god pleases with my tears anne gilchrist marquis road london camden sqr n w letter vi anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis road camden sqre london n w january dear friend i send you photographs of my oldest and youngest children i wish i had some worth sending of the other two that of myself done in is a copy of a daguerrotype the recent one was taken just a week or so before i broke down in my long illness when i was struggling against a terrible sense of inward prostration so it has not my natural expression but i think you will like to have it rather than none the weather here is too gloomy for there to be any chance of a good one if i were to try again your few words lifted a heavy weight off me very few they are dear friend but knowing that i may give to every word you speak its fullest truest meaning the more i brood over them the sweeter do they taste still i am not as happy content as i thought i should be if i could only know my words reached you were welcome to you but restless anxious impatient looking so wistfully towards the letters each morning above all longing longing so for you to come to come see if you feel happy beside me no more this painful struggle to put myself into words but to let what i am all my life speak to you only so can you judge whether i am indeed the woman capable of rising to the full height of great destiny of justifying fulfilling your grand thoughts of women and see my faults flaws shortcomings too dear friend i feel an earnest wish you should do this too that there may be the broad unmovable foundationrock of perfect truth and candour for our love i do not fear i believe in a large allaccepting because allcomprehending love a boundless faith in growth development in your judging not as the judge judges but as the sunshine falling around me to have you in the midst of us we clustered round you shone upon vivified strengthened by your presence surrounding you with an atmosphere of love cheerful life when i wrote to you in nov i was in lodgings in london having just accomplished the difficult task of finding a house for us in london where rents are so high and i have succeeded better than i anticipated for we find this a comfortable dear little home small indeed but not so small as to interfere with health or comfort and at rent that i may safely undertake my husband was taken from us too young to be able to have made any provision for his children i have a little of my own about l a year for the rest depend upon my mother whose only surviving child i am and she by nature generous selfdenying as well as prudent has never made anything but a pleasure of this as long as she was able to see to her own affairs was such a capital manager that she used to spare me about l out of an income of l but now though she retains her faculties in a wonderful degree for her years just upon she is no longer able to do this has put the management of the whole into my hands and i feeling that she needs and ought to have now an easier scale of expenditure at colne have to manage a little more cleverly still to make a less sum serve for us but i succeed capitally dear friend do not want a better home never get behind hand find it no hardship but quite the contrary to have to spend a good deal of time pains in domestic management and then just to help me through at the right moment dear percy obtained in november a good opening in some large copper iron mining smelting works in south wales at a salary upon which he can comfortably live he likes his work well writes very cheerfully lodges in a farmhouse in the midst of grand scenery within a walk of the sea so this enables me to give the girls a turn in education for hitherto they have had hardly any teaching but mine and i chose this part because there is a capital day school for them handy and herby walks in to the best drawing school in london is very diligent and happy at his work his bent is unmistakably strong it was well i have had to be so busy this autumn winter dear walt for i suffered keenly sometimes overwhelmingly through the delay in my letters reaching you what caused it and when did you get the sept oct letters did you get the two copies that i baffled almost despairing sent off in nov goodbye dear friend annie gilchrist letter vii walt whitman to anne gilchrist washington d c feb i send by same mail with this my latest piece copied in a newspaper and write you just a line i suppose you only received my former letters two i ought to have written something about your children described to me in your letter of last summer july d which i have just been reading again dear boys and girls how my heart goes out to them did i tell you that i had received letters from tennyson and that he cordially invites me to visit him sometimes i dream of coming to old england on such visit thus of seeing you your childrenbut it is a dream only i am still living here in employment in a government office my health is good life is rather sluggish here yet not without the sunshine your letters too were bright rays of it i am going on to new york soon to stay a few weeks but my address will still be here i wrote lately to mr rossetti quite a long letter dear friend best love remembrance to you to the young folk letter viii anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq n w april th dear friend i was to tell you about my acquaintanceship with tennyson which was a pleasant episode in my life at haslemere hearing of the extreme beauty of the scenery thereabouts specially of its comparative wildness seclusion he thought he would like to find or build a house to escape from the obtrusive curiosity of the multitudes who flock to the isle of wight at certain seasons of the year he is even morbidly sensitive on this point will not stir beyond his own grounds from weeks end to weeks end to avoid his admiring or inquisitive persecutors so knowing an old friend of mine he called on me for particulars as to the resources of the neighbourhood and i a good walker familiar with every least frequent spot of hill dale for some miles round took him long ambles in quest of a site very pleasant rambles they were tennyson under the influence of the fresh outdoor quite unconstrained life in new scenery with a cheerful aim shaking off the languid ennuye air as of a man to whom nothing has any longer a relish bodily or mental that too often hangs about him and we found something quite to his mind a coppice of acres hanging on the south side two thirds of the way up a hill some ft high so as to be sheltered from the cold yet have the light dry elastic hill air with of course a glorious outlook over the wooded weald of sussex so richly green fertile looking almost as boundless as the great sweep of sky over it the south downs to surrey hills near at hand the hill curving round a fircovered promontory standing out very black grand between him the sunset underfoot too a wilderness of beauty fox gloves i wonder if they grow in america ferns purple heath c c i dont suppose i shall see much more of him now i have left haslemere though i have had very friendly invitations for i am a home bird dont like staying out wanted at home and happiest there and i should not enjoy being with them in the grand mansion half so much as i did picnicing in the road watching the builders as we did it is pleasant to see t with children little girls at least he does not take to boys but one of my girls was mostly on his knee when they were in the room he liked them very much his two sons are now both ft high i have received your letters of march from brooklyn but the one you speak of as having acknowledged the photograph never came to hand a sore disappointment to me dear friend i can ill afford to lose the long eagerly watched for pleasure of a letter if it seems to you there must needs be something unreal illusive in a love that has grown up entirely without the basis of personal intercourse dear friend then you do not yourself realize your own power nor understand the full meaning of your own words whoso touches this touches a man i have put my soul body into these poems real effects imply real causes do you suppose that an ideal figure conjured up by her own fancy could in a perfectly sound healthy woman of my age so happy in her children so busy content practical earnest produce such real tremendous effect saturating her whole life colouring every waking moment filling her with such joys such pains that the strain of them has been well nigh too much even for a strong frame coming as it does after twenty years of hard work therefore please dear friend do not warn me any more it hurts so as seeming to distrust my love time only can show how needlessly my love flowing ever fresh fresh out of my heart will go with you in all your wanderings dear friend enfolding you day and night soul body with tenderness that tries so vainly to utter itself in these poor helpless words that clings closer than any mans love can cling o i could not live if i did not believe that sooner or later you will not be able to help stretching out your arms towards me saying come my darling when you get this will you post me an american newspaper any one you have done with as a token it has reached you so on at intervals during your wanderings it will serve as a token that you are well the postmark will tell me where you are and thus you will feel free only to write when you have leisure inclination i shall be spared the feeling i have when i fancy my letters have not reached you as if i were so hopelessly helplessly cut off from you which is more than i can stand we all read american news eagerly too the children are so well working on with all their might the school turns out more what i desire for them than i had ventured to hope goodbye dearest friend ann gilchrist letter ix anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sqre june d dear friend the newspapers have both come to hand been gladly welcomed i shall realize you on the th sending living impulses into those young men with results not to cease their kindled hearts sending back response through glowing eyes that will be warmer to you than the june sunshine perhaps too you will have pleasant talks with the eminent astronomers there prof young who is so skilful a worker with that most subtle of tidings from the stars the spectroscope always it seems hitherto bringing word of the vast similitude that interlocks all nay of the absolute identity of the stuff they are made of with the stuff we are made of the news from dartmouth that too is a great pleasure it has been what seems to me a very long while since last writing because it has been a troubled time within what i wrote i tore up again believing it was best wisest so you said in your first letter that if you had leisure you could write one that would do me good you too write that letter dear friend after you have been to dartmouth for i sorely need it perhaps the letters that i have sent you since that first have given you a feeling of constraint towards me because you cannot respond to them i will not write any more such letters or if i write them because my heart is so full it cannot bear it they shall not find their way to the post but do not because i give you more than friendship think that it would not be a very dear happy thing to me to have friendship only from you i do not want you to write what it is any effort to write do not ask for deep thoughts deep feelings know well those must choose their own time mode but for the simplest current details for any thing that helps my eyes to pierce the distance see you as you live move today i dearly like to hear about your mother want to know if all your sisters are married if you have plenty of little nephews nieces i like to hear anything about mr oconnor mr burroughs towards both of whom i feel as toward friends has mr oconnor succeeded in getting practically adopted his new method of making cast steel percy being a worker in the field of metallurgy makes me specially glad to hear about this then i need not tell you how deep an interest i feel in american politics want to know if you are satisfied with the result of the cincinnati convention what of mr greely what you augur as to his success i am sure dear friend if you realize the joy it is to me to receive a few words from you about anything that is passing in your thoughts around how beaming bright happy the day a letter comes many days after how light hearted alert i set about my daily tasks it would not seem irksome to you to write and if you say read my books be content you have me in them i say it is because i read them so that i am not content it is an effort to me to turn to any other reading as to highest literature what i felt three years ago is more than ever true now with all their precious augmentations i want nothing else am fully fed satisfied there i sit alone many hours busy with my needle this used to be tedious but it is not so now for always close at hand lie the books that are so dear so dear i brooding over the poems sunning myself in them pondering the vistas all the experience of my past life all its aspirations corroborating them all my future so far as in me lies the future of my children to be shaped modified vitalized by through these outwardly inwardly how can i be content to live wholly isolated from you i am sure it is not possible for any one man or woman it does not matter which to receive these books not merely with the intellect critically admiring their power beauty but with an understanding responsive heart without feeling it drawn out of their breasts so that they must leave all come to be with you sometimes without a resistless yearning for personal intercourse that will take no denial when we come to america i shall not want you to talk to me shall not be any way importunate to settle down where there are some that love you understand your poems somewhere that you would be sure to come pretty often to have you sit with me while i worked you silent or reading to yourself i dont mind how to let my children grow fond of you to take food with us if my music pleased you to let me play sing to you of an evening do your needlework for you talk freely of all that occupied my thoughts concerning the childrens welfare c i could be very happy so but silence with the living presence and silence with all the ocean in between are two different things therefore these years stretch out your hand cordially trustfully that i may feel its warm grasp goodbye my dearest friend annie gilchrist letter x anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq london july the d july was my rejoicing day dearest friend the day the packet from america reached me scattering for a while the clouds of pain and humiliation filling me through through with light warmth indeed i believe i am often as happy reading as you were writing your poems the long new one as a strong bird of itself answers the question hinted in your preface nobly fulfils the promise of its opening lines we want again again in fresh words from the new impetus standpoint of new days the vision that sweeps ahead the tones that fill us with faith joy in our present share of life work prophetic of the splendid issues it does not need to be american born to believe passionately rejoice in the belief of what is preparing in america it is for humanity and it comes through england the noblest souls the most heroic hearts of england were called to be the nucleus of the race that enriched with the blood qualities of other races planted down in the new half of the world reserved in all its fresh beauty exhaustless riches to be the arena is to fulfil justify outstrip the vision of the poets the quenchless aspirations of all the ardent souls that have ever struggled forward upon this earth for me the most precious page in the book is that which contains the democratic souvenirs i respond to that as one to whom it means the life of her soul it comforts me very much you speak in the preface of the imperious resistless command from within out of which leaves of grass issued this carried with it no doubt the secret of a corresponding resistless power over the reader wholly unprecedented unapproached in literature as i believe to be compared only with that of christ i speak out of my own experience when i say that no myth no miracle embodying the notion of a direct communication between god a human creature goes beyond the effect soul body of those poems on me that were i to put into oriental forms of speech what i experienced it would read like one of those old miracles or myths thus of many things that used to appear to me incomprehensible lies i now perceive the germ of truth understand that what was called the supernatural was merely an inadequate too timid way of conceiving the natural had i died the following year it would have been the simple truth to say i died of joy the doctor called it nervous exhaustion falling with tremendous violence on the heart which seemed to have been strained was much puzzled how that could have come to pass i left him in his puzzle but it was none to me how could such a dazzling radiance of light flooding the soul suddenly kindling it to such intense life but put a tremendous strain on the vital organs how could the muscles of the heart suddenly grow adequate to such new work o the passionate tender gratitude that flooded my breast the yearnings that seemed to strain the heart beyond endurance that i might repay with all my life soul body this debt that i might give joy to him who filled me with such joy that i might make his outward life sweeter more beautiful who made my inner life so divinely sweet beautiful but dear friend i have certainly to see that this is not to be so now that for me too love death are folded inseparably together death that will renew my youth i have had the paper from burlington with the details a woman likes so to have i wish i had known for certain whether you went on to boston were enjoying the music there my youngest boy has gone to spend his holiday with his brother in south wales he writes me such good news of per that he is looking as brown as a nut very jolly his home in a clean airy old farm house half way up a mountain in the midst of wild rough grand scenery sea in sight near enough to hear the sound of it about as loud as the rustling of leaves so the boys will have a good time together and the girls are going with me for the holiday to their grandmother at colne w rossetti does not take his till october this year i suppose it will be long long before this letter reaches you as you will be gone to california may it be a time full of enjoyment full to the brim goodbye dearest friend annie gilchrist what a noble achievement is mr stanleys it fills me with pleasure that americans should thus have been the rescuer of our largehearted heroic traveller we have just got his letters with account of the five races in central africa copied from n y herald july letter xi anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis road camden sqre novr my dearest friend i must write not because i have anything to tell you but because i want so by help of a few loving words to come into your presence as it were into your remembrance not more do the things that grow want the sun i have received all the papers each has made a day very bright for me i hope the trip to california has not again had to be postponed i realize well the enjoyment of it what it would be to california the fresh impulses of thought emotion that would shape themselves melodiously out of that for the new volume my children are all well beatrice is working hard to get through the requisite amount of latin c that is required in the preliminary examination before entering on medical studies percy my eldest whom i have not seen for a year is coming to spend xmas with us goodbye dearest friend annie gilchrist letter xii anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis road camden sq london jan dearest friend shall you never find it in your heart to say a kind word to me again or a word of some sort surely i must have written what displeased you very much that you should turn away from me as the tone of your last letter the ten months silence which have followed seem to express to me with such emphasis but if so tell me of it tell me how with perfect candour i am worthy of that a willing learner striver not afraid of the pain of looking my own faults shortcomings steadily in the face it may be my words have led you to do me some kind of injustice in thought i then could defend myself but if it is simply that you are preoccupied too busy perhaps very eagerly beset by hundreds like myself whose hearts are so drawn out of their breasts by your poems that they cannot rest without striving some way or other to draw near to you personally then write once more tell me so i will learn to be content but please let it be a letter just like the first three you wrote do not fear that i shall take it to mean anything it doesnt mean i shall never do that again though it was natural enough at first with the deep unquestioning belief i had that i did but answer a call that i not only might but ought on pain of being untrue to the greatest sweetest instincts aspirations of my own soul to answer it with all my heart strength life i say to myself i say to you as i did in my first letters this voice that has come to me from over the atlantic is the one divine voice that has penetrated to my soul is the utterance of a nature that sends out lifegiving warmth light to my inward self as actually as the sun does to my body draws me to it and shapes shall shape my course just as the sun shapes the earths interlocked in a vast similitude indeed are these inner outer truths of our lives it may be that this shaping of my life course toward you will have to be all inward that to feed upon your words till they pass into the very substance action of my soul is all that will be given to me the grateful yearning tender love growing ever deeper stronger out of that will have to go dumb actionless all my days here but i can wait long wait patiently know well realize more clearly indeed that this wingless clouded halfdeveloped soul of me has a long long novitiate to live through before it can meet answer yours on equal terms so as fully to satisfy you to be in very truth deed a dear friend a chosen companion a source of joy to you as you of light life to me but that is what i will live die hoping striving for that covers includes all the aspirations all the high hopes i am capable of and were i to fall away from this belief it would be a fall into utter blackness despair as one for whom the sun in heaven is blotted out goodbye dearest friend annie gilchrist letter xiii anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis road camden sq n w may th my dearest friend such a joyful surprise was that last paper you sent me with the poem celebrating the great events in spain the new hopes the new life wakening in the breasts of that fine people which has slumbered so long weighed down tormented with hideous nightmares of superstition are you indeed getting strong well again able to drink in draughts of pleasure from the sights sounds perfumes of this delicious time lilac time according to your wont sleeping well eating well dear friend william rossetti is coming to see me thursday before starting for his holiday trip to naples his father was a neapolitan so he narrowly escaped a lifelong dungeon for having written some patriotic songs he fled in disguise by help of english friends spent the rest of his life here so this his first visit to naples will be specially full of interest delight to our friend he is also in great spirits at having discovered a large number of hitherto unknown early letters of shelleys of modern english poets shelley is the one he loves admires incomparably the most perhaps this letter will just reach you on your birthday what can i send you what can i tell you but the same old story of a heart fast anchored of a soul to whom your soul is as the sun the fresh sweet air and the nourishing sustaining earth wherein the other one breathes free feeds expands delights itself there is no occupation of the day however homely that is not coloured elevated made more cheerful to me by thoughts of you by thoughts you have given me blent in suffusing all no hope or aim or practical endeavour for my dear children that has not taken a higher larger more joyous scope through you no immortal aspiration no thoughts of what lies beyond death but centre in you and in moods of pain and discouragement dear friend i turn to that poem beginning whoever you are holding me now in hand and i dont know but that that one revives and strengthens me more than any for there is not a line nor a word in it at which my spirit does not rise up instinctively and fearlessly say so be it and then i read other poems drink in the draught that i know is for me because it is for all the love that you give me on the broad ground of my humanity and womanhood and i understand the reality preciousness of that then i say to myself souls are not made to be frustrated to have their greatest best sweetest impulses and aspirations yearnings made abortive therefore we shall not be carried diverse forever this dumb soul of mine will not always remain hidden from you but some way will be given me for this love this passion of gratitude this set of all the nerves of my being toward you to bring joy comfort to you i do not ask the when or the how i shall be thinking of your great dear mother in her beautiful old age too on your birthday happiest woman in all the world that she was is forever sacred dear to america to all who feed on the poems of her son goodbye my best beloved friend annie gilchrist i suppose you see all that you care to see in the way of english newspapers i often long to send you one when there is anything in that i feel sure would interest you but am withheld by fearing it would be quite superfluous or troublesome even letter xiv anne gilchrist to walt whitman earls colne halstead august my dearest friend the paper has just been forwarded here which tells me you are still suffering and not as i was fondly believing already quite emerged from the cloud of sickness my darling let me use that tender caressing word once more for how can i help it with heart so full no outlet but words my darling i say it over over to myself with voice with eyes so full of love of tender yearning sorrowful longing love i would give all the world if i might come but am held here yet awhile by a duty nothing may supersede soothe tend wait on you with such cheerful loving companionship lift off some of the weight of the long hours days perhaps months that must still go over while nature slowly imperceptibly but still so surely repairs the mischief within result of the tremendous ordeal to your frame of those great overbrimming years of life spent in the army hospitals you see dear friend a woman who is a mother has thenceforth something of that feeling toward other men who are dear to her a cherishing fostering instinct that rejoices so in tending nursing caretaking i should be so happy it needs must diffuse a reviving comforting vivifying warmth around you might but these words breathed out of the heart of a woman who loves you with her whole soul life strength fulfil their errand comfort the sorrowful heart if ever so little through that revive the drooping frame this love that has grown up far away over here unhelped by the sweet influences of personal intercourse penetrating the whole substance of a womans life swallowing up into itself all her aspirations hopes longings regardless of death looking earnestly confidently beyond that for its fruition blending more or less with every thought act of her life a guiding star that her feet cannot choose but follow resolutely what can be more real than this dear friend what can have deeper roots or a more immortal growing power but i do not ask any longer whether this love is believed in welcomed precious to you for i know that what has real roots cannot fail to bear real flowers fruits that will in the end be sweet joyful to you and that if i am indeed capable of being your eternal comrade climbing whereon you climb daring all that you dare learning all that you learn suffering all that you suffer pressing closest then loving enjoying all that you love enjoy you will want me you will not be able to help stretching out your hand drawing me to you i have written this mostly out in the fields as i am so fond of doing the serene beautiful harvest landscape spread around returned once more as i have every summer for five twenty years to this old village where my mothers family have lived in unbroken succession three hundred years ever since in fact the old priory which they have inhabited ceased to be a priory my mothers health is still good wonderful indeed for though she has been years crippled with rheumatism still she enjoys getting out in the sunshine in her bath chair is able to take pleasure in seeing her friends in having us all with her her father was a hale man at these eastern counties are flat tame but yet under this soft smiling summer sky lovely enough too with their rich green meadows abundant golden corn crops now being well got in even the sluggish little river colne one cannot find fault with it nourishes such a luxuriant border of wild flowers as it creeps along turns twists from sunshine into shade from shade into sunshine so as to make the very best most of itself but as to the human growth here i think that more than anywhere else in england perhaps it struggled along choked poisoned by dead things of the past still holding their place above ground carlyle calls the clergy black dragoons in these rural parishes they are black squires making it their chief business to instruct the labourer that his grinding poverty excessive toil the squires affluence ease are equally part of the sacred order of providence when i have been here a little i wish myself in london again dearly as i love outdoor life companionship with nature for though the same terrible cruel facts are there as here they are not choked down your throat by any one as a beautiful perfect ideal even in england light is unmistakably breaking through the darkness for the toilers i did not see william rossetti before i came down but heard he had had a very happy time in italy splendid weather all the while mr conway his wife are going to spend their holiday in brittany do not think me childish dear friend if i send a copy of this letter to washington as well as to camden i want it so to get to you long so long to speak with you the camden one may never come to hand or the washington one might remain months unforwarded it is easy to tear up i hope it will find you by the sea shore getting on so fast toward health strength again refreshed tranquillized soul body goodbye beloved friend annie gilchrist letter xv walt whitman to anne gilchrist i must write friend once more at since i last wrote clouds have darkened over me and still remain on the night of d january last i was paralyzed left side and have remained so since feb i lost a dear dear sister who died in st louis leaving two young daughters may d my dear inexpressibly beloved mother died in camden n j i was just able to get from washington to her dying bed sit there i thought i was bearing it all stoutly but i find it affecting the progress of my recovery since and now i am still feeble palsied have spells of great distress in the head but there are points more favourable i am up dressed every day sleep eat middling well do not change much yet in flesh face only look very old though i can move slowly very short distances i walk with difficulty have to stay in the house nearly all the time as i write today i feel that i shall probably get well though i may not many times during the past year have i thought of you your children many times indeed have i been going to write but did not i have just been reading over again several of this last years letters from you looking at the pictures sent in the one of jan your letters of jan june july of last year and of jan and may this year with certainly one other maybe two all came safe do not think hard of me for not writing in reply if you could look into my spirit emotion you would be entirely satisfied at peace i am at present temporarily here at camden on the delaware river opposite philadelphia at the house of my brother and i am occupying as i write the rooms wherein my mother died you must not be unhappy about me as i am as comfortably situated as can be many things indeed every thing in my case might be so much worse though my plans are not definite my intention as far as anything is on getting stronger and after the hot season passes to get back to washington for the fall winter my post office address continues at washington i send my love to percy all your dear children the enclosed ring i have just taken from my finger send to you with my love illustration facsimile of a typical whitman letter from thomas b harneds collection letter xvi anne gilchrist to walt whitman earls colne sept i am entirely satisfied at peace my beloved no words can say how divine a peace pain and joy struggle together in me but joy getting the mastery because its portion is eternal o the precious letter bearing to me the living touch of your hand vibrating through through me as i feel the pressure of the ring that pressed your flesh now will press mine so long as i draw breath my darling take comfort strength joy from me that you have made so rich strong perhaps it will yet be given us to see each other to travel the last stage of this journey side by side hand in hand so completing the preparation for the fresh start on the greater journey me loving and blessing her you mourn now for your dear sake then growing to know love her in full unison with you i hope you will soon get to the sea as soon as you are strong enough that is if you could have all needful care comfort a dear friend with you there for i believe you would get on faster away from camden that it tends so to keep the wound open quivering to be where the blow fell on you where every object speaks of her last hours is laden with heartstirring associations though i realize dearest friend that in the midst of the poignant sorrow come immortal sweet moments communings rapt anticipations but these would come the same in natures great soothing arms by the seashore with her reviving invigorating breath playing freely over you if only you could get just strong enough prudently to undertake the journey when my eyes first open in the morning often such tender thoughts yearning ineffably pitying sorrowful sweet thoughts flow into my breast that longs longs to pillow on itself the suffering head with white hair more beautiful to me than the silvery clouds which always make me think of it my hands want to be so helpful tending soothing serving my whole frame to support his stricken side o to comfort his heart to diffuse round him such warm sunshine of love helping time the inborn vigour of each organ that the disease could not withstand the influences but healthful life begin to flow again through every part my children send their love their earnest sympathy do not feel anyways called on to write except when inwardly impelled your silence is not dumb to me now will never again cloud or pain or be misconstrued by me i can feast feast still have wherewithal to satisfy myself with the sweet precious words that have now come with the feel of my ring only send any old paper that comes to hand never mind whether there is anything to read in it or not just as a sign that the breath of love hope these poor words try to bear to you has reached you and just one word literally that dearest when you begin to feel you are really getting on to make me so joyful with the news goodbye dearest friend anne gilchrist back again in marquis road letter xvii anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq nov london my dearest friend all the papers have reached me separate packets with the handwriting on them that makes my heart give a glad bound i look through them full of interest curiosity wanting to realize as i do in things small as well as things large my land of promise the land where i hope to plant down my children so strong in the faith that they perhaps still more those that come after them will bless me for that consciously or unconsciously it doesnt matter which i should set out with a cheerful heart on that errand if i knew the first breath i drew on american soil would be my last in life i searched hopeful for a few words telling of improvement in your health in the last paper but perhaps it does not follow from there being no much mention that there is no progress may you be steadily though ever so slowly gaining ground my darling now that i understand the nature of the malady a deficient flow of blood to the brain if it has been rightly explained to me i realize that recovery must be very gradual as the coming on of it must have been slow insidious and perhaps that also even from before the war time with its tremendous strain emotional physical is part of the price paid for the greatness of the poems for their immortal destiny the rapt exaltation the intensity of joy sorrow struggle all that went to give them their lifegiving power for i have felt many times in reading them as if the light and heat of their sacred fire must needs have consumed the vital energies of him in whose breast it was generated faster then even the most splendid physique could renew itself for our sakes for humanitys sake you suffer now i do not doubt it every bit as much as the soldiers wounds are for his countrys sake the more precious the more tenderly cherished the more drawing the hearts that understand with ineffable yearnings for this my children all continue well in the main i am thankful to say though beatrice the eldest girl looks paler than i could wish and is working her brains too much and the rest of her too little just at present with the hope of getting through the apothecaries hall exam in arts next sept which involves a good bit of latin and mathematics this is all women can do in england toward getting into the medical profession as the apoth hall certificate is accepted for the preliminary studies at paris zurich i make no doubt it is also at philadelphia new york so that she would be able to enter on medical studies the virtual preliminary work when we come for she continues steadfastly desirous to win her way into that field of usefulness i believe is well fitted to work there with her grave earnest thoughtful feeling nature strong bodily frame she is able to enjoy your poems the vistas broods over them a great deal percy is bending his energies now to mastering the processes that go to the production of the very best quality of copper such as is used for telegraph wires c no easy matter copper being the most difficult in a metallurgical point of view of all the metals to deal with the company in whose employ he is having hitherto been unsuccessful in this branch his looks too do not quite satisfy me it is partly rather too long hours of work but still more not getting a good meal till the end of it it is so hard to make the young believe that the stomach shares the fatigue of the rest of the body and that there is not nervous energy enough left for it to do all its principal work to perfection after a long exhausting day but i hope now i or rather his own experience and i together have convinced him in time and he promises me faithfully to arrange for a good meal in the middle of the day however much grudging the time my little artist herby is still chiefly working from the antique but tries his hand at home occasionally with oils to life has made an oil sketch of me which though imperfect in drawing c gives far more the real character expression of my face than the photographs have you heard i wonder of william rossettis approaching marriage it is to take place early in the new year the lady is lucy brown daughter of one of our most eminent artists he was the friend who first put into my hand the selections from your poems lucy is a very sweettempered cultivated lovable woman well fitted i should say to make william rossetti happy they are to continue in the old home euston sq with mrs rossetti the sisters who are one and all fond of lucy i am glad he is going to be married for i think he is a man capable both of giving and receiving a large measure of domestic happiness i hope the dear little girls at st louis are well and you my darling o surely the sun is piercing through the dark clouds once more and strength health and gladness returning o fill yourself with happy thoughts for you have filled others with joy strength will do so for countless generations from these hearts flows back and will ever flow a steady current of love the beautiful fruits of love when you next send me a paper if you feel that you are getting on ever so little dearest friend just a dash under the word london i have looked back at all your old addresses i see you never do put any lines so i shall know it was not done absently but really means you are better and how that line will gladden my eyes darling love from us all goodbye anne gilchrist letter xviii anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq n w dec my dearest friend the papers with prof youngs speech came safely i read it my hand in yours happy and full of interest are you getting on my darling when i know that you no longer suffer from distressing sensations in the head can move without such effort and difficulty a hymn of thankfulness will go up from my heart perhaps this week i shall get the paper with the line on it that is to tell me so much or at least that you are well on your way towards it and what shall i tell you about the quiet tenor of our daily lives here but that is very restricted though i trust as far as it goes good healthful o the thoughts and hopes that leap from across the ocean the years but they hide themselves away when i want to put them into words do not think i live in dreams i know very well it is strictly in proportion as the present the past have been busy shaping preparing the materials of a beautiful future that it really will be beautiful when it comes to exist as a present seeing how it needs must be entirely a growth from all that has preceded it that there are no sudden creations of flowers of happiness in men women any more than in the fields but if the buds lie ready folded ah what the sunshine will do what fills me with such deep joy in your poems is the sense of the large complete acceptiveness the full perfect faith in humanity in every individual unit of humanity thus for the first time uttered that alone satisfies the sense of justice in the soul responds to what its own nature compels it to believe of the infinite source of all that too includes within its scope the lot as well as the man his infinite undying self must achieve and fulfil itself out of any all experiences why if it takes such ages such vicissitudes to compact a bit of rock fierce heat icy cold storms deluges crushing pressure slow subsidences as if it were like a handful of grass all sunshine what would it do for a man dec the longedfor paper has come to hand o it is a slow struggle back to health my darling i believe in the main it is good news that is come and there is the little stroke i wanted so on the address but for all that i feel troubled conscious for i believe you have been a great deal worse since you wrote and that you have still such a steep steep hill to climb perhaps if my hand were in yours dear walt you would get along faster dearer and sweeter that lot than even to have been your bride in the full flush strength and glory of your youth i turn my face to the westward sky before i lie down to sleep deep steadfast within me the silent aspiration that every year every month week may help something to prepare and make fitter me and mine to be your comfort and joy we are full of imperfections shortcomings but half developed but half possessing our own souls but we grow we learn we strive that is the best of us i think in the sunshine of your presence we shall grow fast i too my years notwithstanding may the new year lead you out into the sunshine again shed out of its days health strength so that you tread the earth in gladness again this with love from us all goodbye dearest friend anne gilchrist herby was at a conversation last night where were many distinguished men beautiful women among the works of art displayed on the walls was a fine photograph of you th afternoon and now a later post has brought me the other no of the graphic with your own writing in it so full of life and spirit so fresh cheerful vivid dear friend it seems to scatter all anxious sad thoughts to the winds and are you then really back at washington i wonder or have you only visited it in spirit written the recollection of former evenings i shall have none but cheerful thoughts now i shall reread it carefully read it to the young folk at tea tonight letter xix anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq london feb my dearest friend glad am i when the time comes round for writing to you again though i cant please myself with my letters poor little echoes that they are of the loving hoping farjourneying thoughts so busy within it has been a happy time since i received the paper with the joyful news you were back at washington well on your way to recovery able partially to resume work scenting from afar the fresh breeze sunshine of perfect health by this time not from afar perhaps the thought of that makes dull days bright bright days glorious to me too i note in the new york graphic that a new edition of leaves of grass was called for sign truly that america is not so very slowly now absorbing the precious food she needs above all else perhaps dear friend even during your lifetime will begin to come the proof you will alone accept that your country absorbs you as affectionately as you have absorbed it i have had two great pleasures since i last wrote you one is that herby has read with a large measure of responsive delight leaves of grass quite through so that he now sees you with his own eyes has in his heart the living growing germs of a loving admiration that will grow with his growth strengthen every fibre of good in him also he read took much pride in my letters now shown him for the first time percy has had a fortnights holiday with us and looks better in health though still not altogether as i could wish he says he is getting such good experience he would not care just yet to change his post even for better pay music is his greatest pleasure he seems to get more enjoyment out of that than out of literature is acquiring some practical skill today feb th is my birthday dearest friend a day my children always make very bright happy to me and on it they make me promise to do nothing but what i like all day so i shall spend it with you partly in finishing this letter partly reading in the book that is so dear to me for that is indeed my soul coming into the presence of your soul filled by it with strength warmth joy in discouraged moods when oppressed with the consciousness of my own limitations failures lack of many beautiful gifts i say to myself what sort of a bird with unfledged wings are you that would mate with an eagle can your eyes look the sun in the face like his can you sustain your long lifelong flights upward can you rest in dizzy rocks overhanging dark tempestuous abysses is your heart like his a great glowing sun of love then i answer give me time i can bide my time a long long growing unfolding time that he draws me with such power that my soul has found the meaning of itself in him the object of all its deep deathless aspirations in comradeship with him means if life is not a mockery clean ended by death that the germs are in me that through cleaving loving ever striving up on i shall grow like him like but different the correlative what his soul needs desires and if when i reach america he is not so drawn towards me if seeing how often i disappoint myself needs must that he too is disappointed still i can hold bravely lovingly on to this inextinguishable faith hope with the added joy of his presence sometimes winning from him more more a dear friendship yielding him some joy comfort for he too turns with hope with yearning towards me bids me be satisfied at peace so i am so i will be my darling surely surely sooner or later i shall justify that hope satisfy that yearning this is what i say to myself to you this th birthday have i said it over over again that is because it is the undercurrent of my whole life the tribune with proctors lecture on the sun a great deal besides that interests me came safe a masterly lecture and two days ago came the philadelphia paper with prof mortons speech deeply interesting and as i read these things the feeling that they have come from been read by you turns them into poems for me goodbye my dearest friend anne gilchrist w rossettis marriage is to be the end of next month had a pleasant chat with mr conway who took supper with us a week or two ago letter xx anne gilchrist to walt whitman march th with full heart with eyes wet with tears of joy i know not what other deep emotion pain of yearning pity blent with the sense of grandeur dearest friend have i read and reread the great sacred poem just come to me o august columbus whose sorrows sufferings struggles are more to be envied than any triumph of conquering warrior as i see him in your poem his figure merges into yours brother of columbus completer of his work discoverer of the spiritual the ideal america you too have sailed over stormy seas to your goal surrounded with mocking disbelievers you too have paid the great price of health our columbus your accents pierce me through through your loving annie letter xxi anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq may my dearest friend two papers have come to hand since i last wrote one containing the memoranda made during the war precious records eagerly read treasured reread by me how the busy days slip by one so like another yet each with its own fresh pleasant flavour scent as like and as different as the leaves on a tree or the plants in the hedgerows days they are busy with humble enough occupations but lit up for me not only with the light of hope but with the halfhidden joy of one who knows she has found what she sought and laid such strong hold upon it that she fears nothing questions nothing no life or death nor in the end in her own imperfections flaws shortcomings for to be so conscious of these and to love and understand you so are proofs that the germs of all are in her perhaps in the warmth joyous sunshine of your presence would grow fast anyhow distance has not baffled her and time will not a great deal of needlework to be done at this time of year for my girls have not time for any at present it is not a good contrast or the right thing after longish hours of study much better household activity of any sort if they would but understand this in schools colleges for girls young women no healthier or more cheerful occupation as a relief from study could be found than household work sweeping scrubbing washing ironing cooking in the variety of it equable development of the muscles i should think equal to the most elaborate gymnastics i know very well how i have felt still feel the want of having been put to these things when a girl then the importance afterwards of doing them easily well without undue fatigue to all who aim to give practical shape to their ardent belief in equality fair play for all in domestic life under one roof at all events it is already feasible to make the disposals without ignominious distinctions not all the rough bodily work never ending leisure all to the other but a wholesome interchange and sharing of these not least too among the advantages of taking an active share in these duties is the zest the keen relish it gives to the hours not too easily secured for reading music besides i often think that just as the poem nature is made up half of rude rough realities and homely materials processes so it is necessary for women to construct their poem home on a groundwork of homeliest details occupations providing for the bodily wants comforts of their household and that without putting their own hands to this their poem will lack the vital fresh growing naturelike quality that alone endures and that of this soil will grow with fitting preparation culture noble more vigorous intellectual life in women fit to embody itself in wider spheres afterwards if the call comes this month of may that comes to you so laden with great and sorrowful beautiful tender memories and that is your birthmonth too i cannot say that i think of you more than at any other time for there is no month nor day that my thoughts do not habitually spontaneously turn to you refer all to you yet i seem to come closer because of the poems that tell me of what relates to that time but most of all when i think of your beloved mother because then i often yearn more than i know how to bear to comfort you with love and tender care and silent companionship may is in a sense a very real one my birthmonth too for in it were your poems first put into my hand i wish i were quite sure that you no longer suffer in your head and that you can move about without effort or difficulty perhaps before long there will be a paper with some paragraph about your health for though we say to ourselves no news is good news it is a very different thing to have the absolute affirmation of good news my children are all well and hearty i am thankful to say working industriously grace means to study the best system of kindergarten teaching i fancy she is well suited for kindergarten teaching that it is very excellent work herby is still drawing from the antique in the british museum i hope he will get into the academy this summer he is going to spend his holidays with his brother in south wales and we as usual at colne but that will not be till august did i tell you william rossetti and his bride were spending their honeymoon at naples have found it bitterly cold there i learn mr mrs conway their children are well eustace is coming to spend the afternoon with herby tomorrow goodbye my dearest friend annie gilchrist letter xxii anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq july my dearest friend are you well and happy and enjoying this beautiful summer london is in one sense a sort of big prison at this time of year but still at a wide open window with the blue sky opening to me a soft breeze blowing in the book that is so dear my lifegiving treasure open on my lap i have very happy times no one hundreds of years hence will find deeper joy in these poems than i breathe the fresh sweet exhilarating air of them bathe in it drink in what nourishes delights the whole being body intellect soul more than i nor could you when writing them have desired to come nearer to a human being be more to them forever forever than you are will be to me o i take the hand you stretch out each day i put mine into it with a sense of utter fulfilment i ask nothing more of time and of eternity but to live and grow up to that companionship that includes all th this very morning has come the answer to my question first i only saw the poem read it so elate soared with it to joyous heights said to myself he is so well again he is able to take the journey into massachusetts speak the kindling words then i turned over and my joy was dashed my darling such patience yet needed along the tedious path oh it makes me long with passionate longings with yearnings i know not how to bear to come to be your loving cheerful companion the one to take such care to do all for you to beguile the time to give you of my health as you have done to tens of thousands i do not doubt either but that you will get well i feel sure sure it will be given me to see you and perhaps a very slow gradual recovery is safest is the only way in this as in other matters to thoroughness a very speedy rally would be specious treacherous in the end leading you to do what you were not yet fit for i believe if i could only make you conscious of the love the enfolding love my heart breathes out toward you it would do you physical good manysided love mothers love that cherishes that delights so in personal service that sees in sickness suffering such dear appeals to an answering limitless tenderness wifes love ah you draw that from me too resistlessly i have no choice comrades love so happy in sharing all pain sorrow toil effort enjoyments thoughts hopes aims struggles disappointment beliefs aspirations childs love too that trusts utterly confides unquestioningly not more spontaneously wholly without effort or volition on my part does the sunlight flow into my eyes when i open them in the morning than does the sense of your existence enter like bright light into my awaking soul and then i send to you thoughts tender caressing thoughts that would fain nestle so close ah if you could feel them take them in let them lie in your breast each morning my children are all well dear friend herbert is going to spend his holidays with his brother in wales we shall all go to colne as usual the end of this month remain there through august and september so if you think of it address any paper you may send to earls colne halstead because i should get it a day sooner but it does not signify if you forget send it here it will be forwarded all right beatrice has just got through one of the govern exams in elementary mathematics and i hope herby has got into the academy but do not know for certain yet he works away zealously and with great delight in his work william rossetti and his wife are coming to dine with us wednesday they look so well and happy it does one good to see them the conways are going to ostend i think for their holiday when they come back are going to move into a larger house i heard an american lady miss whitman sing at a concert the other day who delighted me fascinated me i longed to kiss her after each song though some of them were poor enough verdi stuff but she contrived to impart genuineness beauty to them i hope you will hear her when she returns to america which will be soon i believe goodbye dearest friend beatrice herby grace join their love with mine i had the sweet little bridal poem all safe by the bye i liked that springfield paper very much your loving annie letter xxiii anne gilchrist to walt whitman earls colne sept my dearest friend the change down here has refreshed me more than usual and i find my mother still wonderful for her years the th able to get out daily in her bath chair for two or three hours to enjoy our being with her and suffering little or no pain from rheumatism now i hope you have had as glorious a summer harvest as we have and that you are able to be much out of doors and absorb the healthgiving influences dear friend such mornings so fresh and invigourating i have been before breakfast mostly in a beautiful garden the old priory garden with my beloved poems and the dewladen flowers and liquid light and sweet fresh air the sparkle of the pond delicious greenness of the meadows beyond rustling trees and had a joyful time with you my darling sometimes with thoughts that lay hold on the solid prizes of the universe sometimes so busy building up a home in america thinking dreaming hoping loving groping among dim shadows straining wistful eyes into the dim distance then to my poems again ah not groping then but hand in hand with you breathing the air you breathe with eyes ardently fixed in the same direction your eyes look heart beating strong with the same hopes aspirations yours beats with it does not need to be american to love america and to believe in the great future of humanity there it is curious to be human still more english to do that i love believe in understand her in through you but was always drawn towards her always a believer though in a vaguer way that a new glorious day for men women was dawning there and recognized a new distinctive american quality very congenial to me even in american virtues which you not perhaps rate highly or retard as decisively national not adequately or commandingly so at any rate did i ever tell you the cousin of mine who owns the priory here fought for two years in the secession war in the army of the potomac when burnside mcclellan were at the head john cowardine was major in a cavalry regiment was at vicksburg frederickburg c never wounded or but slightly had a good deal of outpost duty being just the right sort of a man for that has letters of approval from his generals of which he is not a little proud before that fought under the stars stripes in mexico has had a curiously adventurous career which he commenced by running away from a military college where he was being prepared for a cadetship enlisting as a private getting out of that by bye and working his way before the mast as a sailor then mining in california then in australia riding steeplechases keeper of the melrose hounds market gardening hotel keeping then on his way back to california cast ashore on one of the navigator islands where he remained for six months the only white man among savages who were friendly made much of him now come into a good estate married to a woman who seems to suit him well is healthy cheerful rich handsome he has fallen into indifferent health considerable depression of spirits perhaps he finds the atmosphere of squirearchical gentility very stagnant the bed of roses stifling perhaps too the severe privations he has at different times undergone have injured him i often think he was perhaps one of those your eyes rested on with pride admiration handsome tanfaced dressed in blue he is the very ideal of a soldier in appearance bearing has now some fine children of whom he is very fond it was just this time of year i received the precious letter and ring that put peace and joy and yet such pain of yearning into my heart pain for you my darling o sorrowing helpless love that waits and must wait useless afar off while you suffer but trying every day of my life to grow fitter more capable of being your comfort and joy and true comrade never to cease trying this side death or the other rejoicing in my children more than i ever rejoiced in them before now that in and through you i for the first time see and understand humanity myself included its divine nature its possibilities nay its certainties how i do long for you to see my children dear friend and for them to see and love you as they will love you and all their nature unfold and grow more vigorously and joyously under your influence gracie of whom you have photographs grows fast is such a fine blooming girl i hope soon to send you one of beatrice too they have been enjoying their visit here and are now gone home gracie for school beatrice for

had such a happy time with his brother in wales is looking as brown as a nut full of health life he had a swim in the sea every day he did succeed in getting into the academy will begin work there oct st be sure dear friend if there is a word about your health in any paper to send it me that is what i search for so eagerly to have the joyful news you are getting on but even if it is but so very very slowly still i would rather know the truth i do not like thinking of you mistakenly i want to send you the thoughts the yearnings that belong to you the cherishing love that enfolds you most tenderly of all when you suffer o if i could send it and the cheerful companionship beguiling the time while strength creeps back i hope your little nieces at st louis are well goodbye my dearest friend herby the only one here with me would like to join his love with mine annie gilchrist i go back the beginning of october sep th letter xxiv anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq london dec my dearest friend it did me much good to get your poem beautiful earnest eloquent words from the soul whose dear companionship mine seeks with persistent longing wrestling with distance time it seems to me too from your having spoken the poem yourself i may conclude you have made fair progress what i would fain know is whether you have recovered the use of the left side so far as to get about pretty freely and to have as much openair life as you need like and also whether you have quite ceased to suffer distressing sensations in the head if you can say yes to the first question will you in sign of it put a dash under the word london and if yes to the second under england when you next send me a paper unless indeed the paper itself contain a notice of your health but if it does not that would be an easy way of gladdening me with good news if good news there is i wish i could send you good letters dearest friend making myself the vehicle of what is stirring around me in life thought that would interest you for there is plenty but that is very hard to do though i watch hear read eagerly full of interest everything stirs in me a cloud of questions makes me want to see its relationship to what i hold already i am forever brooding pondering sifting testing but that is not the bent of mind that enables one to reproduce ones impressions in compact lively form so please dear friend be indulgent as indeed i know you will be of these poor letters of mine with their details of my children their iterated and reiterated expressions of the love and hope and aspiration you have called into life within me take them not for what they are but for all they have to stand for beatrice is at colne having got well through the exam we were anxious about in the autumn and is a very great comfort to my mother as i well knew she would be for a more affectionate devoted caretaking nature does not breathe with a strong active mental life of her own too so though missing her sorely i am well satisfied she should be there and the country life and rest are doing her a world of good my artist boy is working away cheerily at the r academy his heart in his work percy is coming to spend xmas with us he too continues well content with his work and in good health gracie is blooming the rossettis have had a heavy affliction this first year of their married life in the premature death of her only brother a young man of considerable promise barely the conways are well i feel more completely myself than i have done since my illness so you see dear friend if it has taken me quite four years to recover the lost ground one must not be discouraged if two do not accomplish it in your case i hope your little nieces at st louis are well and the brothers you are with and that you have many dear friends round you at camden i think my thoughts fly to you on strongest and most joyous wings when i am out walking in the clear cold elastic air i enjoy so much goodbye my dearest friend annie gilchrist a cheerful christmas a new year of which each day brings its share of restorative influence be yours letter xxv anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq dec i see my dearest friend i must not look for those dashes under the words i thought were going to convey a joyful confirmation of my hopes i see how the dark clouds linger full of pain indignation i read the paragraph but fuller still of yearning tenderness trust and hope i believe my dear love that what you need to help on your recovery is a womans tender cherishing love and care and that in that warm genial atmosphere the spring of life will be quickened once more and flow full and strong through all its channels as of old gradually not quickly even so i dare say but with plenty of patience with utmost intelligent care of all conditions favourable to health of diet of abundant oxygen in the rooms you inhabit of as much outdoor life as possible of happy cheerful companionship all the homely everyday domestic joys which are so helpful in their influences america is doing what nations in all times have done towards that which is profoundly new great that which discredits their old ideals and offers them strange fruits flowers from another world than that they have been content to dwell in all their lives but for all that i do not believe the precious seed is lying dormant even now everywhere a few in whose hearts it is treasured yields a noble growth since it is america that has produced you nourished your soul and body she is silently unnoticed producing men women who will justify you who will understand the meaning of all and respond with a love that will quicken exalt humanity as christs influence once did still it is inscrutable to me that the heart of america is not now passionately drawn toward the great heart that beats glows in these poems that drum taps at any rate are not as dear to her as the memory of her dead heroes sons brothers husbands it must be that they really do not reach the hands of the american people at large that the professedly literary cultivated class asking for nothing better than the pretty singsong sentimentalities which join them in their nonsense or else slavishly prostrating their judgments before the models of the past so perfect for their day so wholly inadequate for ours raise their voices so loud in newspapers magazines as to prevent or everywhere check the circulation jan the new year has come in bleakly keenly to the inner as well as to the outer sense with the papers full of the details of the dark fate of the emigrant ship of the terrible railway accidents percy was not able to join us at xmas through business but i am expecting him tonight my mother bears up against the cold wonderfully even continues to go out in her chair bees letters are very bright cheerful she indeed all my children enjoy the cold much provided they have plenty of outdoor exercise above all skating which they are now enjoying i too like it but am so haunted by the thought of the increased misery it brings to our hundreds of thousands of illfed illclothed illhoused i trust the family circle round you your nieces at st louis all near dear to you are well and that you have felt the warm grasp of many loving friends this wintry cloudy time my dearest and that there may breathe out of these poor words a warm bright glow of love and hope unrestricted trust in the future a gilchrist letter xxvi anne gilchrist to walt whitman earls colne halstead feb my dearest friend i have run down to colne for a glimpse of my dear bee whom i had not seen for five months and of my mother now i am alone with the latter beatrice taking my place at home with her brother sister for a week or two a wonderful evergreen my mother continues still able to face the keen winds the frost daily in her bath chair well swathed of course in eiderdown flannels beatrice takes beautiful care of her is happy content with her life here loving the country as dearly as i do having time enough for study reading as well as for domestic activities to keep her mind as busy as her body how i do long for you to see my children dearest friend i wonder if you are surrounded with any in your brothers home young growing blossoming plants that gladden you and i wonder if the winter which i hear is so severe in america this year tries you whether you can yet move briskly enough to keep up the circulation and whether you have as many dear friends round you as you had at washington in my walks i keep thinking of these things write me a little letter once more it would do me such good no one of all your friends so easy as i to write to because none to whom any every little detail is so welcome so precious lifting a tiny corner of the great vast of space between us giving me for a moment to feel the friendly grasp of your hand i that long for it so two years are over since your illness began or seemed to begin dearest friend so slow stealthy in its approaches so slow stealthy in its retreat may the spring that is coming the birds have already caught sight of it cold brown bare as the landscape still is may it but come laden with healing strengthening refreshing influences so that you begin to feel again the joyous freedom of health warbling once more a song of joy for lilac time true i know indeed my dearest that anyhow you are content not grudging the price paid for your life work but even some way or other the richer for paying it garnering precious equivalents for pain privation of health in your inmost soul i cannot choose but believe this earnestly the resplendent faith that there is not one cause nor result lamentable at last in the universe which glows throughout the poems is for me an exhaustless source of strength comfort i see every now then like the more each time the conways i am half afraid mr conway works too incessantly that is does not like well enough the indispensable supplement of close mental work plenty of air exercise c hates walking indeed it is not to be wondered at in great smoky london i shall be fond enough proud enough of it too when i am over the atlantic unless one has a real passion for open air the sense of sky overhead like me i hear mr conway is coming to america for six months in october feb i kept my letter till today that i might have the happiness of speaking to you on my birthday see me this evening in the bright cheerful parlour of our cottage which stands just in the middle of the old village it has been a village jogged on through all change at its own sober sleepy pace this years my mother in her arm chair by the fire i chatting with her working or playing to her when she is awake with the poems i love beside me reading musing wondering while she dozes ah shall i ever attain to the ideal that burst upon me with such splendour of light joy in those poems in so filling so possessing me i seemed as if i had by one bound attained to that ideal as if i were already a very twin of the soul from whom they emanated but now i know that divine foretaste indicated what was possible for me not what was accomplished i know the slow growth the standstill winters that follow the growing joyous springs ripening summers i believe it will take more lives than this one to reach that mountain on which i was transfigured again never to descend more but to start thence for new heights fresh glories ah dear friend will you be able to have patience with me for me goodbye my dearest anne gilchrist letter xxvii anne gilchrist to walt whitman marquis rd camden sq london may my dearest friend since last i wrote to you at the beginning of april enclosing a little photograph of that avenue just by our cottage at colne i have been into wales for a fortnight to see percy have looked for the first time in my life on the atlantic the ocean my mental eyes travel over beyond so often and that your eyes and ears heart have been fed by have communed with and interpreted as in a new tongue to the soul of man looking upon that watching the tides ebb flow on your shores sharing through my beloved book in those greatest movements you have spent alone with it that was a new joyful experience a fresh kind of communing with you i went to wales because i felt anxious about percy who is not happy just now i must not tell friends here about it except his brother sisters but i am sure i may tell you for you will listen with sympathy he has attached himself very deeply i think it will prove to a girl she to him whose parents welcomed him cordially to their house for a year or two allowed plenty of intercourse till they became aware through percy himself who thought it right to tell the father as soon as he was fully aware of his own feelings more than suspected norahs response to them that there was a strong affection growing up between the two then they peremptorily forbade all intercourse not because they have any objection to percy quite the contrary they say but solely and simply because he is not yet earning money enough to marry on they hold that a man has no right to engage a girls affections till he can do so as if these things could be timed to the moment the money comes in percy was in hopes so was i that if i went down i might get sense enough into their heads if not kindness sympathy into their hearts to see that the sole effect of such arbitrary narrowsighted conduct would be to alienate embitter the young peoples feelings toward them while it would make them more restless anxious to marry without adequate means whereas if a reasonable amount of intercourse were allowed it would be a happy time with them norah being still so young percy working away with all his might doing very well for his age sure conscientious thorough capable well trained worker that he is for the l school of mais gives a first rate scientific preparation for his profession to be making a modest sufficiency in a year or two well they were very courteous indeed friendly to me i think i have won over the mother but the father remains obdurate percy feels bitterly the separation all the more trying as they live almost within sight of each other so beatrice grace are going to spend their holidays with him this summer to cheer him up meanwhile dear friend i am on the whole happier than not about him i liked what i saw of norah believe he has found a very sweet affectionate girl of quiet domestic nature practical industrious sensible thoroughly well to suit him that there is true deep love between them also she took to me very much i feel will be quite another child to me it is besides no little joy to me to find how percy has confided in me in this chooses me as the friend to whom he tells all far from being any separation as sometimes happens this love of his seems to draw us closer together only i am very very anxious for his sake to see him in a better berth they would let her marry him on l a year now he has only l he is quite competent to manage iron or copper or tin works only he looks so young not having yet any beard or moustache to speak of that is the end of my long story this will reach you on your birthday perhaps my dearest friend at any rate it must bear you a greeting of love and fond remembrance for that dear day such as my heart will send you when it actually comes patiently waiting heart with the fibres of love and boundless trust joy hope which bind me to you bedded deep grown to be during these long years a very part of its immortal substance untouchable by

earls colne aug my dearest friend your letter came to me just when i most needed the comfort of it when i was watching and tending my dear mother as she gently slowly with but little suffering sank to rest there was no sick bed to sit by we got her up and out into the air and sunshine for an hour or two even the day before she died no disease only the stomach could not do its work any longer for the last three weeks she lived wholly on stimulants suffering somewhat from sickness she drew her last breath very gently before daybreak on the th inst in her th year which she had entered in jan she looked very beautiful in death notwithstanding her great age as well she might tranquil sunset that it was of a beautiful day a fulfilled life joy delight of her father in youth who used to call her the apple of his eye good wife devoted selfsacrificing wise mother patient courageous sufferer through thirty years of chronic rheumatism which however neutralized ceased its pains the last few years unsurpassed indeed i think unsurpassable in conscientiousness in the strong sense of duty perfect obedience to that highest sense she is one of those who amply justify your large faith in women i do not need to tell you anything my dearest friend you know all i feel your strong comforting hand i press it very close i had all my children with me at the funeral o the comfort your dear letter was is to me thinking over over the few words you say of yourself what is said in the paper so eagerly read every word so welcome i cannot help fancying that the return of the distressing sensations in the head must be caused by your having worked at the book the two rivulets i dearly like the title the idea of bringing the poems prose together so that you must be more patient with yourself and submit still to perfect rest that perhaps in regard to the stomach you have not enough adapted your diet to the privation of exercise that you must be more indulgent to the stomach too in the sense of giving it only the very easiest simplest work to do my children join their love with mine your own loving anne illustration facsimile of one of anne gilchrists letters to walt whitman illustration facsimile of one of anne gilchrists letters to walt whitman letter xxix anne gilchrist to walt whitman torriano gardens camden rd nov london i have been wanting the comfort of a talk with you dearest friend for weeks weeks without being able to get leisure tranquillity enough to do it to my hearts content indeed hearts content is not for me at present but restless eager longing to come the struggle to do patiently completely wisely what remains for me here before i am free to obey the deep faith and love which govern me so let me sit close beside you my darling feel your presence take comfort strength serenity from it as i do as i can when with all my heart soul i draw close to you realizing your living presence with all my might first about percy things are beginning to look a little brighter for him he is just entering upon a new engagement with some very large successful works the blenavon iron co where though his salary will not be higher at first his opportunities of improvement will be better he is also to be allowed to take private practice in assaying analyzing the manager there believes in science is friendly to percy will give him every facility for showing what he can do so that he hopes to prove to the directors before long that he is worth a good salary the parents of norah whom he loves have released from their unfriendly attitude since my beatrice has been staying with them the two girls have attached themselves to one another per has had delightful opportunities of being with norah best of all she is to return here with beatrice they are coming tomorrow per is to have a weeks holiday come up so that he norah will be wholly together have i suspect the happiest week they have yet had in their lives then i have stored away for them the furniture of the dear old home at colne i really think that by the time is out they will be able to marry i see and indeed i have known ever since he formed this attachment that i must not look for him to come to america with me but what i build upon dearest friend is that when i have been a little while in america have made friends had time to look about me i might hear of a good certainty for him his excellent training at the school of mines large experience at blenavon energy ability sturdy uprightness will make him a firstrate manager of works by bye but the leaving him so happy with his young wife will make it easier for us to part nov beatrice has begun to work at anatomy at the school of medicine for women lately founded seems to delight in her work she will not enter on the full course all at once i am for taking things gently women have plenty of strength but it is of a different kind from mens must work by gentler slower means above all i do not like what pushes violently aside domestic duties pleasures the special work must combine itself with these i am sure it can herby is getting on very nicely never did student love his work better he is eager by making the best use of present opportunities advantages yet looking towards america full of cheerful hopes sympathy grace is less developed in intellect but not less in character than the others i cant describe her but send you her photograph there is a freshness independence of character about her yet withal a certain waywardness reserve she is a good instinctive judge of character more influenced by it than by books yet with a growing taste for them too she comes to america with a gay and buoyant curiosity declining to make up her mind about anything till she gets there we want as far as possible to transplant our home bodily to bring as much as we can of our own furniture because we have beautiful old things precious in herbys eyes that we are all fond of and by coming straight to philadelphia taking a house somewhere on the outskirts of it or camden immediately we fancy this might be practicable but have not yet launched into the matter i have just heard from mr rossetti and also from mrs conway of her husband having seen you if his report be not too sanguine it is a cheering one would comfort me much dearest friend but what he says is so favourable i am afraid to believe it altogether knowing that you would make the very best of yourself indeed be probably at your best with the pleasure of seeing an old friend fresh from england nov and now dear friend i have had a very great pleasure indeed thanks to you a visit from mr marvin i hope to have another when he returns from paris and the account he gives of you is so cheerful so vivid it seems to part asunder a gloomy cloud that was brooding in my mind and though i know that for the short hours that you feel bright well are many long hours when you are far otherwise still i feel sure those short hours are the earnest of perfect recovery with a fine patience boundless patience and now i can picture you sitting in your favourite window having a friendly word with passersby feel quite sure that you are happy comfortable in your surroundings and a great deal else full of interest mr marvin told me i was loth for him to go but one hour is so small we have noticed for a friend i am sorry to say william rossetti has a little girl which is a great delight to him miss hillard of brooklyn has also paid me a visit spoken to me of you she charmed me much only i felt a little cross with her for giving herby such a dismal account of his chances as an artist in america however we both refused to be discouraged for after all he can send his pictures to england to be established c having plenty of friends who would see to it we are both firm in the faith that if you can only paint the really good pictures the rest will take care of itself somehow or other that can be done as well in america as in england but of course he must finish his training here with best love from us all goodbye my dearest friend anne gilchrist letter xxx anne gilchrist to walt whitman torriano gardens camden rd london dec though it is but a few days since i posted a letter my dearest friend i must write you again because i cannot help it my heart is so full so full of love sorrow struggle the day before yesterday i saw mr conways printed account of you instead of the cheerful report i had been told of he speaks of your having given up hope of recovery those words were like a sharp knife plunged into me they choked me with bitter tears dont give up that hope for the sake of those that so tenderly passionately love you would give their lives with joy for you why who knows better than you how much hope the will have to do with it i know quite well that the belief does not depress you that you are ready to accept either lot with calmness cheerfulness perfect faith perhaps with equal joy but for all that it does you harm ideas always have a tendency to accomplish themselves and what right have the doctors to utter gloomy prophecies the wisest of them know the best how profoundly in the dark they are as to much that goes on within us especially in maladies like yours o cling to life with a resolute hold my beloved to bless us with your presence unspeakably dear beneficent presence me to taste of it before so very long now thirsting pining loving me take through these poor words of mine some breath of the tender tender ineffable love that fills my heart and soul and body take of it to strengthen the very springs of your life it is capable of that o its cherishing warmth and joy if it could only get to you only fold you round close enough would help i know soon soon as ever my boy has one to love care for him all his own i will come i may not before not if it should break my heart to stop away from you for his welfare is my sacred charge nearer dearer than all to me verily my god strengthen me comfort me stay for me let that have a little beginning on this dear earth which is for all eternity which will live grow immortally into a diviner reality than the heart of man has conceived i am well satisfied with norah dear friend she is very affectionate loveable prudent clear in all practical matters well suited to percy in tastes c your own annie letter xxxi anne gilchrist to walt whitman blaenavon routzpool mon england jan my dearest friend do not think me too wilful or headstrong but i have taken our tickets we shall sail aug for philadelphia i found if i did not come to a decision now we could not well arrange it before next summer and since we have come to a decision my mind has been quite at rest do not feel any anxiety or misgivings about us i have a clear and strong conviction i am doing what is right best for us all after a busy anxious time i am having a week or two of rest with percy who i find fairly well in health prospering in his business indeed he bids fair to have a large private practice as an analyst here is already making income enough to marry on only there is to build the nest i think he will have actually to build it for there seem no eligible houses to furnish so that the wedding will not be till next spring or early summer nevertheless with a definite goal a definite time the way between not so very rugged though rather dull and lonely i think he will be pretty cheery this little town of inhabitants all miners smelters c lies up among the hills ft above the sea glorious hills here spreading then converging with wooded flanks swift brooklets leaping over stones in the hollows the air too of course deliciously light pure i have heard through a friend of ours of bees fellow student who lives in camden mr suerkrop i think his name is that we shall be able to get a very comfortable home with pleasant garden there for about l per an i think i can manage that very well so all i need is to hear of a comfortable lodging or boarding house the former preferred where we can be avoiding hotels even while we hunt for the house i have arranged for my goods to sail a week later than we do so as to give us time goodbye for a short while my

store for us years of tranquil tender happiness me making your outward life serene sweet you making my inward life so rich me learning growing loving we shedding benign influences round us out of our happiness and fulfilled life hold on but a little longer for me my walt i am straining every nerve to hasten the day i have enough for us all with the simple unpretending ways we both love best percy is battling slowly doing as well as we could expect in the time i think he will soon build the nest for his mate i think he never in his heart believed i really should go to america and so it comes as a great blow to him now you must be very indulgent towards him for my sake dear friend i am glad we know about those rascally book agents for many of us are wanting a goodish number of copies of the new edition it is important to understand we may have them straight from you rossetti is making a list of the friends the number so that they may all come together perhaps dearest friend you may be having a great difficulty in getting the books out for want of funds if so let me help a little show your trust in me and my love thus generously your own loving annie letter xxxiii anne gilchrist to walt whitman torriano gardens march i have had such joy this morning my darling poems of yours given in the daily news sublime poems one of them reaching dizzy heights filling my soul with strong delight these prefaced by a few words timid enough yet kindly in tone better than nothing the days the weeks are slipping by my beloved bearing me swiftly surely to you before the beauty of the year begins to fade we shall come the young folk too are full of bright anticipation eagerness now i am thankful to say and percy getting on with i trust such near definite prospect of his happiness that he will be able to pull along cheerily towards it after we are gone in spite of loneliness i expect darling we must go to some little town or village ten or twenty miles short of philadelphia till the tremendous influx of visitors to the centennial has ceased else we shall not be able to find a corner there by the bye i feel a little sulky at your always taking a fling at the poor piano i see i have got to try show you it too is capable of waking deep chords in the human soul when it is the vehicle of a great masters thought emotions if only my poor fingers prove equal to the task all my heart shall go into them take from my picture a long long look of tender love and joy and faith deathless ever young ever growing ever learning aspiring love tender cherishing domestic love oh may i be full of sweet comfort for my beloveds soul and body through life through and after death anne gilchrist letter xxxiv walt whitman to anne gilchrist camden new jersey march dearest friend to your good comforting letter of feb th i at once answer at least with a few lines i have already written this morning a pretty full letter to mr rossetti to answer one just recd from him requested him to loan it you for perusal in that i have described my situation fully candidly my new edition is printed ready upon receipt of your letter i sent you a set two vols by mail march which you must have recd by this time i wish you to send me word soon as they arrive my health i am encouraged to think is perhaps a shade better certainly as well as any time of late i even already vaguely contemplate plans they may never be fulfilled but yet again they may of changes journeys even of coming to london seeing you visiting my friends c my dearest friend i do not approve your american transsettlement i see so many things here you have no idea of the social and almost every other kind of crudeness meagreness here at least in appearance dont do anything towards it nor resolve in it nor make any move at all in it without further advice from me if i should get well enough to voyage we will talk about it yet in london you must not be uneasy about me dearest friend i get along much better than you think for as to the literary situation here my rejection by the coteries and the poverty which is the least of my troubles am not sure but i enjoy them all besides as to the latter i am not in want letter xxxv anne gilchrist to walt whitman torriano gardens camden rd london march yesterday was a day for me dearest friend in the morning your letter strong cheerful reassuring dear letter in the afternoon the books i dont know how to settle down my thoughts calmly enough to write nor how to lay down the books with delicate yet serviceable exterior with inscription making me so proud so joyous but there are a few things i want to say to you at once in regard to our coming to america i will not act without further advice from you but as to not resolving on it dear friend i cant exactly obey that for it has been my settled steady purpose resting on a deep strong faith ever since nor do i feel discouraged or surprised at what you say of american crudeness c of which in truth one hears not a little in england i have not shut my eyes to the difficulties and trials responsibilities for the childrens sake of the enterprise i am not urged on by any discontent with old england or by any adverse circumstances here which i might hope to better there my reasons emotions the sources of my strength and courage for the uprooting transplanting all are inclosed in those two volumes that lie before me on the table that america has brought them forth makes me want to plant some at least of my children on her soil i understand believe in love her in through them they teach me to look beneath the surface to get hints of the great future that is shaping itself out of the crude present i believe we shall prove to be of the right sort to plant down there o to talk it all over with you dearest friend here in london first i feel as if that would really be the joy the comfort of that i cannot finish this today but send what i have written without delay that you may know of the safe arrival of the books with reverent grateful love from us all anne gilchrist letter xxxvi anne gilchrist to walt whitman torriano gardens camden rd london april my dearest friend i must write again out of a full heart for the reading of this book the two rivulets has filled it very full ever the deep inward assent rising up strong exultant my immortal self recognizing responding to your immortal self ever the sense of dearness the sweet subtle perfume pervading every page every line to my sense o i cannot put into any words what i perceive nor what answering emotion pervades me flows out towards you sweetest deepest greatest experience of my life what i was made for surely i was made as the soil in which the precious seed of your thoughts emotions should be planted try to fulfil themselves in me that i might by bye blossom into beauty bring forth rich fruits immortal fruits so no doubt other women feel and future women will do not dissuade me from coming this autumn my dearest friend i have waited patiently years patiently yet often especially since your illness with such painful yearning your heart would yearn towards me if you realized it i cannot wait any longer nor ought i to that would indeed be sacrificing the prudence that concerns itself with immortal things to the prudence that concerns itself only with temporary ones but indeed even so far as this latter is concerned there is no sacrifice for any it is by far the best step for instance i could take on beatrices account she is heartily in earnest in her medical studies i am persuaded too it is a splendid training for her whether or no she ever makes a moneyearning profession of it and in england women have at present no means of obtaining a complete medical education they cannot get admission to any hospital for the clinical part of the course so that she is exceedingly anxious to come where it is possible for her to follow out her aims effectually then i am confident she will find america congenial to her that she is in her essential nature democratic that she has the intelligence the sympathies earnestness affectionateness unconventionality needed to pierce through appearances surface crudeness see love the great reality unfolding below so i believe has herby then an artist is as free as an author to work where he pleases reaps as much from fresh and widened experiences he does not contemplate cutting himself off from england will exhibit here very likely take a studio in london for a season a couple of years hence to work among old friends associations so have double chance opportunities then above all dearest friend they too see america in through you they too would fain be near you have no anxiety or misgivings for us let us come be near you see if we are made of the right sort of stuff for transplanting to american soil only advise us where if it be philadelphia which as far as offering facilities for beatrice would as far as i can learn suit us very well we must not come i think till the end of october because of its being so full perhaps indeed dearest friend but dare not build on it we shall talk this over in england if you are able to take the journey it might and would be sure to do you good as well as to rejoice the hearts of english friends but if not if we are not able to talk over our coming do not feel the least anxious about us we shall light on our feet do very well percy seems getting on fairly well considering what a bad time it is in his line of business i think he will be able to marry this autumn or following winter i shall go and spend a month with him in july perhaps indeed if as many are prophecying the iron trade does not recover its old preeminence here he may be glad by bye that i have gone over to america opened a way for him but if he does not follow me then if i live i hope to spend a few months with him every three or four years instead of as now a few weeks once a year anyhow we have to live widely apart thanks for the papers just received specially welcome the account of some strangers interview with you for me too before very long now the joy of hearing the strong musical voice read the wound dresser or speak i have happy thoughts for my companions all day long helping me over every difficulty strengthening me goodbye dearest friend love from us all a gilchrist letter xxxvii anne gilchrist to walt whitman torriano gardens camden rd london may just a line of birthday greeting my dearest friend may it find you enjoying the beautiful springtime the grand sights of people products the music at philadelphia notwithstanding drawbacks but lessening drawbacks i earnestly hope of health lameness rejoiced too perhaps with the sight of many dear old friends occasion has brought to your city may all that will do you good come my dearest friend and not least the sense of relief joy in having fulfilled the great task in the teeth of such difficulties relaunched safely more fully richly equipt the ship to sail down the great ocean of time bearing precious precious freight of seed to be planted in countless successions of human souls helping forward more than even the best lovers of your poems dream the great future of humanity that is what i believe as surely as i believe in my own existence the low star the great star drooping low in the west has been unusually resplendent of a night here lately by day lilacs the labernums wonderfully brightening dear old smoky london constant reminders all if i needed any of the poet the poems so dear to me if i do not hear from you to the contrary i am to take our passage by one of the states line of steamers that come straight to philadelphia sailing about the st sept i am told one ought to secure ones cabin a couple of months or so beforehand but if there be indeed an increasing hope of your coming here in the course of the summer or if you think it would be best for us to go to new york only i want to go at once where we are likely to stop because of my furniture let me hear as soon as may be dear friend looking at it purely as concerns the young ones for some reasons it is very desirable to come this year for others to wait till next with bee for instance we are both losing time wasting money by going over another winter here when there is no complete satisfactory medical course to be had then as regards dear percy he writes me now that though he is doing fairly well he does not think he will be able to take a house marry till next summer that i am very sorry for but then i think that as i could not be with him

his wife a fine specimen of a leading bostonian besides these also a physician from florida whom i much admire with a beautiful firm tenor voice very handsome graceful too a true southerner i should say but of scotch extraction next week we go to boston i went over the lunatic asylum here the other day saw some strange sad sights some figures crouched down in attitudes of such profound dejection i shall never forget them some very bright and talkative it is said to be the best managed in america dr earle who is at the head is a man of splendid capacity for the post a noblelooking old man uncle of those miss chases you met at our house i cant settle to anything or think of any thing since i received percys letter but the baby norah love to you to mrs whitman hattie jessie goodbye dear friend anne gilchrist letter xxxix beatrice gilchrist to walt whitman new england hospital codman avenue boston highlands dear walt hospital life is beginning to seem a longaccustomed life i enjoy all the duties involved all the human relations even getting up in the night is compensated for by yielding a sense of importance independence i sleep in a large room with three windows three beds in a row breakfast at we are supposed to have seen all our patients before breakfast but do not keep to that rule after breakfast round to count pulses respirations note condition dress any wound in charge etc at past oclock go the rounds with the resident physician dr berlin all the students superintendent of nurses then put up medicine each for her own patients about in no give electricity etc if ones patient has an ache or pain the nurse whistles for the student my whistle is she sees the patient orders what is necessary or if serious reports to dr berlin then there is some microscopic work copying out the history daily record of the case making out the temperature charts more than fills in the day at oclock we all in conclave report about our patients talk over any interesting case one of my patients has empyema following pleurisy i inject into her chest about a doz of different preparations several of my patients i have all the very sick just now require very careful watching in the evening we go round again count pulses respirations note temperatures if a very sick patient in the middle of the day also take pulse etc the number of visits depending on the need the competency of the nurse i like introducing lint into wounds such simple ones as an incised abscess of the breast with the probe because if i take trouble enough i can do it without hurting the patient much to the patients surprise the other day mr mrs marvin called to see me with mrs miss callender i enjoyed their visit much today mr marvin drove over to fetch me to lunch i had a beautiful drive over to dorchester in the afternoon a game of lawn tennis a stroll down to the creek drive home by forest hill cemetery jamaica pond the air was fresh after a shower goldentinted the drive through beautiful lanes country all were friendly it was refreshing to emerge from the little hospital world mr marvins cordial face greeted me when i was speaking to some patients in hammocks under the trees the day he called much to my surprise i was today feeling the need of a little change of air scene so that the visit was most opportune mr morse is working away desperately at the bust of you he feels as if he would get on famously if he could only catch a glimpse of you now might not you come to boston on your way to chesterfield ride up in the open horsecars a very pleasant ride to see me also and give mr morse the benefit of a sitting how i wish we could get mrs stafford in here the patients get most excellent care i have great confidence in dr berlin in the attending physician i do not want her to come for a month because dr berlin has just gone away for a vacation i fear no mere visiting once a day of a doctor will do her any good she needs hygienic treatment massage a woman works here every day on the patients who need rubbing massage feeding up i have never yet seen a patient whom we could not make eat appetite or not by aid of beeftea milk perfect rest judicious treatment dr berlin is a learned charming woman of she takes advanced views gives no medicine at all in some cases if any few at a time but efficient she is perfectly unaffected very intelligent has been thoroughly trained she is a russian please give my love to mrs whitman remember me to colonel whitman this afternoon when driving with mr marvin i thought of the pleasant drives i have had with colonel whitman yours affectionately beatrice c gilchrist if it were not for records accumulating mountain high i should have time to write to my friends letter xl anne gilchrist to walt whitman sept chesterfield mass i am half afraid herby has got a malarious place by his description my dearest friend i had a lingering hope till herby went south again that i should have a letter from you in answer to mine saying you were coming up to see us here in truth it was a great disappointment to me his going back to philadelphia instead of your joining us or him either here or somewhere near to new york i wonder where that north amboyna is that you once mentioned to me and what kind of a place it is i have had a long quiet time here and have enjoyed it very much never did i breathe such sweet light pure air as is always blowing freely over these rocky hills rocky as they are and their sides ravines are strewn with huge boulders of every conceivable size shape they nourish an abundant growth of woods and i fancy the farmers here do a great deal better with their winter crops of lumber and bark and maple sugar than with their summer one of grain corn i expect herby has described our neighbours to you specially levi bryant the father of my hostess a farmer who lives just opposite and has put such heart soul and muscle sinew into his farming that he has continued to win quite a handsome competence from this barren soil it isnt muscle industry only that are wanted here but pluck and endurance hauling his timber up down over the snow through the drifts along roads that are pretty nearly vertical i am never tired of hearing his stories nor he of telling them of hairbreadth escapes for him his cattle when the harness or the shafts have broken under the tremendous strain nothing but coolness daring have got him or them out of it alive generally as he sits talking his little boy of eleven who bids fair to be like him and can now manage a team or a yoke of oxen as well as any man in the parish and work almost as hard sits close by him leaning his head on his fathers shoulder or breast for the rugged old fellow has a vein of great gentleness and affectionateness in him i notice the child nestles up to him always rather than to the mother who is all the same a very kind amiable good mother then there are neighbours of another sort up at the centre mr chadwick c from new york with whom i have pleasant chats daily when i trudge up to fetch my letters now then i get a delightful drive or go on a blackberrying party with the folks round i expect giddy over today we shall remain here together for about a fortnight then back to round hill where i am to meet the miss chase whom you may remember taking tea with liking then on to boston to see dear bee then to new york where we shall meet again at last i hope ere long love to mr mrs whitman i enjoy her letters also to hattie jessie who will hear from me by bye with love to you dear friend goodbye a gilchrist letter xli anne gilchrist to walt whitman concord mass oct th my dearest friend the days are slipping away so pleasantly here that weeks are gone before i know it the concord folk are as friendly as they are intellectual and there is really no end to the kindness received we are rowed on the beautiful river every day that it is warm enough a very winding river not much broader than your favourite creek flowing sometimes through level meadows sometimes round rocky promontories steep wooded hills which with their wonderful autumn tints are like a gay flower border mirrored in the water never in my life have i enjoyed outdoor pleasures more i hardly think so much enhanced as they are by the companionship of very lovable men and women they lead an easygoing life here seem to spend half their time floating about on the river or meeting in the evening to talk read aloud judge hoar says it is a good place to live and die in but a very bad place to make a living in beatrice spent one sunday with us here we walked to hawthornes old house in the morning in the afternoon to the old manse and to sleepy hollow most beautiful of last resting places tuesday we go on to boston for a week very loth to leave concord at least i am but giddy begins to long for city life again and then to new york about the th nov herby told you no doubt that i spent an hour or two with emerson and that he looked very beautiful and talked in a friendly pleasant manner a long letter from my sister in england tells me per looks well and happy is so proud of his little boy and that norah is really a perfect wife to him affectionate devoted and the best of housewives how glad i am herby is painting you i wonder if you like the landscape he is working on as well as you did timber creek miss hillard has undertaken the charge of a young ladys education and is very much pleased with her task she is in a delightful family who make her quite one with them live in the best part of new york and pay her a handsome salary she has the afternoons and saturday sunday to herself concord boasts of having been first to recognize your genius mr alcott mr sanborn say so goodbye dear friend a g letter xlii anne gilchrist to walt whitman somerset st boston nov my dearest friend i feel as if i didnt a bit deserve the glorious budget you sent me yesterday for i have been a laggard dull correspondent of late because leading such an unsettled kind of life i dont seem to have got well hold of myself beautiful is the title prose poem the glimpse of the autumn cornfield one smells the sweet fragrance basks in the sunshine with you tastes all the varied subtle outdoor pleasures just as you want us to a lady who has just been calling on me miss hillard no relation of the odious dr h said have you seen a lovely little bit about a cornfield by walt whitman in a new york paper she did not know your poems but was so taken with this by the bye i am not quite american enough yet to enjoy the sound of the locusts big grasshoppers ours are modest little things that only make a gentle sort of whirr not that loud brassy sound couldnt help wishing for more birds less insects when i was at chesterfield but i like our english name ladybird better than ladybug do your children always say when they see one as ours do ladybird ladybird fly away home your house is on fire your children are flown but for the rest i believe i am growing a very good american indeed certain am i there is no more lovable people to live amongst anywhere in the world and in this respect it has been good to give up having a home of my own here for awhile for i have been thrown amongst many more intimately than i could have been otherwise what you say of herbys picture delights me dear friend i have been grieving he was not with us sharing the pleasant times we have had and enlarging his circle of friends but after all he could not have been doing better he must come on here by bye i wonder if you are as satisfied with his portrait of you as with the landscape i suppose he is gone on to new york today i have sighed for dear little concord many times since i came away beautiful city as boston is many the interesting kindly people i am seeing here but the outdoor life the entirely simple unpretending cordial friendly ways of concord its inhabitants won my heart altogether one of them came to see me today to ask us to go and spend a couple of days with them there again before we leave i could not say nay though our time is short there are some portraits in the art museum here which interested me a good deal of adams hancock quincy c of some of the women of that time they would form an excellent nucleus of a national portrait gallery which together with good biographies while yet materials recollections are fresh abundant would be a very interesting important contribution to the worlds history tennysons letter is a pleasure to me to see considering his age the imperfection of his sight through life matters are better rather than worse with him than one could have expected since that was written a friend walter white tells me they the tennysons have taken a house in eaton sq london for the winter and last not least thanks for mr burroughss beautiful letter that young man is indeed as he says like a bit out of your poems there are two or three fine young men boarding here giddy i enjoy their society not a little love to your brothers sister i shall write soon as i am settled down in new york to her or hattie love to mrs stafford and most of all to you goodbye dear friend a gilchrist i will send ts letter in a day or two letter xliii anne gilchrist to walt whitman madison ave new york jan my dearest friend herby has told you of our difficulties in getting comfortable quarters here and also that we seem now to have succeeded not indeed in the way i most wished hoped we had in th st taking rooms boarding ourselves so that we could have a friend with us when as we pleased it seems as if that were not practicable unless we were to furnish for ourselves certainly our experiences there of using anothers kitchen were discouraging it was so dirty and uncomfortable that we were glad to take refuge in a regular boarding house again before one week was out it seems to me more difficult to get anything of a medium kind in new york than elsewhere i have been if it isnt the best it is very uninviting indeed herby is enjoying his work and companionship at the league very much we stand the cold well how does it suit you is your arm free from rheumatic pains when you come to mr j h johnstons which will be very soon i hope we shall be quite handy and have a pretty sunny room a sitting room by day with a handsome piece of furniture which is metamorphosed into a bed at night and a large dressing closet with hot cold water adjoining all very comfortable o how wistfully do i think of one evening in philadelphia last winter i shant begin really to like new york till you come and we have had some chats together i have news from england which makes me rather anxious the blaenavon co to which per is chemist has gone into liquidation i dont know whether it will continue to exist or how soon in these dull times he may find a good opening elsewhere should things go badly for him either giddy and i will return to england to share our home with him there or else i want him to take into serious consideration coming out here instead of our going back of course it would be a risky thing for him to do with wife child in these times unless some definite opening presented itself but i cannot help thinking that being an expert in his profession with first rate training experience and iron work metallurgy promising here to have such enormous developments he would be sure to do well in the end and meanwhile we could rub on together somehow however we shall see i have laid the matter before him he his dear little wife wrote me a very brave cheery letter when they told me the bad news i shall have an answer to mine i suppose by the end of the month kate hillard read an amusing paper on swinburne at a meeting of the womans club in brooklyn we had some fine music too for the rest i have not yet presented any introductions here have had some beautiful glimpses of the north east river effects of the shipping at sunset c have subscribed to the mercantile library are

our room of an evening for an hour or twos chat by the bye being connected with the iron trade he has been able to make some enquiries for me as to what pers chances as a scientific metallurgist would be in this country i am sorry to say he thinks they would be very poor indeed prof lesley said the same thing so it is clear i must not urge him to try the experiment seeing he has a wife child herby

again to one of miss booths receptions there met mrs croly had the best talk about you i have had this long while i like her cordiality we are going to her reception on sunday to one at mrs bigelows wednesday it is true there is not much that can be called social enjoyment at these crowded receptions but they enable you to start many acquaintanceships some of which turn out lasting good we had some fine harp playing a witty recital at miss booths miss selous is back in america i should not wonder if she comes on here soon bee is living at the dispensary now instead of in the hospital finds the comparatively outdoor life the freedom from being whistled for all hours of the day and night as she was there a wonderful refreshment that coloured lady mrs wiley whom you met once at our house is her fellow labourer room mate at the dispensary bee likes her much i am not sure whether you know the gilders we spent a couple of hours delightfully with them yesterday afternoon she has a very attractive face a musical voice such a sweet smile they are going to europe for a four months holiday this spring i admire the simple unconventional way in which they live herby is working away in the best spirits he is going to paint that bowling alley subject on a large scale giddy is sitting by me with her nose in the french dictionary working away at a novel of balzacs i have had scarcely any letters from england lately and the papers bring none but dismal tidings nevertheless i dont believe our sun is going down yet awhile we shall emerge from this dark crisis the better not the worse

friend john burroughs called last wednesday came to try turkish baths for his malarious trouble but it seemed to bring on his attacks of neuralgia worse i am sorry that i can report but poorly of his health so painfully excruciating was his neuralgia about his arms at times that a dr was sent for morphia injected in his wrist but i am glad to say he reported himself a little better he hopes that you will come and give the lecture on lincoln this winter why not confound it it would be most interesting quite often we go to miss booths receptions saturday evening they are gay amusing met mr

recite she recited the swineherd andersons charmingly the faithful lovers which took every one walk in miller was there i cant spell his name lots more this morning being sunday i took my skates to the park the wind was high whirled us about fantastically ladies seated in wicker chairs were pushed rapidly along the ponds smooth icy surface by their gentlemen escorts tall men kissed the ice or sprawled full length on their backs while others flew by like swallows all this with a church spire peeping behind hills dappled with snow sunshine what more inspiriting than this and now dear walt goodbye for the present herbert h gilchrist letter xlvii beatrice gilchrist to walt whitman warrenton st feb dear mr whitman although not in word i have thanked you for your letter papers by enjoying them thoroughly down at this dispensary we work just as hard as at the hospital but our spare minutes are our own no records to write out our work is under our own control we are out in fresh air half the day sometimes half the night making intimate acquaintance with all sorts of people places with far distant parts of boston we have all the responsibility that it is good for young doctors to have i e in all difficult or obscure dangerous cases we are obliged to call in older heads are obliged to report verbally to the visiting physician of the month all our cases our treatment only two students live at the dispensary dr wiley the coloured philadelphia student you saw myself in tastes we have much in common on the whole i prefer to live with her rather than with any of the other students we share rooms we have a bedroom a drugroom a treatment room waiting room for patients take our meals in the kitchen a widow woman with two children housekeeps i think boston a very beautiful city the public gardens commons in the busiest part sloping down from the gilt domed state house on beacon hill threaded by paths in all directions traversed by the business men the fine ladies the beggars etc etc one broad sloping path is given up to the boys who want to coast temporary wooden bridges being thrown over the cross paths then crossing south bay to south boston is a beautiful walk i take from one to four times a day south boston looks rather dingy it is inhabited mostly by artisans mill hands fishermen but walking up rd st as you cross the lettered streets a b c d etc you look down upon the harbour on bright days bright blue a few sails to be seen at sunset the colours of course are reflected gorgeously somehow or other the sea looks doubly beautiful set in dingy s boston far over in the west end too we have patients last tuesday i had twins all by myself only one however was born alive the other had been dead a week how delightful that you are feeling so much better shall you not be coming to boston sometime before i leave st june the boston i know is not the boston i knew in books i am as far off from that as if i lived in england is not the hub i was reminded of that last sunday when i had time for once to go to church went to hear mr e e hale preach and went home to dinner with him i like his daughter whom we knew in philadelphia she is a clever young artist dr wiley is very popular with her patients far more so than i please remember me to all the staffords give my especial love to mrs stafford also to mrs whitman yours affectionately beatrice c

the morning giddy and i set at home busy with needle work letter writing and reading after lunch we go out for a walk or to pay visits and of an evening very often to receptions but they are not half so jolly as our evenings at philadelphia still we have a lively pleasant time i like miss booth very much with her kindly generous character and active practical mind so i do mrs croly she is more impulsive and enthusiastic kate hillard often goes with us she is always good company i had a note from edward carpenter the other day brought by a lady who had been living near him at sheffield an american lady with two very fine little girls who has lately lost her husband in england and was on her way back to her parents home in pennsylvania somewhere beyond pittsburg she is one who loves your poems has great hopes of seeing you in new york she told me her little girls were so fond of carpenter he of them he is first rate with children i hope you will not put off coming to new york till we are returning to philadelphia which will be some time in may i find beatrice is so anxious to get further advantages for study in england or paris before she begins to practise and herby is so strongly advised by mr eaton of whose judgment experience he thinks very highly to study in durons studio in paris for a year that i have made up my mind to go back for a time at any rate this summer but i shall leave my furniture here and the question of where our future home is to be open herby is making great progress i wish you could see the head of an old woman he has just painted and i wish

anne gilchrist to walt whitman glasgow friday june my dearest friend we set foot on dry land again wednesday morning after a good passage not a very smooth one and not without four or five days of seasickness but after that we really enjoyed the sea the sky it was mostly cloudy but such lovely lights and shades invigorating breezes and as we got up into northern latitudes daylight in the sky all night through the last three days we had glorious scenery sailed close in under the giants causeway on the north coast of ireland great sort of natural ramparts bastions or rock wonderfully grand then we sailed on lough fozle to land a group of irish folk at moville some of them old people who had not seen ireland for forty years and who were so happy they did not know what to do with themselves and what with this human interest and the first getting near land again and the rich greenandgolden gorsecovered hills the setting sun streaming along the beautiful lough with golden light it was a sight a time i shall never forget then we entered the firth of clyde sailed among the islands mountainous arran level bute on the other hand the green hills of ayr with pleasant towns nestled under them sloping to the clyde this was during the night we did not go to bed at all it was so beautiful then came a gorgeous sunrise then the landing at greenock a short railway journey to glasgow the tide not serving to bring our big ship up so far we had very pleasant learned withal companions on the voyage the professor of greek of philosophy from harvard and a young student from concord all of whom we have seen since we landed and hope to see often again especially the young student frank bigelow who is a very nice fellow herby enjoyed the voyage much so did giddy glasgow is a great solidly built city very pleasant in spite of smoky atmosphere full of sturdy rosycheeked people with broad scotch accent we have been rushing about shopping have not yet seen per shall meet him at durham in a weeks time spend a month together there where he will be superintending your works meanwhile we are going to edinburgh for a few days i kept thinking of you on the voyage dear friend wondering how you would like it whether you could stand being stowed away in the little boxlike berth at night i should recommend any american friend coming over to try this line we had a fine ship fine officers crew the latter part fine scenery love to your brother sister to mr burroughs address to me for the present care percy c gilchrist blaenavon poutzpool mon love from us all i shall write

little fellow you ever saw asleep beside me giddy and norah my d daughter are gone into durham to do some shopping bee is up in london on her way to berne in switzerland where she has finally decided to complete her medical studies herby is i think staying with eustace conway at hammersmith just now he has been spending a week at brighton with edward carpenter his family but i will leave him to tell his own news we are lodging in this little village with its redtiled roofs gray stone walls lying among wooded hills corn fields meadows and collieries on the banks of the weir for the sake of being near percy his wife he is superintending here the erection of some kilns for making the peculiar kind of basic firebricks needed in his dephosphorization process durham cathedral which was mainly built soon after the norman conquest is in sight crowning a wooded hill that rises abruptly from the riverside it looks as solid majestic venerable as the rocks hills the interior is of wonderful grandeur beauty when you enter one of these cathedrals you are tempted to say architecture is a lost art with us moderns so far as sublimity is concerned except in vast engineering works you would not dignify the weir with the name of a river in america it is no bigger than timber creek but it winds about so capriciously through the picturesque little city as to make almost an island of the hill on which the castle cathedral stand to need three great solid stone bridges within a quarter of a mile of each other with its steep wooded sides carrying nature right into the heart of the old town but the rainy season we have scarcely seen the sun since we have been in england i believe it is the same in france italy and the great depression in trade especially the coal iron which chiefly concerns this district seem to cast a gloom over everything there are whole rows of colliers cottages in this village empty where they go to no one knows but as soon as the collieries reopen they will all reappear we often meet colliers returning from work they look as if they had just emerged from hades poor fellows their faces black as soot their lean bowed legs bare i believe the mines are hot here they work with little on but they are really the cleanest of all workmen as they take a bath every night on their return before supping the speech here is almost like a foreign tongue to any one from the south or middle of england i wonder if you have yet read dr buckes book it is about the only thing i have read since my return it suggests deeply interesting trains of thought i wonder if you are at camden taking your daily trips across the ferry strolls up chestnut st i hardly realized till i left it how dearly i love america great sunny land of hope and progress or how my whole life has been enriched with the human intercourse i had there give my love to those of our friends whom you know tell them not to forget us i have had a long letter from emma lazarus i suppose hattie and jessie are spending their holidays at camden that hattie has pretty well done with school we have been chiefly busy with needlework since we came preparing dear bee for berne i miss her sadly had quite hoped we should have all been together at paris this winter but it seems the course is much longer more arduous there we spent a week in edinburgh before we came on here it is by far the most beautiful city i have ever seen the journey between it and berwickontweed lies through the richest best cultivated farm land in britain the sea sparkling on one side of us these fertile fields dotted with splendid flocks herds with large comfortablelooking farmhouses here there an old castle it was singularly enjoyable how i have wished everywhere that you were with us to share the sight and the best is that you would return home more than ever proud rejoicing in america it is a land where humanity is having and is going to have such chances as never before giddy sends her love

read your last note and traced on the little map a most precious possession which i would not part with for the whole world all your journeyings both in youth now mingled emotions for i cannot but feel anxious about your health if i didnt know it was very naught to ask you questions should beg you to tell me in what way your health has failed whether it is the rheumatic neuralgic affection that troubled you the last spring we were in philadelphia or whether the fatigues excitements the very enjoyments full life burst of prophetic joy as it were had proved too great a strain but you have accomplished another thing that had to be done in your life i exult with you have seen the vast magnificent theatre the free unfettered conditions whereon humanity will enact a new drama with the parts all so differently cast the rest the moving spirit of it all hints of this at least flashes glimpses i find in your greatest poems but dear friend i think humanity moves forward slowly even under splendid conditions you must give it a century or two instead of years before at least the crowning glories of a corresponding literature art will develope themselves nature has got plenty of time before her obstinately refuses to be hurried witness her dealings with the mere rocks stones bee is at berne working away merrily rejoicing in the really splendid advantage for medical study there open to her she mastered german so as to be able to speak understand it lectures all with ease during the two months at wiesbaden she has found a thoroughly comfortable home with some excellent intelligent ladies who are fond of her see to her bodily welfare in every possible way i have my dear little grandson with me here as engaging a little toddler as the sun ever shone upon so

pleasantest prettiest of all our suburbs is terribly inaccessible cuts us off a good deal from the intercourse with old friends i had looked forward to it is on the top of a high hill as high as the top of st pauls looks down on one side over the great city with its canopy of smoke on the other over a wide pleasant stretch of green fertile middlesex has moreover pleasant lanes solid old houses shaded by big elms other picturesque features such an abundance of keen fresh air this cold weather too we sigh for the warmth of an american house indoors often for american sunshine out of doors

about you i believe addington symonds is preparing a book which treats largely of your poems glad to hear that brother sister nieces are all well i wish i could write to some of them but what with

which way to turn per my nephew the process have made a great stride forward won two important law suits at berlin where the bessemer ring krupp at their head were trying to oust them of their patent rights also it is practically making good way in england so by bye the money will begin to flow in i suppose but has not done so yet i trust dearest friend this will find you safe fairly well again at

i went and i am not yet quite reacclimatized what with missing the sunshine working a little too hard was feeling quite knocked up so bee insisted on my coming down or rather up here to stay with some very kind dear friends the house stands all alone on a great heathcovered hill and below around are endless coppices so that you step from the lawn into a winding woodpath along which i wander by the hour and from my window i look over much such a view as we had at round hill hotel northampton this time two years only that with the soft haze that is so often spread over our landscape the distant hill looks more ghostly in the moonlight my friend is a noble largehearted capable woman who devotes all her life and energies to keeping alive an invalid husband and he well deserves her care for he has a beautiful nature too their mutual affection is unbounded he is just ordered by the doctors to leave the home they have made for themselves up here which is as lovely as it can be to spend two

lvi herbert h gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner england well road hampstead london november th my dear walt your postcard came to hand some little time ago i was pleased to get it to hear of your being well with your friends i have been extremely busy seeing after the new edition of my fathers book the work of seeing such a richly illustrated edition de luxe through the press was enormous but it is done the binders are now doing their work next tuesday the reviewers will be doing theirs i defy them to find any fault with the book i dare say you think it tall talk but i think that it is the most perfectly gotten up book that i ever have seen my mother has written an admirable memoir of my father at the end of the second vol pond musings pen sketch of a butterfly by walt whitman i thought that this was to be the title of your prose volume i will undertake the illustrations choosing the paper hand made everything except the expense of reproducing etc i should say london is the place to have things executed in if you wish to give photos they must be drawn by an artist and reproduced no photo ever looked well in a book yet they havent decorative importance and dont blend with type i should suggest that we should imitate the artistic size style of your earliest edition of leaves of g a large thin flat volume a fanciful but as inexpensive as possible cover written in gold on blue a waterlily say but i could think this over i will design fanciful tailpieces to be woven in with the text as a frontispiece the drawing that i gave you retouched by me and reproduced by the typographic etching company farringdon street london e c all these are only suggestions which i am prepared to execute in right earnest thought i read your letter to mother with interest we like our new house so much i am sure that you would you must come and stay with us stroll on hampstead heath ride down into london upon an omnibus sit to some good sculptor here in london boem say and you yourself could make arrangements with the publishers with remembrance to friends herbert h gilchrist letter lvii anne gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner well rd hampstead apr my dearest friend i have just been sauntering in our little but sunny garden which slopes to the south surveying with much satisfaction some fruit trees plum green gage pear cherry apple which we have just had planted to train up against the house and fence in which fashion fruit ripens much better with our english modicum of sunshine besides taking no room casting no shade over your little bit of ground then we have filled our large window with flowers in pots which make the room smell as delicious as a garden giddy is assiduous in keeping them well watered tended welcome was your postcard with the little rainbirds coy note in it but i had not before heard of your illness dear friend the letter before you spoke of being unusually well as i trust you are again now enjoying the spring i am well again so far as digestion c goes but bronchitis asthma of a chronic kind still trouble me my breath is so short i cannot walk which is a privation i am going at the beginning of june to stay with bee in edinburgh as she will not have any holiday or be able to come see us this year much am i longing to be with her have you begun to have any summer thoughts dear walt and do they turn towards england our nest therein yes i have received have enjoyed all the papers cuttings dearly like what you said of carlyle everyone here is speaking bitterly of the harsh judgments sarcastic descriptions of people in the reminiscenses but i know that at bottom his heart was genial and good that he wrote those in a miserable mood never looked at them again afterwards i hope you received the little memoir of my husband all right herby is very busy with a drawing of you hopes that with the many sketches he made the vivid impress on his memory the help of photographs it will be good i wish he had possessed as much power with the brush when he was in america as he has now he is making very great progress in mastery of the technique i observe too that he reads dwells upon your poems especially the walt whitman with growing frequency delight we often say wont walt like sitting in that sunny window or by that cheery open fire or sauntering on the heath picture you here in a thousand different ways i believe maggie lesley is coming from paris where she is studying art in good earnest at the beginning of may then will come and spend a few days with us welcome are american friends the buxton formans took tea with us last week we had pleasant talk of you of dr bucke mrs forman is a sincere sympathetic motherly woman whom you would like the rossettis too have been to see us we didnt think william in the best health or spirits his wife was not looking well either but then another baby is just coming this easter time the poorest of london working folk flock in enormous numbers to hampstead heath it is a sight that would interest you they are rougher noisier poorer than such folks in america the men more prone to get the worse for drink but there is a good deal of fun merriment too the girls boys racing about on donkeys who have a pretty hard time of it plenty of merrygorounds enjoyment of the pure air sunshine such sights more than they know the light is failing dearest friend so with love from us all goodbye anne gilchrist friendliest greeting to your brother sister to hattie jessie when you write to the staffords letter lviii herbert h gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner well road north london hampstead england june th sunday afternoon p m my dear walt you dont write me a letter nor take any notice of my magnificent offers concerning pond musings etc however i will forgive you this oftrepeated offence i often think of you very often of america and things generally there and nearly always with pleasure my mother is away staying with beatrice in edinburgh city recruiting her health which has most sadly needed it of late so i and grace a new scotch lassie one margaret who officiates as servant most efficaciously too i can tell you such scrubbing cleaning as you never saw the like we three i say are alone at keats corner cool sitting here in our long drawingroom hung with innumerable pictures as of yore although it has been scorchingly hot this past month the morning i spend sketching on hampstead heath which is lovely just now all the maytrees are in full bloom the gorse broom are a blaze of yellow the rooks fly constantly by a quarter of a mile seemingly overhead the sly fellows giving some side like dart when you look up at them even at that height i am painting one of them so i have to look up pretty often in the early morning the nightingale sings oh so sweetly long trills roulades in the most accomplished manner last wednesday miss ellen terry whose name you are doubtless familiar with as being the leading actress in london well she called upon me to ask my advice or opinion of a drawing connected with my fathers book ellen terry expressed herself highly interested in our house pictures decorations and so forth her manner was a little stagey but graceful to the extreme and you could see peeping out of this theatric manner a kind good heart oh so kind i feel as if i would do anything for her her manners were so winning will you come to the stage entrance of the lyceum some day soon and you shall have stalls for two now will you come do were her last words to grace i called on her at kensington last week returning the drawing and i was so charmed with two beautiful children of hers a tall fair girl a pretty mixture of shyness and selfpossession that quite won me she too i should fancy will be a great actress some day she has such a bright face the boy master ted was nice too well i gave ellen terry a proof of a drawing that i have just completed for dr buckes book a job i got through buxton forman a great friend of buckes done con amore on my part this drawing has been beautifully reproduced by the new photo intaglioprocess i hope dr bucke will like it but i should not expect great things from him in that line judging from the twopenny hapenny little pen ink sketch by waters which he sent over in the first instance however forman rescued him from that so far he has been guided by his friend whether he will when he sees my drawing we neither of us know but both feel to have done our best in the matter i said that ellen terry must ask for you when she goes to america which she contemplates some day i have sold the last drawing i made in new york of you for l s to buxton forman odd church bells have just commenced chiming in the distance a sound i like better than the parsons i hear that the young american artists are doing capitally filling their pockets my cousin sidney thomas is or was in america a good deal lionized i understand if at any time you favour me with a letter let it be a letter and not a postcard please i have been reading carlyles reminiscences good stuff in them brilliant touches but dreadfully morbid dont you think one shuts the book up with a feeling that in some respect one carlyle is enough in the world yet in some respects a million wouldnt be too many i often think of your remark to us one day that tolerance is the rarest quality in the world interested in those boston scraps you send my mother you have always been pretty well received in boston have you not i mean in the emerson days pity that when emerson is no more there will be no fine portrait of him in existence there was a nobility stamped upon his face that i never saw the like of and which should have been caught and stamped forever on canvas we all see something of the formans all like them they have so much character rather unusual in literary folk of the lighter sort i fancy but there is something very fresh and original about forman nice children they have too miss blind is bringing out a volume of poems why will people all imagine they can write poetry william rossetti is writing a hundred sonnets writes one a day one about john brown is not bad and many are instructive but are in no sense poems i am going down to tea must not keep grace waiting any longer love to you herbert h gilchrist letter lix anne gilchrist to walt whitman well road hampstead london dec my dearest friend

heard they should see her no more the report of your health is comforting dear friend mine too is better i am able to take walks again though still liable to sudden attacks of difficult breathing

to be for he is making great progress works hard loves his work is of the stuff where of great painters are made i am persuaded so he can afford to wait giddy is not quite so well strong as i could wish but there seems nothing serious she is working diligently at the development of her voice is learning german dr buckes friend mr buxton forman his wife are very warm staunch friends of herbys

once wrote you how much she loved the swiss ladies with whom she made her home while in berne a more tender beautiful love and sorrow than that with which they cherish the memory of her never grew in

behaved honourably herby brought away for me a copy of the new edition i like the type like that of the pale green leaf it is folded in so to speak i find a few new friends to love perhaps i have not yet found them all out but you must not expect me to take kindly to any changes in the titles or arrangement of the old beloved friends i love them too dearly every word look of them for that for instance i want walt whitman instead of myself at the top of the page also my own longing is always for a chronological arrangement if change at all there is to be for that at once makes biography of the best kind what deaths dear friend as for me my heart is already gone over to the other side of the river so that sometimes i feel a kind of rejoicing in the swelling of the ranks of the great company there darwin with his splendid days work here gently closed rossetti whose brilliant genius had got entangled in a premature physical decay so that his days work was over too in a letter to me william who was the best most faithful loving of brothers to him says i doubt whether he would ever have regained that energy of body concentration of mental resource which could have enabled him to resume work at his full wonted power without these faculties at ready command my dear gabriel would not have been himself edward carpenters father too is gone but he at a ripe age without disease sank gently the photographs i enclose are but poor suggestions please give one to mrs whitman with my love or if you prefer to keep both i will send her others does the idea ever come into your head dear

friend you have long ere this i hope received herbys letter telling of the safe arrival of the precious copy of specimen days with the portraits it makes me very proud your father had a fine face too there is something in it that takes hold of me that seems to be a kind of natural background or substratum to the radiant sweetness of that other sacred beloved face completing your parentage i like heartily too the new portraits of you they are all wanted as different aspects but the two that remain my favourites are the portrait taken about without coat of any kind and the one you sent me in next to those i love these two latest in some respects better because they are the walt i saw had such happy hours with the second copy of book my lending one has come safe too and the card that told of your attack of illness the welcome news of your recovery in the paper i have been fretting with impatience at my own dumbness but tied to as many hours a day writing as i could possibly manage at my little book now last night finished all but proofs so that i can take my pleasure in specimen days at last but before doing that must have a few words with you dearest friend first a gossip do you remember maggie lesley she came to see us on her way to paris where she is working all alone very earnestly to get through training as an artist then going to start in a studio of her own in philadelphia she like my mothers sister are to me fine lovable samples of american women in whom i mean i detect like the distinctive aroma of a flower something special that is american a decisive new quality to oldworld perceptions herby is working away still chiefly at the consuelo picture has got a very beautiful model today sitting to him his summer work was down in warwickshire making sketches very charming ones they are of george eliots native scenes one of a gardennook up steep old worn stone steps bordered with flowers that is enticing it will make a lovely background for a figure picture giddys voice is growing in richness strength she works with all her heart hoping one day to be a real artist vocally in church oratorio music she will not have power or dramatic ability for opera nor can i wish that she had there are so many thorns with the roses in that path i fear you will be a loser by bognes bankruptcy did i tell you that among our friends one of your warmest

more better soon anne gilchrist greetings to the staffords letter lxiii anne gilchrist to walt whitman well rd hampstead jan it is not for want of thinking of you dear walt that i write but seldom for indeed my thoughts are chiefly occupied with you your other self your poems with struggles to say a few words that i think want saying about them that might help some to their birthright who now stand off either ignorant or misapprehending we all go on much as usual feb i wonder if you will like a true story of lady dilke that i heard the other day i do it was before her marriage she was a handsome young heiress a daring horsewoman fond of hunting there was a man weakly of good position who had behaved very basely cruelly to a young girl in her neighbourhood when as is the case in england half the county was assembled on the hunting field lady d faced him said in a voice that could be heard afar sir you are a blackguard if these gentlemen had the right spirit in them they would horsewhip you he looked at her with effrontery made a mocking bow but she continued since they wont i will and she cut him across the face with her riding whip upon which he turned and rode off the field like a dog with his tail between his legs reappeared in that neighbourhood no more she was a woman much beloved died at the birth of her first child from too much chloroform having been given her her husband was heartbroken i see you too are having floods with us it pours five days out of seven so in germany france we have made the acquaintance of arabella buckley who has just written an interesting article about darwin whom she knew well for the century she says his was the most entirely beautiful perfect nature she ever came in contact with how i wish we could have a glimpse of each other dear friend half an hour talk nay a good long look a handshake herby is overhead painting in his studio such a pleasant room how is john burroughs we owe him a letter thanks for a good art on carlyle love to you dearest friend hearty remembrances to your brother sister hattie jessie a g letter lxiv herbert h gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner well road hampstead london england april th my dear walt your card to hand last night with its sad account of dear mrs staffords health but what the doctor says is cheering i wonder though what the doctor would call good weather mild spring i suppose very glad my dear old walt to see your strong familiar handwriting again it does one good its so individual that it is next to seeing you right glad to hear of your good health had an idea that you were not so well again this winter john burroughs was very violent against my intaglio on the other hand alma tadema our great painter here liked it very much i take violent criticism pretty philosophically now that i see how unreliable it nearly always is john burroughs has got a fixed idea about your personality and that is that the top of your head is a foot high and any portrait that doesnt develop the dome is no portrait curious what eyes a man may have for everything except a picture i finished lately a lifesize portrait of james simmons jp a hunting fox squire of the old school such a fine old fellow my portrait represents him standing firmly in a scarlet huntingcoat well stained with many a wet chase his great whip tucked under his arm whilst buttoning on his left glove white buckskin trousers in shade relieving the scarlet coat black velvet hunting cap dark rich blue background to qualify and cool the scarlet i wish you could see it then i have painted a subject the good gray poets gift i have long meant to build up something of you from my studies adding colour you play a prominent part in this picture seated at table bending over a nosegay of flowers poetizing before presenting them to mother i am standing up bending over the teapot with the kettle filling it up opposite you sits giddy out of the window a pretty view of cannon place hampstead mater thinks it a pretty picture and a good likeness of you just as you used to sit at tea with us at n nd st now i am going out for a stroll on hampstead heath have just come in from a long ramble over the heaths a lovely soft spring day innumerable birds in full song i think j b is right when he says that your birds are more plaintive than ours its natures way of compensating us for a loss of sunshine what would england be without the merry lark the very embodiment of cheeriness are not the carlyle emerson letters interesting it seems to me to be one of the most beautiful and pathetic things in literature cs fondness for e but all englishmen i must tell you are not grumblers like carlyle he stands quite alone in that quality look at darwin i should be grateful for another postcard with all love herb gilchrist letter lxv anne gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner hampstead may dearest friend i feel as if this beautiful spring morning here in england must send you greetings through me our sunny little mound of garden which runs down toward the south is fragrant with hyacinths and wallflowers beautiful tawny reddish yellow fellows laden with rich perfume and at the bottom is a big old cherry tree one mass of snowy blossom in a neighbours gay garden beyond is a distant glimpse of some tall elms just putting on their first tender green our little breakfast room where i always sit of a morning opens with glass doors into this garden herby is gone with the sunday tramps of whom he is a member for a ten or fifteenmile walk said tramps are some half dozen friends neighbours some of them very learned professors but genial good fellows withal who agree to spend every other sunday morning in taking one of their long walks together a very good time they have giddy is gone to hear a lecture our bonnie scotch girl is roasting the beef for dinner singing the while in the kitchen and pussy i are sitting very companionable meditative in the little room before described you cannot think dear friend what a pleasure it was to have a whole big letter from you not that i despise postcards they are good stopgaps but not the real thing yes i have prize the article on the hebrew scriptures how i wish you could make up your mind to spend your summer holiday with us i am still struggling along striving to say something which if i can say it to my mind will be useful will clear away a little of the rubbish that hides you from mens eyes i hear the eminent women series is having quite a large sale in america goodbye love to mrs whitman greetings to your brother love from us all to you a gilchrist letter lxvi anne gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner hampstead jul my dearest friend lazy me that have been thinking letters to you instead of writing them we have dr buckes book at last could not succeed in buying one at tuerbners i believe they all sold directly but he has sent us one there are some things in it i prize very highly namely helen prices memoranda and thomas a geres these i like far better than any personal reminiscences of you i have ever read i feel much drawn to the writers of them also your letter to mrs price from the hospitals dear friend that makes one handinhand with you then there gives one a glimpse of a very beautiful friendship but why why did dr bucke set himself to counteract that beneficient law of natures by which the dust tends to lay itself and carefully gathering together again all the rubbish stupid or malevolent that has been written of you toss it up in the air again to choke and blind or disgust as many as it may what a curious piece of perversity to mistake this for candour a judicial spirit then again how do i hate all that unmeaning irrelevant clatter about what rabelais or shakespeare or the ancients their times tolerated in the way of coarseness or plainness of speech as if you wanted apologizing for or could be apologized for on that ground if these poems are to be tolerated i for one could not tolerate them if they are not the highest lesson that has yet been taught in refinement purity if they do not banish all possibility of coarseness of thought feeling there would be nothing to be said for them but they do i am as sure of that as of my own existence when will men begin to understand them we have had pleasant glimpses of several american friends this summer of kate hillard for instance who by the bye narrowly escaped a bad accident just at our door the harness broke the cab came down on the horse frightened him so that he bolted struck the cab against a lamppost happily else it would have been worse overturned them it but when they crawled out no worse harm was done than a few cuts from the glass kate her friend behaved very pluckily we had a pleasant evening together after all then there was arthur peterson looking much as in the old philadelphia days and emma annie lazarus who owing to some letters of introduction from james the novelist have had a very gay time indeed been quite lionized and last not least mr dalton dorr the curator of the pennsylvania museum in fairmount park whom we all liked much he is enjoying his visit here with all his heart is a great enthusiast for our old gothic cathedrals and for everything beautiful but says there is nothing such a source of unceasing wonder delight as riding about london over the bridges c on the top of an omnibus watching the endless flow of people it is indeed a kind of human mississippi or niagara the young folks are busy packing up to start for the seaside herby wants a background for a picture in which green turf trees and all the richness of vegetation come down to the very edge of the sea and i seem to remember such a place near lynn regis where i was thirty years ago when my eldest child was born so they are going to look it up we hear the heat is very tremendous in america this year i hope you are as well as ever able to stand it enjoy it i wonder where you are friendly greetings to mr mrs whitman hattie jessie the staffords love to you dear friend from us all anne gilchrist my little book on mary lamb just out will send you a copy in a day or two letter lxvii anne gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner hampstead oct dearest friend long long does it seem since i have had any word or sign from you i hope all goes well that you have had a pleasant refreshing summer trip somewhere all goes on much as usual with us hythe kent oct not having felt very well the last month or two and giddy also seeming to need a little bracing up we came down to this ancient town by the sea one of the cinque ports on wednesday and much we like it a fine open sea a delicious briny odour and inland much that is curious and interesting for this part of the kentish coast so near to france has innumerable old castles forts moats traces everywhere of centuries of warfare and of means of defence against our great neighbour it is a fine hilly woody country too and very picturesque these gray massive ruins many of them used now as farm houses look the men of kent are very proud of their country and are reckoned a fine race tall muscular ruddycomplexioned and often too with thick tawnyred beards curious how in our little island the differences of racestock are still so discernible keep along this same coast to the west only about a couple of hundred miles you come to such a different type dark blackest and cornish men i get a nice letter now then from john burroughs i also saw this summer two women doctors who were very kind good friends to my darling bee drs pope twin sisters from boston whom it did me good to see they work hard have a good practice say they dont know what a days illness means so far as they themselves are concerned they tell me also that the women doctors are doing capital work in america and that one of them who was with dear beatrice at the penn med col dr alice bennett is the efficient head of the womans department of a large lunatic asylum we are getting on in england too but the field where english women doctors find the most work the best position is india where as the women are not allowed by their male relatives to be attended by men the mortality was immense herby has taken a better studio than our house afforded both as to light size finds the advantage great i expect he is having a delightful walk this brilliant morning with the hampstead tramps of whom i think i have told you they often walk fifteen miles or so on sunday morning such a glorious afternoon it has been by the sea sapphire colour the air brisk elastic yet soft tomorrow gran goes home i shall be all alone here i hear of specimen days in a letter from australia there will be a large audience for you there some day dear friend i like what john burroughs has been writing about carlyle much we have had nothing but stupidities of late about him here but there will come a great reaction from all this abuse i have no doubt he did put so much gall in his ink sometimes human nature cant be expected to take it altogether meekly i hope you received my little book safely i should be a hypocrite if i pretended not to care whether you found patience to read it for i grew to love mary charles lamb so much during my task that i want you to love them too to see what a beautiful friendship was theirs with coleridge how are mr mrs whitman and hattie jessie send me a few words soon goodbye dearest friend ann gilchrist letter lxviii anne gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner hampstead april my dearest friend those few words of yours to herby tasted good to us few but enough seeing that we can fill out between the lines with what you have given us of yourself forever always in your books that is how i comfort myself for having so few letters but i turn many wistful thoughts toward america and were not i mine bound here by unseverable ties did we not seem to grow belong here as by a kind of natural destiny that has to be fulfilled very cheerfully could i make america my home for the sake of being near you in body as i am in heart soul but time has good things in store for us sooner or later i doubt not i could hardly express to you how welcome is the thought of death to me not in the sense of any discontent with life but as life with fresh energies wider horizon hand in hand again with those that are gone on first herby found the little bit of gray cloth very useful but one day save him an old suit your figure in the picture is i think a fair suggestion of one aspect of you but not could not of course be an adequate portrait he will never rest till he has done his best to achieve that as soon as he can afford it for it is a very slow business indeed for a young artist to make money in england though when he does begin he is better paid than in america he means to run over to see you he says he should like always to spend his winters in new york i say how very highly i prize that last slip you sent me a backward glance on my own road it both corroborates explains much that i feel very deeply if you are seeing mrs whitman please say her letter was a pleasure that i shall write again before very long i feel as if this letter would never find you be sure let us know your whereabouts remembrance love goodbye dear walt anne gilchrist letter lxix anne gilchrist to walt whitman hampstead may my dearest friend your card your very voice touch drawing me across the atlantic close beside you was put into my hand just as i was busy copying out with husky haughty lips o sea to pin into my leaves of grass i hardly think there is anything grander there i think surely they must see that that is the very soul of nature uttering itself sublimely who do you think came to see us on sunday professor dowden and i know not when i have set eyes on a more beautiful personality i think you would be as much attracted towards him as i was it was he who told me full of enthusiasm of the poems in harpers which i had not seen or heard of we had a very happy two or three hours together talking of you looking through blakes drawings he is a tall man complexion tanned healthy nose finely modelled dark eyes with plenty of life meaning in them hair grayish i should think he was between forty fifty but says his father is still a fine hale old man herby disappointed again this year of getting anything into the r academy i think i like the idea of the shanty if you have any one to take good care of you to cook nicely keep all neat clean c i wonder if i have ever been in mickle st i still busy still hammering away to see if i can help those that balk at leaves of grass perhaps you will smile at me at any rate it bears good fruit to me i seem to be in a manner living with you the while everything full of beauty just now here as no doubt it is with you goodbye dearest friend dont forget the letter that is to come soon love from us all love again love from anne gilchrist letter lxx anne gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner aug dearest friend the notion that one is going to write a nice long letter is fatal to writing at all and so i mean to scribble something somehow a little oftener make up in quantity for quality for after all the great thing the thing one wants is to meet if not in the flesh then in the spirit a word will do it i am getting on my heart is in my work though i have been long about it it wont be long but i think hope it will be strong quite a sprinkling of american friends some new ones this spring among them mr mrs pennell from philadelphia whom you know we like them well hope to see them again again also miss keyse her sister married emersons son from concord and the lesleys mary lesley has married gone to the west st paul has just got a little son how does the little shanty answer i wonder herby has been painting some charming little bits in an old terraced garden here i do wish you could hear giddy sing now i am sure her voice would go to the right spot as you used to say goodbye dearest friend love from all most from anne gilchrist letter lxxi anne gilchrist to walt whitman wolverhampton oct dear walt i dont suppose the enclosed will give you nearly so much pleasure as it gives me but villiers stanford is i think the best composer england has produced since the days of purcell blow and your words will be sent home to hundreds thousands who had not before seen them how lovely the words read as themes for great music i have been staying with old friends who have a house you would enjoy it stands all alone on the top of a heathclad hill with miles of coppice young woods below it and spread out beyond is a rich valley with more wooded hills jutting out into it and you see the storms a long way off travelling up from the sea and you can wander for miles miles through the woods or over the breezy hill or as you sit at your window feel yourself in the very heart of a great beautiful solitude very kind warm friends too they are who leave you as free as a bird to do what you like i have had all the papers dear friend have enjoyed them now i am in the heart of the black country as we call it black with the smoke of thousands of foundries works of all kinds staying with percy his wife percy is having a very arduous time here starting some steel works what with his men being inexperienced times bad the machinery not yet perfectly adjusted he seems harassed night day for these things have to be kept going all night too but i hope he will get into smoother waters soon the little son is rosy bright healthy goes to school now which being an only child he enjoys mightily for the sake of the companionship of other boys love from us all dear friend a gilchrist grace herby well busy when i left letter lxxii anne gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner hampstead dec dearest friend at last i have extracted a little bit of news about you from friend carpenter who never comes to see us and is as reluctant to write letters as somebody else that i know that you have a comfortable elderly couple to keep house for you was a good hearing for the old shanty had risen before my eyes as somewhat lonely perhaps the cooking c not well attended to there seems a curious kind of ebb and flow about the recognition of you in england just now there are signs of the flow of a steadily gathering great wave one indication of which is the little pamphlet just published in edinburgh one of the round table series no doubt a copy has been sent you if not and you would care to see it i will send you one on the whole i like it barring one or two stupidities at any rate as compared with what has hitherto been written my poor article has so far been rejected by editors so i have laid it by for a little to come with a fresh eye see if i can make it in any way more likely to win a hearing though i often say to myself if they have not ears to hear you how is it likely one can unstop their ears but on the other hand there is always the chance of leading some to read the poems who had not else done so percy norah and archie now grown a very sturdy active little fellow are coming to spend xmas with us which is a great pleasure i am deep in froudes last volumes of carlyles life in london folks are grumbling that they have had enough too much of carlyle his grumblings and sarcasms but he is an inexhaustibly interesting figure to me will remain so in the long run to the world i am persuaded it grieves me that he should have been so cruelly unjust to himself as a husband that remorse those bitter selfreproaches were undeserved were altogether morbid he was not only an infinitely better husband than she was wife he was wonderfully affectionate tender just as to his temper irritable nerves she knew what she was about when she married him herby was walking through the british museum the other day with a friend when a group a readymade picture struck him it was a young studentsculptress a graceful girl high on a pile of boxes modelling in clay a copy of an antique statue standing below looking up at her was a young sculptor in his blouse criticising her work with much animation gesture the background of the group a part of the elgin marbles so this is what herby is painting i think he will make a very jolly little picture out of it i have been much a prisoner to the house with bad colds ever since i returned from wolverhampton but am beginning to get out again which puts new life into me i have never envied anything in this world but a mans strong legs powers of tramping tramping over hill dale as long as he pleases legs would content me and a sound breathing apparatus i am in no hurry for wings giddys voice too is just now eclipsed by cold i hope you have escaped this evil and are able to jaunt to fro on the ferries as freely as ever and i hope the pleasant quaker friends are well and mr mrs whitman and hattie jessie there is a fellow student of giddys at the guild hall music school who so reminds her of hattie love from us all dear friend most from me anne gilchrist letter lxxiii anne gilchrist to walt whitman keats corner hampstead england feb dearest friend how has the winter passed with you i wonder me it has imprisoned very much with bronchial asthmatic troubles and the four walls of the house the ceiling seem to close in upon ones spirit as well as ones body all too much i hope you have been able to wend to and fro daily on the great ferry boats enjoy the beautiful broad river the sky the throngs of people as of old you are in my thoughts as constantly as ever though i have been so silent percy his wife the little son spent some weeks with us at christmas now they have taken a house quite near into which they will be moving in a week or two i cant tell you what a dear affectionate reasonable companionable little fellow archie is now six years old perhaps you will have seen in the american papers that sidney thomas the cousin with whom percy was associated in the discovery of the basic process is dead he spent his strength too freely wore himself out at he was much loved by all with whom he had to do his mother sister have been watching hoping against hope taking him to warm climates he himself full of hope the mind bright and active to the last now he is gone his eldest brother died only two months before him i cannot help grieving over public affairs too never in my lifetime has old england been in such a bad way no honest capable man seemingly to take the helm what carlyle was fond of describing as the attempt to guide the ship by the shouts of the bystanders on shore the newspapers c prospering very ill a government that tries perpetually how to do it and how not to do it at the same moment the best comfort is that i do not think there is any the smallest sign of deterioration in the english race so we shall pull through somehow after tremendous disasters how many things should i like to sit and chat with you about dear walt above all to see you again i could not get my article into any of the magazines i most wished i believe it is coming out in today giddy was so pleased at your sending her a paper a very capital article too it is of miss kellogg i was interested also in a little paragraph i found about pullman town near chicago which confirmed my suspicion that it was not a thing with healthy roots but only a benevolent despotism i am seeing a good deal of your socialists just now i confess that though they mean well i think they have less sense in their heads than any people i ever saw i am going to pay a little visit to those friends friendliest of friends who live on the lonely top of a heathcovered hill with such an outlook such wooded slopes and broad valleys and the storms travelling up hours before they arrive such sweeps of sunshine too they mean to drive me about till i am quite strong again so the next letter i write dear friend shall be more cheery i am afraid to look back lest this one should read too grumbly to send i dont feel grumbly however only shut in herby has been working hard at getting up an exhibition here to help along our public library it is so very hard to stir up anything like public spirit unity of action in london or its suburbs i suppose because of its vastness alas also the social cliques gentilities snobbishnesses goodbye dearest walt with love from all anne gilchrist letter lxxiv anne gilchrist to walt whitman hampstead may my dearest friend delays of editors there is no end to them i am promised now that the art shall appear in the june no if it does i will send you at once the number of copies you name and if it does not i think i had best get it back have done with the editors of today try for some other better opening again i have been reading rereading pondering over froudes vols of carlyle the reminiscences letters c c and am pretty well at boiling point with indignation against froude boiling point of anger freezing point of contempt his betrayal at every point of a sacred trust lazy slipshod editing not even taking the pains to put letters and their answers together but printing the one in the others three or four years after so that half the meaning and all the mutuality of the letters are lost and then the sly malignity of the comments with which they are preceded if i live i will do my utmost to expose all this to show that mrs carlyle was no injured heroine nor he a selfish neglected husband both had their faults but the balance of affection tenderness was largely on his side as well as of other great qualities though i like her too think she would have scorned froudes ignoble championship herby has had rather better luck with his pictures this year has one the sculptors lesson fairly well hung at the royal academy where it shines out very cheerfully holds its own modestly i may say without maternal vanity i think i described to you the little bit of actual life it depicts a young girl he saw at the british museum modelling a copy of an antique statue young sculptor in his blouse standing below giving her some animated criticism a little bit of the elgin marbles in the background herb has also a little picture he calls midsummer a bit of a very old buttressed wall hung with roses in full bloom giddys figure standing above at the grosvenor now if he has the luck to sell too he has a commission also to paint a small portrait of me for our friends at marley on which he is busy just now as soon as he has a little spare money in his pocket i think his first use of it will be a run across the atlantic a glimpse of you dear friend giddy is going to sing at a soiree of socialists revolutionary folk in general on wednesday her songs are to be the wearing of the green poland dirge the marseillaise you will think we are getting pretty red hot but alas though our sympathy with the cause the cause of suffering millions is warm our faith in the wisdom ability of those who are aspiring to be the leaders so far as we know anything of them is infinitesimal what a burst of beauty we have had during the last ten days we look out just now on a sea of apple pear blossoms from the deepest pink to dazzling white the tenderest green intermingled with all i hope you are able to be out nearly all day enjoy all and that home affairs go smoothly comfortably that mrs davis is attentive good every way adequate as caretaker i am looking forward very much to the after songs and letters of parting does the sale of leaves of grass continue pretty steady i look forward with a sort of dread to seeing my article in proof lest i should feel very disappointed with it your loving friend a gilchrist do you ever see or hear from mr marvin he is a favourite with all of us do you remember how we laughed at his dramatic presentation of a negro prayer meeting letter lxxv anne gilchrist to walt whitman hampstead london jan my dearest friend i hope the todays have come safe to hand i am thinking a great deal about the new edition and cannot help hoping you are going to revert to the plan of the centennial edition which issued your writings in two independent volumes may i without being presumptuous dear walt tell you how i should dearly like to see them arranged i want crossing brooklyn ferry song at sunset song of the open road starting from paumanok carol of words carol of occupations and either as as i sat by blue ontarios shore or the preface to edit put into two rivulets you could make room for them that the volumes might balance in size by making them exchange places with the centennial songs and the memoranda during the war not that these are not precious to me but i want it dearest because i want in the two rivulet volume what will best prepare the reader lift him up to the true point of view and make him all your own before he comes to the inner sanctuary of calamus walt whitman children of adam monday morn your letter just to hand it gives me deep joy dear friend i have sent copies of today to dr bucke john burroughs but did not know of his change of address so fear it has miscarried i will send another and also one to w oconnor you did not tell me about your fall unless indeed a letter has been lost it fills me with concern because of the difficulty it increases in getting that free outdoor life that is so dear essential to your soul body and because too i still cherished in my heart a hope that i should yet see you again here in my own home now it seems next to an impossibility right thankful am i to hear about mrs davis that she takes good care of you please give her a friendly greeting from me i am going to have rather a bothersome summer first of all the house full of workmen to make all clean tidy then my scotch lassie friend factotum rather than servant must have a holiday go to her friends in scotland for a month i shall heartily welcome your friend no need to say be sure to like her love from grace herb most of all from me i have plenty more to say but wont delay this goodbye dear walt anne gilchrist letter lxxvi anne gilchrist to walt whitman well rd hampstead eng july my dearest friend a kind of anxiety has for some time past weighed upon me and upon others i find who love admire you that you do not have all the comforts you ought to have that you are perhaps sometimes straightened for means we have had letters from several young men almost or quite strangers to us asking questions on this subject and we hoped thought that if this were so you would permit those who have received such priceless gifts from you to put their gratitude into some tangible shape some freewill offering hence the paragraph was put into the athenaeum which i send with this and we were proceeding to organize our forces when your paper came to hand this morning the camden post july which seems decisively to bid us desist or at all events wait till we had told you of our wishes and plan one thing would i feel sure give you pleasure in any case and that is to know that there is over here a little band perhaps indeed it is now quite a considerable one for we had not yet had time to ascertain how considerable who would joyfully respond to that poem of yours to rich givers a friend and near neighbour of ours frederick wedmore is coming over to america this autumn and counts much on coming to see you he is a wellknown writer on art here a friendly candid openminded man with whom i think you will enjoy a talk i am on the lookout for miss smith shall indeed enjoy a talk with a special friend of yours dear walt i hope she will not fail to come giddy is away at haslemere herby just going to write for himself to you that is a very graphic bit in the post the portrait of hugo the canary the kitten i like to know all that as well as to hear the talk my love dear walt anne gilchrist so far as can be ascertained this is the last letter anne gilchrist died nov th the end the country life
