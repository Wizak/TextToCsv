 preface fame and fortune like its predecessor ragged dick was contributed as a serial story to the schoolmate a popular juvenile magazine published in boston the generous commendations of the first volume by the press and by private correspondents whose position makes their approval of value have confirmed the author in his purpose to write a series of stories intended to illustrate the life and experiences of the friendless and vagrant children to be found in all our cities numbering in new york alone over twelve thousand in the preparation of the different volumes the requisite information will be gathered from personal observation mainly supplemented however by facts communicated by those who have been brought into practical relations with the class of children whose lives are portrayed the volumes might readily be made more matteroffact but the author has sought to depict the inner life and represent the feelings and emotions of these little waifs of city life and hopes thus to excite a deeper and more widespread sympathy in the public mind as well as to exert a salutary influence upon the class of whom he is writing by setting before them inspiring examples of what energy ambition and an honest purpose may achieve even in their case in order to reach as large a number of these boys as possible the publisher is authorized on application to send a gratuitous copy of the two volumes of the ragged dick series already issued to any regularly organized newsboys lodge within the united states new york december fame and fortune or the progress of richard hunter chapter i a boardinghouse in bleecker street well fosdick this is a little better than our old room in mott street said richard hunter looking complacently about him youre right dick said his friend this carpets rather nicer than the ragged one mrs mooney supplied us with the beds are neat and comfortable and i feel better satisfied even if we do have to pay twice as much for it the room which yielded so much satisfaction to the two boys was on the fourth floor of a boardinghouse in bleecker street no doubt many of my young readers who are accustomed to elegant homes would think it very plain but neither richard nor his friend had been used to anything as good they had been thrown upon their own exertions at an early age and had a hard battle to fight with poverty and ignorance those of my readers who are familiar with richard hunters experiences when he was ragged dick will easily understand what a great rise in the world it was for him to have a really respectable home for years he had led a vagabond life about the streets as a bootblack sleeping in old wagons or boxes or wherever he could find a lodging gratis it was only twelve months since a chance meeting with an intelligent boy caused him to form the resolution to grow up respectable by diligent evening study with henry fosdick whose advantages had been much greater than his own assisted by a natural quickness and an unusual aptitude for learning he had in a year learned to read and write well and had besides made considerable progress in arithmetic still he would have found it difficult to obtain a situation if he had not been the means of saving from drowning the young child of mr james rockwell a wealthy merchant in business on pearl street who at once out of gratitude for the service rendered engaged our hero in his employ at the unusual compensation for a beginner of ten dollars a week his friend henry fosdick was in a hat store on broadway but thus far only received six dollars a week feeling that it was time to change their quarters to a more respectable portion of the city they one morning rang the bell of mrs brownings boardinghouse on bleecker street they were shown into the parlor and soon a tall lady with flaxen ringlets and a thin face came in well young gentleman what can i do for you she said regarding them attentively my friend and i are looking for a boardingplace said henry fosdick have you any rooms vacant what sort of a room would you like asked mrs browning we cannot afford to pay a high price we should be satisfied with a small room you will room together i suppose yes maam i have a room vacant on the third floor quite a goodsized one for which i should charge you seven dollars apiece there is a room on the fourth floor not so large which you can have for five dollars each i think well look at that said richard hunter very well then follow me mrs browning preceded the boys to the fourth floor where she opened the door of a neat room provided with two single beds a goodsized mirror a bureau a warm woollen carpet a washstand and an empty bookcase for books there was a closet also the door of which she opened showing a row of pegs for clothing how do you like it asked fosdick in a low voice turning to his companion its bully said dick in admiring accents i may as well say here what the reader will find out as we proceed that our hero in spite of his advance in learning had not got entirely rid of some street phrases which he had caught from the companions with whom he had for years associated five dollars is rather a steep price said fosdick in a low voice you know i dont get but six in all ill tell you what fosdick said dick itll be ten dollars for the two of us ill pay six and you shall pay four thatll be fair wont it no dick i ought to pay my half you can make it up by helpin me when i run against a snag in my studies you know as much as i do now dick no i dont i havent any more ideas of grammar than a broomstick you know i called cat a conjunction the other day now you shall help me in grammar for im blessed if i know whether im a noun or an adjective and ill pay a dollar towards your board but dick im willing to help you for nothing it isnt fair to charge you a dollar a week for my help why isnt it aint i to get ten dollars a week and shant i have four dollars over while you will only have two i think i ought to give you one more and then wed be even no dick i wouldnt agree to that if you insist upon it well do as you propose but if ever i am able i will make it up to you well young gentleman what have you decided asked mrs browning well take the room said dick promptly when do you wish to commence today well come this evening very well i suppose you can furnish me with references youre in business i suppose i am in hendersons hat and cap store no broadway said henry fosdick and i am going into rockwell coopers on pearl street next monday said dick with a sense of importance he felt that this was very different from saying i black boots in chatham square you look like good boys said mrs browning and ive no doubt youre honest but im a widow dependent on my boarders and i have to be particular only last week a young man went off owing me four weeks board and i dont suppose hell ever show his face again he got a good salary too but he spent most of it on cigars and billiards now how can i be sure you will pay me your board regular well pay it every week in advance said dick promptly thems our best references and he produced his bankbook showing a deposit of over one hundred dollars to his credit in the savings bank motioning at the same time to fosdick to show his you dont mean to say youve saved all that from your earnings said mrs browning surprised yes said dick and i might have saved more if id begun sooner how long has it taken you to save it up about nine months my friend hasnt saved so much because his salary has been smaller i wont require you to pay in advance said mrs browning graciously i am sure i can trust you boys who have formed so good a habit of saving can be depended upon i will get the room ready for you and you may bring your trunks when you please my hours are breakfast at seven lunch at halfpast twelve and dinner at six we shant be able to come to lunch said fosdick our stores are too far off then i will make half a dollar difference with each of you making nine dollars a week instead of ten the boys went downstairs well pleased with the arrangement they had made dick insisted upon paying five dollars and a half of the joint weekly expense leaving three and a half to fosdick this would leave the latter two dollars and a half out of his salary while dick would have left four and a half with economy both thought they could continue to lay up something there was one little embarrassment which suggested itself to the boys neither of them had a trunk having been able to stow away all their wardrobe without difficulty in the drawers of the bureau with which their room in mott street was provided why are you like an elephant fosdick asked dick jocosely as they emerged into the street i dont know im sure because you havent got any trunk except what you carry round with you well have to get trunks or perhaps carpetbags would do no said dick decisively it aint spectable to be without a trunk and were going to be spectable now respectable dick all right respectable then lets go and buy each a trunk this advice seemed reasonable and fosdick made no objection the boys succeeded in getting two decent trunks at three dollars apiece and ordered them sent to their room in mott street it must be remembered by my readers who may regard the prices given as too low that the events here recorded took place several years before the war when one dollar was equal to two at the present day at the close of the afternoon fosdick got away from the store an hour earlier and the boys preceded by an expressman bearing their trunks went to their new home they had just time to wash and comb their hair when the bell rang for dinner and they went down to the diningroom nearly all the boarders were assembled and were sitting around a long table spread with a variety of dishes mrs browning was a good manager and was wise enough to set a table to which her boarders could not object this way if you please young gentlemen she said pointing to two adjoining seats on the opposite side of the table our hero it must be confessed felt a little awkward not being used to the formality of a boardinghouse and feeling that the eyes of twenty boarders were upon him his confusion was increased when after taking his seat he saw sitting opposite him a young man whose boots he remembered to have blacked only a week before observing dicks look mrs browning proceeded to introduce him to the other mr clifton she said let me introduce mr hunter and his friend mr fosdick two new members of our family dick bowed rather awkwardly and the young man said glad to make your acquaintance mr hunter your face looks quite familiar i think i must have seen you before i think ive seen you before said dick its strange i cant think where said the young man who had not the least idea that the welldressed boy before him was the bootblack who had brushed his boots near the park railings the monday previous dick did not think proper to enlighten him he was not ashamed of his past occupation but it was past and he wanted to be valued for what he might become not for what he had been are you in business mr hunter inquired mr clifton it sounded strange to our hero to be called mr hunter but he rather liked it he felt that it sounded respectable i am at rockwell coopers on pearl street said dick i know the place it is a large firm dick was glad to hear it but did not say that he knew nothing about it the dinner was a good one much better than the two boys were accustomed to get at the eatinghouses which in times past they had frequented dick noticed carefully how the others did and acquitted himself quite creditably so that no one probably suspected that he had not always been used to as good a table when the boys rose from the table mrs browning said wont you walk into the parlor young gentlemen we generally have a little music after dinner some of the young ladies are musical do either of you play dick said he sometimes played marbles at which a young lady laughed and dick catching the infection laughed too miss peyton mr hunter introduced mrs browning miss peyton made a sweeping courtesy to which dick responded by a bow turning red with embarrassment dont you sing mr hunter asked the young lady i aint much on warblin said dick forgetting for the moment where he was this droll answer which miss peyton supposed to be intentionally funny convulsed the young lady with merriment perhaps your friend sings she said thereupon fosdick was also introduced to dicks astonishment he answered that he did a little it was accordingly proposed that they should enter the next room where there was a piano the young lady played some wellknown melodies and fosdick accompanied her with his voice which proved to be quite sweet and melodious you are quite an acquisition to our circle said miss peyton graciously have you boarded in this neighborhood before no said fosdick at another part of the city he was afraid she would ask him in what street but fortunately she forbore in about half an hour the boys went up to their own room where they lighted the gas and opening their trunks placed the contents in the bureaudrawers blessed if it dont seem strange said dick for a feller brought up as i have been to live in this style i wonder what miss peyton would have said if she had known what i had been you havent any cause to be ashamed of it dick it wasnt a very desirable business but it was honest now you can do something better you must adapt yourself to your new circumstances so i mean to said dick im going in for respectability when i get to be sixty years old im goin to wear gold spectacles and walk round this way like the old gentlemen i see most every day on wall street dick threw his head back and began to walk round the room with a pompous step and an air of great importance i hope well both rise dick weve got well started now and thereve been other boys worse off than we are who have worked hard and risen to fame and fortune we can try said dick now let us go out and have a walk all right said fosdick they went downstairs and out into the street accustomed to the lower part of the city there was a novelty in the evening aspect of broadway with its shops and theatres glittering with light they sauntered carelessly along looking in at the shopwindows feeling more and more pleased with their change of location all at once dicks attention was drawn to a gentleman accompanied by a boy of about his own size who was walking a little in advance stop a minute he said to fosdick and hurrying forward placed his hand on the boys arm how are you frank he said frank whitney for it was he turned in some surprise and looked at dick but did not at first recognize in the neat welldressed boy of fifteen the ragged bootblack he had encountered a year before i dont think i remember you he said surveying dick with a puzzled expression perhaps youd remember me better if i had on my washington coat and napoleon pants said our hero with a smile he felt rather pleased to find he was not recognized since it was a compliment to his improved appearance what exclaimed frank his face lighting up with pleasure is it possible that you are richard hunter at your service said our hero but when you knew me i was ragged dick chapter ii introduction to mercantile life frank whitney was indeed surprised to find the ragged bootblack of a year before so wonderfully changed he grasped dicks hand and shook it heartily uncle he said this is dick isnt he changed it is a change i am glad to see said mr whitney also extending his hand for it appears to be a change for the better and who is this other young man this is my private tutor said dick presenting fosdick professor fosdick hes been teachin me every evenin for most a year his terms is very reasonable if it hadnt been for him i never should have reached my present high position in literature and science i am glad to make your acquaintance professor fosdick said frank laughing may i inquire whether my friend dick owes his elegant system of pronunciation to your instructions dick can speak more correctly when he pleases said fosdick but sometimes he falls back into his old way he understands the common english branches very well then he must have worked hard for when i first met him a year ago he was as ignorant as a horse interrupted dick it was you that first made me ambitious frank i wanted to be like you and grow up spectable respectable dick suggested fosdick yes thats what i mean i didnt always want to be a bootblack so i worked hard and with the help of professor fosdick ive got up a little way but im goin to climb higher i am very glad to hear it my young friend said mr whitney it is always pleasant to see a young man fighting his way upward in this free country there is every inducement for effort however unpromising may be the early circumstances in which one is placed but young gentlemen as my nephew would be glad to speak further with you i propose that we adjourn from the sidewalk to the st nicholas hotel where i am at present stopping yes dick said frank you and professor fosdick must spend the evening with me i was intending to visit some place of amusement but would much prefer a visit from you dick and fosdick readily accepted this invitation and turned in the direction of the st nicholas which is situated on broadway below bleecker street by the way dick where are your washington coat and napoleon pants now they were stolen from my room said dick by somebody that wanted to appear on broadway dressed in tiptop style and hadnt got money enough to pay for a suit perhaps it was some agent of barnum who desired to secure the valuable relics suggested frank by gracious said dick suddenly there they are now its the first time ive seen em since they was stolen he pointed to a boy of about his own size who was coming up broadway he was attired in the wellremembered coat and pants but alas time had not spared them the solitary remaining coattail was torn in many places of one sleeve but a fragment remained grease and dirt nearly obliterated the original color and it was a melancholy vestige of what it had been once as for the pantaloons they were a complete wreck when dick had possessed them they were well ventilated but they were now ventilated so much more thoroughly that as dick said afterwards a feller would be warmer without any thats micky maguire said dick a particlar friend of mine that had such a great fection for me that he stole my clothes to remember me by perhaps said fosdick it was on account of his great respect for general washington and the emperor napoleon what would the great washington say if he could see his coat now said frank when i wore it said dick i was sorry he was so great cause it prevented his clothes fitting me it may be necessary to explain to those who are unacquainted with dicks earlier adventures that the clothes in which he was originally introduced were jocosely referred to by him as gifts from the illustrious personages whose names have been mentioned micky maguire did not at first recognize dick when he did so he suddenly shambled down prince street fearful perhaps that the stolen clothes would be reclaimed they had now reached the st nicholas and entered mr whitney led the way up to his apartment and then having a business engagement with a gentleman below he descended to the readingroom leaving the boys alone left to themselves they talked freely dick related fully the different steps in his education with which some of our readers are already familiar and received hearty congratulations from frank and earnest encouragement to persevere i wish you were going to be in the city frank said dick so i shall be soon said frank dicks face lighted up with pleasure thats bully said he enthusiastically how soon are you comin i am hoping to enter columbia college next commencement i suppose my time will be a good deal taken up with study but i shall always find time for you and fosdick i hope you both will call upon me both boys readily accepted the invitation in advance and dick promised to write to frank at his boardingschool in connecticut at about half past ten the two boys left the st nicholas and went back to their boardinghouse after a comfortable nights sleep they got up punctually to the seven oclock breakfast it consisted of beefsteak hot biscuit potatoes and very good coffee dick and fosdick did justice to the separate viands and congratulated themselves upon the superiority of their present fare to that which they had been accustomed to obtain at the restaurants breakfast over fosdick set out for the hat and cap store in which he was employed and dick for rockwell coopers on pearl street it must be confessed that he felt a little bashful as he stood in front of the large warehouse and surveyed the sign he began to feel some apprehensions that he would not be found competent for his post it seemed such a rise from the streets to be employed in such an imposing building but dick did not long permit timidity to stand in his way he entered the large apartment on the first floor which he found chiefly used for storing large boxes and cases of goods there was a countingroom and office occupying one corner partitioned off from the rest of the department dick could see a young man through the glass partition sitting at a desk and opening the door he entered he wished it had been mr rockwell for it would have saved him from introducing himself but of course it was too early for that gentleman to appear what is your business inquired the bookkeeper for it was he ive come to work said dick shortly for somehow he did not take much of a fancy to the bookkeeper whose tone was rather supercilious oh youve come to work have you yes i have said dick independently i dont think we shall need your valuable services said the bookkeeper with something of a sneer the truth was that mr rockwell had neglected to mention that he had engaged dick dick though a little inclined to be bashful when he entered had quite got over that feeling now he didnt intend to be intimidated or driven away by the man before him there was only one doubt in his mind this might be mr cooper the second member of the firm although he did not think it at all probable so he ventured this question is mr rockwell or mr cooper in theyre never here at this hour so i supposed said dick coolly he sat down in an armchair and took up the morning paper the bookkeeper was decidedly provoked by his coolness he felt that he had not impressed dick with his dignity or authority and this made him angry bring that paper to me young man he said i want to consult it very good said dick you can come and get it i cant compliment you on your good manners said the other good manners dont seem to be fashionable here said dick composedly apparently the bookkeeper did not want the paper very particularly as he did not take the trouble to get up for it dick therefore resumed his reading and the other dug his pen spitefully into the paper wishing but not quite daring to order dick out of the countingroom as it might be possible that he had come by appointment did you come to see mr rockwell he asked at length looking up from his writing yes said dick did he tell you to come yes what was that you said about coming to work i said i had come here to work who engaged you mr rockwell oh indeed and how much are you to receive for your valuable services you are very polite to call my services valuable said dick i hope they will be you havent answered my question i have no objection im sure im to get ten dollars a week ten dollars a week echoed the bookkeeper with a scornful laugh do you expect you will earn that no i dont said dick frankly you dont returned the other doubtfully well youre more modest than i thought for then why are you to get so much perhaps mr rockwell will tell you said dick if you tell him youre very particular to know and will lose a nights rest if you dont find out i wouldnt give you a dollar a week then im glad i aint goin to work for you i dont believe your story at all i dont think mr rockwell would be such a fool as to overpay you so much praps i shouldnt be the only one in the establishment that is overpaid observed dick do you mean me you young rascal demanded the bookkeeper now very angry dont call names it isnt polite i demand an answer do you mean to say that i am overpaid well said dick deliberately if youre paid anything for bein polite i should think you was overpaid considerable there is no knowing how long this skirmishing would have continued if mr rockwell himself had not just then entered the countingroom dick rose respectfully at his entrance and the merchant recognizing him at once advanced smiling and gave him a cordial welcome i am glad to see you my boy he said so you didnt forget the appointment how long have you been here half an hour sir i am here unusually early this morning i came purposely to see you and introduce you to those with whom you will labor mr gilbert this is a young man who is going to enter our establishment his name is richard hunter mr gilbert richard is our bookkeeper mr gilbert nodded slightly not a little surprised at his employers cordiality to the new boy so the fellow was right after all he thought but it cant be possible he is to receive ten dollars a week come out into the wareroom and i will show you about continued mr rockwell how do you think you shall like business richard dick was on the point of saying bully but checked himself just in time and said instead very much indeed sir i hope you will if you do well you may depend upon promotion i shall not forget under what a heavy obligation i am to you my brave boy what would the bookkeeper have said if he had heard this how is the little boy sir asked dick very well indeed he does not appear even to have taken cold as might have been expected from his exposure and remaining in wet clothes for some time i am glad to hear that he is well sir you must come up and see him for yourself richard said mr rockwell in a friendly manner i have no doubt you will become good friends very soon besides my wife is anxious to see and thank the preserver of her boy i shall be very glad indeed to come sir i live at no madison avenue come tomorrow evening if you have no engagement thank you sir mr rockwell now introduced dick to his head clerk with a few words stating that he was a lad in whose welfare he took a deep interest and he would be glad to have him induct him into his duties and regard with indulgence any mistakes which he might at first make through ignorance the head clerk was a pleasantlooking man of middle age named murdock very different in his manners and bearing from mr gilbert the bookkeeper yes sir he said i will take the young man under my charge he looks bright and sharp enough and i hope we may make a business man of him in course of time that was what dick liked his heart always opened to kindness but harshness always made him defiant ill try to make you as little trouble as possible sir he said i may make mistakes at first but im willin to work and i want to work my way up thats right my boy said mr murdock let that be your determination and i am sure you will succeed before mr murdock begins to instruct you in your duties said mr rockwell you may go to the postoffice and see if there are any letters for us our box is no all right sir said dick and he took his hat at once and started he reached chatham square turned into printing house square and just at the corner of spruce and nassau streets close by the tribune office he saw the familiar face and figure of johnny nolan one of his old associates when he was a bootblack how are you johnny he said is that you dick asked johnny turning round wheres your box and brush at home you havent give up business have you ive just gone into business johnny i mean you aint give up blackin boots have you all except my own johnny aint that a good shine and dick displayed his boot with something of his old professional pride what you up to now dick youre dressed like a swell oh said dick ive retired from shines on a fortun and embarked my capital in mercantile pursuits im in a store on pearl street what store rockwell coopers howd you get there they wanted a partner with a large capital and so they took me said dick were goin to do a smashin business we mean to send off a ship to europe every day besides what we send to other places and expect to make no end of stamps whats the use of gassin dick tell a feller now honor bright then johnny ive got a place at ten dollars a week and im goin to be spectable why dont you turn over a new leaf and try to get up in the world i aint lucky dick i dont half the time make enough to live on if it wasnt for the newsboys lodgin house i dont know what id do i need a new brush and box of blacking but i aint got money enough to buy one then johnny ill help you this once heres fifty cents ill give it to you now if youre smart you can make a dollar a day easy and save up part of it you ought to be more enterprisin johnny theres a gentleman wants a shine now illustration johnny hitched up his trousers put the fifty cents in his mouth having no pocket unprovided with holes and proffered his services to the gentleman indicated with success dick left him at work and kept on his way down nassau street a year ago he thought i was just like johnny dressed in rags and livin as i could if it hadnt been for my meetin with frank id been just the same to day most likely now ive got a good place and some money in the bank besides ristocratic friends who invite me to come and see them blessed if i aint afraid im dreamin it all like the man that dreamed he was in a palace and woke up to find himself in a pigpen chapter iii at the postoffice the new york postoffice is built of brick and was formerly a church it is a shabby building and quite unworthy of so large and important a city of course dick was quite familiar with its general appearance but as his correspondence had been very limited he had never had occasion to ask for letters there were several letters in box dick secured these and turning round to go out his attention was drawn to a young gentleman of about his own age who from his consequential air appeared to feel his own importance in no slight degree he recognized him at once as roswell crawford a boy who had applied unsuccessfully for the place which fosdick obtained in hendersons hat and cap store roswell recognized dick at the same time and perceiving that our hero was welldressed concluded to speak to him though he regarded dick as infinitely beneath himself in the social scale on account of his former employment he might not have been so condescending but he was curious to learn what dick was about i havent seen you for some time he said in a patronizing tone no said dick and i havent seen you for some time either which is a very curious coincidence hows bootblacking now inquired roswell with something of a sneer tiptop said dick not at all disturbed by roswells manner i do it wholesale now and have been obliged to hire a large building on pearl street to transact my business in you see them letters theyre all from wholesale customers i congratulate you on your success said roswell in the same disagreeable manner of course thats all humbug i suppose youve got a place yes said dick who are you with rockwell cooper on pearl street how did you get it asked roswell appearing surprised did they know you had been a bootblack of course they did i shouldnt think that they would have taken you why not there are not many firms that would hire a bootblack when they could get plenty of boys from nice families perhaps they might have secured your services if they had applied said dick goodhumoredly ive got a place said roswell in rather an important manner im very glad i didnt go into hendersons hat and cap store ive got a better situation have you said dick im glad to hear it im always happy to hear that my friends are risin in the world you neednt class me among your friends said roswell superciliously no i wont said dick im goin to be particular about my associates now that im gettin up in the world do you mean to insult me demanded roswell haughtily no said dick i wouldnt on any account i should be afraid youd want me to fight a duel and that wouldnt be convenient for i havent made my will and im afraid my heirs would quarrel over my extensive property how much do you get a week asked roswell thinking it best to change the subject ten dollars said dick ten dollars ejaculated roswell thats a pretty large story you neednt believe it if you dont want to said dick that wont make any difference to me as long as they pay me reglar ten dollars why i never heard of such a thing exclaimed roswell who only received four dollars a week himself and thought he was doing well do you think id give up a loocrative business for less asked dick how much do you get thats my business said roswell who for reasons that may be guessed didnt care to mention the price for which he was working judging dick by himself he thought it would give him a chance to exult over him i suppose it is said dick but as you was so particlar to find out how much i got i thought id inquire youre trying to deceive me i dont believe you get more than three dollars a week dont you is that what you get i get a great deal more im happy to hear it i can find out how much you get if i want to youve found out already i know what you say but ive got a cousin in rockwell coopers have you asked dick a little surprised who is it it is the bookkeeper mr gilbert yes he has been there five years ill ask him about it youd better as youre so anxious to find out mr gilbert is a friend of mine he spoke only this morning of my valooable services roswell looked incredulous in fact he did not understand dick at all nor could he comprehend his imperturbable goodhumor there were several things that he had said which would have offended most boys but dick met them with a careless goodhumor and an evident indifference to roswells good opinion which piqued and provoked that young man it must not be supposed that while this conversation was going on the boys were standing in the postoffice dick understood his duty to his employers too well to delay unnecessarily while on an errand especially when he was sent to get letters some of which might be of an important and urgent nature the two boys had been walking up nassau street together and they had now reached printing house square there are some of your old friends said roswell pointing to a group of ragged bootblacks who were on the alert for customers crying to each passer shine yer boots yes said dick i know them all no doubt sneered roswell theyre friends to be proud of im glad you think so said dick theyre a rough set he continued more earnestly but theres one of them at least thats ten times better than you or i speak for yourself if you please said roswell haughtily im speakin for both of us said dick theres one boy there only twelve years old thats supported his sick mother and sister for moren a year and thats more good than ever you or i did how are you tom he said nodding to the boy of whom he had spoken tiptop dick said a brightlooking boy who kept as clean as his avocation would permit have you given up business yes tom ill tell you about it some other time i must get back to pearl street with these letters hows your mother she aint much better dick buy her some oranges theyll do her good and dick slipped half a dollar into toms hand thank you dick shell like them i know but you oughtnt to give so much whats half a dollar to a man of my fortune said dick take care of yourself tom i must hurry back to the store roswell was already gone his pride would not permit him to stand by while dick was conversing with a bootblack he felt that his position would be compromised as for dick he was so well dressed that nobody would know that he had ever been in that business the fact is roswell like a great many other people was troubled with a large share of pride though it might have puzzled himself to explain what he had to be proud of had dick been at all like him he would have shunned all his former acquaintances and taken every precaution against having it discovered that he had ever occupied a similar position but dick was above such meanness he could see that tom for instance was far superior in all that constituted manliness to roswell crawford and bootblack though he was he prepared to recognize him as a friend when dick reached the store he did not immediately see mr rockwell he accordingly entered the countingroom where gilbert the bookkeeper was seated at a desk here are the letters mr gilbert said dick lay them down said the bookkeeper sourly youve been gone long enough how many did you drop on the way i didnt know i was expected to drop any said dick if i had been told to do so i would have obeyed orders cheerfully mr gilbert was about to remark that dick was an impudent young rascal when the sudden entrance of mr rockwell compelled him to suppress the observation and he was obliged to be content with muttering it to himself back already richard said his employer pleasantly where are the letters here sir said dick very well you may go to mr murdock and see what he can find for you to do mr rockwell sat down to read his letters and dick went as directed to the head clerk mr rockwell sent me to you mr murdock he said he says you will find something for me to do oh yes well keep you busy said the head clerk with a manner very different from that of the bookkeeper at present however your duties will be of rather a miscellaneous character we shall want you partly for an entry clerk and partly to run to the postoffice bank and so forth all right sir said dick im ready to do anything that is required of me i want to make myself useful thats the right way to feel my young friend some boys are so bigfeeling and put on so many airs that youd think they were partners in the business instead of beginning at the lowest round of the ladder a while ago mr gilbert brought round a cousin of his about your age that he wanted to get in here but the young gentleman was altogether too lofty to suit me so we didnt take him was the boys name roswell crawford yes do you know him not much he thinks im too far beneath him for him to associate with but he was kind enough to walk up nassau street with me this morning just to encourage me a little that was kind in him certainly said the head clerk smiling unless i am very much mistaken you will be able to get along without his patronage i hope so said dick the rest of the day dick was kept busy in various ways he took hold with a will and showed himself so efficient that he made a favorable impression upon every one in the establishment except the bookkeeper for some reason or other mr gilbert did not like dick and was determined to oust him from his situation if an opportunity should offer chapter iv life at the boardinghouse dick found his new quarters in bleecker street very comfortable his room was kept in neat order which was more than could be said of his former home in mott street there once a fortnight was thought sufficient to change the sheets while both boys were expected to use the same towel and make that last a week indeed mrs mooney would have considered the boys mighty particular if they had objected to such an arrangement mrs browning fortunately was very different and dick found nothing to complain of either in his chamber or in the board which was furnished dick had felt rather awkward on his first appearance at the table but he was beginning to feel more at his ease it was rather remarkable considering his past life how readily he adapted himself to an experience so different he left the store at five oclock and got to his boardinghouse in time to get ready for dinner dick had now got to be quite particular about his appearance he washed his face and hands thoroughly and brushed his hair carefully before appearing at the table miss peyton the lively young lady who has already been mentioned in the first chapter sat near the boys and evidently was quite prepossessed in their favor both had bright and attractive faces though dick would undoubtedly be considered the handsomest he had a fresh color which spoke of good health and was wellformed and strong henry fosdick was more delicate in appearance his face was thinner and rather pale it was clear that he was not as well able to fight his way through life as dick but there was something pleasant and attractive in his quiet sedateness as well as in the frank honesty and humor that could be read in the glance of our friend dick wont you and your friend stop a little while and sing asked miss peyton addressing henry fosdick on the evening of the second day of dicks business career fosdick hesitated my friend has an engagement this evening he said i suppose i may not ask where said she i am invited to spend the evening with some friends on madison avenue said dick indeed said miss peyton surprised i wasnt aware you had such fashionable friends or i couldnt have expected to retain you all my friends are not as fashionable said dick wondering what the young lady would say if she could see his late fellowlodgers at mrs mooneys on mott street if i cant hope to keep you this evening you must promise to stay awhile tomorrow evening i hope to have the pleasure of hearing you sing mr hunter when i give a concert said dick ill be sure to let you in gratooitous thank you said miss peyton i shall remind you of it i hope that time will come very soon just as soon as i can engage the academy of music on reasonable terms youd better try first in the parlor here well take up a contribution to pay you for your exertions thank you said dick youre very kind as the man said to the judge when he asked him when it would be perfectly agreeable for him to be hung miss peyton laughed at this remark and dick went upstairs to get ready for his visit to madison avenue our hero felt a little bashful about this visit he was afraid that he would do or say something that was improper or that something would slip out which would betray his vagabond life of the streets i wish you was going with me fosdick he said youll get along well enough alone dick dont be afraid you see i aint used to society fosdick nor i either but it seems to come natural to you im always makin some blunder youll get over that in time dick its because you have so much fun in you i am more sober miss peyton seems very much amused by your odd remarks i have to talk so i cant think of anything else to say theres one thing dick we mustnt give up at any rate whats that studying we dont either of us know as much as we ought to thats so you can see how much good studying has done for you so far if it hadnt been for that you wouldnt have been able to go into mr rockwells employment thats true enough fosdick im afraid i dont know enough now you know enough to get along very well for the present but you want to rise youre right when i get to be old and infirm i dont want to be an errandboy nor i either so dick i think we had better make up our minds to study an hour or an hour and a half every evening of course you cant begin this evening but there are very few when you cant find the time ill send a circlar to my numerous friends on fifth avenue and madison tellin em how much im obliged for their kind invitations but the claims of literatoor and science cant be neglected do you know dick i think it might be well for us to begin french i wonder what johnny nolan would say if i should inquire after his health in the pollyvoo language it wouldnt be the first time you have astonished him well fosdick im in for it if you think its best now tell me what necktie i shall wear dick displayed two one was bright red with large figures which he had bought soon after he began to board in mott street the other was a plain black youd better wear the black one dick said fosdick whose taste was simpler and better than his friends it seems to me it dont look handsome enough said dick whose taste had not yet been formed and was influenced by the bowery style of dress its more modest and that is all the better all right i suppose you know best before i get ready i must give a new shine to my boots im going to make them shine so you can see your face in them better let me do that for you dick i can do it while youre dressing and that will save time no fosdick i was longer in the business than you and none of the boys could beat me on shines i dont know but youre right dick i freely yield the palm to you in that dick stripped off his coat and vest and went to work with a will he had never worked so hard for one of his old customers im goin to give it a twentyfive cent shine he said just then a knock was heard at the chamberdoor come in said dick pausing a moment in his labors mr clifton a fellowboarder entered with a cigar in his mouth holloa said he whats up going to the theatre hunter no said dick im goin out to spend the evening with some friends up in madison avenue so i heard you say at the table but i thought you were joking no said dick its a fact seems to me you handle the brush pretty skilfully remarked mr clifton i should almost think you had served a regular apprenticeship at it so i have answered dick didnt you ever see me when i blacked boots on chatham square good joke said the young man who was far from supposing that dick was in earnest oh yes of course ive seen you often did you make money at it i retired on a fortun said dick and now ive invested my capital in mercantile pursuits there and he took up one boot and showed it to his visitor did you ever see a better shine than that no i didnt thats a fact said clifton admiringly you beat the young rascal i employ all hollow i say hunter if you ever go into the shine business again ill be a regular customer of yours he little thinks ive blacked his boots before now thought dick all right said he aloud when a commercial crisis comes and i fail in business i think ill remember your encouragin offer and remind you of it have a cigar either of you asked clifton drawing out a case excuse my not offering it before no thank you said fosdick dont smoke eh wont you have one hunter no thank you fosdick is my guardian and he dont allow it so youre a good boy well i wish you a pleasant evening and clifton sauntered out to find some other companion he wouldnt believe id been a bootblack said dick even after i told him i knew he wouldnt or i wouldnt have said so is my hair parted straight yes its all right hows my cravat itll do youre getting to be quite a dandy dick i want to look respectable got it right that time when i visit turkey i want to look as the turkeys do wont you go with me as far as the door i mean yes if youre going to walk id rather i feel kind of nervous and perhaps ill walk it off the two boys got their caps and walked up broadway on the west side the lights were already lit and the shop windows made a brilliant display at intervals places of amusement opened wide their hospitable portals and large placards presented tempting invitations to enter they reached union square and traversing it again walked up broadway to madison park at the upper end of this park commences the beautiful avenue which bears the same name only about half a dozen blocks now required to be passed when the boys found themselves opposite a residence with a very imposing front this is the place said dick i wish you were going in with me i hope you will have a pleasant time dick goodby till i see you again dick felt a little nervous but he summoned up all his courage and ascending the broad marble steps rang the bell chapter v dick receives two valuable presents at the end of the last chapter we left dick standing on the steps of mr rockwells residence in madison avenue he had rung the bell and was waiting to have his summons answered to say that dick expected to enjoy his visit would not be strictly true he knew very well that his street education had not qualified him to appear to advantage in fashionable society and he wished that fosdick were with him to lend him countenance while under the influence of these feelings the door was thrown open and a servant looked at him inquiringly is mr rockwell at home asked dick yes would you like to see him he asked me to call this evening what are you the boy that saved master johnny from drowning asked the servant her face brightening up for johnny was a great favorite in the house i jumped into the water after him said dick modestly i heard mr rockwell say he was expecting you tonight come right in mistress is very anxious to see you placed a little at his ease by this cordial reception dick followed the servant upstairs to a pleasant sittingroom on the second floor mr and mrs rockwell were seated at a centretable reading the evening papers while johnny and his sister grace were constructing a tower of babel with some blocks upon the carpet before the fire dick entered and stood just within the door with his cap in his hand feeling a little embarrassed i am glad to see you richard said mr rockwell rising from his seat and advancing to our hero with a pleasant smile mrs rockwell has been anxious to see you my dear this is the brave boy who saved our little johnny mrs rockwell a tall graceful lady with a smile that quite captivated dick offered her hand and said earnestly my brave boy i have been wishing to see you i shudder to think that but for your prompt courage i should now be mourning the loss of my dear little johnny accept a mothers thanks for a favor so great that she can never hope to repay it now this acknowledgment was very pleasant to dick but it was also very embarrassing it is difficult to receive praise gracefully so our hero not knowing what else to say stammered out that she was very welcome i understand that you have entered my husbands employment said mrs rockwell yes said dick he was kind enough to take me i hope to make a man of business of our young friend said mr rockwell he will soon feel at home in his new position and i hope we may find the connection mutually satisfactory have you a pleasant boardingplace asked mrs rockwell tiptop said dick i mean pretty good he added in a little confusion where is it in bleecker street said dick very glad that he was not obliged to say mott street that is quite a good location said mr rockwell how do you spend your evenings richard in studying with a friend of mine said dick i want to know something by the time i grow up that is an excellent resolution said his employer with warm approval i wish more boys of your age were equally sensible you may depend upon it that a good education is the best preparation for an honorable and useful manhood what is your friends name henry fosdick he rooms with me i am glad you have a friend who shares your tastes but perhaps you would like to renew your acquaintance with the young gentleman to whom you have rendered so great a service johnny has been allowed to stay up beyond his usual bedtime because you were coming johnny come here johnny rose from his blocks and came to his mothers side he was a pleasantlooking little fellow with a pair of bright eyes and round plump cheeks he looked shyly at dick did you ever see this young man asked his mother yes said johnny when was it when i was in the river said johnny he pulled me out are you glad to see him yes said johnny what is his name dick said our hero who somehow could not help feeling when called richard that some other boy was meant wont you come and help me build a house asked little johnny dick accepted the invitation with pleasure feeling more at home with children than with older persons this is sister grace said johnny with an offhand introduction i saw you on the boat said dick yes said grace i was there oh how frightened i was when johnny fell into the water i dont see how you dared to jump in after him oh ive been in swimming many a time i dont mind it said dick i spose youre used to it like the fishes said johnny im glad im not a fish i shouldnt like to live in the water i dont think i should either said dick now what do you think the fishes do when it rains i do not know they go down to the bottom of the sea to get out of the wet isnt it wet down at the bottom of the sea asked johnny in good faith of course it is you little goose said grace with an air of superior wisdom will you make me a house said johnny what kind of a house do you want said dick seating himself on the carpet and taking up the blocks any kind said johnny dick beginning to feel quite at home with the children erected an imposinglooking house leaving little spaces for the doors and windows thats better than the house grace made said johnny looking at it with complacency but it wont last very long said dick youd better sell it before it tumbles over do you own any houses asked johnny not many said dick smiling my father owns this house said johnny positively he paid fifty dollars for it i didnt think houses were so cheap said dick id like to buy one at that price youre a little goose johnny said grace he gave as much as five hundred dollars grace doesnt know much more about the price of real estate than johnny said mr rockwell didnt the house cost as much as five hundred dollars asked grace as much as that certainly my dear just then by an unguarded movement of johnnys foot the edifice of blocks reared by dick became a confused ruin ive got tired of building houses he announced wont you tell me a story dick i dont think i know any said our hero here is a book of pictures said his mother bringing one from the table perhaps your new friend will show them to you dick took the book and felt very glad that he had learned to read otherwise he might have been considerably embarrassed the children asked a great many questions of dick about the pictures some of which he could not answer johnny on being shown the picture of a turkish mosque asked if that was the place where the turkeys went to church if there was any place for a goose to go to church youd go there said his sister i aint a goose any more than you are said johnny indignantly am i dick just then the servant came in to carry the children to bed and considerably against their wishes they were obliged to withdraw come again dick said johnny thank you said dick goodnight goodnight said the two children and the door closed upon them i think ill be going said dick who did not feel quite so much at ease now that his young friends had left him wait a few minutes said mrs rockwell she rang the bell and a servant brought up some cake and apples of which dick was invited to partake i need not detail the conversation but mrs rockwell with the tact of a genuine lady managed to draw out dick and put him quite at his ease how old are you richard she asked fifteen said dick goin on sixteen you are getting to be quite a young man old enough to wear a watch have you one no said dick not suspecting the motive that led to her question will you allow me the pleasure of supplying the deficiency said mrs rockwell as she spoke she drew from a box at her side a very neat gold watch and chain and placed it in dicks hands our hero was so astonished at first that he could scarcely believe that this valuable present was intended for him is it for me he asked hesitatingly yes said mrs rockwell smiling pleasantly i hope you will find it of service it is too much said dick i do not deserve it you must let me be the judge of that said the lady kindly here is the key i nearly forgot to give it to you i suppose you know how to wind it up yes said dick i understand that i am very much obliged to you you are very welcome whenever you look at it let it remind you that under all circumstances you can rely upon the friendship of johnnys parents dick slipped the watch into a watchpocket in his vest for which he had never before had any use and attached the chain to his buttonhole how beautiful it is he said in tones of admiration it was bought at ball blacks said mrs rockwell if it should not keep good time or anything should happen to it i advise you to take it there and they will repair it for you dick perceived by his new watch that it was nearly ten oclock and rose to go he was kindly invited to renew his visit and promised to do so just as he was leaving the room mr rockwell handed a sealed envelope to dick saying put this in your pocket richard it will be time enough to open it when you get home dick sped home much more quickly than he had come he thought with delight of fosdicks surprise when he should see the new watch and chain and also with pardonable exultation of the sensation he would produce at the table when he carelessly drew out his watch to see what time it was when he reached his boardinghouse and went upstairs he found fosdick sitting up for him well dick what sort of a time did you have he asked tiptop said dick who did you see mr and mrs rockwell and two children johnny the one i fished out of the water and his sister grace johnnys a jolly little chap and his sister is a nice girl halloa whats that asked fosdick suddenly espying the watchchain what do you think of my new watch asked dick drawing it out do you mean to say it is yours yes mrs rockwell gave it to me its a regular beauty mr henderson has got one that he paid a hundred dollars for but it isnt as nice as yours seems to me i have no end of luck said dick ill be a young man of fortun before i know it people will think you are now when they see you wear such a watch as that johnny noland think i stole it if he should see it said dick poor chap i wish some luck would come to him i saw him today lookin just as i used to before i met frank theres some difference between then and now dick yes i was a rough chap in them days in those days dick in those days and i dont know but i am now but im trying to improve with you to help me i think ill grow up respectable i hope we both will dick but whos that letter from that youve just taken out of your pocket oh i forgot mr rockwell handed it to me just before i came away and told me not to open it till i got home praps it says that he hasnt no more occasion for my valuable services that isnt very likely considering the present you have brought home but open it i am curious to see what is in it the envelope was cut open and a piece of paper dropped out fosdick picked it up and to his inexpressible amazement ascertained that it was a check on the park bank for the sum of one thousand dollars made payable to richard hunter or order a thousand dollars repeated dick overwhelmed with astonishment youre only foolin me praps its ten dollars no its a thousand dollars read it yourself if you dont believe it i wish youd pinch me fosdick said dick seriously certainly if you wish it thats enough said dick hastily i only wanted to make sure i wasnt dreamin i cant believe im worth a thousand dollars youre a lucky fellow dick said fosdick and you deserve your luck im heartily glad of it about the best luck i ever had was in meeting you said dick affectionately im goin to give you half the money no youre not dick thank you all the same said fosdick decidedly it was meant for you and you must keep it ill get along well enough if i dont i know youll help me but i wish youd take half the money no dick it wouldnt be right but your new watch says its getting late and we had better go to bed it was some time before dick fell asleep his good luck had so excited him that he found it difficult to calm down sufficiently to sink into a quiet slumber chapter vi mr gilbert is astonished when dick woke up in the morning the first thing he thought of was his watch the next the check which he had received from mr rockwell ill go to the bank this morning and get my money said he how are you going to invest it dick asked fosdick i dont know said dick ill put it in the savings bank till i decide thatll make moren eleven hundred dollars i didnt use to think i everd be worth that when i slept in boxes and old wagons eleven hundred dollars at six per cent interest will yield you sixtysix dollars a year so it will said dick and all without working i tell you what fosdick at this rate ill soon be a man of fortune yes if you can make a thousand dollars a day i wonder what old gilbertll say when he sees it said dick whos he hes the bookkeeper he aint very fond of me what has he against you he thinks i dont treat him with proper respect said dick besides he tried to get his cousin roswell crawford in but he couldnt then it seems both of us have interfered with roswell hes got a place now i guess hes the senior partner by the way he talks the breakfastbell rang and the boys went down to breakfast clifton was down already and was standing in front of stove being an observing young man he at once noticed dicks watchchain halloa hunter said he i didnt know you had a watch i didnt know it myself till last night said dick where did you get it it came from ball blacks said our hero willing to mystify him thats a nice chain solid gold eh do you think id wear anything else asked dick loftily will you allow me to look at the watch certainly said dick drawing it from his pocket and submitting it to cliftons inspection its a regular beauty said the young man enthusiastically do you mind telling how much you paid for it how much do you think a hundred dollars it cost all of that said dick confidently if you see one for sale at that price just let me know and ill buy it for a speculation you must be getting a pretty good salary to buy such a watch as that pretty good said dick carelessly mr clifton was rather a shallow young man who was fond of show and had a great respect for those who were able to make it when dick first came to the boardinghouse he looked down upon him as a boy but now that he proved to be the possessor of an elegant gold watch and chain and might therefore be regarded as in prosperous circumstances he conceived a high respect for him the truth was that clifton himself only got two dollars a week more than dick yet he paid eight dollars a week for board and spent the rest in dress his reputation among tailors was not the best being always more ready to order new clothes than to pay for them while they were talking the rest of the boarders entered and breakfast commenced miss peyton was there of course how did you find your friends in madison avenue last evening mr hunter she inquired they were all up and dressed said dick they sent their particlar regards to you oh you wicked storyteller simpered miss peyton just as if id believe such nonsense have they got a nice house beautiful said dick i havent seen any like it since i called on queen victoria last year how is the house furnished well said dick as near as i can remember theres diamonds worked in the carpet and all the tables and chairs is of gold theyd be rather hard to set on if it twant for the velvet cushions aint you afraid to tell such stories mr hunter mr fosdick you will have to talk to your friend i am afraid it wouldnt do much good miss peyton if you fail to cure him mr hunter has just been investing in a handsome watch remarked clifton passing his cup for a second cup of coffee oh do let me look at it i dote on watches said miss peyton certainly said dick and he detached the chain from his buttonhole and passed the watch across the table its a perfect little love said miss peyton enthusiastically isnt it mrs browning it is very beautiful certainly said the landlady she could not help feeling surprised that dick who it will be remembered had represented himself at his first visit to be in limited circumstances and now occupied one of her cheapest rooms could afford to purchase an article which was evidently so costly where did you buy it mr hunter asked another boarder i did not buy it at all said dick deciding to let it be known how it came into his possession it was given to me perhaps youll mention my name to the person that gave it to you said mr clifton if hes got any more to dispose of in that way i should like to come in for one how do you know but it may have come from a lady friend mr clifton said miss peyton slyly how is that hunter i havent had any presents from any of my lady friends yet said dick perhaps i may some time you dont mean anybody in particular of course mr hunter said miss peyton oh no of course not this conversation may seem scarcely worth recording but it will serve to illustrate the character of dicks fellowboarders miss peyton was rather silly and affected but she was goodnatured and dick felt more at home with her than he would have done had she been a lady like mrs rockwell for instance it got to be the custom with dick and fosdick to remain in the parlor a short time after supper or rather dinner for this was the third meal and fosdick joined the young lady in singing dick unfortunately had not been gifted by nature with a voice attuned to melody and he participated only as a listener in which capacity he enjoyed the entertainment after breakfast dick set out for the store as usual he felt unusually happy and independent as he walked along the check in his pocket made him feel rich he wondered how it would be best to invest his money so as to yield him the largest return he wisely decided to take mr murdock the head clerk into his confidence and ask his advice upon this point when dick arrived at the store neither mr gilbert nor mr murdock had yet arrived half an hour later the latter came and five minutes after him the bookkeeper the latter noticed that the morning paper appeared to have been disturbed and glad of any opportunity to find fault with dick said angrily so youve been reading the paper instead of minding your work have you ill report you to mr rockwell thank you said dick youre very kind are you sure i read the paper is there any news missin out of it youre an impudent boy said the bookkeeper provoked he wanted to overawe dick but somehow dick wouldnt be overawed evidently he did not entertain as much respect for the bookkeeper as that gentleman felt to be his due that a mere errandboy should bandy words with a gentleman in his position seemed to mr gilbert highly reprehensible youre an impudent boy repeated gilbert sharply finding dick did not reply to his first charge i heard you make that remark before said dick quietly now there was nothing out of the way in dicks tone which was perfectly respectful and he only stated a fact but the bookkeeper became still more angry who rumpled that paper he asked suppose you ask mr murdock said dick did he come in here asked gilbert cooling down for it was against dick that his charge was made and not against the head clerk as to the paper he really cared nothing yes said dick then its all right i supposed you had been idling your time over the paper go and ask mr murdock what time it is i left my watch at home its half past eight said dick drawing out his watch up to this time the bookkeeper had not noticed dicks watchchain now that his attention was drawn not only to that but to the beautiful gold watch which dick carried he was not a little surprised whose watch is that he asked abruptly mine said dick briefly rather enjoying the bookkeepers surprise how did you come by it honestly said dick is it gold or only plated its gold humph did you buy it or was it given you well said dick i didnt buy it did you say it was yours yes gilbert looked at dick in surprise our hero was becoming more and more an enigma to him that a boy in dicks position should have a gold watch given him especially now that he had learned from his cousin roswell the nature of dicks former employment seemed indeed wonderful let me look at your watch a minute he said dick handed it to him it seems to be a very good one he said yes said dick i aint proud its as good as i want to wear it looks entirely out of place on such a boy as you said the bookkeeper sharply perhaps it would look better on you suggested our hero innocently yes it would be more appropriate for me to wear than you youre not old enough to be trusted with a watch least of all with such a good one as that perhaps youd be kind enough to mention it to the one that gave it to me whoever gave it to you didnt show much judgment said gilbert in the same pleasant way who was it it was mrs rockwell if a bombshell had exploded in the office it could hardly have taken gilbert more by surprise who did you say he repeated thinking his ears might have deceived him mrs rockwell said dick once more the bookkeeper could hardly suppress a low whistle when did she give it to you last evening were you up there yes did mr rockwell invite you yes just then dick was called away by mr murdock who had some work for him to do theres something mighty queer in all this thought the bookkeeper what mr rockwell can see in that boy i dont understand hes an impudent young rascal and ill get him turned off if its a possible thing chapter vii a financial discussion in the course of the morning dick called at the park bank and presented the check which was made payable to himself his employer had accompanied him to the bank on a previous day and introduced him to the cashier as one who was authorized to receive and pay over money for the firm dick therefore found no difficulty in obtaining his money though the fact that the check was made payable to him created some surprise your salary seems to be a large one said the teller as he handed our hero ten bills of a hundred dollars each yes said dick my services are very valooable on leaving the bank dick went to the savings bank and presented his book how much do you wish to deposit a thousand dollars said dick briefly the bank officer looked at him in surprise how much did you say he repeated a thousand dollars no nonsense young man my time is too valuable said the other impatiently he was justified in his incredulity since dicks deposits hitherto had been in sums of from one to five dollars if you dont want to take the money i can go somewhere else said our hero who was now on his dignity i have a thousand dollars to deposit here it is the bank officer took the money and counted it over in considerable surprise business is improving isnt it he said yes said dick i made all that money in one day if you should want a partner call round and see me all right i wont forget dick took the bankbook and putting it in his inside coatpocket buttoned up his coat and hurried back to the store his reflections were of a very agreeable nature as he thought of his large deposit in the savings bank and he could not help feeling that he had been born under a lucky star nothing of consequence transpired in the store that day dick was attentive to his duties he was determined to learn the business as rapidly as possible not only because he felt grateful to mr rockwell for his kindness but also because he knew that this was the best thing for his future prospects mr murdock who has already been mentioned was of service to him in this respect he was himself an excellent business man and very conscientious in the discharge of his duties he required the same fidelity of others he had observed dick closely and was attracted towards him by his evident desire to give satisfaction as well as by his frank open face he resolved to help him along more especially when he saw the manner in which he was treated by the bookkeeper to tell the truth mr gilbert was not a favorite with mr murdock he understood his business to be sure and so far as mr murdock knew kept the books correctly but personally he was not agreeable and the head salesman doubted whether his integrity was what it should have been so altogether he made up his mind to help dick on as well as he could and take pains to instruct him in the business dick on his side was pleased with mr murdock and determined to make him a confidant in the matter of his sudden accession of fortune he took an opportunity therefore during the day to say to him mr murdock i want to ask your advice about something well my lad what is it said his friend kindly if its about choosing a wife i dont know whether my advice will be good for much it isnt that said dick next yearll be soon enough for that so i should think well if its nothing of that sort what is it its about investing some money i thought you might be able to advise me how much is it asked mr murdock supposing the sum could not be more than fifty or sixty dollars eleven hundred dollars said dick how much demanded the salesman in surprise eleven hundred dollars is it your own yes of course you couldnt have earned so much was it left to you ill tell you all about it said dick i wouldnt tell mr gilbert and i dont mean he shall know it but id just as lieves tell you do you know why mr rockwell gave me this place no ive wondered a little not at that but at his giving you so much higher pay than boys usually receive then ill tell you dick proceeded to give an account of the manner in which he had rescued little johnny from drowning as related in the adventures of ragged dick it was a brave act said mr murdock it was nothing at all said dick modestly i could swim like a duck and i didnt mind the wetting but you ran the risk of drowning i didnt think of that if you had been a coward or a selfish boy it would have been the first thing you would have thought of so mr rockwell gave you this place in acknowledgment of your service i am glad he did you deserve it he has done more said dick then he related the events of the evening previous and told mr murdock of the two gifts he had received so with the money i had before i have now eleven hundred dollars dick concluded shall i leave it in the savings bank or can i do better with it ill tell you what i think will be a good investment said mr murdock i know a party who owns four adjoining lots on fortyfifth street he is pressed for money and wishes to dispose of them he offered them to me at twentytwo hundred dollars half cash i offered him a thousand dollars cash for two of them but he wishes to sell the whole together i think it will be an excellent speculation for the laying out of central park is carrying up the price of lots in the neighborhood rapidly why didnt you buy them then because i didnt want to buy anything that i couldnt pay for at once ive got a wife and three children to look out for and so i can save money but slowly if i only had myself to take care of i wouldnt hesitate cant we club together and buy it suggested dick eagerly that is just what i was going to propose i think the owner will take two thousand dollars down for the lots that will be a thousand dollars apiece ive got that money and so have you what do you think of it tiptop said dick enthusiastically its just what id like to do of course it wouldnt bring us in anything but would instead be an expense for the present as we should have to pay taxes on it on the other hand you could invest the money in bankstock so as to receive seventy or eighty dollars annually at interest you must decide which investment you prefer the land we may have to keep on hand four or five years paying taxes yearly but the pricell go up there is no doubt of that the city is extending northwards rapidly i shouldnt be surprised if the lots would bring a thousand dollars apiece in less than five years this would be equal to a very handsome interest im in for buying em said dick so if youll see the owner ill have the money all ready whenever you want it very well but perhaps you would like to see them first well manage to get off an hour earlier than usual this afternoon and go up and take a look at them it seems to me mr murdock and that boy are pretty thick together said the bookkeeper glancing through the glass partition he could see that they were conversing earnestly but of course couldnt hear a word that was said what he or mr rockwell can see in the young rascal passes my comprehension he called sharply to dick and ordered him to go to the postoffice for letters all right said dick and mind you dont loiter by the way said the bookkeeper sharply you were gone long enough at the bank this morning did you come right back no said dick why didnt you there was somewhere else i wanted to go on your own business or mr rockwells on my own business so i thought i shall report you to mr rockwell said gilbert triumphantly i wouldnt if i were you said dick coolly and why not you young rascal because he knows it already knows it already repeated the bookkeeper discomfited well i hope he gave you a good scolding i am sorry to disappoint you said dick but he knows it because he gave me leave to go i dont believe it said gilbert mortified to find that dick was in the right after all then perhaps youd better ask mr rockwell i will said gilbert who really had no intention of doing so you must have had some very urgent private business he added with a sneer youre right there said dick playing marbles with some of your ragamuffin friends i suppose playin marbles is a very refined and intellectual amusement said dick but i dont play marbles in business hours where did you go said the bookkeeper impatiently i dont want any of your impertinence i went to the savings bank said dick i suppose you have a very large account there sneered gilbert yes said dick quietly pretty large its to be hoped you wont withdraw your patronage or the bank might fail then i wont said dick shall i go to the postoffice now yes and be quick about it the bookkeeper had some curiosity as to the amount of dicks account at the savings bank but there was no good chance for him to inquire and he accordingly returned to his writing more prejudiced against dick than ever on the whole i have some doubts whether dicks manner was quite as respectful as it ought to have been to one who was older and higher in office than himself i should not recommend my young readers to imitate him in this respect but it is my business to describe dick just as he was and i have already said that he was not a model boy still in most respects he tried to do what was right and it must be admitted that the bookkeepers treatment of him was not likely to inspire much attachment or respect dick had no difficulty in perceiving the dislike entertained by gilbert for him and he was beginning to cherish a similar feeling towards the bookkeeper he determined however to give him no cause of complaint so far as he was entitled to command his services but it must be confessed he found much more satisfaction in obeying mr rockwell and mr murdock chapter viii new plans at the close of the afternoon as had been proposed mr murdock accompanied by dick rode up as far as fortyfifth street to look at the lots which he had suggested buying they were located in a very eligible situation between fifth and sixth avenues some of my young readers may not be aware that the dimensions of a city lot are twentyfive feet front by one hundred feet in depth the four lots together made a plot of one hundred feet by one hundred or a little less than quarter of an acre in the country the whole would scarcely have been considered sufficient for a house with a good yard in front but if people choose to live in the city they must make up their minds to be crowded it looks small dont it said dick i shouldnt think there was four lots there yes said mr murdock they are of the regular size some lots are only twenty feet wide these are twentyfive they dont look so large before they are built on well said dick im in for buying them i think it will be a good investment for both of us said mr murdock the money shall be ready whenever you want it said dick very well i will see the owner tomorrow or rather this evening as it is best to be prompt lest we might lose so favorable a bargain i will make the best terms i can with him and let you know the result tomorrow all right said dick goodnight mr murdock goodnight bytheby why wont you come round and take supper with us my wife and children will be glad to make your acquaintance thank you said dick i will come some other evening with pleasure but if i stay away without saying anything about it fosdick wont know whats become of me dick got back to bleecker street a little late for dinner when he entered the diningroom the remainder of the boarders were seated at the table come mr hunter you must render an account of yourself said miss peyton playfully why are you late this evening suppose i dont tell said dick then you must pay a fine mustnt he mrs browning that depends upon who is to benefit by the fines said the landlady if they are to be paid to me i shall be decidedly in favor of it that reminds me that you were late to breakfast this morning miss peyton oh ladies mustnt be expected to pay fines said miss peyton shaking her ringlets they never have any money you know then i think we must let mr hunter off said mrs browning if he will tell us what has detained him you must excuse my curiosity mr hunter but ladies you know are privileged to be curious i dont mind telling said dick helping himself to a piece of toast im talking of buying some lots uptown and went up with a friend to look at them fosdick looked at dick inquiringly not knowing if he were in earnest or not indeed said mr clifton may i inquire where the lots are situated ill tell you if i buy them said dick but i dont want to run the risk of losing them you neednt be afraid of my cutting you out said clifton i paid my washerwoman this morning and havent got but a dollar and a half over i suppose that wont buy the property i wish it would said dick in that case id buy half a dozen lots i suppose from your investing in lots mr hunter that you are thinking of getting married and living in a house of your own said miss peyton simpering no said dick i shant get married for a year nobody ought to be married before theyre seventeen thats just my age said miss peyton mr clifton afterwards informed dick that miss peyton was twentyfive but did not mention how he had ascertained he likewise added that when he first came to the boardinghouse she had tried her fascinations upon him shed have married me in a minute he said complacently but im too old a bird to be caught that way when you see mrs clifton gentlemen youll see style and beauty and money he added after a moments reflection mr clifton had a tolerably good opinion of himself as may be inferred from this remark in fact he valued himself rather more highly than the ladies appeared to do but such cases are not remarkable mrs clifton will be a lucky woman said dick with a sober face youre very kind to say so said mr clifton modestly i believe im tolerably goodlooking and nobodyll deny that ive got style but money thats my weak point you couldnt lend me five dollars could you till next week im afraid not said dick my uptown lots cost so much and then therell be the taxes afterwards oh its of no consequence i thought a little of going to the opera tonight and i need a new pair of gloves it costs a sight to keep a fellow in gloves so it does said dick i bought a pair for fifty cents six months ago and now ive got to buy another pair ha ha good joke by the way i wonder you fellows dont take a better room why should we isnt this good enough asked fosdick oh its comfortable and all that said clifton but you know what i mean you wouldnt want any of your fashionable friends to call upon you here thats a fact said dick suppose he said turning to fosdick with a twinkle in his eye johnny nolan should call upon us here what would he think of our living in such a room he would probably be surprised said fosdick entering into the joke is he one of your madisonavenue friends asked clifton a little mystified i dont know where he lives said dick with truth but hes a friend of mine in business down town wholesale or retail retail i should say shouldnt you fosdick yes said fosdick amused at cliftons evident mystification well goodevening gents said clifton sauntering out of the room call and see me when you havent anything better to do thank you goodnight were you in earnest dick about the uptown lots asked fosdick after clifton had left the room yes said dick its an investment that mr murdock advised ill tell you about it and then you can tell me what you think of it dick thereupon gave an account of the conversation that had taken place between him and the head clerk and what they proposed to do what do you think of it he concluded i have no doubt it is an excellent plan said fosdick but of course my opinion isnt worth much i dont see but you stand a chance to be a rich man some time dick by the time i get to be a hundred said dick a good while before that i presume but theres something else we must not forget what is that money is a good thing to have but a good education is better i was thinking today that since we have come here we havent done any studying to amount to anything that is true and the sooner we begin the better all right i agree to that but we shall need assistance ive taught you about all i know myself and now we want to go higher what shall we do ill tell you dick have you noticed the young man that has a room just opposite ours his name is layton isnt it yes what about him i heard yesterday that he was a teacher in a private school we might engage him to teach us in the evening or at any rate see if he is willing all right is he in now i wonder yes i heard him go into his room a few minutes since very well suppose we go in and speak to him the boys at once acted upon this suggestion and crossing the entry knocked at the door come in said a voice from within the door being opened they found themselves in the presence of a young man of pleasant appearance apparently about twentyfive years of age goodevening gentlemen he said i am glad to see you will you have seats thank you said fosdick we came in on a little business i understand you are a teacher mr layton yes i am engaged in a private school in the city my friend and myself are engaged in business during the day but we feel that our education is quite deficient and we want to make arrangements to study evenings we cannot do this to advantage without assistance are you occupied during the evenings no i am not perhaps you would not like teaching in the evening after being engaged in the daytime on the contrary i have been hoping to secure scholars but i hardly knew how to set about it are you acquainted with the french language mr layton yes i am tolerably familiar with it i studied it at college with a native teacher if you are a college graduate then you will be able to teach us whatever we desire to learn but i am afraid we may not be able to make it worth your while we have neither of us large salaries but if four dollars a week two dollars for each of us would be satisfactory i shall be satisfied with it said mr layton in fact he added frankly i shall consider it quite a welcome addition to my salary my father died a year since and my mother and sister are compelled to depend upon me in part for support but i have not been able to do as much for them as i wished this addition to my earnings will give me the means of increasing their comforts then it will be a pleasant arrangement all round said fosdick what would you advise us to study after a few inquiries as to their present attainments mr layton recommended a course of mathematics beginning with algebra history and the french language he gave the boys a list of the books they would be likely to need the next evening the boys commenced studying and determined to devote an hour and a half each evening to mental improvement they found mr layton an excellent teacher and he on his side found them very apt pupils dick had an active intelligent mind and an excellent capacity and fosdick had always had a thirst for learning which he was now able to gratify as his salary would have been insufficient to pay his expenses and the teacher besides he was obliged to have recourse to his little fund in the savings bank dick offered to assist him but fosdick would not consent just as his savings were about exhausted his wages were raised two dollars a week and this enabled him to continue the arrangement without assistance in the course of a few weeks the boys commenced reading french and found it quite interesting chapter ix roswell crawford at home while fosdick and dick are devoting their evenings to study under the guidance of mr layton we will direct the readers attention to a young gentleman who considered himself infinitely superior in the social scale to either roswell crawford could never forget that dick had once been a bootblack and looked upon it as an outrage that such a boy should be earning a salary of ten dollars a week while he a gentlemans son was only paid four which he regarded as a beggarly pittance roswells father had once kept a small dry goods store on broadway but failed after being in business a little less than a year this constituted his claim to gentility after his failure mr crawford tried several kinds of business without succeeding in any his habits were not strictly temperate and he had died two years previous his wife hired a house in clinton place and took boarders barely succeeding in making both ends meet at the end of the year the truth was that she was not a good manager and preferred to talk of her gentility and former wealth to looking after the affairs of the household she was very much like her son in this respect among mrs crawfords boarders was mr gilbert who is already known to the reader as the bookkeeper of rockwell cooper it has been mentioned also that he was roswells cousin being a son of mrs crawfords only brother he too was not unlike his aunt and cousin and all three combined to hate and despise dick whom mrs crawford saw fit to regard as her sons successful rival hows the bootblack cousin james asked roswell on the evening succeeding that which dick had passed at mr rockwells putting on airs worse than ever replied gilbert mr rockwell has a singular taste to say the least said mrs crawford or he wouldnt hire a boy from the streets and give him such extravagant wages to pay such a vagabond ten dollars a week when a boy of good family like roswell can get but four is perfectly ridiculous i dont believe he gets so much said roswell its only one of his big stories youre mistaken there said gilbert he does get exactly that are you sure of it i ought to be since i received directions from mr rockwell today to pay him that amount tomorrow night that being the end of the week i never heard of such a thing ejaculated mrs crawford the man must be a simpleton if he is theres another besides him who do you mean mrs rockwell has she made acquaintance with the bootblack then asked roswell with a sneer yes he visited them last evening at their house did he tell you so yes i should think theyd feel honored by such a visitor probably they did for mrs rockwell made him a present of a gold watch what exclaimed roswell and his mother in concert its true i sent him out to ask the time today when he pulled out a new gold watch with an air of importance and told me the time was it a good watch a very handsome one it must have cost with the chain a hundred and twentyfive dollars the idea of a bootblack with a gold watch exclaimed roswell with a sneer its about as appropriate as a pig in a silk dress i cant understand it at all said mrs crawford it cant be that hes a poor relation of theirs can it i should say not mr rockwell wouldnt be likely to have a relation reduced to blacking boots is the boy so attractive then what does he look like hes as bold as brass and hasnt got any manners nor education said roswell poor dick his ears ought to have tingled considering the complimentary things that were said of him this evening but luckily he knew nothing about it and if he had it is doubtful whether it would have troubled him much he was independent in his ideas and didnt trouble himself much about the opinion of others as long as he felt that he was doing right as nearly as he knew how do you think this strange fancy of mr rockwells is going to last inquired mrs crawford i wish roswell could have got in there so do i but i couldnt accomplish it if this boy should fall out of favor there might be a chance for roswell yet dont you think so asked mrs crawford i wish there might said roswell id like to see that beggars pride humbled besides four dollars a week is such a miserable salary you thought yourself lucky when you got it so i did but that was before i found out how much this bootblack was getting well said gilbert he isnt a favorite of mine as you know well enough if theres anything i can do to oust him i shall do it couldnt you leave some money in his way he might be tempted to steal it i dont know yet what course would be best ill try to get him into trouble of some kind but i can tell better by and by what to do gilbert went up to his room and mrs crawford and roswell were left alone i wish you were at rockwell coopers roswell said his mother so do i mother but its no use wishing i dont know about that your cousin ought to have some influence there the bootblacks in the way he may not be in the way always your cousin may detect him in something that will cause his discharge even if he does ive tried once to get in there and didnt succeed they didnt seem to take a fancy to me i shouldnt expect them to if they take a fancy to a common street boy but when they find him out they may change their opinion of you i dont know how that will be mother at any rate i think i ought to get more than four dollars a week where i am why theres talbot only two years older than i gets eight dollars and i do more than he to tell the truth i dont like the place i dont like to be seen carrying round bundles it isnt fit work for a gentlemans son roswell forgot that many of the most prosperous merchants in the city began in that way only on less wages one who wants to climb the ladder of success must except in very rare cases commence at the lowest round this was what roswell did not like he wanted to begin halfway up at the very least it was a great hindrance to him that he regarded himself as a gentlemans son and was puffed up with a corresponding sense of his own importance the more roswell thought of his illrequited services as he considered them the more he felt aggrieved it may be mentioned that he was employed in a dry goods store on sixth avenue and was chiefly engaged in carrying out bundles for customers a circumstance which occurred about this time deepened his disgust with the place about the middle of the next week he was carrying a heavy bundle to a house on madison avenue now it happened that mr rockwell who it will be remembered lived on the same street had left home that morning quite forgetting an important letter which he had received and which required an early answer he therefore summoned dick and said richard do you remember the location of my house yes sir said dick i find i have left an important letter at home i have written a line to my wife that she may know where to look for it i want you to go up at once very well sir dick took the note and walking to broadway jumped on board an omnibus and in a few minutes found himself opposite the fifth avenue hotel here he alighted and crossing the park entered madison avenue then as now lined with fine houses walking briskly up the avenue he overtook a boy of about his own size with a large bundle under his arm glancing at him as he passed he recognized roswell crawford how are you crawford said dick in an offhand manner roswell looked at the speaker whom he recognized im well said he in a stiff ungracious manner ashamed of the large bundle he was carrying he would rather have been seen by any boy than dick under present circumstances he did not fail to notice dicks neat dress and the gold chain displayed on his vest indeed there was nothing in dicks appearance which would have been inconsistent with the idea that he lived on the avenue and was what roswell claimed to be a gentlemans son it seemed to roswell that dick was immensely presumptuous in swaggering up madison avenue in such a style as he mentally called it and he formed the benevolent design of taking down his pride and making him feel uncomfortable if possible have you lost your place he inquired no said dick not yet its very kind of you to inquire i suppose they pay you for walking the streets then he said with a sneer yes said dick composedly thats one of the things they pay me for i suppose you like it better than blacking boots said roswell who supposing that dick was ashamed of his former occupation felt a malicious pleasure in reminding him of it yes said dick i like it better on the whole but then theres some advantages about bootblackin indeed said roswell superciliously as i was never in the business i cant of course decide then i was in business for myself you see and was my own master now i have to work for another man you dont seem to be working very hard now said roswell enviously not very said dick you must be tired carrying that heavy bundle ill carry it for you as far as i go roswell who was not above accepting a favor from a boy he didnt like willingly transferred it to our hero i carried it out just to oblige he said as if he were not in the daily habit of carrying such packages thats very kind of you said dick roswell did not know whether dick spoke sarcastically or not and therefore left the remark unnoticed i dont think i shall stay where i am very long he said dont you like asked dick not very well im not obliged to work for a living added roswell loftily but not altogether truly i am said dick ive had to work for a living ever since i was six years old i suppose you work because you like it im learning business im going to be a merchant as my father was ill have to give up the bundle now said dick this is as far as i am going roswell took back his bundle and dick went up the steps of mr rockwells residence and rang the doorbell chapter x a store on sixth avenue roswell kept on his way with his heavy bundle more discontented than ever the bundle seemed heavier than ever dick had no such bundles to carry he had an easier time his business position was better and his wages more than double and all this in spite of the glaring fact that roswell was a gentlemans son and dick wasnt surely fortune was very blind and unfair in the distribution of her favors i suppose hell be crowing over me thought roswell bitterly judging from what would have been his own feeling had the case been reversed i hope hell have to go back to bootblacking some day i wish motherd buy me a gold watch and chain thered be some sense in my wearing it roswell evidently thought it very inappropriate that dick should wear a handsome gold watch more especially as he was quite sure beforehand that his mother would not gratify his own desire to possess one still he resolved to ask there was another thing he meant to ask feeling that his services were worth more than the wages he received and convincing himself that his employers would be unwilling to lose him he determined to ask an advance of two dollars a week making six dollars in all not that he considered that even this would pay him but as he could hardly hope that he would be appreciated according to his deserts he limited his request to that sum he concluded to defer making his application until saturday evening when he would receive his weeks wages he consulted his mother upon this subject and she having nearly as high an opinion of her promising son as he had himself consented to the application if his cousin james gilbert had heard of his intention he was enough of a business man to have dissuaded him from the attempt though he saw fit to espouse the cause of roswell against dick it was more because he disliked the latter than because he was blind to the faults of the former indeed he had a very moderate opinion of his young cousins capabilities the days slipped by and saturday night came it was nine oclock before roswell was released the saturdaynight trade being the best of the week the other clerks had been paid roswells turn coming last because he was the youngest the designation of the firm was hall turner mr hall the senior partner usually went home early in the evening and mr turner the junior partner a man of about thirtyfive attended to the evening business and paid the weekly wages here crawford he said counting out four one dollar bills its your turn now i want to speak to you for a moment mr turner said roswell beginning to feel a little nervous for now that the time had come for making his request he felt a little uncertain how it would be received very well said his employer showing a little surprise be quick about it for i want to get through i want to know if you will not be willing to raise my wages said roswell rather awkwardly on what ground do you ask for it said mr turner looking up i thought i might be worth more said roswell how long have you been in my employment do you remember about four months said roswell do you think you have learned enough in that time to make you worth more yes sir said roswell with a little hesitation how much more would satisfy you two dollars more for the present said roswell beginning to feel a little hopeful that is six dollars a week yes sir and how soon would you expect another advance asked mr turner quietly in about six months you are quite moderate in your demands certainly there was something in mr turners tone which struck roswell as unfavorable and he hastily said in his own justification theres a friend of mine no older than i am who gets ten dollars a week certainly roswell must have spoken inadvertently or he would hardly have referred to dick as his friend but his main idea at present was to produce an impression upon the mind of mr turner is your friend in a dry goods store asked mr turner no sir then i dont see that his wages have any bearing upon your case there may be some special circumstances that affect his compensation how long has he been in the service of his present employer only a week or two is this his first place yes sir it may be that he is some relative of his employer that isnt very likely said roswell his lip curling he used to be a bootblack about the streets indeed said mr turner keenly i think you said he was a friend of yours no sir said roswell proudly i havent the honor you certainly said theres a friend of mine no older than i am who gets ten dollars a week i didnt mean to speak of him as my friend said roswell im a gentlemans son if you are his friendship might do you no harm if he receives the wages you state he must be a smart fellow if he didnt earn as much probably he would not receive it i dont believe hell keep his place long muttered roswell his wish being father to the thought if he doesnt you may be able to succeed him said mr turner i shall be compelled to refuse your request indeed so far from increasing your compensation i have been considering during the last week whether it would not be for my interest to get another boy in your place sir exclaimed roswell in dismay i will give you my reasons you appear to think yourself of too great consequence to discharge properly the duties of your position i dont understand you sir stammered roswell i believe you claim to be a gentlemans son yes sir said roswell my father used to keep a store on broadway and i am led to suppose you think it incompatible with your dignity to carry bundles to different parts of the city i would rather stand behind the counter and sell goods said roswell of course you will be a salesman in time if you stick to business faithfully but it so happens that we didnt hire you as a salesman but as a boy whose chief business it should be to carry bundles but we dont want to impose a disagreeable duty upon you therefore if you think upon reflection that you would prefer not to continue in your situation we will hire somebody else that wont be necessary sir said roswell considerably crestfallen you are content then to remain yes sir and upon four dollars a week yes sir i suppose i may hope to have my wages increased some time when we find your services worth more you shall receive more said mr turner that is fair isnt it yes sir then here is your money i didnt mean to talk so long but its as well to come to an understanding roswell left the store considerably crestfallen he found that instead of regarding him worth an advance of wages mr turner had had it in his mind to discharge him and that hurt his pride it was certainly very singular that people shouldnt be more impressed with the fact that he was a gentlemans son he could not have received less deference if he had been an exbootblack like dick himself he certainly was no more contented than before nor was his selfappreciation materially diminished if the world did not recognize his claims there was one comfort his mother appreciated him and he appreciated himself as to his cousin he did not feel quite so certain why are you so late roswell asked his mother looking up from her work as he entered it seems to me they kept you later than usual at the store even for saturday evening im sick of the store said roswell impatiently whats the matter i asked old turner tonight if he wouldnt raise my wages said roswell well what did he say he said he wouldnt do it did he give any reason he said i didnt earn any more hes a stingy old hunks any way and i wish i was in another place so do i but it isnt so easy to get a new position you had better stay in this till another offers i hate carrying bundles through the streets it isnt fit work for a gentlemans son ah if your poor father had lived things would have been very different with us all said mrs crawford with a sigh she chose to forget that previous to his death her late husbands habits had been such that he contributed very little to the comfort or support of the family i wouldnt care if i were a salesman continued roswell but i dont like being an errand boy id just as lives go to the postoffice for letters or to the bank with money but as for carrying big bundles of calico under my arm i dont like it i was walking on madison avenue the other day with a tenpound bundle when the bootblack came up dressed handsomely with a gold watch and chain and exulted over me for carrying such a big bundle there was a little exaggeration about this for dick was very far from exulting over roswell otherwise he certainly would not have volunteered to carry the bundle himself but it often happens that older persons than roswell are not above a little misrepresentation now and then hes an impudent fellow then said mrs crawford indignantly then mr hall wont raise your wages it wasnt mr hall i asked it was mr turner said roswell didnt he hold out any hopes of raising your wages hereafter he said he would raise them when i deserve it he dont amount to much hes no gentleman said roswell scornfully whos no gentleman inquired james gilbert who chanced just then to enter the room mr turner whos mr turner my employer hall turner you know whats amiss with him i asked him to raise my wages tonight and he wouldnt umph how much did you ask for two dollars more a week youre a fool what said roswell astonished what exclaimed mrs crawford angrily i say the lads a fool to ask for so large an advance so soon of course his employers refused it i would in their place youre very hard upon the poor boy said mrs crawford i thought you were his friend so i am but hes acted foolishly for all that he should have known better i ought to be worth six dollars if your bootblack is worth ten responded roswell he isnt worth ten why do you pay him that then its mr rockwell who pays him not i why he does it i cant say it isnt because he earns it no boy of his age or yours either can earn ten dollars a week at any rate he gets ten and i get only four i certainly earn more than that said roswell i am not so sure about that said his cousin but if it will afford you any comfort ill venture to make the prediction that he wont remain in rockwell coopers employment a week longer has anything happened asked roswell eagerly not yet said james gilbert significantly then something is going to happen you need not trouble yourself to ask questions wait patiently and when anything happens ill let you know here james gilbert left the room and went up to his own chamber his words had excited hope in both roswell and his mother the former felt that it would be a satisfaction to him to learn that dick had lost his situation even if he failed to get it himself chapter xi a new alliance the name of micky maguire is already familiar to the readers of ragged dick he had acquired a prominent position among the downtown bootblacks by his strength which he used oftentimes to impose upon boys weaker than himself he was a young ruffian indeed with few redeeming qualities when dick was in the same business he tried on two or three occasions to make him acknowledge his superiority but it was not in dicks nature to be subservient to any one whom he did not respect moreover dick had two good stout arms of his own and knew how to use them in selfdefence the consequence was that micky maguire signally failed in the attempts which he made on different occasions to humble our hero and was obliged to slink off in discomfiture with his satellite limpy jim the last glimpse we had of micky was in dicks castoff clothes of which by some means probably not honest he had become possessed he did not wear them long however the famous washington coat and napoleon pants were only mortal and being already of venerable antiquity became at length too fragmentary even for mickys not very fastidious taste one morning accordingly having levied an unwilling contribution from a weaker but more industrious bootblack micky went to baxter street and invested it in a blue coat with brass buttons which by some strange chain of circumstances had found its way thither from some country town where it may at one time have figured at trainings and on townmeeting days a pair of overalls completed mickys costume he dispensed with a vest his money not having been sufficient to buy that also certainly micky presented a noticeable figure as he stood in the city hall park clad in the abovementioned garments he was rather proud of the brass buttons and may even have fancied in his uncultivated taste that his new costume became him while he was swaggering about he espied part of a cigar which some one had thrown aside micky who was fond of smoking picked it up and looked about him for a light not being provided with a match a young man was slowly crossing the park with a cigar in his mouth but he was evidently plunged in thought and hardly conscious of the scene about him micky observed this and a cunning scheme suggested itself he walked up to the young man and said cavalierly give us a light mister will yer the young man mechanically took the cigar from his mouth and passed it to the questioner without observing who he was had he done so it is doubtful whether the request would have been complied with rapidly calculating that he would not notice the substitution micky after lighting the stub handed it to the young man retaining the good cigar himself and placing it straightway in his mouth this trick would probably have passed off undetected if it had not been observed by some of mickys fellowprofessionals a jeering laugh from these called the young mans attention to the substitution and with a look of indignation he said you young rascal you shall pay for this illustration but micky evaded his grasp and scudded rapidly through the park pursued by the victim of misplaced confidence run micky ill bet on you cried pat nevins encouragingly go it long legs said another who backed the opposite party give him a good lickin when you catch him maybe youd have to wait too long for that said pat leave yer cigar wid us mister said another boy james gilbert for he was the young man in question began to find that he was becoming rather ridiculous and felt that he would rather let micky go free than furnish a spectacle to the crowd of bootblacks who were surveying the chase with eager interest he accordingly stopped short and throwing down the stub prepared to leave the park dont give it up mister youll catch him said his first backer micky cant run far ragged dick give him a stretcher once ragged dick said gilbert turning abruptly at the sound of this name maybe you know him does he black boots he used to but he dont now what does he do oh hes a swell now and wears good clothes how is that hes in a store and gets good pay whats the name of the boy that ran away with my cigar micky maguire was he a friend of ragged dick as you call him not much they had two or three fights which beat dick he can fight bully gilbert felt disappointed he was in hopes our hero had met with a defeat somehow he seemed born for success then i suppose maguire hates him ill bet he does humph thought gilbert i may turn his enmity to some account let me consider a little at length a plan suggested itself and his countenance cleared up and assumed an expression of satisfaction on reaching home he held the conversation with roswell and his mother which has been recorded at the close of the last chapter meantime micky went home to a miserable lodging on worth street in the precincts of the five points and very near where the five points house of industry now stands this admirable institution has had a salutary influence and contributed greatly to the improvement of the neighborhood then however it was about as vile and filthy as could well be micky exulted not a little at the success of his cunning and smoked the cigar an expensive one by the way with not a little satisfaction he recounted the story to a group of admiring friends who had not been fortunate enough to witness it its you thats got the cheek micky said teddy donovan you did it neat said another maybe ill try that same some day youd better not the copp might get hold of you was it a good cigar micky wasnt it just i wish id got another stand treat teddy i would if i had the stamps im savin up my money to go to the old bowery tonight the boys were standing in a little group and in the interest of their discussion did not observe the approach of james gilbert who was now visiting the park with a special object in view with an expression of satisfaction he recognized the boy who had served him a trick the day before indeed it was not easy to mistake micky the blue coat with brass buttons and the faded overalls would have betrayed him even if his superior height had not distinguished him from his comrades had micky been aware of gilberts approach he would have thought it prudent to change his base but his back being turned he was taken by surprise his attention was drawn by a tap on the shoulder and looking round he recognized his enemy as he regarded him he started to run but was withheld by a strong grasp leave me alone will yer he said ducking his head as if he expected a blow i believe you are fond of smoking said gilbert continuing to hold him tight micky maintained silence and sometimes exchange a poor cigar for a good one continued his captor it was a mistake said micky what did you run for then what you going to do about it mister asked one boy curiously so it was a mistake was it said gilbert yes sir said micky glibly take care you dont make the mistake again then now you may black my boots not only the boys who were standing by but micky himself were considerably surprised at this unexpected turn they confidently expected that micky would get a lickin and instead of that he had found a customer their respect for gilbert was considerably diminished for failing to exact punishment and their interest in the affair being over they withdrew micky laid down his box and commenced operations how long have you been a bootblack asked gilbert five years goin on six said micky can you earn much no said micky business aint very good now you manage to dress well said gilbert with an amused look at mickys habiliments yes said micky with a glance at the brass buttons but i had to borrer the money to buy my cloes there used to be a boy around here that was called dick did you know him there be a good many dicks which did you mean this boy was nearly your size i believe they called him ragged dick i knowd him said micky shortly with a scowl was he a friend of yours no he wasnt i give him a lickin once the fact happened to be the other way but micky was not very scrupulous as to the strict truth of his statements you dont like him then where is he now hes in a store and swells round with good clothes have you seen him lately no an i dont want to he wears a gold watch now i suppose he wouldnt have anything to say to you maybe not said mickey it would be a good joke if he should lose his place and have to go back to bootblacking again i wish he would said micky fervently it ould cure him of puttin on airs if for example his employer should be convinced that he was a thief he would discharge him do you know him mister asked micky looking up suddenly yes is he a friend of yours i like him about as well as you do said gilbert done said micky releasing the second foot suppose you brush the other boot again ill pay you double i want to talk to you a little all right said micky and he resumed operations the conversation that followed we do not propose to chronicle the results will appear hereafter enough that gilbert and micky departed mutually satisfied the latter the richer by five times his usual fee chapter xii dick falls into a trap one evening when dick and fosdick returned from their respective stores a surprise awaited them the postman left some letters for you said the servant as she opened the door to admit them maybe theyre from the taxcollectors said dick thats the misfortun of being men of property what was your tax last year fosdick i dont remember such trifles said fosdick i dont think they was taxes said the girl seriously they looked as if they was from a young lady very likely they are from fosdicks wife said dick shes rusticatin in the country for the benefit of her health maybe theyre from yours mr hunter said the girl laughing no said dick gravely im a disconsolate widower which accounts for my low spirits most of the time and my poor appetite where are the letters i left them on the bureau in your room said the servant they come this afternoon at three oclock both fosdick and dick felt not a little curious as to who could have written them letters and hastened upstairs entering their chamber they saw two very neat little notes in perfumed french envelopes and with the initial g in colors on the back on opening them they read the following in a neat feminine fine handwriting as both were alike it will be sufficient to give dicks miss ida greyson presents her compliments to mr richard hunter and solicits the pleasure of his company on thursday evening next at a little birthday party no west twentyfourth street were getting fashionable said dick i didnt use to attend many parties when we lived in mott street and blacked boots for a livin im afraid i shant know how to behave i shall feel a little bashful said fosdick but i suppose weve got to begin some time of course said dick the important position we hold in society makes it necessary howll i be able to hold levees when im mayor if i dont go into society now very true said fosdick i dont expect to occupy any such position but we ought to go in acknowledgment of mr greysons kindness mr greyson was the teacher of the sundayschool class of which both dick and fosdick were members his recommendation had procured fosdick his present place and he had manifested his kindness in various ways those who have read ragged dick will remember that he had a very sprightly and engaging daughter of ten years of age who seemed to have taken an especial fancy to dick being wealthy his kindness had been of great service to both boys inspiring them with selfrespect and encouraging them to persevere in their efforts to raise themselves to a higher position the dinnerbell rang just as the boys had finished their discussion and they went down and took places at the table soon miss peyton came sailing in shaking her ringlets coquettishly she was proud of these ringlets and was never tired of trying their fascinations upon gentlemen but somehow they had not succeeded in winning a husband goodevening mr hunter said she you look as if you had had good news do i said dick perhaps you can tell what it is i know how it came said miss peyton significantly then i hope you wont keep me in suspense any longer than you can help perhaps youd rather i wouldnt mention before company never mind said dick dont have any regard to my feelins theyre tough and can stand a good deal how do you like the letter g asked miss peyton slyly very much said dick as long as it behaves itself what is your favorite letter dont think im going to tell you mr hunter that was a pretty little note and in a young ladys hand too yes said dick perhaps youd like to see it you wouldnt show it to me on any account i know you may see it if you like said dick may i really i should like to very much but would the young lady like it i dont think shed mind shes written one to my friend fosdick just like it dick passed the invitation across the table its very pretty indeed said miss peyton and is miss ida greyson very handsome im no judge of beauty said dick so she lives in west twentyfourth street is her father rich i dont know how rich said dick but my impression is that his taxes last year were more than mine i know now what your favorite letters are said miss peyton they are i g i g are very well as long as you dont put p before them said dick thank you for another cup of tea mrs browning i should think youd need some tea after such a brilliant effort hunter said mr clifton from across the table yes said dick i find my brain gets exhausted every now and then by my intellectual efforts aint you troubled that way cant say i am dont you want to go out and try a game of billiards this evening no thank you ive got to study i expect to see you a college professor some of these days i havent made up my mind yet said dick im open to an offer as the oyster remarked when he was placed on the table if i can serve my fellowmen best by bein a college professor and gettin a big salary im willin to sacrifice my private feelins for the public good do you agree with your friend mr fosdick said miss peyton wont you favor us with your views i have none worth mentioning said fosdick i leave my friend to do the talking while i attend to the eating mr hunters remarks are very entertaining said miss peyton thank you said dick but my friend prefers a different kind of entertainment the boys rose from the table and went up to their room to look over the evenings lessons they were quite pleased with their new teacher whom they found not only competent for his task but interested in promoting their progress he was able to help them readily out of their difficulties and encouraged them to persevere so they came to look forward to their evening lessons not as tasks but as pleasant exercises its strange said dick one evening after the teacher had left them i used to enjoy goin to the old bowery so much i went two or three times a week sometimes now i would a good deal rather stay at home and study then you didnt have a home and the lighted theatre must have been much pleasanter than the cold and cheerless streets yes that was it i used to get so tired sometimes of having no home to go to and nobody to speak to that i cared about youd hardly like to go back to the old life dick no it would come pretty hard to me now i didnt seem to mind it so much then because you had never known anything better no it was a lucky day when i met you fosdick id never have had the patience to learn readin or tryin to read always gave me the headache you always leave off the last letter in such words as reading dick you should be more careful now that you associate with educated persons i know it fosdick but im so used to droppin i mean dropping the g that it comes natural i will try to remember it but about this party shall we have to get new clothes no we have each a nice suit and we shant be expected to dress in the height of the fashion i wish it was over i dread it so do i a little but i think we shall enjoy it ida is a nice girl thats so if i had a sister id like her to be like ida perhaps shed like a brother like you i notice she seems to fancy your company i hope youre not jealous fosdick you can be a brother to miss peyton you know fosdick laughed theres no chance for me there either he said she evidently prefers you ill adopt her for my aunt if itll be gratifying to her feelings said dick but i aint partial to ringlets as a general thing it is well perhaps that miss peyton did not hear these remarks as she cherished the idea that both fosdick and dick were particularly pleased with her a day or two afterwards dick was walking leisurely through chatham street about half past one oclock he was allowed an hour about noon to go out and get some lunch and he was now on his way from the restaurant which he usually frequented as it was yet early he paused before a window to look at something which attracted his attention while standing here he became conscious of a commotion in his immediate neighborhood then he felt a hand thrust into the sidepocket of his coat and instantly withdrawn looking up he saw micky maguire dodging round the corner he put his hand into his pocket mechanically and drew out a pocketbook just then a stout redfaced man came up puffing and evidently in no little excitement seize that boy he gasped pointing to dick hes got my pocketbook contrary to the usual rule in such cases a policeman did happen to be about and following directions stepped up and laid his hand on dicks shoulder you must go with me my fine fellow he said hand over that pocketbook if you please whats all this about said dick heres the pocketbook if it is yours im sure i dont want it youre a cool hand said the guardian of the public peace if you dont want it what made you steal it from this gentlemans pocket i didnt take it said dick shortly is this the boy that stole your pocketbook demanded the policeman of the redfaced man who had now recovered his breath its the very young rascal does he pretend to deny it of course he does they always do when it was found on him too i never knew such barefaced impudence stop a minute said dick while i explain i was standing looking in at that window when i felt something thrust into my pocket i took it out and found it to be that pocketbook just then that gentleman came up and charged me with the theft thats a likely story said the officer if any one put the pocketbook into your pocket it shows you were a confederate of his youll have to come with me and poor dick for the first time in his life was marched to the stationhouse followed by his accuser and a gang of boys among these last but managing to keep at a respectful distance was micky maguire chapter xiii dick in the stationhouse poor dick if trinity church spire had suddenly fallen to the ground it could scarcely have surprised and startled him more than his own arrest for theft during the hard apprenticeship which he had served as a street boy he had not been without his share of faults and errors but he had never even under the severest pressure taken what did not belong to him of religious and moral instruction he had then received none but something told him that it was mean to steal and he was true to this instinctive feeling yet if he had been arrested a year before it would have brought him less shame and humiliation than now now he was beginning to enjoy the feeling of respectability which he had compassed by his own earnest efforts he felt he was regarded with favor by those whose good opinion was worth having and his heart swelled within him as he thought that they might be led to believe him guilty he had never felt so downhearted as when he walked in company with the policeman to the stationhouse to be locked up for examination the next morning you wasnt sharp enough this time young fellow said the policeman do you think i stole the pocketbook asked dick looking up in the officers face oh no of course not you wouldnt do anything of that kind said the policeman ironically no i wouldnt said dick emphatically ive been poor enough and hungry enough sometimes but i never stole its mean what is your name said the officer i think i have seen you before i used to black boots then my name was ragged dick i know you your name is jones ragged dick yes yes i remember you used to be pretty well out at elbows if i remember rightly my clothes used to be pretty well ventilated said dick smiling faintly that was what made me so healthy i expect but did you ever know me to steal no said the officer i cant say i have i lived about the streets for more then eight years said dick and this is the first time i was ever arrested what do you do now im in a store on pearl street what wages do you get ten dollars a week do you expect me to believe that story its true i dont believe theres a boy of your age in the city that gets such wages you cant earn that amount i jumped into the water and saved the life of mr rockwells little boy thats why he pays me so much where did you get that watch and chain are they gold yes mrs rockwell gave them to me it seems to me youre in luck i wasnt very lucky to fall in with you said dick dont you see what a fool i should be to begin to pick pockets now when i am so well off thats true said the officer who began to be shaken in his previous conviction of dicks guilt if id been going into that business i would have tried it when i was poor and ragged i should not have waited till now if you didnt take the pocketbook then how came it in your pocket i was looking in at a shop window when i felt it thrust into my pocket i suppose it was the thief who did it to get out of the scrape himself that might be at any rate ive known of such cases if so you are unlucky and i am sorry for you i cant let you go because appearances are against you but if there is anything i can do to help you i will thank you mr jones said dick gratefully i did not want you to think me guilty where is the man that lost the pocketbook just behind us i should like to speak to him a moment the redfaced man who was a little behind came up and dick asked quietly what makes you think i took your pocketbook sir wasnt it found in your pocket you young rascal said the other irritably yes said dick and isnt that enough not if somebody else put it there said dick thats a likely story its a true story can you identify this as the boy who robbed you and whom you saw running no said the redfaced man rather unwillingly my eyesight is not very good but ive no doubt this is the young rascal well that must be decided you must appear tomorrow morning to prefer your complaint mind you dont let the rascal escape said the other i shall carry him to the stationhouse where he will be safe thats right ill make an example of him he wont pick my pocket again in a hurry i hope the judge wont be so sure that i am guilty said dick if he is itll go hard with me why dont you call your employer to testify to your good character thats a good idea can i write a note to him and to another friend yes but perhaps the mail wouldnt carry them in time i will send a messenger can i do so when we get to the stationhouse i will see that you have a chance to send here we are escorted by the officer and followed by his accuser dick entered there was a railing at the upper end of the room and behind it a desk at which sat a captain of the squad the officer made his report which though fair and impartial still was sufficient to cause our heros commitment for trial what is your name questioned the captain dick thought it best to be straightforward and though he winced at the idea of his name appearing in the daily papers answered in a manly tone richard hunter of what nation american where were you born in this city what is your age sixteen years these answers were recorded and as dick expressed a desire to communicate with his friends before trial permission was given him to write to them and the trial was appointed for the next morning at the tombs the redfaced man certified that his wallet contained nine dollars and sixtytwo cents which was found to be correct he agreed to be present the next morning to prefer his charge and with such manifest pleasure that he was not retained as it sometimes happens to insure his appearance i will find a messenger to carry your notes said the friendly officer thank you said dick i will take care that you are paid for your trouble i require no pay except what i have to pay the messenger dick was escorted to a cell for safekeeping he quickly dashed off a letter to mr murdock fearing that mr rockwell might not be in the store it was as follows mr murdock what will you think when i tell you that i have been unlucky enough to be arrested on suspicion of picking a mans pocket the real thief slipped the wallet into my pocket as i was looking into a shop window and it was found on me i couldnt prove my innocence so here i am at the stationhouse they will think strange at the store because i am absent will you tell mr rockwell privately what has detained me but dont tell mr gilbert he dont like me any too well and would believe me guilty at once or pretend he did i am sure you wont believe i would do such a thing or mr rockwell either will you come and see me tonight i am to be tried tomorrow morning i aint very proud of the hotel where i am stopping but they didnt give me much choice in the matter richard hunter stationhouse franklin street the other letter was to fosdick here it is dear fosdick i didnt much think when i left you this morning that i should be writing to you from the stationhouse before night ill tell you how it happened here follows a detailed account which is omitted as the reader is already acquainted with all the circumstances of course they will wonder at the boardinghouse where i am if miss peyton or mr clifton inquires after me tonight you can say that i am detained by business of importance thats true enough i wish it wasnt as soon as dinner is over i wish youd come and see me i dont know if you can not being acquainted with the rules of this hotel i shant stop here again very soon if i can help it theres a woman in the next cell who was arrested for fighting she is swearing frightfully it almost makes me sick to be in such a place its pretty hard to have this happen to me just when i was getting along so well but i hope itll all come out right your true friend dick ps ive given my watch and chain to the officer to keep for me gold watches aint fashionable here and i didnt want them to think me putting on airs stationhouse franklin street after dick had written these letters he was left to himself his reflections as may readily be supposed were not the most pleasant what would they think at the boardinghouse if they should find what kind of business it was that had detained him even if he was acquitted some might suppose that he was really guilty but there was a worse contingency he might be unable to prove his innocence and might be found guilty in that case he would be sent to the island dick shuddered at the thought just when he began to feel himself respectable it was certainly bad to meet with such hard luck what too would mr greyson and ida think he had been so constant at the sunday school that his absence would be sure to be noticed and he knew that his former mode of life would make his guilt more readily believed in the present instance if ida should think me a pickpocket thought poor dick and the thought made him miserable enough the fact was that ida by her vivacity and lively manners and her evident partiality for his society had quite won upon dick who considered her by all odds the nicest girl he had ever seen i dont mean to say that dick was in love at least not yet both he and ida were too young for that but he was certainly quite an admirer of the young lady again if he were convicted he would have to give up the party to which he had been invited and he could never hope to get another invitation all these reflections helped to increase dicks unhappiness i doubt if he had ever felt so unhappy in all his life but it never once occurred to him that his arrest was brought about by the machinations of his enemies he hadnt chanced to see micky maguire and had no suspicion that it was he who dropped the wallet into his pocket still less did he suspect that gilberts hostility had led him so far as to conspire with such a boy as micky against him it was lucky that he did not know this or he would have felt still more unhappy but it is now time to turn to micky maguire and mr gilbert whose joint scheme had met with so much success chapter xiv micky maguires disappointment micky maguire waited until dick was actually on the way to the stationhouse and then started for pearl street to acquaint gilbert with the success of his machinations his breast swelled with triumph at the advantage he had gained over his enemy may be hell keep his cheerin reflections to himself another time thought micky he wont have much to say about my going to the island when hes been there himself they wont stand none of his airs there im thinkin there was another pleasant aspect to the affair micky had not only triumphed over his enemy but he was going to be paid for it this was the stipulation between gilbert and himself the bookkeeper had not promised any definite sum but micky in speculating upon the proper compensation for his service fixed upon five dollars as about what he ought to receive like many others who count their chickens before they are hatched he had already begun to consider what he would buy with it when he had got it now only the day previous micky had noticed hanging in a window in chatham street a silver watch and chain attached which was labelled genuine silver only five dollars since micky had been the possessor of a blue coat with brass buttons his thoughts had dwelt more than ever before on his personal appearance and the watch had struck his fancy he did not reflect much on the probable quality of a silver watch which could be sold for five dollars and a chain thrown into the bargain it was a watch at any rate and would make a show besides dick wore a watch and micky felt that he did not wish to be outdone as soon as he received his reward he meant to go and buy it it was therefore in a very cheerful frame of mind that micky walked up in front of rockwell coopers store and took his stand occasionally glancing at the window ten minutes passed away and still he remained unnoticed he grew impatient and determined to enter making his business an excuse entering he saw through the open door of the office the bookkeeper bending over the desk writing shine yer boots he asked gilbert was about to answer angrily in the negative when looking up he recognized his young confederate his manner changed and he said yes i believe ill have a shine but you must be quick about it micky swung his box from his shoulder and sinking upon his knees seized his brush and went to work scientifically any news asked gilbert in a low voice yes mister ive done it said micky have you managed to trap him yes i left him on his way to the stationhouse how did you manage it i grabbed an old fellows wallet and dropped it into dicks pocket he pulled it out and while he was lookin at it up came the copp and nabbed him how about the man from whom the wallet was taken he came up puffin and swore dick was the chap that stole it so he was carried off to the stationhouse yes hes there safe enough then we shall have to carry on business without him said gilbert coolly i hope he will enjoy himself at his new quarters maybe theyll send him to the island said micky beginning his professional operations upon the second boot very likely said gilbert i suppose youve been there before this wot if i have said micky in rather a surly tone for he did not relish the allusion no offence said gilbert i only meant that if you have ever been there you can judge whether your friend dick will enjoy it not a great deal said micky but you neednt call him my friend i hate him your enemy then but get through as soon as possible micky struck his brush upon the floor to indicate that the job was finished and rising waited for his fee gilbert took from his pocket ten cents and handed him thats for the shine he said and heres something for the other matter so saying he placed in the hand of the bootblack a banknote micky glanced at it and his countenance changed ominously when he perceived the denomination it was a onedollar bill its one dollar he said isnt that enough no it isnt he answered sullenly i might ave been nabbed myself i cant afford to work on no such terms micky was right it certainly was a very small sum to receive for taking such a risk apart from all moral considerations and his dissatisfaction can hardly be wondered at but gilbert was not of a generous nature in fact he was disposed to be mean and in the present instance he had even expected to get the credit of being generous a dollar he thought must seem an immense sum to a ragged bootblack but micky thought differently and gilbert felt irritated at his ingratitude its all youll get said he roughly then youd better get somebody else to do your dirty work next time mister said micky angrily clear out you young blackguard exclaimed gilbert his temper by this time fully aroused clear out if you dont want to be kicked out maybe youll wish youd given me more said micky sullenly picking up his box and leaving the office whats the matter asked mr murdock who happened to come up just as micky went into the street and heard the last words of the altercation oh said gilbert carelessly he wasnt satisfied with his pay i gave him ten cents but the young rascal wanted more as he said this he turned back to his desk i wonder whether gilberts going anywhere thought the head clerk i never knew him so extravagant before he must be going out this evening just then it occurred to him that dick had been absent longer than usual and as he needed his services he asked has richard returned mr gilbert i havent seen him did he go out at the usual time yes what can have detained him said mr murdock thoughtfully hes probably fallen in with some of his old friends and forgotten all about his duties that is not his way said mr murdock quietly as he walked away he understood very well mr gilberts hostility to dick and that the latter was not likely to receive a very favorable judgment at his hands five minutes later a boy entered the store and looking about him a moment in uncertainty said i want to see mr murdock i am mr murdock he answered then this note is for you the clerk felt instinctively that the note was from dick and not wishing gilbert to hear the conversation motioned the boy to follow him to the back part of the store then he opened and read the note quickly did richard hunter give this to you he asked no said tim ryan for that was his name it was the copp that arrested him i suppose a copp is a policeman yes sir were you present when he was arrested yes sir do you know anything about it yes i seed it all you saw the wallet taken yes sir did richard take it you mean dick said tim interrogatively for richard was to him a strange name no he didnt then he wouldnt steal i never knowd him to then you know dick yes sir ive knowed him ever since i was so high indicating a point about three feet above the floor then who did take it if not he micky maguire who is he he blacks boots then how did it happen that he was not arrested micky was smart enough to drop the wallet into dicks pocket as he was standin before a shop winder then he got out of the way and dick was nabbed by the copp is this micky of whom you speak a friend of yours no he likes to bully small boys then why didnt you tell the officer he had arrested the wrong boy i wanted to said tim for dicks always been kind to me but i was afraid micky would give me a beatin when he got free then there was another reason what was that its mean to tell of a fellow isnt it meaner to let an innocent boy get punished when you might save him by telling maybe it is said tim perplexed my lad continued mr murdock you say dick has been kind to you you now have an opportunity to repay all he has ever done by clearing him from this false charge which you can easily do ill do it said tim stoutly i dont care if micky does lick me for it by the way said mr murdock with a sudden thought what is the appearance of this micky maguire hes rather stout and has freckles does he wear a blue coat with large brass buttons yes said tim in surprise do you know him i have seen him this morning said mr murdock wait a minute and i will give you a line to dick or rather it will not be necessary if you can get a chance let him know that i am going to call on him this afternoon will you be at the stationhouse or near it at six oclock yes sir then we can arrange about your appearing as a witness at the trial here is half a dollar for your trouble in bringing the note i dont want it sir said tim i dont want to take anything for doing a good turn to dick but you have been prevented from earning money you had better take it but tim who was a warmhearted irish boy steadfastly refused and left the store in quest of hendersons hat and cap store having also a note to deliver to fosdick so that was micky maguire who was here a little while since said mr murdock to himself it seems singular that immediately after getting richard into trouble he should have come here where he was employed can it be that gilbert had a previous acquaintance with him the more mr murdock reflected the more perplexed he became it did cross his mind that the two might be in league against dick but then on the other hand they evidently parted on bad terms and this seemed to make such a combination improbable so he gave up puzzling himself about it reflecting that time would clear up what seemed mysterious about the affair gilbert on his part could not help wondering on what errand tim ryan came to mr murdock he suspected he might be a messenger from dick but thought it best not to inquire and mr murdock did not volunteer any information when the store closed the head clerk bent his steps towards the stationhouse chapter xv the franklin street stationhouse the stationhouse to which dick had been conveyed is situated in that part of franklin street which lies between centre and baxter streets the last is one of the most wretched streets in the city lined with miserable tenement houses policy shops and secondhand clothing stores whoever passes through it in the evening will do well to look to the safety of his pocketbook and watch if he is imprudent enough to carry either in a district where the ten commandments are unknown or unregarded the stationhouse is an exception to the prevailing squalidness being kept with great neatness mr murdock ascended the steps and found himself in a large room one side of which was fenced off by a railing behind this was a desk at which sat the officer in charge to him mr murdock directed himself have you a boy named richard hunter in the house yes said the sergeant referring to his minutes he was brought in this afternoon charged with picking a gentlemans pocket there is some mistake about this he is as honest as i am i have nothing to do with that he will have a fair trial tomorrow morning all i have to do is to keep him in safe custody till then of course where is he in a cell below can i see him if you wish the officer summoned an attendant and briefly ordered him to conduct mr murdock to dicks cell this way sir said the attendant mr murdock followed him through a large rear room which is intended for the accommodation of the officers then descending some steps into the courtyard he descended thence into the apartments in the basement here are the cells for the temporary detention of offenders who are not at once sent to the tombs for trial the passages are whitewashed and the cells look very neat they are on either side with a grating so that one passing along can look into them readily they are probably about seven feet long by four or five in width a narrow raised bedstead covered with a pallet occupies one side on which the prisoner can either lie or sit as he pleases how are you boss asked a negro woman who had been arrested for drunkenness swaying forward as mr murdock passed and nearly losing her balance as she did so cant you give me a few cents to buy some supper turning from this revolting spectacle mr murdock followed his guide to the second cell beyond where our hero was confined is it you mr murdock exclaimed our hero joyfully jumping to his feet i am glad to see you and i am glad to see you but i wish it were somewhere else said mr murdock so do i said dick i aint partial to this hotel though the accommodations is gratooitous and the company is very select i see you will have your joke dick even in such a place i dont feel so jolly as i might said dick i never was in the stationhouse before but i shall be lucky if i dont get sent to a worse place have you any idea who took the wallet which was found in your pocket no said dick do you know a boy called micky maguire proceeded mr murdock yes said dick looking up in surprise micky used to be a great friend of mine hed be delighted if he only knew that i was enjoyin the hospitality of the government he does know it said mr murdock quietly how do you know asked dick quickly because it was he that stole the wallet and put it in your pocket how did you find out asked dick eagerly do you know a boy named tim ryan yes hes a good boy it was he that brought me your note he saw the whole proceeding why didnt he tell and stop my bein arrested then i asked him that but he said he was afraid micky would beat him when he found out but he is a friend of yours and he stands ready to testify what he knows at your trial tomorrow morning thats lucky said dick breathing a sigh of relief so it was micky that served me the trick he always loved me like a brother micky did but i didnt expect hed steal for my benefit im very much obliged to him but id rather dispense with such little favors another time you will be surprised to learn that micky came round to our store this afternoon what for questioned dick in amazement i dont know whether he came by accident or design but mr gilbert employed him to black his boots mr gilbert yes they seemed to be conversing earnestly but i was too far off to hear what was said finally gilbert appeared to get angry and drove the boy out thats strange said dick thoughtfully mr gilbert loves me about as much as micky does yes there seems to be some mystery about it we may find out some time what it is but here is your friend fosdick how are you fosdick hailed dick from his cell im holdin a little levee down here did you receive my card of invitation ive been uneasy all the afternoon dick said fosdick ever since i heard that you were here ive been longing to come and see you then you aint ashamed of me even if i am in the stationhouse of course i know you dont deserve to be here tell me all about it i only got a chance to speak a minute with tim ryan for there were customers waiting ill tell you all i know myself said dick im sorry to keep you standing but the door is locked and ive accidentally lost the key so i cant invite you into my parlor as the spider invited the fly dont stand on ceremony dick id just as lieves stay outside so would i said dick rather ruefully the story was told over again with such new light as mr murdock had been able to throw upon it its just like micky said fosdick hes a bad fellow it was rather a mean trick said dick but he hasnt had a very good bringin up or maybe hed be a better boy that he should have spoken thus at the moment when he was suffering from mickys malice showed a generosity of feeling which was characteristic of dick no one was more frank open or free from malice than he though always ready to stand up for his rights when he considered them assailed it is this quality in dick joined to his manly spirit which makes him a favorite with me as he is also with you let me hope young reader itll come out right dick said fosdick cheerfully tim ryans testimony will clear you i feel a good deal better about it now than i did this afternoon when i didnt know how things were likely to go with you i hope so said dick but im afraid you wont get any supper if you stay any longer with me how about your supper dick asked fosdick with sudden thought do they give you any in this establishment no said dick this hotels on the european system with improvements you get your lodgin for nothing and nothing to eat along with it i dont like the system much i dont think i could stand it moren a week without its hurtin my constitution ill go out and get you something dick said fosdick if the rules of the establishment allow it shall i well said dick i think i might eat a little though the place isnt very stimulatin to the appetite what shall i bring you i aint particular said dick just then the attendant came along and fosdick inquired if he would be allowed to bring his friend something to eat certainly was the reply we provide nothing ourselves as the prisoners only stay with us a few hours ill be right back said fosdick not far from the stationhouse fosdick found a bakers shop where he bought some bread and cakes with which he started to return as he was nearing the stationhouse he caught sight of micky maguire hovering about the door micky smiled significantly as he saw fosdick and his burden where are you carryin that he asked why do you ask said fosdick who could not feel very friendly to the author of dicks misfortune never mind why said micky i know well enough its for your friend dick how does he like his new lodgins how do you like them youve been there often enough dont be impudent or ill lam ye said micky scowling as fosdick was considerably smaller than himself micky might have ventured upon an assault but deemed it imprudent in the immediate vicinity of the stationhouse give my compliments to dick he said i hope hell sleep well to this fosdick returned no answer but entering the building descended to dicks temporary quarters he passed the bread and cake through the grating and dick cheered by the hope of an acquittal on the morrow and a speedy recovery of his freedom partook with a good appetite cant you give me a mouthful boss muttered the negro woman before mentioned as she caught sight of fosdicks load he passed a cake through the grating which she seized eagerly and devoured with appetite i think i must be going said mr murdock consulting his watch or my wife and children wont know what has become of me goodnight mr murdock said dick thank you for your kindness goodnight richard keep up your courage ill try to fosdick stopped longer at last he went away and our hero left to himself lay down upon his pallet and tried to get to sleep chapter xvi roswell crawford retires from business can you send this home for me asked a lady in hall turners store about three oclock in the afternoon of the day on which dick as we have related was arrested certainly madam where shall it be sent asked the clerk no west fortieth street was the reply very well it shall be sent up immediately here roswell roswell crawford came forward not very willingly he had no great liking for the task which he saw would be required of him fortieth street was at least a mile and a half distant and he had already just returned from a walk in a different direction besides the bundle was a large one containing three dress patterns he did not think it very suitable for a gentlemans son to be seen carrying such a large bundle through the streets why dont you send edward he said complainingly he doesnt do half as much as i i shall send whom i please said the clerk sharply you wouldnt do anything if you could help it i wont carry bundles much longer said roswell you put all the heaviest bundles off upon me roswells back being turned he did not observe mr turner who had come up as he was speaking what are you complaining about asked that gentleman roswell turned and colored a little when he saw his employer what is the matter repeated mr turner mr evans always gives me the largest bundles to carry said roswell he is always complaining of having to carry bundles said the clerk he says it isnt suitable work for a gentlemans son i have noticed it said mr turner on the whole i think mr crawford he said with mock deference i think you have mistaken your vocation in entering a drygoods store i advise you to seek some more gentlemanly employment at the end of the week you are at liberty to leave my employment for one better suited to you im ready to go now said roswell sulkily very well if you desire it i will not insist upon your remaining if you will come up to the desk you shall receive what is due you it was somewhat humiliating to roswell to feel that his services were so readily dispensed with still he had never liked the place and heartily disliked carrying bundles by going at once he would get rid of the large bundle to be carried to west fortieth street congratulating himself therefore on the whole on escaping from what he regarded as a degrading servitude he walked up to the desk in a dignified manner and received the wages due him i hope you will find some more congenial employment said mr turner who paid him the amount of his wages i have no doubt i shall said roswell loftily my father was a gentleman and our family has considerable influence well i wish you success goodby goodby said roswell and walked out of the shop with head erect he did not quite like going home at once as explanation would be rather awkward under the circumstances he accordingly crossed over to fifth avenue considering that the most suitable promenade for a gentlemans son he could not help regarding with some envy the happy possessors of the elegant buildings which he passed why had partial fate denied him that fortune which would have enabled him to live in this favored locality plenty of snobs have got money he thought how much better i could use it than they i wish i were rich you wouldnt catch me slaving my life out in a drygoods store or any other this was undoubtedly true work of any kind had no charms for roswell to walk up the avenue swinging a dandy cane dressed in the height of the fashion or what was better yet sitting back luxuriously in an elegant carriage drawn by a dashing span such was what he regarded himself most fit for but unfortunately he was not very likely to realize his wishes the desire to enjoy wealth doesnt bring it and the tastes of a gentleman are not a very good stock to begin life with so roswell sauntered along in rather a discontented frame of mind until he reached madison park where he sat down on a bench and listlessly watched some boys who were playing there hallo roswell said one of his acquaintances coming up by chance how do you happen to be here why shouldnt i be here i thought you were in a store somewhere on sixth avenue well i was but i have left it when did you leave it today got sacked hey sacked in the new york vernacular means discharged from a place the idea of having it supposed that he had been sacked was not pleasing to roswells pride he accordingly answered i never was sacked in my life besides its a low word and i never use it well you know what i mean did they turn you off no they didnt they would have been glad to have me stay why didnt you then i didnt like the business dry goods wasnt it yes a retail drygoods store if i ever go into that line again itll be in a wholesale store theres a chance there for a man to rise you dont call yourself a man yet do you i call myself a gentleman said roswell shortly what are you going to do now im in no hurry about a new place i shall look round a little well success to you i must be getting back to the shop what are you doing im learning a trade oh said roswell turning up his nose slightly which was quite easy for him to do as nature had given that organ an upward turn he thought all trades low and resolved hereafter to hold as little communication as possible with the boy who had so far demeaned himself as to be learning one that was worse than being in a drygoods store and carrying around bundles towards six oclock roswell rose from his seat and sauntered towards clinton place which was nearly a mile distant he entered the house a little before dinner are you not earlier than usual roswell asked his mother ive left the store he said abruptly left the store echoed his mother in some dismay why because they dont know how to treat me its no fit place for a gentlemans son i am sorry roswell said mrs crawford who like her son was poor and proud and found the four dollars he earned weekly of advantage im afraid you have been foolish listen mother and ill tell you all about it he said roswell gave his explanation which it need hardly be said was very favorable to himself and mrs crawford was finally brought to believe that hall turner were low people with whom it was not suitable for one of her sons gentlemanly tastes to be placed his vindication was scarcely over when the bell rang and his cousin gilbert was admitted mr gilbert entered briskly and with a smiling face he felt unusually complaisant having succeeded in his designs against our hero well james said mrs crawford you look in better spirits than i feel whats happened amiss roswell has given up his place been discharged you mean no said roswell i left the place of my own accord what for i dont like the firm nor the business i wish i were in mr rockwells well said gilbert perhaps i can get you in there has the bootblack left hes found another place said gilbert smiling at what he regarded as a good joke you dont mean to say he has left a place where he was earning ten dollars a week said mrs crawford in surprise where is this new place that you speak of in the stationhouse is he in the stationhouse asked roswell eagerly that is what i hear whats he been doing charged with picking a pocket well i do hope mr rockwell will now see his folly in engaging a boy from the streets said mrs crawford charitably concluding that there was no doubt of our heros guilt whatll be done with him cousin james asked roswell hell be sent to the island i suppose he may get clear i think not circumstances are very much against him i hear and will you try to get me in cousin james ill do what i can perhaps it may be well for you to drop in tomorrow about ten oclock all right ill do it both mrs crawfords and roswells spirits revived wonderfully and mr gilbert too seemed unusually lively and all because poor dick had got into difficulties and seemed in danger of losing both his place and his good name its lucky i left hall turners just as i did thought roswell complacently may be theyd like to engage the bootblack when he gets out of prison but i guess hell have to go back to blacking boots thats what hes most fit for chapter xvii dicks acquittal after his interview with mr murdock and henry fosdick dick felt considerably relieved he not only saw that his friends were convinced of his innocence but through tim ryans testimony he saw that there was a reasonable chance of getting clear he had begun to set a high value on respectability and he felt that now he had a character to sustain the night wore away at last the pallet on which he lay was rather hard but dick had so often slept in places less comfortable that he cared little for that when he woke up he did not at first remember where he was but he very soon recalled the circumstances and that his trial was close at hand i hope mr murdock wont oversleep himself thought our hero if he does itll be a gone case with me at an early hour the attendant of the police station went the rounds and dick was informed that he was wanted brief space was given for the arrangement of the toilet in fact those who avail themselves of the free lodgings provided at the stationhouse rarely pay very great attention to their dress or personal appearance dick however had a comb in his pocket and carefully combed his hair he also brushed off his coat as well as he could he also critically inspected his shoes not forgetting his old professional habits i wish i had a brush and some blackin he said to himself my shoes would look all the better for a good shine but time was up and under the escort of a policeman dick was conveyed to the tombs probably all my readers have heard of this building it is a large stone building with massive columns broad on the ground but low it is not only used for a prison but there are two rooms on the first floor used for the holding of courts into the larger one of these dick was carried he looked around him anxiously and to his great joy perceived that not only mr murdock was on hand but honest tim ryan whose testimony was so important to his defence dick was taken forward to the place provided for those awaiting trial and was obliged to await his turn one or two cases about which there was no doubt including the colored woman arrested for drunkenness were summarily disposed of and the next case was called the policeman who had arrested dick presented himself with our hero dick was so neatly dressed and looked so modest and selfpossessed that the judge surveyed him with some surprise what is this lad charged with he demanded with taking a wallet from a gentlemans pocket said the policeman did you arrest him i did did you take him in the act no i did not see him take it what have you to say prisoner are you guilty or not guilty said the judge turning to dick not guilty said dick quietly state why you made the arrest said the judge i saw him with the wallet in his hand is the gentleman who had his pocket picked present he is summon him the redfaced man came forward and gave his testimony he stated that he was standing on the sidewalk when he felt a hand thrust into his pocket and forcibly withdrawn he immediately felt for his wallet and found it gone turning he saw a boy running and immediately gave chase was the boy you saw running the prisoner i suppose it was you suppose dont you know of course it was or he would not have been found with the wallet in his hand but you cannot identify him from personal observation the redfaced man admitted with some reluctance that his eyesight was very poor and he did not catch sight of the boy till he was too far off to be identified this is not so clear as it might be said the judge still appearances are against the prisoner and as the wallet was found in his possession he must be found guilty unless that fact can be satisfactorily explained i have a witness who can explain it said dick where is he tim ryan who understood that his evidence was now wanted came forward after being sworn the judge asked what is your name tim ryan sir where do you live in mulberry street tell what you know of this case i was standing in chatham street when i saw the ould gintleman with the red face here the prosecutor scowled at tim not relishing the description which was given of him standing at the corner of pearl street a boy came up and put his hand into his pocket and then run away as fast as his legs could carry him wid the wallet in his hand who was this boy do you know him yes sir tell his name it was micky maguire said tim reluctantly and who is micky maguire he blacks boots then if this micky maguire took the wallet how happened it that it was found in this boys possession i can tell that said tim i ran after micky to see if hed get off wid the wallet he hadnt gone but a little way when i saw him slip it into dicks pocket i suppose you mean by dick the prisoner at the bar yes sir and what became of this micky he stopped runnin after hed got rid of the pocketbook and a minute after up came the copp and took dick why didnt you come forward and explain the mistake i was afraid mickyd beat me do you know this micky maguire said the judge turning to the officer i do what is his reputation bad hes been at the island three or four times already did you see him anywhere about when you made the arrest i did do you know this boy who has just testified yes he is a good boy the case seems a clear one the prisoner is discharged from custody arrest micky maguire on the same charge as early as possible the next case was called and dick was free mr murdock came forward and took him by the hand which he shook heartily i congratulate you on your acquittal he said i feel a little better than i did said dick tim youre a good fellow he said clasping tims hand i wouldnt have got off if it hadnt been for you i ought to do that much for you dick when youve been so kind to me how are you getting along now tim pretty well mothers got so she can work and were doin well when she was sick it was pretty hard heres something to help you along said dick and he drew a bill from his pocket five dollars said tim in surprise you can buy some new clothes tim i ought not to take so much as that dick its all right tim theres some more where that comes from they were in centre street by this time fosdick came up hurriedly have you got off dick he asked eagerly yes fosdick theres no chance of my being entertained at the expense of the city i didnt expect the trial was coming off so early tell me all about it what did they say at the house at my being away asked dick miss peyton inquired particularly after you i said as you directed me that you were detained by important business what did she say then dick was so particular in his inquiries fearing lest any suspicion should have been formed of the real cause which had detained him there was no reason for it but it had always been a matter of pride with him in his vagabond days that he had never been arrested on any charge and it troubled him that he should even have been suspected of theft you are fishing for compliments dick said fosdick how do you make that out you want to know what miss peyton said i believe you are getting interested in her when i am just send me to a lunatic asylum said dick i am afraid you are getting sarcastic dick however not to keep you in suspense miss peyton said that you were one of the wittiest young men she knew of and you were quite the life of the house i suppose i ought to blush said dick but im a prey to hunger just now and its too much of an effort ill excuse you this time said fosdick as to the hunger thats easily remedied we shall get home to breakfast and be in good time too fosdick was right they were the first to seat themselves at the table mr clifton came in directly afterwards dick felt a momentary embarrassment what would he say thought our hero if he knew where i passed the night goodmorning hunter said clifton you didnt favor us with your presence at dinner last evening no said dick i was absent on very important business dining with your friend the mayor probably well no not exactly said dick but i had some business with the city government it seems to me that youre getting to be quite an important character thank you said dick i am glad to find that genius is sometimes appreciated here miss peyton entered welcome mr hunter she said we missed you last evening i hope it didnt affect your appetite much said dick but it did i appeal to mr fosdick whether i ate anything to speak of i thought miss peyton had a better appetite than usual said fosdick that is too bad of you mr fosdick said miss peyton im sure i didnt eat more than my canary bird just the way it affected me said dick it always improves my appetite to see you eat miss peyton miss peyton looked as if she hardly knew whether to understand this remark as complimentary or otherwise that evening at the dinnertable clifton drew a copy of the express from his pocket and said by jove hunter heres a capital joke on you ill read it a boy named richard hunter was charged with picking a pocket on chatham street but it appearing that the theft was committed by another party he was released from custody dicks heart beat a little quicker while this was being read but he maintained his selfpossession of course said he that was the important business that detained me but i hope you wont mention it for the sake of my family id make the young rascal change his name if i were you said clifton if hes going to get into the police record i think i shall said dick or maybe ill change my own you couldnt mention a highly respectable name that i could take could you clifton is the most respectable name i know of said the young gentleman owning that name if youll make me your heir perhaps ill adopt it ill divide my debts with you and give you the biggest half said clifton it is unnecessary to pursue the conversation dick found to his satisfaction that no one at the table suspected that he was the richard hunter referred to in the express chapter xviii the cup and the lip while dicks night preceding the trial was an anxious one gilbert and roswell crawford passed a pleasant evening and slept soundly do you think mr rockwell would be willing to give me the same wages he has paid to the bootblack he inquired with interest perhaps he wont take you at all i think he ought to pay some attention to your recommendation said mrs crawford you ought to have some influence with him of course said gilbert i shall do what i can in the matter but its a pity roswell cant give better references hes never been with a decent employer yet hes been very unlucky about his places said mrs crawford she might have added that his employers had considered themselves unfortunate in their engagement of her son but even if she had known it she would have considered that they were prejudiced against him and that they were in fault entirely i will do what i can for him continued gilbert but i am very sure he wont get as much as ten dollars a week i can earn as much as the bootblack i should hope said roswell he didnt earn ten dollars a week he got it thats a very different thing well if i get it i dont care if i dont earn it thats true enough said gilbert who did not in his heart set a very high estimate upon the services of his young cousin and who had the business been his own would certainly not have engaged him at any price roswell thought it best not to say any more having on some previous occasions been greeted with remarks from his cousin which could not by any means be regarded as complimentary do you think i had better come in at ten oclock cousin james inquired roswell as breakfast was over and gilbert prepared to go to the countingroom well perhaps you may come a little earlier say about halfpast nine said the bookkeeper all right said roswell being rather sanguine he made up his mind that he was going to have the place and felt it difficult to keep his good fortune secret now in the next house there lived a boy named edward mclean who was in a brokers office in wall street at a salary of six dollars a week now though edward had never boasted of his good fortune it used to disturb roswell to think that his place and salary were so much superior to his own he felt that it was much more respectable to be in a brokers office independent of the salary than to run around the city with heavy bundles but if he could enter such an establishment as rockwell coopers at a salary of ten dollars he felt that he could look down with conscious superiority upon edward mclean with his six dollars a week he went over to his neighbors and found edward just starting for wall street how are you roswell said edward pretty well are you going down to the office yes youve got a pretty good place havent you yes i like it how much do you get six dollars a week thats very fair said roswell patronizingly how do you like your place asked edward i believe youre in a drygoods store on sixth avenue oh no said roswell you were yes i went in temporarily to oblige them said roswell loftily but of course i wouldnt engage to remain any length of time in such a place however large the inducements they might offer considering roswells tone it would hardly have been supposed that the large inducements were four dollars a week and that even at that compensation his services were not desired then it wasnt a good place said edward well enough for such as liked it said roswell i have no complaint of hall turner i told them that it was not dissatisfaction with them that led me to leave the place but i preferred a different kind of business have you got another place i have an offer under consideration said roswell consequentially one of the most solid firms in the city they offer me ten dollars a week ten dollars a week repeated edward somewhat staggered by the statement thats big pay yes said roswell but i think i ought to get as much as that why i thought myself lucky to get six dollars said edward yes thats very fair said roswell condescendingly in fact ive worked at that figure myself but of course one expects more as he grows older i suppose youll accept your offer said edward i havent quite made up my mind said roswell carelessly i think i shall youd better such places dont grow on every bush though edward did not more than half believe roswells statement he kept his disbelief to himself feeling that it was a matter of indifference to him whether roswell received a large or small salary i must be going down to the office he said goodmorning goodmorning said roswell and he reentered the house feeling that he had impressed edward with a conviction of his superiority and the value set upon his services by the business men of new york he went upstairs and picked out a flashy necktie from his drawer tied it carefully before the glass and about nine set out for rockwell coopers warehouse it is necessary for us to precede him gilbert reached the countingroom at the usual time his thoughts on the way thither were pleasant i shant be subjected to that young rascals impertinence he considered thats one satisfaction his astonishment nay dismay may be imagined therefore when on entering the countingroom the first object his eyes rested on was the figure of dick goodmorning mr gilbert said our hero pleasantly how came you here he demanded i walked said dick i dont often ride i think walkins good for the constitution you know what i mean well enough how did you get out of prison i havent been there you were arrested for picking a mans pocket yesterday afternoon said gilbert excuse me mr gilbert youre slightly mistaken there i was arrested on suspicion of picking a mans pocket the same thing not quite as it has been proved that i was innocent and the wallet was taken by another boy have you been tried yes and acquitted gilbert looked and felt disappointed he could not conceive how dick could have escaped when the plot to entrap him had been so artfully contrived well young man he said ill give you a piece of advice and if youre wise youll follow it thats kind in you said dick i pass over your impertinence this time and will advise you as a friend to resign your situation before mr rockwell comes why should i itll save your being discharged do you think hell discharge me i know he will he wont have any one in his employ who has been arrested for picking pockets not even if he didnt do it not even if he was lucky enough to get off said gilbert you think id better give up my place thatll be the best course for you to pursue but howll i get another place ill do what i can to help you to another place if you leave at once i think ill wait and see mr rockwell first ill make all the necessary explanations to mr rockwell said the bookkeeper i think id rather see him myself if it doesnt make any difference to you youre acting like a fool youll only be kicked out of the store if you dont follow my advice i shant interest myself in getting you another place do you think i took the wallet mr gilbert asked dick of course i do then how could you recommend me to another place because i think this may prove a lesson to you youve been lucky enough to escape this time but you cant expect it always im much obliged to you for your favorable opinion but i dont think i shall resign at once at this moment mr rockwell entered the warehouse he had been informed of dicks misfortune by mr murdock who had had occasion to call at his house on his way from the trial hows this richard he said advancing with a frank smile i hear you got into strange quarters last night yes said dick but i didnt like it well enough to stay long why didnt you send for me thank you sir i didnt like to trouble you mr murdock was very kind have they got the real thief i dont know sir well alls well that ends well you can afford to laugh at it now mr gilbert listened to this colloquy with very little satisfaction it seemed to show such a good understanding between dick and his employer that he perceived that it would be a very difficult thing to supersede him mr rockwell seems to be infatuated with that boy he muttered to himself i think i wont resign just yet said dick in a low voice to the bookkeeper youll be found out some day said gilbert snappishly go to the postoffice and mind you dont stop to play on the way dick started on his errand and in passing out into the street encountered roswell crawford who attired with extra care had just come down the street from broadway on seeing dick he started as if he had seen a ghost goodmorning roswell said dick pleasantly goodmorning said roswell stiffly your cousin is in the countingroom i am in a hurry and must leave you i thought he was on his way to the island by this time thought roswell perplexed what can it mean it occurred to him all at once that dick might just have been discharged and this thought cheered him up considerably he entered the countingroom with a jaunty step goodmorning cousin james he said gilbert turned round and said in a surly tone you may as well take yourself off theres no chance for you here hasnt the bootblack been discharged no and isnt going to be how is that asked roswell looking very much disappointed i cant stop to tell you now youd better go now and ill tell you this evening just my luck said roswell to himself considerably crestfallen i wish i hadnt said a word to edward mclean about the place chapter xix another arrest micky maguire as the reader will remember was by no means satisfied with the compensation he received from gilbert for his share in the plot which came so near proving disastrous to our friend dick he felt that the bookkeeper had acted meanly to him and he meant to have his revenge if a good opportunity should ever offer he was very much disappointed to think he must do without the watch which he had set his heart upon he would have felt no particular scruples against stealing it but that would be rather dangerous he began to wish he had kept the pocketbook very probably it contained more than enough to buy the watch but in spite of his disappointment he had one satisfaction he had avenged himself upon dick whom he had long disliked he knew nothing of tim ryans testimony and supposed there was no doubt of dicks conviction he would like very well to have been present at the trial but he had unpleasant associations connected with the courtroom at the tombs having figured there on several occasions in an important but not very enviable capacity as he was standing by the park railings his particular friend and admirer limpy jim came up mornin jim said micky what luck none at all said jim i havent had a shine yet and im precious hungry come and take breakfast with me said micky in an unusual fit of generosity for he was generally more willing to be treated than to treat have you got stamps enough look at this and micky displayed the bill which he had received from gilbert youre in luck micky did you make all that by shines never mind how i made it i guess its good come along if youre hungry limpy jim followed micky across printinghouse square to a cheap restaurant on nassau street between ann and beekman streets and they were soon partaking with relish of a breakfast which as they were not very fastidious proved abundantly satisfactory ive got some news said micky after he had drained his cup of coffee you havent forgot ragged dick have ye hes set up for a gentleman i saw him a week ago strutting round as if he lived on fifth avenue well hes set up for something else now whats that a pickpocket what asked jim amazed he stole an old chaps pocketbook yesterday afternoon and i seed a policeman haulin him off to the plice station thats where he gets his good cloes from suggested jim most likely i expect hes on his way to the island by this time serve him right for puttin on airs he wont pretend to be so much better than the rest of us now wonder what tom wilkinsll say hes a great friend of dicks hes a sneak said micky thats so i wanted to borrer a shillin of him last week and he wouldnt lend it to me this tom wilkins was a bootblack like the two who were expressing so unfavorable an opinion of his character he had a mother and two sisters partially dependent upon him for support and faithfully carried home all his earnings this accounts for his being unwilling to lend limpy jim who had no one to look out for but himself and never considered it necessary to repay borrowed money tom had reason to feel friendly to dick for on several occasions one of which is mentioned in the first volume of this series dick had given him help in time of need he was always ready to defend dick when reviled by micky and his followers and had once or twice been attacked in consequence limpy jim was right in supposing that nothing would disturb tom more than to hear that his friend had got into trouble micky who was in a generous mood bought a couple of cheap cigars of which he presented one to his satellite these were lighted and both boys feeling more comfortable for the hearty meal of which they had partaken swaggered out into the street they reentered the park and began to look out for patrons theres tom wilkins now said limpy jim tom was busily engaged in imparting a scientific shine to the boots of an old gentleman who was sitting on one of the wooden seats to be found in the neighborhood of the city hall when he had completed his task and risen from his knees limpy jim advanced towards him and said with a sneer ive heard fine news about your friend dick whats that asked tom hes got nabbed by a copp i dont believe it said tom incredulously isnt it so micky said jim appealing to his friend yes its true i seed him hauled off for pickin an old fellows pocket in chatham street i dont believe it repeated tom but he began to feel a little uneasy i saw him and spoke to him yesterday mornin what if you did it didnt happen till afternoon dick wouldnt steal said tom stoutly hell find it mighty hard work provin that he didnt said micky you wont see him for the next three months why wont i because hell be at the island maybe youll go there yourself if i do itll be for the first time retorted tom and thats more than either of you can say as this happened to be true it was of course regarded as offensive shut up tom wilkins said micky if you dont want a lickin none of your impudence said limpy jim emboldened by the presence and support of micky who was taller and stronger than tom ive only told the truth said tom and you cant deny it take that for your impudence said micky drawing off and hitting tom a staggering blow on the side of the head limpy jim was about to assist micky when there was a very unlookedfor interruption micky maguire was seized by the collar and turning indignantly found himself in the grip of a policeman so you are fighting are you my fine fellow demanded the guardian of the public peace he insulted me said micky doggedly not attempting resistance which he knew would be ineffectual didnt he jim but jim had already disappeared he had a prejudice easily accounted for against the metropolitan police and had as little communication with them as possible i dont know anything about that said the policeman all i know is that youre wanted just for hittin him i didnt hurt him any he didnt hurt me much said tom generously not desiring to see micky get into trouble on his account he says i didnt hurt him urged micky cant you let me go that isnt what i want you for said the policeman micky was astonished the real cause of his arrest never once occurred to him and he could not understand why he was wanted what is it then he asked in some surprise what ave i been doin perhaps you dont remember relieving an old gentleman of his pocketbook yesterday in chatham street twasnt me who was it then ragged dick the feller that was took at the time i seed him pick the mans pocket it seems that you remember something about it but it was dick that did it if he says i did it he lies ive nothing to do with that you must tell your story to the judge has he let dick go yes micky received this intelligence with dismay somehow it had got out that he was the real thief and he began to think that his chance of getting off was small just then while in custody of the policeman he saw advancing towards him the man who had inveigled him into the plot gilbert the bookkeeper his anger against gilbert overcame his prudence and he said well if i did take the pocketbook i was paid for doin it and that was the man that hired me with some surprise the policeman listened to this story if you dont believe me just wait till i speak to him mr gilbert called micky gilbert who had not till now noticed his confederate looked up and rapidly understanding what had happened determined upon his course who speaks to me he said quietly youve got me into trouble mr gilbert said micky and i want you to get me out of it what does he mean asked gilbert coolly addressing the policeman you hired me to steal a mans pocketbook and im took up for it said micky i want you to help me or ill be sent to the island the boy must be crazy said gilbert shrugging his shoulders you give me a dollar to do it said micky very much incensed at the desertion of his confederate do you know the boy asked the policeman respectfully for he put no faith in mickys statement he blacked my boots once said gilbert thats all i know about him what is he arrested for for picking pockets there was another boy arrested on suspicion but it appeared on trial that he was innocent and that this boy really took the wallet he looks like a young scamp said gilbert coolly im much obliged to him for introducing my name into the matter i hope hell get his desserts this was too much for mickys patience he assailed gilbert with such a shower of oaths that the policeman tightened his grip and shook him vigorously gilbert shrugged his shoulders and walked off with apparent unconcern wait till i get free said micky furiously ill fix him in regard to micky i have only to say further at this time that he was at once conveyed to the tombs summarily tried and convicted and spent the same night on blackwells island where we leave him for three months chapter xx before the party youll be able to attend ida greysons party after all dick said fosdick on tuesday evening yes said dick i was afraid that i should be wanted to grace the fashionable circles at blackwells island but as my particular friend micky maguire has kindly offered to go in my place i shall be able to keep my other engagement mickys a bad fellow im afraid he is said dick but hes never had a fair chance his father was a drunkard and used to beat him and his mother till micky ran away from home and set up for himself hes never had any good example set him you speak kindly of micky considering he has always been your enemy i havent any ill will against micky said dick generously if i ever can do him a good turn i will ive been luckier than he and most of my old companions im going to do all i can to help them along theres good in them if you can only bring it out dick spoke earnestly in a very different tone from his usual one he had a certain philosophy of his own and had always taken the world easily however it treated him but he had a warm and sympathizing heart for the sufferings of others and he felt that he was in a position to befriend his old associates and encourage them to higher aims and a better mode of life youre a good fellow dick said fosdick it isnt everybody that is so charitable to the faults of others i know one said dick smiling you mean me but im afraid you are mistaken i cant say i feel very well disposed towards micky maguire maybe mickyll reform and turn out well after all it would be a wonderful change havent both of us changed wonderfully in the last eighteen months you were always a good fellow even when you were ragged dick you say that because you are my friend fosdick i say it because its true dick you were always ready to take the side of the weak against the strong and share your money with those who were out of luck i had a hard time till i fell in with you thank you said dick if i ever want a firstrate recommendation ill come to you what a lot of friends ive got mr gilbert offered to get me another place if id only resign my situation at rockwell coopers hes a very disinterested friend said fosdick laughing do you think of accepting his offer im afraid i might not be suited with the place hed get me said dick he thinks im best fitted to adorn the office of a bootblack maybe hed appoint me his private bootblack but im afraid i shouldnt be able to retire on a fortune till i was two or three hundred if i accepted the situation what shall we wear to the party dick weve got good suits of clothes we can carry them to a tailors and have them pressed and they will look well enough i saw a splendid necktie today at a store on broadway im going to buy it you have a weakness for neckties dick you see fosdick if you have a striking necktie people will look at that and they wont criticise your face there may be something in that dick i feel a little nervous though it is the first fashionable party i ever attended well said dick i havent attended many when i was a bootblack i found it interfered with my business and so i always declined all the fashionable invitations i got youd have made a sensation said fosdick if you had appeared in the costume you then wore thats what i was afraid of i dont want to make a sensation im too modest in fact both the boys though they were flattered by idas invitation looked forward rather nervously to the evening of the party for the first time they were to meet and mingle on terms of equality with a large number of young people who had been brought up very differently from themselves dick could not help remembering how short a time had elapsed since with his little wooden box strapped to his back he used to call out black your boots in the city park perhaps some of his old customers might be present still he knew that he had improved greatly and that his appearance had changed for the better it was hardly likely that any one seeing him in mr greysons drawingroom would identify him as the ragged dick of other days then there was another ground for confidence ida liked him and he had a sincere liking for the little girl for whom he had a feeling such as a brother has for a cherished younger sister so dick dressed himself for the party feeling that he should get through it somehow i need not say of course that his boots shone with a lustre not to be surpassed even by the professional expert of the fifth avenue hotel it was very evident that dick had not forgotten the business by which he once gained his livelihood when dick had arranged his necktie to suit him which i am bound to confess took at least quarter of an hour had carefully brushed his hair and dusted his clothes he certainly looked remarkably well dick was not vain but he was anxious to appear to advantage on his first appearance in society it need not be added that fosdick also was neatly dressed but he was smaller and more delicatelooking than dick and not likely to attract so much attention as the boys were descending the stairs they met miss peyton really mr hunter said that young lady you look quite dazzling this evening how many hearts do you expect to break this evening im not in that line of business said dick i leave all that to you youre too bad really mr hunter said miss peyton highly pleased nevertheless i never think of such a thing i suppose i must believe you said dick but why is it that mr clifton has looked so sad lately mr clifton would not think of poor me said miss peyton if you only knew what he said about you the other day do tell me i couldnt if you will ill give you thank you interrupted dick gravely but i never accept kisses from ladies over six years old how can you say so mr hunter im sorry to disappoint you miss peyton but i really couldnt as if i ever thought of such a thing said miss peyton in affected horror i appeal to my friend fosdick did i say so mr fosdick fosdick smiled you mustnt appeal to me miss peyton you and mr hunter are so brilliant that i dont pretend to understand you then you wont tell me what mr clifton said it is too bad i shant sleep tonight for thinking of it suppose you ask mr clifton i dont know but i will miss peyton went into the parlor her heart fluttering with the thought that she had made a conquest of the gentleman referred to as mr clifton was a clerk on a small salary continually in debt and with no expectations he could not be considered a very brilliant match but miss peyton was not very particular and she would have readily changed her name to clifton if the chance should present itself as we may not have occasion to refer to her again it may be as well to state that mr cliftons pecuniary affairs came to a crisis some months afterwards he had always been in the habit of laughing at miss peyton but in his strait he recollected that she was mistress of a few thousand dollars over which she had absolute control under these circumstances he decided to sacrifice himself he accordingly offered his heart and hand and was promptly accepted miss peyton informed him that he was the object of her hearts tenderest affection her first and only love mr clifton expressed no doubt of this though he was aware that miss peyton had been laying her snares for a husband for nearly ten years the marriage took place at the boardinghouse dick and fosdick being among the invited guests mr clifton with his wifes money bought a partnership in a retail store on eighth avenue where it is to be hoped he is doing a good business any one desirous of calling upon him at his place of business is referred to the new york city directory for his number whether mr and mrs clifton live happily i cannot pretend to say not being included in the list of their friends but i am informed by my friend dick who calls occasionally that mrs clifton is as fascinating now as before her marriage and very naturally scorns the whole sisterhood of old maids having narrowly escaped becoming one herself chapter xxi ida greysons party when dick and his friend reached mr greysons house two carriages stood before the door from each of which descended young guests who like themselves had been invited to the party one of these brought two young girls of twelve the other two boys of twelve and fourteen and their sister of ten entering with this party the two boys felt less embarrassed than if they had been alone the door was opened by a servant who said young ladies dressingroom second floor lefthand room young gentlemens dressingroom opposite following directions the boys went upstairs and entered a spacious chamber where they deposited their outer garments and had an opportunity to arrange their hair and brush their clothes is your sister here this evening asked one of the boys addressing dick no said dick soberly she couldnt come im sorry for that she promised to dance with me the first lancers wouldnt i do as well asked dick i dont think you would said the other laughing but ill tell you what you shall dance with my sister i will with pleasure said dick if youll introduce me why i thought you knew her said the other in surprise perhaps i did said dick but i exchanged myself off for another boy just before i came and that makes a difference you know i shouldnt have known you if you hadnt spoken to me do you know me now asked the other boy beginning to understand that he had made a mistake you live on twentyfirst street dont you yes was the unexpected reply for dick had by a curious chance guessed right youre henry cameron after all no said dick my name is richard hunter and mine is theodore selden but i suppose you knew that as you knew where i live if youre ready well go downstairs come fosdick said dick were going to have the lancers first said theodore ida told my sister so have you a partner engaged no then ill introduce you to my sister come along i may explain here that dick and fosdick also had several times danced the lancers in the parlor at the boardinghouse in the evening so that they felt reasonably confident of getting through respectably still his new friends proposal made dick feel a little nervous he was not bashful with boys but he had very little acquaintance with girls or young ladies and expected to feel ill at ease with them still he could not think of a good reason for excusing himself from the promised introduction and after going up to ida in company with his new friend and congratulating her on her birthday he would not have known how to act if theodore had not set him an example he walked across the room to where one of the young ladies who had entered at the time he did was seated alice said theodore this is my friend mr hunter who would like to dance with you in the first lancers dick bowed and alice producing a card said i shall be most happy will mr hunter write his name on my card dick did so and was thankful that he could now write a handsome hand now said theodore unceremoniously ill leave you two to amuse each other while i go off in search of a partner im in for it thought dick seating himself on the sofa beside alice i wish i knew what to say do you like the lancers inquired the young lady yes i like it said dick but i havent danced it much im afraid i shall make some mistakes ive no doubt we shall get along well said alice where did you learn i learned at home said dick i thought i had not met you at dodworths i attended dancing school there last winter no said dick i never took lessons dont you like ida greyson inquired alice yes i like her very much said dick sincerely shes a sweet girl shes a very intimate friend of mine who is that boy that came into the room with you his name is henry fosdick hes going to dance with ida come let us hurry and get in the same set dick offered his arm and as the sets were already being formed led his partner to the upper end of the room where they were just in time to get into the same set with ida theodore with a girl about his own age had already taken his position opposite dick fosdick and ida were the first couple and opposite them isaac and isabella selden cousins of theodore and alice they had scarcely taken their places when the music struck up dick felt a little flustered but determined to do his best being very quick in learning figures and naturally gracefully in his movements he got through very creditably and without a mistake i thought you expected to make mistakes said alice selden as dick led her back to her seat i think you dance very well it was because i had such a good partner said dick thank you for the compliment said alice courtesying profoundly seems to me youre very polite alice said theodore coming up mr hunter was paying me a compliment said alice i wish youd tell me how said theodore to dick i wish he would interrupted alice all your compliments are of the wrong kind it isnt expected that brothers should compliment their sisters said theodore mrs greyson came into the room during the dancing and was pleased to see that dick and henry fosdick instead of sitting awkwardly in the corner were taking their part in the evenings amusement dick made an engagement with alice for another dance later in the evening but danced the second with ida greyson with whom by this time he felt very well acquainted illustration i didnt know you knew alice selden said ida where did you meet her her brother theodore introduced me this evening i did not know her before you havent been here lately dick said ida familiarly no said he its because ive been very busy you dont work in the evening do you i study in the evening what do you study dick french for one thing can you speak french a little not much im going to try you comment vous portezvous monsieur trиs bien mademoiselle et vous thats right said ida gravely i cant talk much yet myself who teaches you i have a private teacher so have i she comes twice a week when i dont know my lesson she boxes my ears is your teacher cross no said dick laughing he doesnt box my ears thats because youre so large i wish i could have you for my teacher id ask papa if you could only speak it like a native so i can said dick you can really yes like a native of new york ida laughed and was afraid that wouldnt do when the dance was over and dick was leading ida to her seat a surprise awaited him a boy came forward hastily and said in a tone blending amazement with gratification is it possible that this is dick hunter frank whitney exclaimed dick clasping his hand cordially how came you here just the question i was going to ask you dick but ill answer first i am spending a few days with some cousins in thirtyseventh street they are friends of the greysons and were invited here this evening and i with them i little dreamed of meeting you here i must say dick you seem quite at home mr greyson has been a kind friend of mine said dick and ive met ida quite often but i felt a little nervous about coming to this party i was afraid id be like a cat in a strange garret youre a wonderful boy dick you look as if you had been used to such scenes all your life i can hardly believe youre the same boy i met in front of the astor house a little more than a year ago if im changed its because of what you said to me then you and your father but for those words i might still have been ragged dick im glad to hear you say that dick but for all that a great deal of credit is due to yourself ive worked hard said dick because i felt that i had something to work for when are you going to enter college i expect to apply for admission in about two months at columbia college yes i am glad of that i shall hope to see you sometimes you will see me often dick here the music struck up and the boys parted it is unnecessary to speak farther of the events of the evening dick made several other acquaintances and felt much more at ease than he had anticipated he returned home feeling that his first party had been a very agreeable one and that he had on the whole appeared to advantage chapter xxii micky maguire returns from the island for three months micky maguire was not seen in his accustomed haunts during his involuntary residence at the island he often brooded over the treachery of gilbert to whom his present misfortune was due he felt that he had been selfishly left to his fate by his equally guilty confederate it had certainly been a losing speculation for poor micky he had received but a paltry dollar for his services and in return he was deprived of his liberty for three months the disgrace of being sent to the island micky did not feel as dick would have done he had been there too many times to care for that but he did not like the restraints of the place and he did like the free and independent life of the streets from which for a time he was debarred the result of mickys brooding was a strong thirst for vengeance upon the author of his misfortunes he could do nothing at present but only bide his time meanwhile things went on pretty much as usual at the establishment in pearl street gilbert liked dick no better than he had done in fact he disliked him more but seeing the friendly relations between dick and his employer found it prudent to treat him well whenever mr rockwell was by at other times he indulged in sneers and faultfinding which dick turned off goodhumoredly or returned some droll answer which blunted the edge of the sarcasm and made the bookkeeper chafe with the feeling that he was no match for the boy he hated dick by faithful attention to his duties and a ready comprehension of what was required of him steadily advanced in the good opinion of every one except gilbert keep on as you have begun richard said mr murdock to him and youll be a member of the firm some time do you really think so mr murdock asked dick with a flush of gratification i really do you have excellent abilities mr rockwell likes you and you have only to continue steady and faithful and youll be sure to rise you know what i was mr murdock you are none the worse for that richard it is a great credit to a boy to earn his own living when circumstances force it upon him if his employment is an honest one it is an honorable one by such remarks as these dick was encouraged and he felt that mr murdock was a true friend to him meanwhile a way was opening for his advancement one day micky maguire appeared in his old haunts the second day he met gilbert in the street but the bookkeeper took not the slightest notice of him that touched mickys pride and confirmed him in his resolution he decided to make known to mr rockwell gilberts share in the little plot thinking that this would probably be the best method of injuring him he ascertained by means of a directory with some difficulty for mickys education was rather slight the residence of mr rockwell and about eight oclock in the evening ascended the steps and rang the bell he might have gone to his place of business but gilbert would be there and he preferred to see mr rockwell at home the servant stared at the odd and not particularly prepossessing figure before her is mr rockwell at home asked micky yes i want to see him did he tell you to call its on particular business said micky stop here and ill tell him said the girl theres a boy at the door wants to see you mr rockwell said the girl did you ask him in no sir he looks like a suspicious carakter said bridget laying the stress on the second syllable mr rockwell rose and went to the door what is your business he asked its about dick ragged dick we used to call him said micky you mean richard hunter yes said micky he was took up for stealin a gentlemans pocketbook three months ago but he was proved innocent said mr rockwell so if you have anything to say against him your time is thrown away i know he was innocent said micky another boy took it who was he i did it then you did a wicked thing in stealing the money and a mean thing in trying to get an innocent boy into trouble i wouldnt have done it said micky if i hadnt been paid for it paid for stealing said mr rockwell astonished paid for tryin to get dick into trouble that does not seem to be a very likely story said mr rockwell who would pay you money for doing such a thing mr gilbert my bookkeeper yes said micky vindictively i can hardly believe this said mr rockwell he paid me only a dollar for what i did said micky in an injured tone hed ought to have given me five dollars hes a reglar mean feller and is this why you betray him now no said micky it isnt the money though its mean to expect a feller to run the risk of bein nabbed for a dollar but when the copp had got hold of me i met him and he said i was a young scamp and he didnt know anything about me is this true asked mr rockwell looking keenly at micky micky confirmed his statement by an oath i dont want you to swear i shall not believe you the sooner for that can you explain why mr gilbert should engage in such a base conspiracy he told me that he hated dick said micky do you like him no i dont said micky honestly but i hate mr gilbert worse why do you hate richard because he puts on airs i suppose said mr rockwell smiling that means that he wears good clothes and keeps his face and hands clean he wasnt nothin but a bootblack said micky in an injured tone what are you im a bootblack too but i dont put on airs do you mean to be a bootblack all your life i dunna said micky there aint anything else to do tell me truly wouldnt you rather wear good clothes than poor ones and keep yourself clean and neat yes i should said micky after a slight hesitation then why do you blame dick for preferring to do the same he licked me once said micky rather reluctantly shifting his ground what for i fired a stone at him you cant blame him much for that can you no said micky slowly i dunno as i can for my own part i have a very good opinion of richard said mr rockwell he wants to raise himself in the world and i am glad to help him if that is putting on airs i should be glad to see you doing the same there aint no chance for me said micky why not i aint lucky as dick is dick may have been lucky said mr rockwell but i generally find that luck comes oftenest to those who deserve it if you will try to raise yourself i will help you will you asked micky in surprise the fact was he had been an ishmaelite from his earliest years and while he had been surrounded by fellows like limpy jim who were ready to encourage and abet him in schemes of mischief he had never had any friends who deserved the name that a gentleman like mr rockwell should voluntarily offer to assist him was indeed surprising how old are you asked mr rockwell seventeen said micky how long have you blacked boots ever since i was eight or nine i think it is time for you to do something else what will i do we must think of that i must also think of the information you have given me in regard to mr gilbert you are certain you are telling the truth yes said micky its the truth micky did not swear this time and mr rockwell believed him let me see he said reflecting can you be at my store tomorrow morning at ten oclock i can said micky promptly what is your name micky maguire goodnight michael goodnight sir said micky respectfully he walked away with a crowd of new thoughts and new aspirations kindling in his breast a gentleman had actually offered to help him on in the world nobody had ever taken any interest in him before life to him had been a struggle and a conflict with very little hope of better things he had supposed he should leave off blacking boots some time but no prospect seemed open before him why shouldnt i get up in the world he thought with new ambition he half confessed to himself that he had led a bad life and vague thoughts of amendment came to him somebody was going to take an interest in him that was the secret of his better thoughts and purposes on the whole i begin to think there is hope for micky chapter xxiii fame and fortune mr gilbert chanced to be looking out of the window of mr rockwells countingroom when he was unpleasantly surprised by the sudden apparition of micky maguire he was destined to be still more unpleasantly surprised micky walked up to the main entrance and entered with an assured air gilbert hastened to meet him and prevent his entrance clear out of here you young rascal he said in a tone of authority youre not wanted here ive come on business said micky with a scowl of dislike showing no intention of retreating i have no business with you said gilbert perhaps you havent said micky but mr rockwell has mr rockwell will have nothing to say to a vagabond like you he told me to come said micky resolutely and i shant go till ive seen him gilbert did not believe this but suspected that micky intended to betray him and to this of course he had a decided objection go out he said imperiously or ill make you i wont then said micky defiantly well see about that gilbert seized him by the shoulders but micky was accustomed to fighting and made a vigorous resistance in the midst of the fracas mr rockwell came up what does this mean he demanded in a quiet but authoritative tone this young rascal has attempted to force his way in said the bookkeeper desisting and with a flushed face i asked to see you said micky and he said i shouldnt i told him to come said mr rockwell you may come into the countingroom michael mr gilbert i should like your presence also in surprise not unmingled with foreboding mr gilbert followed his employer and micky maguire into the countingroom mr gilbert commenced mr rockwell are you acquainted with this boy he blacked my boots on one occasion said the bookkeeper i know no more of him except that he is a young vagabond and a thief who hired me to steal retorted micky i dont think you would need any hiring said gilbert with a sneer micky was about to retort in no choice terms but mr rockwell signed to him to be silent this boy has made a charge against you mr gilbert he said which you ought to be made aware of he is capable of any falsehood said the bookkeeper but he began to be nervous i thought your acquaintance with him was very slight so it is but it is easy to judge from his looks what he is that is not always a safe guide but to the charge he asserts that you hired him to fix the charge of theft upon richard on account of your dislike to him so he did and all he give me was a dollar said micky aggrieved that was mean do you believe this story asked gilbert turning to mr rockwell i know that you dislike richard mr gilbert so i do hes artful and bad but youll find him out some day i dont think you do him justice artful is the very last word i should apply to him you may be deceived if i am i shall never put confidence in any boy again but you havent answered the charge mr gilbert it isnt worth answering said the bookkeeper scornfully still i would be glad to have you give an answer one way or the other persisted mr rockwell then its a lie of course its true said micky i hope you consider my word as of more value than this vagabonds said gilbert contemptuously why were you so anxious to prevent his entering mr gilbert i didnt see what business he could possibly have here michael will you give an account of all that has taken place between mr gilbert and yourself i do not yet feel satisfied mr rockwell said gilbert in a passion i do not choose to submit to the insulting investigation you propose my month is out next thursday i beg leave to resign my situation your resignation is accepted said mr rockwell quietly if it is convenient to you i should like to leave at once said the bookkeeper livid with passion as you please said his employer your salary shall be paid up to the end of the month to this gilbert offered no opposition the balance of his salary was paid him and he left the warehouse in a very unpleasant frame of mind much to the gratification of micky maguire who felt that his vengeance was complete now michael said mr rockwell i must see what i can do for you do you wish to give up your present business yes said micky i dont like it i can give you a situation as errandboy in my own employ said mr rockwell my head clerk will explain your duties what wages will i get asked micky anxiously for the present you shall have a dollar a day or six dollars a week i will besides give you a new suit of clothes will that suit you yes said micky feeling as if he had unexpectedly become heir to a fortune when will i begin tomorrow if you like come here this afternoon at three and i will send richard with you to a clothinghouse just then dick who had been to the postoffice entered and mr rockwell in a few words informed him of the changes that had taken place i believe you and michael havent been very good friends he added but i trust you will get over that dick promptly offered his hand to his old enemy i am glad you are coming here micky he said ill do all i can to help you on and if we are not good friends it wont be my fault do you mean that dick said micky almost incredulous yes i do ive acted mean by you moren once if you have its all over now said dick theres no use in remembering it youre a good fellow dick said micky an i ought to have known it before dick was gratified by this testimony from one who for years had been his active opponent and he determined to help micky to turn over the new leaf which was to bear a very different record from the old one when micky had gone out mr rockwell said well richard i have lost my bookkeeper yes sir said dick and i cant say i am sorry i will do mr gilbert the justice to say that he understood his business but he was personally disagreeable and i never liked him now i suppose i must look out for a successor yes sir i suppose so i know a very competent bookkeeper who is intending to go into business for himself at the expiration of six months until that time i can secure his services now i have a plan in view which i think you will approve you shall at once commence the study of bookkeeping in a commercial school in the evening and during the day i will direct mr haley to employ you as his assistant i think in that way you will be able to succeed him at the end of his term dick was completely taken by surprise the thought that he so recently plying the trade of a bootblack in the public streets could rise in six months to the responsible post of a bookkeeper in a large wholesale house seemed almost incredible i should like nothing better he said his eyes sparkling with delight if you really think i could discharge the duties satisfactorily i think you could i believe you have the ability and of your fidelity i feel assured thank you sir you are very kind to me said dick gratefully i have reason to be said mr rockwell taking his hand under god it is to your courage that i owe the life of my dear boy i shall never forget it one thing more i intend michael to undertake most of your present duties such as going to the postoffice etc do you think he will answer i think so said dick he has been a rough customer but then he has never had a chance i believe in giving everybody a chance so do i said mr rockwell michael shall have his chance let us hope he will improve it there are many boys and men too who like micky maguire have never had a fair chance in life let us remember that when we judge them and not be too hasty to condemn let us consider also whether it is not in our power to give some one the chance that may redeem him that afternoon micky maguire was provided with a new suit of clothes of which he felt very proud the next morning on his way to the postoffice he fell in with his old confederate limpy jim who regarded him with a glance of the most bewildering surprise it aint you micky is it he asked cautiously surveying his old comrades neat appearance when did you come back from the island shut up about the island jim said micky do i look as if i had been there you look nobby said jim wheres your brush ive give up the blackin business said micky you have what are you going to do sell papers no said micky consequentially im in business on pearl street why said limpy jim surprised thats where that upstart ragged dick works he aint an upstart an he aint ragged said micky hes a friend of mine an if you insult him ill lam ye o my eyes ejaculated jim opening the organs of vision to a very wide extent thats the biggest joke i ever heerd of youll hear of a bigger one pretty quick said micky rolling up his sleeves and squaring off scientifically limpy jim who had a respect for mickys prowess incontinently fled surveying micky from a safe distance with a look in which surprise seemed to mingle with incredulity it may seem strange but from that time forth dick had no firmer friend than micky maguire who i am glad to say though occasionally wayward improved vastly and became a useful employй of the establishment which he had entered of course both in ability and education though in the last he gained considerably he was quite inferior to dick but he was advanced as he grew older to the position of porter where his strength stood him in good stead his pay increased also and through dicks influence he was saved from vicious habits and converted from a vagabond to a useful member of society and now almost with regret i find myself closing up the record of dicks chequered career the past with its trials is over the future expands before him a bright vista of merited success but it remains for me to justify the title of my story and show how dick acquired fame and fortune i can only hint briefly at the steps that led to them in six months at the age of seventeen dick succeeded to mr gilberts place with a salary to commence with of one thousand dollars to this an annual increase was made making his income at twentyone fourteen hundred dollars just about that time he had an opportunity to sell his uptown lots to a gentleman who had taken a great fancy to them for five times the amount he paid or five thousand dollars his savings from his salary amounted to about two thousand dollars more meanwhile mr rockwells partner mr cooper from ill health felt obliged to withdraw from business and richard to his unbounded astonishment and gratification was admitted to the post of junior partner embarking the capital he had already accumulated and receiving a corresponding share of the profits these were so large that richard was able to increase his interest yearly by investing his additional savings and three years later he felt justified in offering his hand to ida greyson whose partiality to dick had never wavered he was no longer ragged dick now but mr richard hunter junior partner in the large firm of rockwell hunter mr greyson felt that even in a worldly way dick was a good match for his daughter but he knew and valued still more his good heart and conscientious fidelity to duty and excellent principles and cheerfully gave his consent last week i read dicks marriage in the papers and rejoiced in his new hopes of happiness so dick has achieved fame and fortune the fame of an honorable and enterprising man of business and a fortune which promises to be very large but i am glad to say that dick has not been spoiled by prosperity he never forgets his humble beginnings and tries to show his sense of gods goodness by extending a helping hand to the poor and needy boys whose trials and privations he understands well from his own past experience i propose in my next story to give an account of one of these boys and shall take the opportunity to give further information in regard to some of the characters introduced in this volume this story the third in the ragged dick series will be entitled mark
