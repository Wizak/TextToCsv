 it ought to start with a girl the best ones always do she ought to be kick the lid off your coffin gorgeous she ought to be in hot water right up to her cute little ears she shouldnt quite know why or maybe she just wont say why the guys with the bent noses are after her she ought to have eyes full of mischief and not be afraid to get mischievous with the right guy thats the way it ought to be but this time it started with three darling gremlins any one of whom could sprain a set of male eyeballs at thirty paces oh im garrett aka mr right although a jealous acquaintance might lie about it im six feet two inches of handsome exmarine yeah sure my face has a few nicks and dings but those just add character they let the frantic cutie in the deep gravy know shes found a standup guy or maybe a guy too dim not to lead with his chops dean my cook and housekeeper and dooranswerer general and majordomo was out i had to answer the taptaptapping myself it was noon id been enjoying my first cup of tea i was still a little tousled wearing my charming rogue look i had treated myself to a late nap in celebration of having survived an infestation of great old ones olden gods more like worlddevouring termites than the woosie celestial accountants populating todays dream quarter what the heck real women like their fellows a little rough around the edges i put a bloodshot peeper to the peephole the day looked better right away eureka my stoop was overrun with lovelies cooked up from all the right ingredients youth beauty curve and flow and swoop to make drooling geometricians opt for a very specialized area of study and right behind them hulked several ugly thugs who provided the element of menace i flung the door wide how lucky can one guy get the blond was alyx weider she gawked like shed just seen something pop up out of its grave she was five feet four and sleek as a mink but nature hadnt shorted her on the extras garrett is that you like i was wearing a disguise you grew up she definitely grew up the redhead said stop drooling garrett that was tinnie tate professional redhead and she took her calling seriously my semi exgirlfriend youll get the floor all nasty dean will make you mop this was the first time tinnie had spoken to me in months right away she had to start in on chores you look lovely this morning darling come in come in i eyed the third woman the brunette she had done herself a cruel disservice by falling in with tinnie and alyx she wore plain clothing and had taken no special care with her grooming tinnie and alyx made her seem mousy but only at first glimpse the sharp eye could tell she was the most gorgeous of the three i have an eye like a razor i didnt recognize her tinnie said youre really working at the bachelor business arent you huh usually im armed with a rapier wit well actually a gladius sort of wit but when tinnie comes around my brain curdles you look like death on a stick garrett slightly warmed over tinnie has a way with words like the guy at the end of the chute at the slaughterhouse has a way with tools thats my honey i told the crowd i backed into the house aint she precious you got a honey garrett i dont think her name is tinnie tate unless theres more than one of us awk i said stricken impossible youre unique did you break a leg or forget the way to my house or forget how to write she had me the slickest stoat that ever slank couldnt have weaseled out of this one id done one of those things guys do that they dont know theyre doing when they do them and still dont know what they did after theyre done then id had the brassbottomed gall not to rush right over with a public apology lately i have begun to suspect that standing on principle is a strategic error of the first water i think you didnt come here to bicker in front of your friends i showed her a lot of shiny teeth she showed me a scowl that told me once again i had everything all wrong but she was going to let it slide for the moment this visit was no surprise except in its timing the ladies had been around to see me before while i was otherwise preoccupied saving the world alyxs daddy had problems she thought i could unravel them tinnie knows the hours i keep bless her sadistic little heart old man weider owns the biggest brewery empire in tunfaire thats because the clever rascal brews the best brew the first time he hired me i saved him from an inside theft ring that was devouring his business like a raging cancer hes had me on retainer ever since he wants me to work for him fulltime im not interested in a real job when youre your own boss you dont have to please anybody but yourself though that arrangement doesnt leave much room to pass the blame in exchange for my retainer i make frequent surprise visits to the brewery random appearances make it difficult for organized villainy to take root again in the old days alyx was a scrawny kid barely threatening to become a heartbreaker her older sister kittyjo was a lot more interesting time trudges on sometimes it plays a pretty melody i tried again lets not argue tinnie i cant possibly win if you know that how come i didnt say you were right damn i knew id blown it before i finished saying it garrett i quiver me heart a voice squawked feast yer glims mates it must be heaven where do we start is that the infamous parrot the new girl asked alyx and tinnie glowered into the small front room they put enough kick into it to freeze water and crack glass the room opens off the hall to the right just inside the front door i hadnt remembered to close up before admitting the ladies thats mr big yes trash beak champion of the universe ignore him otherwise hell get excited excited hes restraining himself right now tinnie observed garrett calls him the goddamn parrot how did she know that the feathered mosquito didnt arrive till after her famous parting tizzy of course her effort to twist my mind around till the last sensejuice leaked out didnt mean that she didnt see dean and dean thinks tinnie is the next best thing to immortality hes her enthusiastic mole in the garden of my life i said id call him kitty food if i could wring his neck without offending the guy who gave him to me someday ill get even with morley but its going to be tough hes kind of neat alyx decided changing her mind on the fly but i wouldnt take him to visit my aunt claire come here sugar the bird squawked awk check them hooters i am in love i muttered the only goddamn bird in the world with a vocabulary and he uses it up being obnoxious before you pop trying to find a safe way to ask tinnie told me her finest taunting smile prancing across her lovely lips while she leaned against me and looked up with total greeneyed innocence this is nicks giorgi nicks for nicholas hi gorgeous nicks for nicholas whoops that slip earned me a pinch the goddamn parrot sang the praises of alyx weider in language that would embarrass stevedores but it was hard to fault his eye tinnie kept looking up and pinching the devil in her eyes guess what lover shes taken lucky guy mr big will be devastated that foulbeaked jungle buzzard had spied nicks now nicks winked at me she had an incredible smile and eyes as blue as a cloudless sky she said im only engaged garrett im not dead alyx whistled nicks tinnie laughed but her eyes narrowed wickedly this looked like a good time to run down the street and see if dean needed help with the groceries nicks said whoops that didnt come out right are you the garrett tinnie brags about all the time last time i checked that was still the name im not sure about the brag part that earned me a fingernail in the ribs from the nearest beautiful redhead who observed its going to be mud if youre not careful just dont put me in the middle of anything darling alyx said nicks is just being nicks she cant help it i said huh nicks flirts shes been doing it since we were seven she cant help it she doesnt mean it she doesnt realize shes sending comeon signals nicks for heavens sake you can get in real trouble out here in the world alyx was right theres always trouble if a woman shows shes willing when shes not i asked did i miss something did you spend your whole life in a harem nicks that isnt a karentine thing but the rich do have strange ways alyx had been incredibly sheltered as a child practically the goddamn parrot flapped over settled on her wrist like a falcon in a clown suit my father has strong ideas about saving me from the world the weiders and a few other families are the only people ive ever met till recently alyx said shes staying with us now daddy isnt the big ogre he used to be he never was with his baby alyx always got anything she wanted with just a cute pout nicks used a finger to stroke the top of the jungle chickens head the little monster went along enthusiastically he tilted his head back so she could get a finger under his chin id never seen him take to anyone so wholeheartedly i looked to alyx i didnt get anything what was she doing out of the family fortress herself old man weider must be losing his grip hell i knew that already didnt i wasnt that why the toothsome threesome had come if max was on top of everything he wouldnt need help and his baby wouldnt be out looking for it i shrugged ill find out what i need to know as we go lets visit his nibs get comfortable and talk about it tinnie stepped back she glared at me shouldnt you get dressed first my gal tinnie always looking out for my best interest not a bad idea sweetheart though i was perfectly happy dressed the way i was so what if i was a little rumpled that was part of my rough charm be right back my lovelies if you want tea or anything youll have to help yourselves deans out shopping tinnie you know where everything is sneaky garrett he will get fresh tea brewed by the very viragos who think they ve got him in a clean pin i trotted upstairs before tinnie caught on i descended the stairway wearing my clotheshorse best only to discover skinny old dean newly returned he wrinkled his bony nose shook his bony head proceeded into the kitchen alyxs blue eyes twinkled you dont waste much time picking out your clothes do you tinnie was in the kitchen dean brightened right up miss tate this is a pleasant surprise may i observe that you are looking particularly lovely today mr creech you rogue of course you may somebody ought to notice let me help you with that i leaned into the kitchen damn the old boy was being victimized by a hugging redhead life aint fair not even a little me she pokes and pinches a crackling sense of amused anticipation grew around me somehow the ladies had both wakened my partner and put him in a good mood that filled me with foreboding eclipses and planetary conjunctions are less common than the dead man awakening in a good mood when the house is infested with females i took a deep breath here we went again i led the ladies into the dead mans room which takes up most of the leftside ground floor of my house excepting the pantries off the kitchen the cuties made themselves right at home without asking they dragged chairs out of my office which is an ambitious closet across the hall from the dead mans room tinnie perched on the guests chair nicks claimed the comfortable one that belongs behind my desk i would cherish the warmth forever meantime alyx decorated the chair i usually use when im in with the dead man the goddamn parrot still perched on nicks hand nibbling bits of something she offered him he cooed like a goddamned turtledove you might reserve that admiration for miss tate if you were a gentleman that was my partner shoving unwanted advice directly into my head but im not shes told me so lots of times i glared alyx and nicks smiled as though enjoying a private joke maybe old bones had shared his remarks with the three heartstoppers not just me perhaps i blushed slightly tinnie sure grinned the dead man resides in a huge wooden chair at the heart of the biggest room in the house usually the room isnt lighted in his present state he doesnt need light but the ladies did and had brought lamps in from other rooms they shouldnt have bothered the dead man isnt pretty thats partly because he isnt really a man he hails from a rare species called loghyr who resemble humans only vaguely he goes four hundred plus pounds though the vermin keep nibbling off bits so hes probably dropped a few hes uglier than your sisters last husband and has a snoot like an elephant it hangs about fourteen inches long ive never seen a live loghyr so dont know how they use that he was called the dead man when i met him ages ago one of those clever street names picked up on account of he has been dead for four hundred years somebody stuck a knife in him way back when probably while he was taking one of his sixmonth siestas hes never bothered to explain but he is loghyr and loghyr do nothing hastily they especially dont get into a rush about giving up the ghost i hear four hundred years is far from a record stall nobody knows much about the loghyr the dead man will babble on for weeks without dropping a hint himself i leaned against a set of shelves loaded with souvenirs from old cases and knickknacks the dead man likes to grab with a thought and send swooping around if he feels that will rattle a visitor already distressed by his less than appetizing appearance could you not have selected clothing less threadbare in business it is important to present a businesslike appearance him too steel yourself garrett its teak on tommy tucker time with you in the coveted role of tommy in the brownbottomed slit trench thats how well justify my fee fee money gold and silver and copper that stuff we use to buy beans for me and dean and keep the leaky roof from leaking on your head you recall your days in that ruin on wizards reach with the roof halfgone and the snow blowing in the women looked at me weirdly which meant that they were getting only my half of the conversation but their imaginations were perking of course you must maintain a businesslike approach if not a businesslike appearance but perhaps you have overlooked the fact that we have a retainer arrangement with mr weider and are therefore expected to provide our services against fees already paid you got a point the weider retainer had seen me through numerous dry spells hey alyx before we worry about anything else are you here for your dad or you im not sure he didnt send me but he asked manvil if they should think about calling you in this thing will affect the brewery he mightve sent me if it ever occurred to him that a daughter could do something productive i think he hasnt sent for you just because hes embarrassed to admit that he cant handle everything himself hes still hoping he can get by without you but i think its been too late for that for days i didnt have a clue what it was all about yet i glanced at nicks alyx told me nicks is in it because my brother is in it and theyre engaged and shes worried what a cruel world it is where a beauty like nicks wastes herself on a creature like ty weider though nicks did not appear excited by her impending nuptials she is not but she does not have the heart to disappoint two sets of parents who have had this alliance planned for twenty years she has found ways to delay it several times now her time has run out and tinnie shes my friend garrett shes just here to lend emotional support a wise man would not now insist on subjecting all things to a rigorous scrutiny garrett i have lived with his nibs so long that even his obscurantisms and obfuscations have begun to make sense this time he was hanging a codicil on the rule about not looking too closely at politics sausage manufacture or the teeth of gift horses tinnie was here i should enjoy that not go picking the scabs off sores all right i still dont have a clue start at the beginning and tell me everything alyx even if it doesnt seem important okay its the call i sighed it would be already i knew i wasnt going to like any of this i asked what are they doing strongarm stuff extortion tinnie says you call it protection i glanced at the professional redhead so silent of late at the moment she wasnt into her favorite role deeply they tried it with my uncle too she smiled nastily i worked for willard tate once he was a tough old buzzard with a herd of relatives willing to do whatever he told them he wouldnt be threatened he sent them packing tinnie grinned you know uncle willard of course he did dared them to come back too that might not have been too bright some human rights gangs are pretty wicked alyx no both of you was it the call specifically the call as in call to arms is marengo north englishs gang and is the biggest loudest best financed and most vigorously political of the war veterans groups the call includes a lot of wealthy powerful men unhappy with the direction karenta is drifting as far as i knew the call only raised funds by donation but they might extend their reach if rowdier more radical groups began to attract more recruits north english has a big ego and a personal agenda thats never been clear alyx said yeah no i dont know they talked to ty he claimed he knew some of them he said they told him welders has to contribute five percent of gross receipts to the cause and well have to get rid of any employees who arent human ty is alyxs brother one of three all older than she is two of those three didnt make it back from the cantard in one piece the other one didnt make it back at all i dont like ty weider though for no concrete reason maybe its his relentless bitterness though he has a right to be bitter he gave up a leg for karenta the kingdom hasnt given him much in return ty is not unique far from it just look down any street but he belongs to a family with wealth and influence why would they take a run at ty instead of your dad daddy doesnt spend much time with the business anymore momma is lots sicker he stays with her he only goes to the brewery maybe every other day and then mostly he only stays for a little while talking to people hes known a long time so ty is more likely to bump into the public i glanced at the dead man was he mining the unspoken side of this he didnt send me a clue that suggested alyx was being as forthright as she knew how yes but mr heldermach and mr klees are still in charge of course because ty weider is no brewmaster and not much of an executive because nobody at the brewery likes ty because heldermach and klees are more than weider employees they are more nearly junior partners their investment in the brewery is skill and knowledge both operated their own breweries before consolidating with weider the weider empire isnt just the big brewery downtown its a combine of smaller places scattered throughout the city most were struggling when weider took over and rooted out the inefficiencies and bad brewing policies that kept them from prospering the best brewmasters and best recipes stayed on mr heldermach and mr klees were there when the call talked to ty they were i glanced at the dead man he did not contradict alyx surprise surprise the moment shed mentioned ty as interlocuter i set a new conclusionjumping distance record figuring ty for trying to scam his own dad im convinced ty was at least marginally involved in the skimming operation whose breakup endeared me to old man weider back when that involved barrels of beer vanishing into thin air and becoming pure profit for those enterprising characters who used that method to reduce overhead in the tavern business i spent months posing as a worker to unearth what i had i never nailed ty what evidence i did find was all circumstantial and could have been explained away as easily by stupidity and gullibility as by evil intent i never mentioned him to his father which maybe was one of the services weider had expected whatever tys role i closed the brewerys bleeding belly wound without any scandal and ive kept the stitches from tearing loose again for which the old man has been more than necessarily grateful hes kept me on that retainer ever since and even sends the occasional lonely keg of reserve dark over to spend the holidays though the dead man would have explored any thoughts in the area already i asked what do you think about ty alex i try to make allowances we all do because of his leg she wouldnt look me in the eye but hmmm i hear a but a reservation alyx glanced at nicks she looked like she thought she had said too much already i glared at the dead man bingo she is concerned about miss nicholas feelings garrett huh why i blurted the dead man seemed amused he is whenever i stick my foot into my mouth though i hadnt gotten a good taste of dirty old leather yet here miss weider conceals a considerable affection for her brother although she does understand why others find him unlikable she has an even stronger regard for miss nicholas they have been friends from childhood miss weider will not knowingly cause her pain for her part miss nicholas does not care to hear evil of her fiancé because she plans to accept this marriage despite having no desire to do so she will not disappoint the expectations of so many she consoles herself with the certain knowledge that ty weider although no prince charming stands to be one of the richest men in tunfaire and the wait may not be protracted if there is substance to the cluster of fears infesting miss weiders head i glanced at nicks remembered ty money sure can get the blood moving too tinnie seemed to be getting sour i was too introspective to suit her today that was a problem most days as far as she was concerned all right alyx i said the call made a threat they dont have a history of that but there is a first time for every extortionist what do you want me to do about it i want you to stop them but i dont think you could do that by yourself so i dont really know i can be pretty persuasive usually with morley dotes and saucerhead tharpe helping me drive my points home alyx didnt hear me she was too busy talking i guess if theres anything i really need its for you to watch out for dad he was pretty blunt in public when he heard about the demands somebody might want to make him an example exactly tinnie said the men who came to our compound did claim to be from the call the tate clan manufactures footwear they got rich making combat boots during the war but i dont think they really were they were too nervous the dead man sent i have compared the recollections of miss weider and miss tate and must submit the possibility that we have afoot several bold operators moving in where they believe they can score quickly by exploiting fear and hatred theres nothing so holy some scroat wont try to turn a few marks on it somebodys trying to scam the rich theyll have to stay way ahead of marengo north english then and i kept right on having trouble getting my mind around the notion that a honey like nicks would even talk to ty weider maybe id just always caught ty at bad times maybe he wasnt as hopeless as i thought have you done anything i asked alyx besides coming back here till you caught up with me did you talk it over with your dad or ty or manvil have they done anything i didnt discuss it with them daddy would say it wasnt proper for a lady to take an interest but if i went to anybody hed want me to go to you ty though will get mad when he finds out he doesnt want outsiders around hes argued with dad about you big surprise but tys likes and dislikes never were high on my list of concerns think hed cut off my supply of dark nobody got it not even the dead man apparently so much for a new career in comedy ladies you must excuse garrett the presence of so much loveliness in such tight quarters has disoriented him completely sarky bastard nicks jumped at the dead mans first touch but settled down quickly she had been forewarned tinnie and alyx showed the nonchalance of old hands his nibs continued and i cannot say i blame him this once i am overwhelmed myself and i was dead ages before any of you were born what a sweettalker thank you old bones maybe if i shut my eyes and pretend im not a robust hearty virile young man whose special lady has shunned him mercilessly you might consider supplying shovels hightop boots and nose plugs garrett how sharper than a serpents tooth my eyes are sealed my breathing is almost normal nicks asked is he always like this tinnie hes pretty tame right now wait till he wakes up not a tooth teeth i grumbled alyx did your dad take this seriously hes worried hes been asking our employees what they think about the call hes decided we wont hire anybody but veterans he never had but that wouldnt satisfy the call although most human males are veterans not all veterans are human and weider never made a distinction he wouldnt now he protects his employees like a shewolf protects her young most give him complete loyalty in return me i even drink his beer but there are always a rotten few who slip through any screen or who are brought in by a big wormy apple already loafing in the barrel the ladies babbled on but i got nothing out of them i turned to the dead man he sent they are frightened time is passing nothing has been done to disarm or appease the call apparently there is a deadline unknown even to miss alyx miss alyx now huh i watched the goddamn parrot nibble out of nicks fingers you want that critter nicks take him call him my wedding present alyx broke into laughter so maybe im not a complete bust as a comic but it would help to know why they laugh sorry alyx said but i had this picture of mr big kibbitzing ty and nicks on their wedding night that would be something unless they tied the bird into a gunnysack and hung the sack out a window i glanced at nicks she wasnt smiling she looked like a young lady who didnt believe in her future at all i couldnt disagree with her but i had that deep prejudice against ty weider she is an excellent actress garrett perhaps inside as well as out perhaps able to fool even herself even i see something different each time i look at her i have to remind myself to recognize the surface interesting save your interest for miss tate that was my plan stick to it this matter will become complicated enough without adding the machinations of women scorned he does not have a high estimation of the fairer species tinnie i noted seemed to be daydreaming which meant she was communing with the dead man he can do that he has several distinct minds and can go several directions at once i asked alyx could there be trouble on the shop floor theres always sympathy for the call anywhere you go i doubt they cheer the call much in ogre town or dwarf fort or the elven neighborhoods i havent seen many ratmen or pixies carrying banners in the calls parades well they wouldnt would they maybe there was some rightsist sympathy right there from the sounds of it somebody nonhuman was being real unsympathetic to human rights out front right now the neighborhood attracts more than its share of political debates alyx the guys who brought you they going to hang around some situations cant be managed with cute and beautiful a wiggle and a giggle they went to lunch theyre supposed to wait out front afterward good its starting to sound excitable out there the dead man evidently wasnt interested in what was going on he didnt bother to report we could stay till it quiets down alyx winked i couldnt stand the heat im about to melt down into a puddle of tallow now garrett garrett ah tinnie me love my hottest of flames youre awake after all tinnie gave alyx a look of exasperation how was she going to get me trained if even her friends encouraged my delinquencies nicks stayed out of it she concentrated on the goddamn parrot except that when i glanced at her she winked too help they do it just to watch you crackle and fry like bacon left too long in too hot a pan the ladies departed headed not for the brewery but tinnies family compound the tates had to be hurting the recent outbreak of peace had to be terrible for business thats the trouble when some darn war goes on too long life begins to revolve around it we live and die by it at home as much as do the soldiers on the battlefields now that the fighting is over except for moppingup exercises against the last of glory mooncalleds raggedyass republican partisans regiments are demobilizing as fast as the navy can haul them home these days many jobs belong to nonhumans because we humans went off to war and only a fraction returned todays soldiers come home to find theres nothing to come home to the door closed behind those three luscious behinds i returned to the dead mans room and settled into my own chair the seat was still warm a clash of perfumes hung in the air i asked whats your boy glory mooncalled up to years ago mooncalled entered the war as a mercenary captain on the venageti side though a successful campaigner he failed to have been born into the ruling clique of sorcerers and nobles and so was treated badly he resented that so much he changed sides he spent the next decade embarrassing and picking off the men who had injured his pride his treatment by karentas overlords was not much better he got paid on time but received few honors however dramatic his victories he defected again this time he collected the tribes of the cantard under the banner of a republic that rejected both karentine and venageti territorial claims he provided spankings to armies from both kingdoms but fate wasnt kind karenta got some breaks the venageti collapsed karentine forces began exterminating the republicans the peoples of the cantard immediately began migrating into karenta and especially to tunfaire where their presence only adds to the social stress something i stumbled over during a recent case made me suspect that mooncalled himself was now in tunfaire the dead man seemed disgruntled in all likelihood he is fomenting disorder under the illusion that his past popularity still assures him support amongst the lower classes you seem disappointed perhaps heroes are best kept at arms length up close their flaws are too easily seen the goddamn parrot had taken station on his shoulder nicks fault shed put him there i hadnt been able to talk her into taking the flashy little vulture with her the bird started to relieve himself he ended in a tangle amongst the mementos on the dead mans knickknack shelves he was so startled he could hardly squawk in parrotese he got his feet under him shook his head took a tentative step fell off the shelf and smacked into the floor if that thing fails to survive please extend my deepest condolences to mr dotes wow what a great idea why didnt i think of it before im slow but im brilliant ill tear him apart in here and blame it all on you ill have morley come over see all the feathers and parrot shit hell just shake his head and forget it he wont go getting into a feud with you very creative try it and i will hang you by your bootlaces from the rooftree that bird is far too valuable even to joke about valuable you cant even eat those damned things unless youre so hungry you already ate up all the snakes and buzzards and crows i mean valuable as a communications tool not to me silence i was only going to we are about to have company strangers receive them in your office they do not need to be made aware of my existence dean beat me to the front door but got a silent warning from the dead man he peeped through the peephole backed off frowning whats wrong i dont like the looks of those two he retreated to the dead mans room the goddamn parrot flapped into the hall when he opened the door it landed on my shoulder argh i started to swat him dean came out of the dead mans room lugging the chairs back to my office easy on the bird garrett dean when you finish shut the door to this room do not open it again while those people are in this house put a kettle on too for hospitalitys sake dean gave me the look that asked what i thought he should do in his spare time the pounding resumed it had started polite now it seemed impatient i used the peephole myself do i really need to talk to these guys the two men on the stoop looked just like the guy dean wanted me to be when i grew up it might be of value or instructive to who that would be whom garrett im beginning to get it already i grumbled starting in on deans battery of latches he was done moving furniture the dead man would stir the sludge inside their pretty gourds ever so discreetly while i sat through some kind of sales pitch those two were selling something they were so squeakyclean and well groomed that i feared their scam would be religion id have trouble staying polite if they were godshouters ive suffered an overdose of religion lately i changed my mind as soon as the door opened before anybody cracked a word the erect postures and humorless mouths said they were selling a true belief that had nothing to do with pie in the sky by and by both were five feet six and unreasonably handsome one had blond hair and blue eyes i wish i could report that the other had blue hair and blond eyes but he didnt he was a pretty hunk of brown hair and blue eyes neither had visible scars or tattoos clerks instinct told me mr garrett the blond asked he had perfect teeth how often do you see good teeth never even tinnie has an incisor that laps its neighbor guilty maybe depends on what you want nobody smiled the brunette said a friend gave us your name said you would be a good man to see said as you were a bona fide war hero i could throw bricks with my eyes closed and hit a bona fide war hero eight tries out of ten anybody who made it home is a hero which free company are you guys with they wore clothing as though they were headed for the parade ground like appearance wasnt just part of being a soldier it was the whole thing clerks do not antagonize them simply for the sake of deflating their pomposity garrett i need a new partner this one knows me too well they seemed surprised how did you im a trained detective selfeducated from a very short syllabus its obvious the brunette almost whined these would be guys whose selfimage included no whinery but who would whine a lot and call it something else in their own minds they were big hairyassed hemen clerks when youre headed wherever you go when you leave compare yourselves to everybody else to human male people anyway that might have the unfortunate side effect of encouraging their feelings of superiority but they might see what i meant you cant be a secret agent if youre wearing a sign they exchanged baffled looks they were lost pretty but not bright the blond asked may we come in by all means i stepped aside we can talk in my office second door to your left be hospitable garrett either one of you guys want a parrot garrett both men had wrinkled their noses when first they saw me and my bird everybody was a clothes critic nowadays why i was decent i was even clean these guys looked around like they expected the place to be a dump they seemed pleasantly disappointed that it wasnt dean does good work we trooped into the closet i call an office i told them my man dean will bring tea in a minute they eyed me uncertainly how could i know my office is less ordered than the hallway i dont let dean loose in there and behind my desk hangs a painting that dean hates at first you just see a pretty woman running from a brooding darkness but as you stare at the painting more and more of that darkness reaches out to you the artist who created it had been possessed by a talent so fierce that it amounted to sorcery it drove him mad he put everything into this painting including his insanity it was personal at one time it told a whole story and indicted a villain it doesnt have a tenth its original charge now but still retains an immense impact it exudes terror thats eleanor i said she died before i was born but she helped me crack a case she did a lot more the portrait once belonged to the man who murdered eleanor hes dead now too he doesnt need the painting anymore i do eleanor makes a better sounding board than dean the dead man or the goddamn parrot shes seldom judgmental and she never gives me any lip blondie said we understand youre often involved in unusual affairs im a lightning rod for weird stuff thanks dean the big tray carried the right number of cups cookies and muffins and a steaming pot of tea the boys exchanged glances nervous under eleanors piercing gaze and deans stern disapproval dean left i poured and asked what can i do for you guys really they exchanged glances again look boys im working hard here the goddamn parrot squawked in my ear if you just need a place to get in out of the rain i recommend mrs cardonlos rooming house up the street on the other awk queen bitch queen bitch its not raining literalminded clerks stow it bird i growled at the goddamn parrot my visitors exchanged looks again this could go on all day the blond said i apologize mr garrett we were cautioned that we might find you unconventional and should try to become comfortable with that before proceeding puny penis the parrot squawked i snarled youre going into the sack again you animated feather duster the brunette smiled insincerely is that ventriloquism when i was little i had an uncle who could why does everybody ask that no this devilspawn of a sevencolor jungle pigeon does it all on his own hes got a vocabulary bigger than yours or mine and every word is foul fowl maybe there was sorcery done him sometime i dont know he was a gift i cant seem to get rid of him pencil dick now nobody was smiling again i thought about choking the dead man only what good would that do strengthen my grip the blond said my name is carter stockwell so we were going to do business after all im not surprised and you trace wendover of course hello carter and trace sure you dont want a talking parrot cheap make a great holiday gift for the kids garrett once again i must caution you against antagonizing these men no all right i made my sales pitch your loss you guys make yours or go away we were told you might be illmannered that was the darker one trace carter said our mission is to interest you in contributing to our cause right now ive got about six copper sceats to clink together the only cause im going to contribute to is the garrett household supper fund we dont want money please give us a chance to talk youve been here ten minutes you havent said anything yet youre right we are free company men black dragon valsung carter watched for my reaction whats that i asked trace countered you dont know the dragons sorry heeding the dead mans advice i forebore remarks that might betray my feelings about those quasimilitary gangs called free companies there are so many of them that not having heard of a particular one was no big deal our leader is colonel valsung norton valsung i got intent looks from both pretty boys i shrugged doesnt ring a bell guys he must have been army carter began to puff up hed caught the slight trace though was made of sterner stuff yes mr garrett colonel valsung was army he commanded the black dragon brigade trace tossed him a warning look but he continued you would be impressed if you were to review his record no doubt war does tend to expose men for what they really are wouldnt be a relative would he my uncle the ventriloquist i recall several colonels who were masters at putting words into other peoples mouths no mr garrett not that uncle were getting somewhere now we have a colonel who isnt a ventriloquist what does your uncle the nonventriloquist want with me your peculiar combination of talents and expertise both from your service and your career since i didnt get it you need a force recon guy with experience ducking vampires and sorcerers and tracking wayward wives to help you beat up old dwarves and crippled ratmen garrett both of my visitors turned red but carter was out in front because hed gotten a head start trace said mr garrett we do not roam the streets assaulting people we are a veterans mutual assistance brotherhood not a street gang the other day a veteran whod done five fiveyear hitches three in the cantard was almost beaten to death right outside hed won eight decorations including the imperial star with swords and oak leaves in one battle he lost half of his left arm and most of that side of his face in a blast from a witch ward hes in the bledsoe now he probably wont get out alive those butchers wont pay any attention to him he doesnt have any money go down there and mutually assist him his name is brate trueblood but the bledsoe is a charity hospital isnt it you didnt grow up in tunfaire did you in this town charity is available only to those who can pay for it no thats ugly trace seemed genuinely touched carter obviously didnt care but was cooling down thats exactly why we have to band together but theres a problem trace brate was a real hero and as good a soldier as ever soldiered unfortunately he made one really huge stupid mistake my visitors looked at me expectantly garrett please stop now the dead man seemed almost to despair he was so stupid he picked an ogre for one of his grandparents it took them a while to catch on i watched their eyes narrow and go shifty as they figured it out carter was slowest but he was the first to stand up he told me you have the wrong idea and trace were wasting our time here youre not wasting your time carter i said i just want you to understand that nothing is blackandwhite i tried to hold traces eye he seemed to be mulling my parable what did you guys do down there you were clerks right your uncle got you some safe assignment right trace carter you had an angel too so who do you suppose did more to defend and preserve the karentine crown you guys or my ugly quadroon carter said you really dont know whats happening do you and that actually seemed to please him i left my chair moved to the office doorway you arent wasting your time guys im right behind you i just need to know how to reconcile the brate truebloods trace started to say something carter squeezed his arm in moments those earnest young men were back in the street carter i was convinced would ignore my story which was true only in a moral sense anyway there really is a brate trueblood but he was just a small hero and the thugs who jumped him didnt put him in the hospital ogre blood made him hard to hurt but these two creeps did want brate in the bledsoe or worse i might have done the devils work with trace though he looked like a young man who might on occasion actually have a thought i whistled as i bolted the door blissful in my ignorance that was not one of your more salubrious performances garrett that flake of moral hubris may come back to haunt you come on theyre jerks especially the blond one their minds did not reflect the prejudice you expect but such jerks are quite common today they are aggrieved they need targets for their frustration those two seemed to be fundamentally good men yet yet what they had no depth even a mind as dim as saucerhead thorpes has its deeps no kidding theyre a couple of pretty boys who never worked a day not shallow garrett not that way just all surface inside humans are filled with turmoil continuous dark currents collide and roil down deep where you do not see them and do not know them always even in mr thorpe or miss winger but those two had nothing beneath the fanatic surface and that fanaticism was not as narrow and blind as is common they grasped your trueblood parable they seemed unable to deal with it only because doing so would not have been in character well hed lost me except for the part about being all surface that dont surprise me i know those guys i ve seen a lot of them they just give up everything and let somebody else do their thinking life is easier that way perhaps but i have a strong intuition that we would have been better served had you held them here whilst i milked them rather than driving them away milked them i didnt hear a moo from either one intentional obtuseness seldom finds a complimentary acute observation you should have probed them for information you should have held them while i wormed in under their surfaces he refused to let me exasperate him more than i had already their particular free company may finance itself by extorting funds in the name of the call but we are in no position to winkle that out now are we i hate it when hes right and he was right i let my emotions take over i hadnt thought of those two in relation to the weider problem yet they could have had that in mind one of their cronies might have noticed the girls coming to my place your problem far too often garrett huh you do not think you emote you act on that emotion in preference to reason however there was nothing in their minds to tie them in to the weider matter which of course is no guarantee that those who sent them are equally innocent aha they knew about you those two did not they knew nothing about you either except what they had been told i believe you muffed this one garrett i dont know about that they probably wanted me to work but i sighed he really was right and i definitely hate that i hear about it forever i think ill just go over to the brewery and yes you should do that but not right away go later after the night crew comes in they will be the younger men who have the cantard more freshly in mind if there are human rights activists there they are most likely to be found among the younger workers what could i say when hes right hes right and he has been right a little too often lately all right whatre you going to suggest instead there would be something see captain block ask him about the call let fall some gentle intimation of the threat to mr weider captain westman block runs the guard tunfaires halfass police force the guard is lame but more effective than the predecessor from which it evolved the watch which existed primarily to absorb bribes to stay out of the way the watch still exists but only as a fire brigade the reason the guard works is a little guy who is part dwarf a touch of several other things and maybe an eighth human his name is relway hes the ugliest man ive ever met hes obsessed with law and order his conversations all revolve around his new order by which he means the absolute rule of law when i met him on a rainy night not that long ago he was a volunteer auxiliary helping blocks tiny seriouscrimes section of the watch i said something unpleasant to relway that night he assured me that i ought to be less unpleasant because he was going to be an important fellow before long his powers of prophecy were excellent prince rupert created the guard and installed westman block as its chief then block sanctioned relway and relway immediately put together a powerful and nasty secret police force consisting of people who thought his way offenders have been known to just vanish once they attract the notice of relways section probably no more than a thousand people know the section exists he doesnt blow his own horn and id bet there arent more than a dozen people who can identify relway by sight im one of them sometimes that makes me nervous that all rips through my mind whenever anyone mentions block i get the exact feeling relway wants everybody to feel that somebody is watching old man weider is one of tunfaires leading subjects hes a commoner but is rich and powerful and influential he has friends in high places who are real friends simply because he is the kind of man he is block would take an extra step to protect him relway being what he is might take a few steps more if the call was involved maybe thats all i really need to do get the guard on the case block has more resources there is more going on why am i not surprised to hear that because you are at last becoming somewhat adept at reading people though not yet at a conscious level at that same shadow level both miss weider and miss nicholas fear that ty weider was not the recipient of the threat but its source i dont like the guy but i could be wrong about him nicks thinks hes got something going miss nicholas is torn in many directions i feel for that child she does indeed think some good things though she has known ty weider as long as she has known miss alyx she makes allowances because she knew the ty weider who existed before the ty weider who returned from the cantard missing a leg have lunch then see captain block yes mom dumb move garrett the dead man took the mental muzzle off the goddamn parrot that freaking jungle chicken just stores it up when hes under control it gushed blocks headquarters were inside the alkhar tunfaires city prison handy what with criminals being rounded up in gaggles lately the place is huge stark cold ugly and badly in need of maintenance its a wonder prisoners dont escape by walking through the walls or by powdering the rusty bars in the infrequent windows ages ago some hill family fattened up by cutting corners on construction particularly in the choice of stone instead of a good karentine limestone available from quarries within a days barge travel somebody had supplied a soft snotty yellowgreen stone that sucks up crud from the air darkens streaks then flakes leaving the exterior acned the streets alongside the alkhar always boast a layer of detritus the mortar is in worse shape than the stone luckily the walls are real thick i stopped stunned when i rounded a corner and saw the prison scaffolding was up some tuckpointing was under way some chemical cleansing was restoring the youth of the stone even clean that stone was buttugly how were they financing the facelift till recently tunfaire jailed hardly anybody so no provision had been made to help maintain the seldomused prison theyd had to evict squatters when block moved in captain block not only was in he was willing to see me immediately youre a bureaucrat now block even if you havent opened your eyes for fifteen years youre supposed to be too busy to see somebody without an appointment youll set a precedent you really live here in jail im single i dont need much room he seemed a little sad and a lot weary he had shown fair political acumen getting the guard created but perhaps didnt have the moral stamina to keep diverting frequent attempts to scuttle the rule of law you look more relaxed these days blocks quarters definitely didnt match his standing in the community neither did his dress he should have been decked out like an admiral with two hundred years of service but he just didnt care block told me that business with the serialkiller spell that kept recasting itself made the prince love me im almost untouchable almost my cynical side says thats because nobody else wants the job it certainly is thankless but business is good new villains jump up as fast as we harvest the old ones theyre like the dragons teeth in that old myth im endlessly amazed that so many of them survived the war i shrugged i didnt know the one about the dragons teeth block is a compact thin man with short brown hair quickly going gray he needed a shave hed make a fair spy because there was nothing remarkable about him you wouldnt notice him unless he yelled in your face when i first met him at a time when the law was honored more in the taking of bribes than actual enforcement hed had a mouth as filthy as the goddamn parrots and all the manners of a starving snake i wasnt sure i liked the new improved mannered and unantagonistic dedicated block better than the angry old one i told him in the old days you never seemed like the dedicated type you only did what you had to to get by a shadow brushed his features i got religion garrett huh i let relway talk me into putting him on fulltime big mistake his conviction infects everybody around him it does given his head relway will exterminate the concept of crime by the end of the year hes a man with a holy mission hes scary so whats up going to collect favors owed not entirely i want to ask about the call and i want to talk about max weider somebodys trying to squeeze him i betrayed tradition and fed him all the details he was suspicious why tell me i would have been suspicious too in the past id kept him in the dark on principle my partner insisted and i owe weider it would be handy if somebody official was watching if something happened what could happen with these rightsists anything no shit you heard about those people burning up on the north side i heard i didnt pay attention ive been busy theyre people with no connection to each other drunks and noaccounts who couldnt make an enemy on a bet but theyve been burning up youre pulling my leg no its happened six times its got to be sorcery relway wants it to connect with the rights business but i dont see it i cant see some teetotaling sorceress setting drunks on fire either though you think it would be a woman if it was a teetotaller you know any men dead set against spirits only one and i have to live with him so what about it is the call moving into the rackets i havent heard that jirek the door opened a creature limped in he wasnt human not much anyway there was a little of everything in him but the three main ingredients appeared to be ogre troll and ugly the whole was complicated by birth defects and wounds jirek moved sort of sideways stiffly and bent like his back hurt all the time jirek was injured in the ambush at council wells a veteran then yet not human another one of those inconvenient complications id pointed out to carter and trace some of our biggest heroes arent even human council wells one of our great victories i observed do i detect the odor of sarcasm council wells was supposed to have been a preliminary peace conference the karentine army concealed commando forces in the surrounding desert those patriots murdered the venageti delegates in their sleep another of those little triumphs that when totalled helped karenta win the war me sarcastic the gods forfend jireks great knobbly green mess of a face twisted and wriggled into a grotesque smile then he guffawed his breath could gag a maggot but he had a sense of humor block told him relway should be in his cell tell him i need him jirek told me good joke then left what was that i asked jirek a unique which was slang for a breed who had extremely complicated antecedents he saved my ass a couple times in the cantard he was a perfect soldier too dumb to question authority just did what he was told and was one bad boy in a fight i just might change my mind about you dont brag about it people might wonder why it took so long to rid yourself of the old clogged one and i thought i was developing a new relationship with the minions of the law relway arrived a little guy he sort of oozed into blocks cell no knock like a shadow that didnt want to be noticed relway is another unique a completely improbable mixture his interior landscape is a strange strange land too he has a chip on his shoulder big enough to provide lumber for four houses hes so far into law and order that he considers himself above any law that might restrain his efforts to crush crime now his auxiliaries and spies and midnight avengers are everywhere it shouldnt be long till his name becomes one of the most feared in tunfaire relway the man is almost unknown i know him only because chance put me in the right place back when he nodded garrett you been keeping well his voice was hoarse cracking only half there im fine you pick up a cold the weathers been strange i hear you might know something about that me i was out there freezing my butt off with everybody else why relive my misadventures amongst mobs of lowgrade feuding gods he gave me that look all lawmen develop it says not one word dripping from your filthy mouth is true now nor ever has been the power had gone to his head though there was no denying the good being done he had the bad guys rattled whats that on your shoulder garrett block had done me the courtesy of ignoring that owl in a clown suit my lunch ill share stoke up the fire the goddamn parrot or the dead man speaking through the buzzards beak had to have his word awk jerk alert how do you do that without moving your lips relway asked its a trick they teach marines relway asked we got something wes they were getting cuddly now maybe youve been working the rights gangs where i can theyre hard to infiltrate mostly they form from groups who knew each other in the cantard i still hang out with guys i knew down there we dont spend good beerdrinking time trying to figure out how to hurt people though relway continued big mobs like the call are more vulnerable everybody doesnt know everybody the call proper is organized like the army and marengo north english is building a real private army freecorps theverly theyre calling it is colonel theverly with them i was surprised though i hadnt known lieutenant colonel moches theverly well enough to make sound assessments of his feelings toward nonhumans he treated everybody the same in the zone he was one of few officers who didnt go around with his head firmly inserted in a dark stinky place a man of conviction the colonel shadows stirred behind relways eyes you know him i worked for him in the islands briefly he got hurt and they pulled him out just before the venageti overran us the wound cost him a leg if i remember right he was a good officer thats not why youre here no i didnt know about that block asked is the call moving into the rackets deal as a fundraising activity relway frowned you have a runin garrett i have a client max weider the brewery weider relway nodded my relationship with weider was no secret his daughter alyx says somebody claiming to be from the call took a run at her brother ty they wanted a piece of the gross that didnt sound like the call but if they need money to conjure up their own army they might try more creative ways of getting it they might relway agreed i havent heard of it being discussed seriously yet on the other hand they have discussed other areas traditionally associated with the outfit where those exploit nonhumans two birds one stone exactly the calls inner council put it we deem it fitting that the disease provide the means of sustaining the cure interesting sounded like he attended call council meetings himself theyre pushing chodo and theyre still healthy i wouldnt have thought even the most fanatic member of the call would dare jostle chodo contague chodo was the king of organized crime nobody poached in chodos territory nobody that is who wasnt ready to fight a major war its impossible to imagine a deadlier enemy than chodo contague i knew the real head of the combine more intimately than relway suspected chodos daughter belinda is young but so hard she can cut steel relway smiled his nastiest thatll be temporary you know the contagues and what they can do o evil day i said cute the short answer is the call have shown no interest in extortion but this could be a test case if weider knuckles under and they get the brewery in their pocket weiders peers will fall in line i know max he wont give in even if it costs ten times as much to fight most of the commercial class would agree even where their political sympathies belong to the call they wont want the precedent set they didnt get rich by being easily intimidated tinnie and nicks running with alyx might be as much business as friendship the tates were big in shoes the family nicholas in its several branches were involved in winemaking coal mining and inland shipping in each case possibly even including that of the beer baron i would have been reluctant to listen to a standard appeal but send a beautiful girl and you can get garretts attention every time im too damned predictable but they keep on making pretty girls the shadows still swirled behind relways eyes and those focused on me while the darkness pranced we have a basis for a deal garrett he mused uh apparently you dont approve of my methods you dont need to and i dont care if you do youre a textbook case of inflexible goodguyitis he chuckled at his own neologism scary a relway with a sense of humor maybe this one was a changeling but that dont mean we cant help each other thats why i came back to see block im listening overwhelm me with enthusiasm im a regular ball of fire everybody says so youd fit with the rightsists without any effort youre the kind of guy they want must be else yahoos like stockwell and wendover wouldnt come pounding on my door id only have to shuck about half my beliefs relways grin revealed teeth definitely not human you served with those people you know how they think youve heard all their kneejerk crap how hard could it be to parrot it his grin got bigger he stared at mr big put some words in your own mouth i grunted hoped relway and block didnt think too much about the bird i didnt need them figuring out the fact that the dead man was riding my shoulder by proxy i could but why should i this was starting to sound like work i cant get my people inside these crackpots are abidingly paranoid if a man has even a tenth part nonhuman blood hes a breed and part of the problem never mind he might have been a war hero the spiders spinning the web of hatred are sure humankind can be redeemed only through the extinction of the rest of the races even to the extreme of hunting down and expunging every drop of nonhuman blood otherwise us uniques might breed back to original stock i guess my mouth was open luckily no flies were working the cell thats so damned ridiculous what does ridiculous have to do with belief those people are out there garrett i wanted to argue but my last case had involved several religions each more unlikely than the last people will believe anything when they need to believe something a lot have to believe in something bigger than themselves whether that is a cause or a god what doesnt necessarily matter as long as something is there i understand you dont have to sign a pact in blood just drift farther inside than you planned then let me know what you find and whatll you do for me keep you posted on what i learn and protect the weiders if it comes to that i owed old man weider a lot i owed the tates some too could you keep an eye on the tates while youre at it relway sighed i suppose i can do that he smiled pity about those teeth you make peace with your friend my life is an entertainment for all tunfaire everybody knows every time tinnie winks at me theyre special to me you have a deal wes ive got to wander see whats new on the street he can do that little scruff like him nobody would believe hes relway wait up i said couple things more ever hear of black dragon valsung relway shrugged showed me his palms which is what supposed to be a new freecorps colonel norton valsung commanding lately of the black dragon brigade relway shook his head block said never heard of either one me neither thats what made me wonder what relway wanted to know two squeakyclean clerk types named carter stockwell and trace wendover came to the house today wanted me to join their outfit block and relway glanced at each other block said means nothing to me relway said therere always new gangs ill keep an ear open block waved relway headed for the door i started to go myself block told me hang on garrett uhm if you do get involved you be real careful these people are nasty ive been playing with the bad boys a long time i dont make mistakes anymore only takes one garrett smart guys get dead too point taken thanks one more thing relway gets too focused sometimes doesnt think about whatever dont bear on what interests him right now you leading up to something yes his people saw crask and sadler yesterday remember them you should theyre back in town and too stupid not to be seen never heard either one accused of genius i shivered not much scares me but crask and sadler are stonecold professional killers of the worst sort the sort who want to hurt mrs garretts only surviving son theyre that lucky kind of professional who get to do work they really enjoy crask and sadler have a sack full of bones to pick with mama garretts favorite boy i helped run them out of town i helped fix them up with a combine price on their heads ill watch out do hey teach that ugly sack of feathers to scout for you you hear that bird the goddamn parrot kept his beak shut a remarkable state of affairs crask and sadler damn i thought those doubleuglies were out of my life for good they tried to take over when chodo had his stroke which few people knew about most think hes still in charge they wouldnt if belinda hadnt outfoxed crask and sadler when they made their grab them knowing about chodo and their deadly enmity explained belindas eagerness to elevate them to the next plane nowadays chodo is a lump of meat imprisoned in a wheelchair belinda has no use for him except to pretend her orders come from him block again told me you take care you too i decided to say it i like this westman block better than the old one that got me a sour look and might be smart not to turn up here again you go out on the fringe youll never know whos watching or what their real loyalties are i paused outside the jail studied the street at the best of times watching your surroundings closely is wise our great city never lacks for characters willing to steal your gold tooth in broad daylight while youre watching nobody was interested in me i didnt appear threatening nor weak enough to be an easy victim i felt good i had an accommodation with the law which would work for me because max weider is a municipal treasure it was a gorgeous day a tad warm but with a nice breeze a few scurrying clouds dancing on a sky so blue it defined the color for all time it was the kind of day that makes us daytime people feel good the kind of day when people laugh visit friends not seen for a while conceive children the kind of day when bloodlettings are few and even the scroats take time off to appreciate what a wonderful world it can be it was the kind of day when relways crew might get into mischief because they had too much time on their hands i headed east and north it was time i visited an old friend of my own the streets were crowded but the activists were having trouble working up much indignation if the weather held the coffinmakers and crematoria would catch up and have to cut pieces a centaur clipclopped past he wore an old army blanket i couldnt make out the regimental mark he couldnt be real bright if that blanket was loot and not a crown issue to an auxiliary formation possession could get him killed some days it could anyway he was drunk he didnt care the air above swarmed with pixies and fairies and whatnot the young ones tormenting the pigeons that wouldnt earn them any enemies who werent pigeons themselves birds were out courting too i noted a few hawks and peregrines way up high the little people better stay alert a dimwit peregrine dived at a pixie girl it drew a flurry of poisoned darts the wee folk were using the nice day to educate a new generation of predators its a pity people are stupider than falcons otherwise we could teach them not to prey on their own kind on days like this when everyone comes out to soak up the warm it seems impossible that so many beings live in this city but tunfaire is really several cities occupying the same site there are evening peoples and night peoples and morning peoples who never see one another it is both an accommodation and a way of life it used to work the tip of a wing whipped across the back of my hair the goddamn parrot was showing off for his plainfeathered cousins i know a yessiley place where they put pigeon in everything they cook and they dont care if the pigeon is really a pigeon awk i want to soar with eagles and am forced you want me to call one of those hawks down theyll soar with you help hey mister does your bird really talk hush bertie the mans a ventriloquist berties mom gave me a look that said i ought to be ashamed trying to scam people with an innocent bird youre probably right maam why dont you take the poor creature and give him a decent home the air crackled around woman and child so swift was their departure nobody wanted poor old lovable mr big the place has pretensions toward being a class eatery it doesnt compete for the yessiley trade its fashionable dishes never include anything harder to catch than squash or eggplant its name varies with the mood of its owner morley dotes the palms is the moniker hes hung on it lately his target clientele has gone from being blackhearted secondstring underworlders foregathering to plot negotiate or arrange an expedient truce to upscale subjects foregathering to plot negotiate or arrange an expedient truce the staff however is a constant it was an offpeak hour when i invited myself into morleys place diners of any station were conspicuous by their absence staff were making preparations for the hour when the crowd would show morleys new gimmick was a money cow the place reeked prosperity sheeit i done thunk we was shut of dis perambulatin sack a horse apples better watch using words like perambulate sarge youll throw your tongue out of joint how long did it take him to latch on to the words meaning so he could use it it was several syllables longer than any in his normal vocabulary a voice from the shadowed back growled you let dat damned dog in here again sarge i smell doggie do dat aint dog shit puddle dats garrett tossup which is worst fugginay you guys ought to take your routine on the road i couldnt see puddle but he had been struck from the same mold as sarge both are big and fat and sloppy tattooed and almost as bad as they think they are fugginay garrett wed have em rollin in da streets be up to our friggin noses in hot little gels nah i dont tink im gettin too old for all dat watcha want garrett puddle demanded i tink we done you bout enough favors for dis week i dont need any favors i fibbed i wanted to let morley in on some bad news back there in the shadows puddle must have reported through the speaking tube to morleys office upstairs dotes voice came from the stair what bad news is that garrett crask and sadler are back morley didnt say anything for a good ten seconds then he asked where did you get that cant tell you which told him sheeit sarge observed whatd i say it smells like poop its probaly gonna be poop he wants sometin again fugginay puddle replied im gonna have me a case a da brownleg trots he comes in here someday an he dont want nuttin i tried a ferocious scowl on sarge as i passed him he grinned amiably he doesnt scare nice shoulder ornament dere garrett we knew youd take to da bird eventually these people are my friends allegedly i told morley you know eggplant used to be poisonous yes i keep a few of the undomesticated variety around in case i want to cook up special dishes for people who dont respect our dress code here he led the way upstairs so whos going to hear you now block told you about crask and sadler he got it from relway oh in here morley ducked across the room he uses for an office settled into a plush chair behind a big table he slipped a toothpick into a forest of nasty sharp teeth looked thoughtful crask and sadler interesting morley dotes is the kind of guy nightmares are made of if you have a daughter hes so damned handsome its painful in an olive slim darkelven fashion anything he throws on makes him look like he spent all last week at a tailors he can deck himself out in white and prance through a coalyard without getting a spot on himself ive never seen him sweat females of numerous species stop thinking while hes around for all his faults hes a good friend albeit a friend of the sort who would give you a talking parrot as a gift and do it in a way that would tie you in knots of obligation that keep you from disposing of said gift in any sensible fashion sort of the way an old hag witch might put a curse on you that you can shed only when some other fool volunteers to take it upon himself no doubt morley chuckles himself to sleep every night thinking about me and the goddamn parrot i said looks like the new scam has the marks rolling in it was the right move at the right time garrett took a while to convince the neighbors that they would benefit though i could imagine the area had been known as the safety zone till recently it was neutral ground where gentlemen of unsavory enterprise who were business rivals or outright enemies could sit down with some expectation of personal safety the joy house had been the heart of the zone morley made the zone work and therefore profitable for the whole area a shift in market focus certainly would disconcert the neighbors rich people have the same requirements and vices as poor people morley observed lamplight sparkled off the points of his unnaturally white teeth but they have more money to pay for them that convinced everyone that and i didnt doubt the marketing strategems of sarge and puddle and their compatriots uhm crask and sadler block do any guessing about who brought them in nope i thought belinda should know theyd been seen morley has better contacts in the outfit if she doesnt know shell be grateful for the warning i said id like to break the news personally morley gave me a double dose of the fisheye you sure that would be smart she used me up and left no hard feelings from me from you belinda contague is a strange woman garrett might not be healthy to get within stabbing distance of her we understand each other but itll be easier for both of us if i have you contact her ill pass it on this time you bullshitter but you need to find somebody else to run your love notes im out of that life who was bullshitting who but i didnt ask let the man think he can kid a kidder if he did it could be a useful lever later what have you been into lately dotes asked we havent had a chance to just sit and talk and find cures for the ills of the world his notions for the latter involve either forcing everyone to turn vegetarian or necessitate wholesale slaughters or both i told him about my adventures among the gods and goddesses i thought about getting you together with magodor she was your type uhm he looked speculative she had four arms snakes for hair green lips teeth like a cobra but she was to kill for otherwise oh yes ive dreamed about her for years elves dont dream he shrugged what about now now you didnt visit block to tip a few beers and reminisce about old murders you solved together sure i did i know you garrett you have a case it isnt really a case ive got the deal with the brewery somebody threatened the old man maybe i sketched the situation you have yourself a situation fraught with peril garrett he smirked potential violence weider wont stand for it and if the call tries moving into the rackets the call probably wouldnt but several fringe groups are trying they dont attract people with money well see some excitement there i can hear belinda sharpening her knives you going inside inside into the movement as a spy you wouldnt have any trouble youre ethnically pure youre a war hero morley is a war hero himself in his own mind he stayed behind and did yeoman service comforting many a soldiers frightened wife youre healthy enough to stand on your hind legs youre unemployed makes you the perfect recruit except for i dont buy the doctrine morley smiled his sharptoothed finest you better not be seen here if youre going inside you shouldnt even be around the dead man oh i didnt swear any oaths with relway did i no thumbcutting and bloodmixing obvious as it was i hadnt thought about the fact that infiltrating the rightsists meant my own lifestyle would have to reflect rightsist prejudice adopting a false identity would be too iffy too many veterans knew me one thing you do when youre single and dont work is hang out with people like yourself i prefer the company of women but there are rare occasions on an almost daily basis when no woman prefers mine hard as that is to believe it wont go that far i hoped im going to the brewery to poke around if ty is trying to scam pops cash prematurely ill scare him off if hes playing straight ill still get an idea of the real problem i cant believe any of our racist lunatics have balls big enough to go after weider you have true believers involved garrett you ought to know reality doesnt faze those people theyre right thats their armor thats all they need morley sat up straight he wanted to move on to something else be careful out there garrett im always careful no youre not youre lucky and luck is a woman be careful you learned from the best take my lessons to heart right i chuckled morley doesnt lack for selfimage tell puddle to come up i need him to run a message i dont think hell do much running i did as dotes asked though morley never said a word about the goddamn parrot never asked a question never even looked at the bird never smirked or rubbed it in morley was playing with me again i ought to slice the little buzzard into thin strips and slip them to him buried in one of his strange overly spiced vegetarian platters i watched puddle strain his way upstairs that man needs to eat more of what he serves i told sarge who isnt a single pound lighter fugginay were all puttin on da pounds garrett sarge muttered polishing a mug though theyre all thugs morleys guys pretend to be waiters and cooks ya tink about it hard when ya aint eatin but den ya wander inta a place where dey got da good beer and da great food ya go bugfuck and dont tink what ya done till ya done et half a cow i know what you mean dean was too good a cook couldnt be the beer beer is good for you fugginay hey i got work to do garrett yeah later you be careful out dere pal da worlds goin crazy that was the nicest thing sarge ever said to me i hit the street wondering why a birds wing brushed the back of my head again my livein clown was restless he didnt speak though luckily had the dead man not been controlling him he would have screeched about me abusing infants or something there was an unnatural rapport between the loghyr and the bird the dead man could touch his mind from miles away me he can barely reach in the street outside the house its bad enough to have the dead man after me constantly at home having him use mr big to keep tabs everywhere else had gotten old two minutes after he found out he could do it i reminded him im going to the brewery shift change was coming up people noticed me talking to the bird they gave me a more than normal amount of room because the streets are filled with men who talk to ghosts and shadows for them the cantard opened doors to realms the rest of us never see war may not be hell itself but it definitely does weaken the barriers between us and the dark regions the goddamn parrot took wing he followed me from above the dead mans control slipped the jungle vulture squawked insults at passersby some hurled sticks or bits of broken brick the bird mocked them he fears nothing that goes on two legs hawks are something else a pigeon killer of uncertain species arrowed down out of the blue mr big sensed his peril at the last instant he dodged even so bright feathers flew but only the parrots feelings suffered any real injury he shrieked curses i chuckled that was close you little pervert maybe next time ill get lucky the little monster returned to my shoulder he wouldnt leave again the hawk circled but lost patience quickly there is no shortage of pigeons in this burg argh i said wheres me eye patch matey i took a few crabbed steps dragging my left foot folks didnt appreciate the effort thought almost everybody has a disabled veteran in the family stragglers from the early shift still drifted into the street as i reached the brewery the stench of fermentation drenched the neighborhood the workers didnt notice neither did the residents their noses were dead weiders main brewery is a great gothic redbrick monster that looks more like a hospice for werewolves and vampires than the anchor of a vast commercial empire it has dozens of turrets and towers that have nothing to do with what goes on inside the building bats boil out of the towers at dusk the monstrosity sprang from old man weiders imagination a smaller duplicate stands directly across delor street weiders first effort hed meant that to be a brewery but it turned out to be too small so he remodeled and moved his family in while he built a copy ten times bigger to which all sorts of additions have attached themselves since we tunfairens love our beer the brewery doent have a real security team senior workers take turns patrolling and watching the entrances outside villains dont get in the workforce protects the place like worker bees protect their hives a spry antique named geral diar had the duty at the front entrance hey gerry i said as i walked up checking in garrett his eyes arent the best and he was surprised to see me that was a good sign if nobody expects me any bad guys will have no time to cover up whatre you doing here snooping same as always the big house says its time been stealing any barrels you enjoy yourself young fellow somebody should oh youre not diar is one of those guys who cant not talk if anybody stops to listen not much joy around here lately how come state of the kingdom everybodys got a viewpoint and nobodys got a pinch of tolerance for the other guys this might be germane been some political friction here oh no not around here mr weider wouldnt put up with that but its everywhere else and you got to get through it to get to work you cant hardly go anywhere without you run into a brawl or demonstration or even an out an out riot its all a them foreigners from the cantard they just act like they want to cause trouble i know what you mean i was in my chameleon mode where i mirror whomever im with that loosens people up diars comment though complimented the dead mans suspicion that glory mooncalled was trying to destabilize karentine society gets depressing garrett knowing you have to go out there things was better back when all you had to worry about was thieves and strongarm men im sure the king will do something soon like the traditional turnoftheback till the mob sorted itself out not that the royals deign to spend time in tunfaire where the upper crust bears them far less goodwill than does the factious fractious rabble well you just have yourself a wonderful day garrett and you too gerry you too when you think brewery mostly you picture the finished product beer ale stout whatever you dont consider the process first thing you notice about a brewery is the smell that isnt the toothsome bouquet of a premium lager either its the stench of vegetable matter rotting because thats the process to get beer you let vats of grain and water and additives like hops rot under the loving guidance of skilled old brewmasters who time each phase to the minute there are no youngsters working in the brewhouse in the weider scheme even apprenticed sons of the brewmasters start out as rough labor weider himself was a teamster before he went to the cantard and believes that physical labor made him a better man but when he was young everybody over nine had to work and jobs were easy to find weider does know every job in the brewery and occasionally works some of them just to keep in touch with a workingmans reality he expects his senior associates to do the same manvil gilbey wrestling beer barrels is a hoot which might explain why gilbey isnt entirely fond of me ive witnessed his efforts and feel comfortable reporting that as a laborer hes pretty lame i said hello to the brewmasters on duty skibber kessel returned a sullen greeting mr klees was too busy to notice a housefly like me they were dedicated men disinclined to gossip at the most relaxed times i supposed they were happy with things the way they were no brewmaster is shy about raising hell when hes bothered the finest brewmasters are like great operatic performers when i go to the brewery i try to stay unpredictable the bad boys dont need to catch me in a routine sometimes i hang around only half an hour other times i just wont go away i become like some unemployed cousin loafing around the place though i will help the guys on the docks loading and unloading i shoot the bull with the apprentices shovel with the guys in the grain elevator just watch the boys in the hops shed i wander doublecheck counts on the incoming barley rice and wheat calculating inflow against recorded output in all ways i try to be a pain in the ass to wouldbe crooks the brewerys biggest problem always was pilferage thats been a lot smaller since i came around but unfortunately human nature is human nature i knew some of the teamsters and dock wallopers well enough to drink with so it seemed i ought to start with them they wouldnt hesitate to talk about conflicts within the workforce there are two ways to reach the loading docks besides going around to the freight gate one leads through the caverns beneath the brewery where the beer is stored the caverns and the proximity of the river on which raw materials arrive are why weider chose the site the caverns are the more difficult route the other way runs through the stable thats huge few other enterprises require so much hauling capacity i chose the caverns its almost a religious experience wandering those cool aisles between tall racks of kegs and barrels they work round the clock down there and i always find mr burkel there with his tally sheets mr burkel dont you ever sleep garrett hello of course i do youre just a lucky man you get to enjoy my company every time you come around how can i argue with that how are your numbers running these days as good as theyve ever been as good as theyve ever been which still meant a slight floor loss in favor of the workforce probably limited to what was consumed on the premises which was fine with old man weider mr burkel handed me a huge stein as chance would have it that stein was filled with beer this is a new wheat weve just started shipping i sipped half a pint and a fine brew it is mr burkel its heavier than the lager but lighter than the dark i usually prefer i forebore tossing in some wine snob chat he wouldnt get the joke thiss why i like old man weider hes always trying something thanks maybe ill come through again on my way out do now answer me something garrett how come you got a stuffed bird on your shoulder looks goofy as hell its not stuffed its alive its kind of a signature thing other guys in my racket all got a gimmick oh youd have thought i was threatening to tell him about my new wall coverings well you be careful out there garrett likewise mr burkel the weider freight docks are chaos incarnate yet out of that confusion flows the lifeblood of the tavern industry from its heart to its nethermost extremities beer is the blood and soul of the metropolis the teamsters and deckhands received me with mixed emotions as always some were friendly or pretended to be others scowled maybe some of those were involved in the theft ring i rooted out they might figure i done them wrong because stealing from the boss is a workers birthright shadows were gathering in the dockyard hostlers had begun retiring the incoming teams after dark only outside haulers would be loaded this was a time of day the dockworkers liked they could get lazy it was also the time of day when a keg or three could disappear most easily i planted the other side of my lap on a returned empty meant to go back to the cooperage yard for repairs i stayed out of the way let the noise and chatter wash over me the goddamn parrot muttered but did not lapse into filth what little i understood sounded like random thoughts from one of the dead mans secondary minds he must be distracted i listened i overheard almost nothing about the political situation and less about what everybody thought i might be after i didnt mind i didnt expect anybody to be dumb enough to plot right in front of me though the criminal class does boast a rich vein of stupidity mostly i watched how guys behaved when they knew i was watching nobody acted guilty garrett i opened my eyes id been on the brink of falling asleep the long nights were catching up gilbey manvil gilbey masquerades as old man weiders batman but hes no servant the bond between them goes back to their army days and is unshakable nobody can indict its rectitude either gilbey had a wife who died weider still has one he worships if max is the brain of the brewing empire manvil gilbey is its soul and conscience max requests the honor of your company whenever you can get over to the house gilbey needed a few quaffs of the product hes all right once hes had a few ill be over before it gets completely dark good enough gilbey turned and marched away a driver called sparky observed thats one guy what never should of got outta the army always on the parade ground isnt he hes all right you get to know him one of the good people i agreed he just never learned to take it easy the streets are filled with people like that these days tell me about it sparky grumbled when i get off ive been driving and hossing them barrels for twelve fourteen hours all i want to do is get home and collapse so what happens every goddamned night ive got to walk a mile through morons trying to save the world from the guy next door and every damned one of them wants me to join his mob they get deaf as a cobblestone when you tell them to just leave you the fuck alone another driver said im thinking about just camping out here till this shit blows over im fed up having to duck a fight every time i go somewhere i suggested maybe you could try a different route those rights guys only show up where they think they can start something i didnt get any hassles coming down here i dont get much trouble at all really you think walking around with that stick and stuff dont make a difference them assholes aint ready to work for it yet yeah garrett mosta dem fucks be scared shitless of a guy wit a eagle on his shoulder thank you zardo but dont give the buzzard a swelled head i tote my headknocker everywhere these days times have grown so interesting that i no longer feel foolish being cautious you want to buy this bird zardo sparky ill cut you a deal ill throw in an eye patch datd just be askin for trouble i couldnt fight my way outta a weddin reception sparky said i spent my five doing the same thing i do here garrett i never touched a weapon after basic i didnt know sparky well enough to preach to him so i just shrugged lifes never kind to the goodhearted i had a friend once who recited a poem over and over about how good men die while the wicked prosper one of the best men i ever knew what the crocodile didnt eat we buried in a swamp on an island down south i know that pome id better head for the big house sure something i wanted to ask you though yeah what that bird its stuffed right you got a bet on its alive its just doped on idiocysuppressing thoughts from the dead man if i dont dope it it cusses worse than old matt berry usually at somebody who could yank off both of my arms with one hand tied behind his back oh sparky seemed disappointed he must have lost the bet i dropped off the dock strolled toward the stables going through was the fastest way to the big house i was halfway through stepping carefully when i found myself at the heart of a sudden triangle of guys who didnt look very friendly morleys oftgiven advice was sinking in or maybe i was just in a bad mood or maybe i was just impatient i didnt ask what anybody wanted i spun my oak headknocker tapped the temple of the guy moving up behind me the pound of lead inside the sticks business end added emphasis to my argument his eyes glazed he went down without a word i continued to turn dropped laid my next love tap on the side of the knee of a huge weider teamster he was just getting a fist wound up his legs folded i rose past him tapped him on his bald spot stepped aside as he sprawled turned to the last character something on your feeble mind he kept coming even though he had no tools that didnt seem encouraging why the confidence i feinted a tap at an elbow buried the tip of my stick in his breadbasket he whooshed a bushel of bad breath i whapped the side of his head then found out why he kept on coming a second wave of three materialized these boys looked like they were accustomed to muscle work i didnt recognize any of them on the plus side none of them were behind me while they decided what to do because plan one had burned up in their fingers i rethumped everybody already down i didnt want any surprises one of the new bunch grabbed a pitchfork another collected a shovel i didnt like the implications the goddamn parrot who had elevated himself to a stringer overhead when the excitement started said awk garretts in deep shit now the third man who seemed to be in charge hung back to direct traffic he and his pals all looked up when the bird spoke i didnt i charged a pitchfork is nasty and a shovel unpleasant but neither was designed to hurt people my stick though has no other reason for existing a feint and a weave gave me a chance to reach in and crunch knuckles on a hand gripping the pitchfork shovel man froze momentarily when his tooslow buddy shrieked i skipped aside and cracked his skull i swear he shimmered i thought he was going to fade away i wanted to whimper because i was afraid some gods were after me again i whipped back to pitchfork man he was too slow to be a threat by himself a moment later he was sinking and i was ready to go after the last man the clown shut the stall gate between us leaned on it and smiled im impressed you ought to be youre about to be flat on your back in the horse fruit yourself who are you why the hell are you bothering me awk the goddamn parrot observed from above im nobody special just a messenger i rolled me eyes corn by the bucketful spare me i dont mind crippling the messenger not scared just quaking in my little shoesies i banged a toe off the temple of the guy who had tried to fork me for half a second he shimmered like his buddy had no skin off my nose you listen or not want to bet i popped my stick against my palm lets see if you shimmer too heres the word we know where you live stay away from the weider brewery a joke right i indicated my collection of unconscious bodies i know where i live too you guys want come on over for just a second his confidence was shaky im telling you back off stay away says who youve gotten something turned around inside your head you and your companyclerk buddies here are going to keep your lardy asses off of weider property next time you trespass youll get hurt the guy smirked i flicked the tip of my stick at the fingers of his right hand where he gripped the top of the gate he bit yanked back i kicked the gate he staggered backward unfortunately my balance wasnt perfect either my followthrough was a plop into notsosweetsmelling straw the goddamn parrot guffawed your day is coming the big guy bounced off a post got his balance back he grabbed a handy hay hook whooshed it back and forth he wasnt happy anymore he snarled that was a big mistake now you got me pissed off and i dont need you in one piece there are people so stupid they just cant imagine somebody hurting them and some of those are so dim you cant even teach them with pain this guy looked like one of the latter the goddamn parrot made a distressed noise i dived for my stick it had gotten away from me when i fell i slithered over an earlier victim he groaned when i got him with an elbow what are you men doing there that sounded like somebody used to being in charge i glanced sideways as i got hold of my stick saw ty weider and his wheelchair maybe fifteen feet away beyond a couple of stalls with him were his fulltime helper lancelyn mac and two stable hands the big guy looked too he dithered a second longer than i did without getting up i swung my stick and got him in the kneecap he yowled and raised his leg i rolled into the one still on the straw lance ike see whats going on there ty ordered i got up its me i was crossing from the dock to the big house when these guys jumped me i kicked the big man in the side of the head before he got organized i wasnt fond of anybody right then i planted a foot on his butt and pushed him into a manure pile lancelyn and ike joined me i asked you guys recognize any of these thugs both looked toward ty for advice weider maneuvered his chair through the mess sit them up so i can see their faces i lifted guys so did ike lance didnt want to get anything under his fingernails he elected himself director of field operations id always suspected him of being that kind of guy he was a tall goldenhaired boy with an inflated notion of his own worth women of the shallow variety drooled when he walked past wed never gotten along but then wed never had to i didnt hang out with the younger weiders anymore you play rough garrett ty said i took them by surprise in more ways than one id guess he was right for sure these guys hadnt been clear on who i was otherwise they would have been better prepared ty said lance those faces look familiar he pointed indicating the men id seen before myself whatre you doing garrett going through their pockets i tapped a guys head to keep him down might find something interesting you saying this wasnt personal none of these guys have a sister some of them probably do but i dont know them it didnt get personal till they tried to thump on me the one i was wrestling when you showed up told me they were supposed to tell me to stay away from the brewery he was the only one who ever said anything you dont know him no neither do i lance no ike mays no looks like we have a mystery then this is votil hanbe ike said indicating one of the familiar men he cleans stables nights that one works the dock nights i dont remember his name kessel lancelyn said milo kessel skibber kessel is his uncle mr klees hired him as a favor to skibber i was there when they discussed it we can talk to them then dont beat on those two anymore garrett and what should we do with the rest of them whatever you do with trespassers keelhaul em the goddamn parrot suggested i continued beat them some more and toss them into the canal hello what all of them have one of these armbands tucked away i lifted one it was the black and red and blue common to all the human rights groups this one boasted a black twoheaded dragon on a red field as its main device i dont recognize this nobody else claimed any knowledge either ty said lance get them up and get them out of here ike mays lend a hand i asked is there any reason one of the nut groups would want me to stay away from here im part of the scenery who knew you were coming right to the point old ty nobody i fibbed he should know though unless he didnt talk to his intended nicks wouldnt be hiding what she and alyx were doing from her fiancé even if alyx wanted or would she but ive been here long enough for somebody to send out for help only what would political guys be afraid that id find these people are mainly lowerclass veterans garrett you need money to become a political force did you check to see if someones been skimming again i did i didnt catch any bad smells ill reexamine the accounts myself ill let you know if i find anything you say my father wanted to see you gilbey caught me on the dock soon as i finished i headed for the big house dads probably grumbling about you taking so long ill let you know what these two have to say if they dont talk theyll be looking for work the unknowns were headed for the street already partly under their own power those boys would have a fine crop of aches and bruises in the morning not me though id saved myself all that by moving fast and hitting hard first just what morley has been preaching for so long pretty soon id be leaving them with their throats cut ty muttered im going to be late again he worked his chair around until he was right in there with the brewery employees both of whom were conscious now lance well question hanbe first no sense upsetting skibber kessel if we dont have to the goddamn parrot dropped out of the gloom satisfied that it was safe to show his ugly beak around me again ty started then he grinned put one on the other shoulder too garrett add a tricorner hat a bad limp some facial scars and an eye patch you could pass yourself off as captain scarlet he smirked the goddamn parrot brings out the worst in everybody except me ill just go see your dad now yo ho ho manvil gilbey was waiting for me i barely finished cranking the bell handle before he stuck his bleak face outside i was surprised a stiffneck named gerris genord usually answered the door his nose rolled up instantly what in the world are you aware of the state of your apparel plenty i was headed over here i got ambushed in the stable ill want to talk that over with the boss too but first why dont i go around back shuck out of all this horse flavoring and wash down if youve got somebody who can bring me a towel and something else to wear thoughtful of you garrett take care you dont fall afoul of any pigs or cattle on your journey careful is my new middle name the goddamn parrot decided that was his cue to laugh he sounded like a donkey braying i strolled around to the tradesmans gate i waited there for ten minutes i started talking to myself or maybe thinking out loud to the goddamn parrot gilbey himself finally showed up to open the gate and let me into a large paved courtyard that would have been the shipping point had the mansion actually become a brewery you get lost backstairs or are you just the only one home wholl risk i ran into alyx i had to discourage her from supervising your ablutions personally that might have been interesting must be this glamorous life i lead i wouldnt get too interested in alyx me neither max is my bread and butter oh did it hurt to say that and actually try to mean it the more i thought about how wonderfully alyx had grown up the more and i understand youre taken awk chuckles in parrotese this bird and me were a hot number nothing is going to come between us i expect miss tate will be devastated manvil is business all the time he took himself and life and everything else much too seriously you should relax gilbey take a night off go out somewhere where nobody knows you get fucked up and party your ass off gilbeys eyes widened a skillionth of an inch sound advice no doubt its certainly done you well ill consider it go after it the way you did when you were young and in the service i was in the judge advocates office wouldnt you know he probably prosecuted guys for smiling on the job i dont recall ever having criticized the way you live your life mr garrett ouch despite his obvious disapproval point taken mr gilbey and that makes you a treasure everyone else is critical including my partner my housekeeper my girlfriend my best friend even this ludicrous buzzard the goddamn parrot cracked an eyelid and went to all the trouble of interjecting an awk as bitterly cold as any corpse for a second i thought gilbey might crack a smile he didnt but i knew how to get to him now with the unanticipated with the kind of humor that blindsides you with the unlikely a troll an ogre and a barbarian walk into a tavern the elephant behind the bar says we dont serve mice are never amusing youve heard it i hadnt finished the setup i hear them all kittyjo collects them the more offcolor the better i have to listen to them here we are i had several buckets of hot water brought around use them as you will can i ask you something gilbey he waited neither offering permission nor denying it youre a right guy youre maxs pal his sidekick but half the time you talk like some kind of butler or something we are what we are garrett you should find soap towels and fresh clothing inside rinse down the floor when youre done courtesy to the next bather when youre ready meet us in maxs study thanks for everything and whatever i stepped into the place he had made available the floor was zinc so were the walls the staff were allowed to bathe there horses got scrubbed down there too a selection of clothing soap a brush and three steaming buckets all sat on a bench a doorway without a door in it opened into a chamber about five feet by nine also floored and walled with zinc the floor sloped to a central drain a bizarre apparatus consisting of a barrel and lead pipes hung overhead you filled the tank by climbing a ladder in the outer room i figured it out because it resembled a contraption wed built from a hardtack barrel in the islands using bamboo for pipes i scrubbed up as good as i have in years the clothes were not the sort youll usually find on one of mama garretts boys mainly because mom and all her boys together couldnt afford them nor were they a choice i wouldve selected given a choice they were too dressy formal dull too dark more suited to the funeral racket also there was a waistcoat and ruffles not a plethora of ruffles not ruffles like you see when morley dresses up but ruffles ruffles arent me the goddamn parrot resumed station on my shoulder he made no effort to control his snickers the clothing smelled like it had been stored maybe it had belonged to one of the weider boys in happier times not ty though he was smaller than me probably the only one who hadnt come home i couldnt remember his name the tools were there so i shaved i dont know why i didnt seize the opportunity to cut the goddamn parrots throat it was one in a thousand and nobody was looking old man weider stands about two hairs over five and a half feet tall but he has a much bigger presence hes a roundfaced ruddyskinned guy with closecropped white hair most of which has migrated to the sides of his head i suppose to escape the direct impact of sunshine and rain his mustache is doing much better thank you maybe it gets more fertilizer its a huge gray bush with flecks of yesterdays brown still hanging on stubbornly weider smiles readily but his smiles seldom take up residence in his eyes its like hes really glad to see you but the moment youre actually there he starts calculating all the angles he grabbed my hand pumped it his fingers were plump little sausages he grinned as he said i hear you had an adventure over in my stables he has remarkably good teeth for his age ty sent ike khame over he told us what happened while you were cleaning up ah an adventure that dont capture it i was lucky ty and lance turned up when they did why what sorry sit down you look good in those clothes they were tads i suppose you guessed keep them in fact manvil tell genord to have tads whole wardrobe shipped over to garretts place you dont have any objection do you this was the boss chatter chatter off in seven unpredictable directions no sit down sit down you want something to drink weve got beer or beer or you can have beer he worked some change on that joke every time i visited which wasnt often our relationship may be based on absence makes the heart grown fonder why would anyone jump you good question i dont know two were your employees ty said hed get an answer they all carried armbands from some rights gang their emblem wasnt one ive ever seen before gilbey brought a schooner of beer a weider dark reserve with a strong yeast flavor the very beer the goats in heaven give instead of milk he said its spooky seeing you in those clothes weider agreed if we got a surgeon to cut that growth off your shoulder youd look a lot like tad the old pain rose into weiders eyes it was the pain we all know because weve all lost somebody to the war i took a long drink and tried to forget my brother my father doesnt hurt because i dont remember him weider didnt have that solace nor that of beer he drinks nothing he stays away because he loves the stuff too much gilbey drew a mug he would nurse it all evening i dont get out much anymore garrett he said as he settled into the chair he always used not far from max where he could scoot over and get into a cutthroat game of dominoes when the mood hit im out of touch with popular culture are stuffed birds some new fad a present from a friend i let it go at that with my luck the dead man was napping and catching nothing through that hideous jungle chicken weider mused so alyx went to you i nodded i didnt send her so she said but she hinted that you wouldnt run me off if i turned up its good that you came youve already generated evidence that something is going on this cancer people call a human rights movement it has penetrated the brewery alyx said somebodys trying to extort money on behalf of the call weider seemed surprised he glanced at gilbey manvil news to me gilbey sat forward in his chair alert she said ty told her tinnie and nicks backed her up a couple of brewmasters supposedly saw it happen they did the call nicks miss nicholas tys fiancé it doesnt sound like the calls style absolutely not marengo north english has more wealth than any three men deserve interesting weider should be north englishs equal in that id gladly relieve the man of some of the responsibility weider chuckled no doubt but his wealth is why the call is the biggest rights group gilbey amended his wealth and his connections most of his social peers share his prejudices max said i dont even though i consider him my friend he wouldnt try something that underhanded hed come ask for support i said he might have some renegade troops id had an unpleasant encounter with a call splinter group not that long ago plausible gilbey took my schooner restored it to a happier estate then added the men in the stable werent from the call weider told me ike seemed certain that ty had made sure of that oh tomorrow night im hosting a gala where ty and giorgi will announce their engagement everybody who is anybody will be here including marengo north english and bondurant altoona and you i hope wont you join us uh me socializing with socialites ive done that mostly in shady places street corners alleyways taverns where their own kind wont notice them rubbing elbows with a disreputable character like me youll manage garrett just bring your manners pretend the guests are all beautiful women and you have charm to waste get him an invitation manvil youll come in like any other guest garrett the security people wont know who you are not right away i must have let another expression get out and go scampering around my face maybe i need to hit the landing and hang out in the gambling dens until i get my betting face back i didnt have you do security because youre only one man garrett that was hopping on a crippled leg but i ignored it i accepted a fancy folded paper from gilbey asked weider so why did you send manvil to get me an impulse possibly driven by an unconscious surge of common sense i wanted to give you that invitation because i suddenly realized that by shutting you out i was putting myself entirely in the hands of amateurs and strangers at a time when i was going to have a house full of outsiders many of whom i couldnt call friends even during a wedding celebration and i wanted to find out why you suddenly decided to show an interest in the brewery just when things are showing signs of getting weird call it my oldage paranoia suddenly flaring up i looked at gilbey manvil thinks much less of me than max does you approve i do but his gout was nipping him or he was having a problem with gas pains you have other troubles max said i expect to find out for sure tomorrow night i mean to flush the snakes out of the grass there would be a few of those amongst the bourgeois robber moguls likely to be invited to a weider soiree vipers the size of the crocodile killers we used to cut up and feed to the sabertoothed cats in the islands gilbey volunteered alyx wanted you invited too the little darling huh on behalf of miss tate but also because shes wary of snakes herself tinnie seemed to be wriggling her cute little tail right back into the center of my life and i didnt mind at all ill see if i cant find something to wear manvil will have genord make sure tads things gets to your house in time please avoid the stables until after the affair i think i can resist the urge to visit them grinning gilbey suggested if you arrive early you can critique our arrangements and watch the villains make that guests arrive i pretended to be businesslike a reasonable plan gentlemen awk well be here we ill sell your feathers first you glorified duster weider chuckled he said at least one of you ought to show up one of us will me the one with half a brain i got up i must have moved too fast the floor got awfully unsteady suddenly couldnt have been that little dribble of beer will you quit stomping around the goddamn parrot kept getting more and more restless i hoped that didnt mean he wanted to exploit me the way pigeons traditionally do statues of forgotten generals id seen enough animal byproduct for one day weiders personal sitting room was in a corner of the front of his mansion on what was called the second floor despite being only slightly above street level the ground on which the mansion stood sloped in back you could walk straight out but in front you climbed fifteen steps to reach the front door then descended half a dozen back to street level so the first floor lies below actual ground level almost everywhere only the rear of the house including the kitchen family dining room and back stairs sees daily use most of it is reserved for entertainment even the second floor mainly serves business and entertainment purposes weider rules his empire from there the family lives higher still on the third and fourth floors servants who live on the premises do so in nooks and crannies and under the eaves i didnt envy them i was about to head down the grand staircase to the first floor when a remote scream stopped me i glanced back gilbey stood in the doorway of weiders study silhouetted he shrugged pointed upward i clomped downstairs muttering tom is still with us i took several deep breaths crossing the pinkmarble floor so when i got to the steps i could bound up to the front door with the spring of a misspent youth the goddamn parrot never stopped prancing on my shoulder max had three sons tad tom and ty tom and ty made it back from the cantard but tom left his mind and soul behind rich or poor we have that in common weve been to the cantard and weve lost somebody and none of us who survived came home unchanged but the war is over karenta has triumphed the cantards fabulous mines now serve the sorcerers who are our real masters karenta is the most powerful kingdom in the world we should be proud this month for the first time in three generations the crown conscripted no one we won and because we did our world is falling apart boy am i glad we didnt lose it seemed like a mile to the door my heels clacked hollowly their sound echoed off the walls preparations were under way for the party but so far only to the extent that the hall had been stripped of clutter like carpets furniture portraits of imaginary forbears old armor crossed swords and pikes and most anything that could become a weapon after the weather turned drunken there was no one watching the front door the old mans paranoia couldnt run too deep i clomped up and let myself out while making a mental note to suggest a less relaxed security posture i surveyed the neighborhood from the porch daylight was a ghost of its former gaudy self you got to dump youd better go do it now you runt turkey the bird squawked said i wanted you outside so i could talk the dead man of course i knew we were headed this direction as soon as he started insisting that i take the little vulture everywhere not only would he use that ugly feather duster to spy on me he meant to nag me like he was my mother i muttered bird you are doomed doomed what youve got me talking to myself what do you want you need to come home we have company only you can handle damn what did that mean i didnt ask because he wouldnt tell me his excuse would be that the bird could talk only so much before he injured his throat a limitation ive never witnessed when that vulture or the dead man had something to say that i didnt want to hear want to name names no dont waste time ill strangle them both its got to take more effort to deny me than to say a name i took the direct route which turned out to be a poor choice grand avenue from the landing south to the dream quarter was choked with prohuman demonstrators they were mostly younger than me it didnt seem possible that there could be so many that they could all belong right here instead of scattered amongst a hundred towns and cities and a hundred thousand farms but of course resentment of nonhumans is an ancient exercise we had great and vicious wars in ages past and today plenty of men older than me secure in their trade or employment are as intolerant as any youngster with no prospects i hit grand where six hundred guys from the call were marching back and forth practicing their manuals at arms using quarterstaves and wooden swords instead of pikes and sharp steel their apparel was moderately uniform their shields matched most wore light leather helmets they were true believers in the highest cause and they had faced deadly enemies on the plains of war this night would turn nasty if some genius on the hill decided the army should disperse the demonstrators any troops sent in faced demobilization themselves an interesting complication i relaxed awaited a chance to cross when i wouldnt inconvenience any nut you dont want to irritate somebody who has several thousand of his best friends handy not unless youre armed with the headbone of an ass a nice gap opened me and fifty other apolitical types decided to go for it hey garrett wait up i knew that voice unfortunately damn maybe i could outrun her garrett that was my pal winger doing the hollering winger is a big old country girl as tall as me a goodlooker who abandoned her husband and kids to chase her fortune in the city dammit you stop right there garrett wait the goddamn parrot squawked in my ear i stopped i was well trained several people nearby stopped too all startled by the birds having spoken a kid asked does your bird really talk mister she was maybe five with blond hair in ringlets and the biggest innocent blue eyes ever invented i wanted to make a date for about fifteen years but her dad looked like a guy who thought too much like a father yes he does but its hard to get him started awk pretty baby pretty girl unless youre someone special the bird spotted winger awk holy hooters look at them gazoombies nature had been generous to winger i squeezed the birds beak before he got me assassinated i love you too mr big winger said hustling up she ignored kid and dad completely the father decided he wanted nothing to do with lowlifes like us he took off across the street winger demanded where do you think youre going garrett i was seriously contemplating crossing the street while the goofballs dont have it blocked hawkeye he was trying to get away from you genius said a voice from behind me saucerhead i turned saucerhead tharpe is a mountain of a man whose face has been rearranged several times too often he grinned down at me his teeth were stunted black and broken between them saucerhead and winger have about enough sense to get out of the rain after a lively debate obese with irrelevance but you can count on their friendship well all right you can count on saucerheads friendship wingers tends to get slippery if money is involved hello winger my love hello saucerhead how are you im just fine myself thank you nice to see you i cant chat right now ive got to run well run with you winger told me why because your sidekick isnt athletic enough to do it hisself so he hired us he figures you might need your diaper changed yeah saucerhead said hes got a notion somebody might actually want to hurt you i cant imagine why i cant imagine why neither garrett winger grumbled i mean you only trample all over peoples feelings stuff it winger last time you had a feeling you beat it to a midwife to find out if it was gas or pregnancy winger grinned the man with the cute little girl increased his pace he ignored her demands to hear the pretty bird talk again the call guys started a chant and cheer combination that was both moving and chilling then they started marching in place their feet shook the pavement they had a band too we discovered to our dismay i never liked military bands i dont get real excited about patriotic marches either i paid attention and concentrated when i was in the corps i got real good at what i did i became one of the best in a force made up of the elite of the elite that helped me stay healthy never before then then or even now has my soul suffered any compulsion to become an anonymous fraction of a brainless mass that has its thinking done for it by somebody who shouldnt ought to be trusted to water horses another chance to cross presented itself i stepped out winger and saucerhead stepped with me one on either side what was going on in the dead mans minds maybe he was finally drifting away for good tarrying in a paranoid fantasy before letting go this political crap is out of hand i told saucerhead tharpe is no thinker he takes a while to form an opinion so he must have applied some serious mind work to the matter i dont get it garrett theyre overreacting its like theyre screaming because tunfaire is full of people who live here if saucerhead has a prejudice ive never noticed of course he can develop one professionally if the pay is right hes a bonebreaker by trade though he needs odd jobs to keep body and soul together the other day you told me these times would be good for you yeah but times being good for me dont mean its right whats happening people are going crazy its like some mad wizard cast a hate spell so everybody would act twice as stupid as usual saucerhead and winger searched the shadows as we walked i kept an eye on the darkness myself i was edgy times had not been easy lately i thought about penning an autobiography called trouble follows me or maybe danger is my business nothing happened except that we had to detour one small riot straggler rightsists had run into night folks who didnt share their viewpoint most of the night crowd arent human and none have had sensitivity training so they respond to offensive behavior by breaking heads i dont know why when you put three drunks together they decide they can conquer the world if they choose to start with a troll they get hurt no matter how much they drink that troll is still impervious to just about everything but lichen infections beer may not be the root cause of social problems at all despite what the teetotallers claim old man weider may be producing the cure for our social ills suppose we let the morons get tanked and go looking for big trouble big trouble can eliminate them bingo no more problem you cant convince me that im obligated to save you from yourself if you want to head for hell by way of smoking weed or opium or by drinking or by being dim enough to call a giant names to his face go head enjoy the slide i wont get in your way nope i wont hand you a bucket of grease either youve got to do it on your own whats the drill i asked as we turned into macunado east of my place i spoke for the goddamn parrot in case the dead man needed to let me know about any special plans saucerhead and winger thought i was asking them they were unaware of the special relationship between the character with no mind and the one with way too many winger said we walk you to your door and make sure youre safely inside you pay us pay you thats going to come out of the dead mans side of the business i didnt ask for babysitters his nibs didnt rise to the bait he didnt want anybody to know he used the parrot saucerhead said will you look at them kids garrett thats disgusting he meant several youths of preconscription age gathered on a street corner they were baiting a covey of adolescent elf girls who were way out of their own neighborhood not to mention out after dark their fathers would have whipped their bottoms purple had they witnessed what was happening the boys were uncomplimentary in the extreme their vocabularies heavily racist although the clothing they affected was borrowed directly from elven styles the girls giggled at the boys and dared them to do something anything because then they would make the boys look as stupid as they were talking you want me to go tell them to mind their manners i asked huh tharpe responded baffled manners whatre you talking about garrett no whatre you talking about if not their behavior their hair man tharpe eyed me like he wondered if i was going blind look at their hair theyve got a lot of it most of them had it up and artificially curled and it looked like hell but so what it was obvious already that they didnt mind being the butt of mockery saucerhead never outgrew his military haircut he grumbled what kind of parents would let their kids go around looking like that you want to know why karenta is going to hell i did but i didnt think saucerheads theory would hold much water hair had nothing to do with those boys behavior though behavior and hair might be two symptoms of the same disease and the girls bore an equal responsibility hardly anybody human or elven would argue that there are any women more beautiful or sensual than the elven and these girls were blessed additionally with the glow of youth and they flaunted every weapon they had to get those boys to humiliate themselves the boys were too naive to realize they were going to lose no matter what they did thats a hard lesson for even a man of my mature years im past standing on street corners and howling at the unattainable but i suspect no woman ever gets entirely beyond belittling you however subtly for finding her attractive i was stretching saucerheads mind to its limit trying to explain what was going on across the street when winger opined youre really full of shit garrett tell you what winger you tell me about the women you hang out with huh whats that got to do with anything youre going to tell me how women really think but you hang out with me you hang out with saucerhead when he doesnt have a girlfriend tying him down you hang out in lowlife taverns trying to get into fights with guys who remind you of your husband you hang out with thieves and thugs and confidence men and none of them are women so i dont think the fact that you squat to pee qualifies you as an expert on female culture as practiced in our great metropolis sheeit there you go cutting me down again cause i come from the country this could go on for hours winger always has a comeback even if it doesnt make much sense lucky for me we came to my house it was night out and as quiet as it gets in my block but damned if mrs cardonlos wasnt outside watching my place like she expected entertainment of the sort only i can provide i studied the area carefully first i get an armed escort then i find my neighborhood nemesis on point whats happening old bones how come the wicked witch of macunado street is on patrol saucerhead looked at me like id gone goofier than hed ever expected just thinking out loud i said priming him yeah winger said then tell him to read his account book theres two marks each due here two marks dont be ridiculous it is indeed ridiculous garrett the woman has swung into her avaricious mode and she is testing our ability to communicate to establish if she can our limits two pennyweights silver was the agreed upon fee and that was overly generous on reflection i believe you ought to convince them to take an equivalent value in copper sceats the price of silver is depressed it will stabilize at a higher level once the euphoria of victory is swept away by realitys breeze what was he going on about euphoria youve got to be kidding you know whats happening in these streets winger and saucerhead gaped yes i do know would you say that what is happening involves the sort of people who deal in large quantities of noble metals all right i understand dummy me i understood too that i had given winger a bucket of information for free please deal with those two quickly we have company and i am impatient to correct that oh my winger wouldnt take copper she wasnt bright but she was possessed of a certain cunning if we didnt want to let go of our silver we must know something she respected the dead mans brains saucerhead followed her lead though he wasnt sure why he gave me a black look for trying to pay him in copper i told him dont spend it all in one place its already spent garrett i owe morley imagine that tharpe runs a tab at morleys place even now that its the palms how come morley lets him winger told me you need to consult some kind of expert garrett expert about your habit of talking to birds i could cure it in a minute faster even take him home with you he idolizes you and he makes more sense than most people do winger responded with a big raspberry as they walked away saucerhead tried to convince her that shed just blown the best offer shed had all year nobody human had shown as much interest you want a knuckle sandwich for supper you just keep on jacking your jaw winger growled where we gonna eat anyway i shut the door pleased that wed gotten by without winger trying to enlist me in some harebrained scheme for replacing the crown jewels with paste they say you cant pick your relatives but you can pick your friends i must have some really strange secret urges garrett cease dallying i entered the dead mans room calling to the kitchen dean i need you to come bear witness i knew the signs i was about to be granted a nosetothe grindstone lecture by the alltime grandmaster procrastinator and sloughoff artist trouble was the only witness who could really indict him would be another loghyr a little chow wouldnt hurt either my own particular loghyr despite having been dead for ages has the reputation of being one of the most ambitious of his kind ever some battles you cant win wisdom is attained when you start to recognize those beforehand and slink onward in search of ground you do have a chance to hold dean please bring our guest when you come and do put together a platter for garrett if you will be so kind he is hungry and becoming cranky i was going to get crankier his attitude earlier and that message told me our guest was female and under forty dean has a way with women young enough to be his daughters they like to hang out in his kitchen partly thats because hes safe partly because he indulges them like they were favorite daughters partly because hes a nice old guy is tinnie here again no tell me what happened out there the goddamn parrot was on top of me the whole damned time the beast is more limited than you believe the bird is keen of ear but only in a narrow range and his visual acuity and sense of smell leave much to be desired you ought to find yourself a human tool but not me perfect idea unfortunately no human has a mind sensitive enough for remote access no intelligent creature whatever the species fits my particulars exactly there would appear to be a relationship i must examine that someday yeah i muttered completely confident that i was a failed experiment the door swung open dean platter in hand held it for someone someone stepped inside you i was surprised me said belinda contague your lack of enthusiasm is breaking my heart the woman doesnt have one but i didnt remind her she likes black she positively loves black she wore a black evening cloak over a masculinecut black suit of very supple leather she wore black boots with raised heels a pair of long blacksilk gloves were folded over her blackleather belt when she arrived i was sure dean had taken her black hat and veil and put them in the small front room shed painted her nails black and had put something on her lips to darken and gloss them then shed used a face powder to make her skin appear more pallid i have seen vampires with more color despite all that or perhaps because of it she was incredibly beautiful more she exuded something that made it difficult to cling to common sense and the urge to selfpreservation that bizarre look was very erotic you sent a message i was in town i had no other demands on my time i came here you were out but dean was kind as he ever is i glared at the dead man thought hard you should have warned me he didnt respond damn the woman was bold she knew what the dead man was nobody with a conscience as black as hers ought to be anywhere near him back in those remote times when the outfit was in transition passing into belindas regency we had a brief fling i might consider myself lucky because i got out alive belinda is very strange and when it comes to hardness she makes her daddy look like a pet bunny i gobbled im sorry you took me off guard youre the last person i expected belinda contague stands five feet six inches she looks twentyfive says shes twenty she lived a rough life before she took over lived like she was trying to kill herself she was in good shape now as her apparel proclaimed eloquently nature blessed her with a shape that would have them kicking the lids off their coffins if she strolled through a mortuary her dark eyes fell smack into the center of that semimythical windows of the soul class you will discover more warmth and compassion in the stare of a cobra i cant imagine what she ever saw in me i always knew she would come back to haunt me though im not as bad as you think garrett her daddy used to say the same thing huh my father turned out to be a good friend didnt he she sounded wistful i grunted my relationship with chodo contague had been strange too i did him a big favor once accidentally and forever afterward he felt he owed me he did me good turns even when i didnt ask he covered my ass he tried hard to entangle me in the outfits webs so id become one of his soldiers i repaid him by helping take him down crask and sadler are back in town that would take the play out of belinda you saw them she actually became more pale no i heard it from relway via captain block he traded the information for a favor she understood that kind of deal she didnt question my source what favor it doesnt involve you or yours relway isnt interested in us of course he is hes interested in everything but hes a realist he knows you offer services the public wants nor are you breaking the law mostly whatever the priests and reformers say hes really interested in people who hurt people or people he thinks threaten society but hes relway hes a slave to his obsessions he wants to know everything about everything garrett being able to read your mind and intentions helps but even so what you have just said makes only marginal sense i had no trouble understanding me belinda got it too though her coalchip gaze never stopped boring holes through me i asked darling why couldnt you be somebody else nobody grabs the unreasoning side of me like belinda contague sometimes i wish i was somebody else too garrett but its too late do we have to be enemies were we ever yes careful garrett no but what we are can drive us places where were out of choices sufficient to the day the evil thereof i gave her a look at my raised eyebrow that always charms them and dont try that on me garrett youre in my heart suppose we just go on the way you did with my father your dad thought he owed me the final account left me way in his debt though i owe you in a different way youre the only guy i know who treats me like a human being even when i was completely weird you treated me right thats just me i glanced at the dead man he was one witness too many shut up im not proposing im not going to steal you away from the tate woman she has more spies than relway but i do have my small claim on you control your breathing garrett when i was younger the old guys promised me id grow out of the heavy breathing maybe you have to be dead though theres always a belinda or tinnie or somebody scrambling my brain if what relway wants doesnt involve me whats the secret good point perhaps he wants to infiltrate the rights movement and im involved because some rightsist group is trying to extort money from the weider family belinda became the kingpin completely a stone killer handicapped only marginally by her sex i have rightsist problems too she said those people have no respect they believe they have the right to do whatever they want because their cause is just i grunted agreement that was their thinking exactly i wont let them tread on my toes ohoh somebody else wanted to sign me up i am going to take a short nap garrett i expect it will last all night what now i knew why i hadnt seen belindas coach outside shed had no plans to leave and his nibs suddenly was inclined to humor her which he had not been only a short while ago what intriguing thought had he plucked from her spiders nest of a mind im a devil pig im told because i like women a lot go figure that kind of thinking the preference has gotten me into trouble occasionally with belinda trouble could get ugly the spiders in her head spin strangely kinked thoughts and she had to turn up just when tinnies stubbornness had begun to crack i heard about it over breakfast basking in deans disapproval i hated to let him waste all that bile thanks i said accepting the tea youll need to do up the guest bedroom after belinda gets up the old boy had an idea in his head he wasnt going to let me confuse him youre wasting an ulcer dean help i appealed to the dead man tell him nothing happened i was asleep garrett however if a small prevarication will oil the machinery dean made a sound of disgust he didnt want to believe the dead man either belinda came downstairs she was in a bitter mood she didnt like not getting her own way she glared at dean he responded with the indifference of a man so old he has nothing left to fear belinda shrugged she cared for no mans opinion which wasnt always wise her world was unforgiving and the penalties for failing to observe its rules often lethal she worried too little about making enemies inside her own circle she could have worked something out with crask and sadler belinda was chodo contagues child both his creation and his doom it must have been hell to be his kid belinda wouldnt talk about it but there was no doubt that she was bitter there are suspicions that belindas mother went to her eternal reward early because chodo disapproved of her infidelity that was common rumor before i ever met belinda it might have plenty to do with chodos condition now i feared belindas obsessions might compel the outfit to take her down but she was quite capable of taking it down with her belinda asked suppose i explain in person that might get exciting is the woman irrational garrett is any woman reasonable after she makes up her mind tinnies not i cant figure her out i hardly try anymore whatre you trying to do to me nothing anymore garrett its just business now did i need to concern myself with the hell hath no fury syndrome dont worry lover these crackpots are bad for business theyll be dealt with but hey could that be why crask and sadler are back because somebody wants their knowledge about you belinda smiled like a cat contemplating a cornered mouse possibly i have an idea why dont i be your companion tonight i can see people id never run into otherwise im dead she has put forth an outstanding idea garrett consider it i had a good notion where she came up with it too you consider it chuckles you dont have to get along with tinnie tate as miss contague has suggested miss tate cannot be entirely irrational then you know a different miss tate he did see more of tinnie than i did though maybe he knew something maybe the leopardess had changed her spots maybe shed traded them in for sabertooth tiger stripes i told belinda me and the junior partner need to butt heads he agrees with you tell him i take back all the wicked things i ever said about him i wont im going to invent new words so i can say more what is this i demanded as i blew into the dead mans room are you determined to get me lynched i reiterate miss tate is not irrational enough of that there are larger issues at hand larger to who old bones thousands even tens of thousands name for me if you will just five nonhumans murdered today who considered miss tates potential ill will an eventuality more dire than the catastrophe which actually afflicted them unfair unfair he was deft at carving holes in the thickest smoke when the mood took him none of them knew tinnie like i garrett all right how is taking belinda along going to be useful we want to situate you so that you become a recognized intermediary between as many interests as possible so you can dip into the information flows this will position you to take advantage of anyone wishing to communicate with the syndicate particularly as regards those with little sympathy for the call and its ilk ilk what kind of word is ilk relway an excellent example with max weider and his moderate friends perhaps as another spoke to that wheel with effective guidance i can even see you situating yourself on the axis between the radical parties and glory mooncalleds people guess who would do the guiding he was feeling smug about his genius his true plan drifted too near the surface of his thoughts hang on there old bones there aint no way i can sell me to all those folks as the hero of their prophecies you do not have to sell yourself to mr weider or mr relway you serve their interests already no effort is needed to bring miss contague along either she wants to come aboard that leaves only the rightsists and the rebels the former are after you already aw hell why not link up with the nonhumans and all those wannabe revolutionaries who have been lying low since the explosion of rightsist terrorism the rightsists have no use for those guys either rightsists dont like anybody very much nothing to it big guy apiece of cake the rightsists should be fish in a barrel to use your vernacular you are exactly what they want a certified war hero im a war hero who lives with a loghyr and a psychotic talking bird and my best friend is part elf all faults that are correctable a man can come to the truth late you can sell the rightsists because they want to be sold glory mooncalleds is the organization i am concerned about cracking why bother i dont share your infatuation with glory mooncalled truth be told garrett i no longer share that infatuation with my younger self when mooncalled was a distant gadfly yanking the beards of the lords and ladies we love to hate it was easy to cheer him on but he is among us now and the glimmers of purpose i catch are depressingly sinister perhaps the mooncalled i treasured perished along with his dream of an independent cantard or he may have elected to become karenta s great foe because we no longer have serious enemies but deserve them theres that damned word again smiley which word we i find nonhumans fond of reminding the rest of us that karenta is a human construct they make big shows of negotiating exemptions from human law and rule excellent maintain that capacity for dredging up irrelevant sophistries and the call will clutch you to its bosom you may be promoted directly into their inner council i dont want to do this there is little choice garrett these are pivotal times everyone must take a stand before it ends who refuses will be devoured because he will be out there alone but we who recognize the signs and portents have the opportunity to deflect or defeat the gathering darkness i know where i stand windy but id rather be noble and honorable and defend true justice and the divine right of karentas kings while im sitting in my office with a mug in my hand chatting with eleanor and you insist that i am lazy only because you have no more ambition than a bone thats been buried for twenty years you dont have to go out there and try to run between the raindrops partner that is another matter which warrants future discussion right on time i said when somebody hammered on my door late in the afternoon belinda said my people are expected to be punctual and to do their jobs well and they deliver you should take life easier belinda you dont always have to be i try garrett but some demon keeps pushing me i cant beat it and itll get me killed eventually i nodded that came with the territory i looked out the peephole an unfamiliar hulking creature of mixed ancestary shuffled impatiently on my front stoop i think i understand is this thing somebody you know she leaned past me so close i had trouble breathing normally thats two toes marker my driver driver he looks like he wrestles ogres for a living he looks badder than he is he doesnt move very well anymore two toes knocked again despite plaster dust falling all over the house dean didnt come out of the kitchen he was exasperated with everybody and for once he did put the blame where it always belongs squarely on the shoulders of the dead man ill get my shoulder ornament and well be set why that bird is disgusting finally somebody who agreed with me the dead man relaxed his control of the goddamn parrot the little monster barked im in love look at this sweet fluff i already looked you deadweight jungle buzzard and youre right she looks damned good but shes a lady mind your stinking manners that was really good garrett belinda told me your lips never moved once argh but the bird was right i was right she did look good if a little too vampiric for current fashion shed had people in and out all afternoon some to elevate her to this supernal state she didnt want to go unnoticed tonight hell she was going to raise the dead i thought about wrapping her in a blanket so we wouldnt have crowds chasing us through the streets this evening would be easy on my eyeballs alyx was sure to give belinda a run so would nicks and tinnie would be absolutely killer if she bothered to try belinda would be a blooddark rose in a garden of brilliant whites and yellows and carmines if i was doing the talking this little shit would say things to score points for me not to get everybody pissed off belinda laughed then she demanded what you startled me you dont laugh very often you should i cant though i do wish i was different a shuddering déjà vu overcame me i recalled her father once suggesting that he didnt really want to be a bad guy but he was in a bind where his choices were to be the nastiest bad boy he could or end up grease under some climbers heel the underworld is strictly survival of the fittest the contagues survive i opened the door belinda pushed past murmured something to two toes dean bustled out of the kitchen did you remember your key mr garrett yeah and this door better not be chained when i get back got that he had talked me into installing an expensive key lock supposedly so i wouldnt need help getting in late but maybe he just wanted to aggravate me it used to be cats he was always adopting strays apparently because i didnt want them around i attract enough stray people absolutely guaranteed mr garrett i looked at him askance i didnt like his tone thank you dean i shut the door living with him is like being married without any of the perquisites i waved to mrs cardonlos who was outside watching again i wondered if she knew what she was looking for i wondered what had become of mr cardonlos i have a suspicion hes alive and well and happy somewhere far from here she got an eyeful of belinda that one and its sister both liked to popped i thought her chin would hit her knee now she had something juicy to chew up and pass around what do they see in that man two toes had left the contague coach around the corner on wizards reach as we strolled behind him i noted that he had earned his nickname the hard way he had a weird crooked limp i gave him a significant glance then raised my eyebrow to belinda shed relaxed she understood old family obligation she made a noise i would have called a giggle had it come from another young lady guess what he has a twin brother nonose harker the harker boys didnt have much luck in the army i gave the automatic response of every guy who ever made it back from a war when most soldiers didnt sure they did they got out alive if you check the men in the street particularly in the rightsist freecorps almost every one bears some physical memento and beyond the outside scars there are still suppurating wounds of mind and soul and those affect our rulers as well as the least man among us you wont find a duke or stormwarden crouching in a filthy alleyway trying to exorcise his memories with wine or weed but up on the hill or out in the manors the great families have locked doors behind which they conceal their own casualties like tom weider you dont hear about that in histories or sagas they whoop up the glory and forget the horror and pain the dead man assures me that all histories whether official or oral bear only coincidental resemblance to actual events which few principals considered to be history in the making at the time belinda said you used to be a lighthearted guy garrett a little cynical yeah but its hard not to be cynical nowadays what happened to the wisecracks darling a wise man once told me each of us is allowed only so many wisecracks then life stops thats how he explained there being so many sour old farts ive only got one smartass crack left im saving it which means that for the next four or five hundred years im going to be a sour old fart too her sense of humor was underdeveloped she didnt get it or just didnt appreciate it you making fun of me no never just ringing changes on something an oldtimer did tell me when i was a kid this guy was so ancient he could remember when karenta wasnt at war with venageta a human yeah i said he was old dwarves and elves and some other species hang around as long as the loghyr given sufficient good luck in fact elves claim to be immortal but even the dead man isnt sure about that he hasnt been around long enough to see one never get killed stories about elven immortality come from the same myth cycle that tells us that if you con a dwarf into coming out of his mine in the daytime or riddle a troll into staying up past sunrise theyll turn to stone word to the wise dont bet your life dont bet your favorite cockroach youll find out what that red stuff is between trolls toes sure you dont see many trolls on the daytime streets of tunfaire but thats because trolls dont like cities things move too fast but if you insist on looking for trolls be sure you dont get trampled by all the dwarves trying to separate humans from their money day or night i continued this old man was a real storyteller tall tales i wish somebody had written them down he claimed he was so old because there was one last joke that death came and told you and he hadnt heard it yet my father used to say that chodo yeah really maybe he knew the same old man she became the cold hard belinda id come to regret someday you have to tell me what it was like being chodos kid what most of the time i like you but whenever you even remotely connect with your father you go all cold and spooky the coach stopped i shut my yap peeked between curtains were here without any trouble two toes dismounted and came to the coach door one minute belinda told him garrett sometimes im halfway in love with you most of the time im not you treat me decent i like that but we cant ever go anywhere i cant always control the part of me that you dont like if you shoot your mouth off when im out of control i hadnt thought she could see it herself as always belinda insisted on being a surprise two toes helped her down he worshipped the ground she stalked on and she didnt notice one of those sad songs two toes gave me a look that said id better treat her right manvil gilbey was out with the hirelings making sure no great unwashed types penetrated the perimeter glad youre here garrett im getting nervous they started arriving before we were halfway ready he checked belinda he was impressed i am amazed young woman what could such a lovely creature possibly see in this battered rogue gilbey i asked is that really you he winked as he took my invitation i wondered if they were keeping count he said we assumed youd pair off with miss tate life is chockfull of surprises i believe miss tate planned along those lines i didnt doubt it for a second im ready for her right can we gossip later i want to check all the arrangements for myself of course i just wanted you to realize that the situation could become complex he was rubbing me the wrong way and i didnt know why look this isnt important now maybe it was having to face tinnie my partner felt i should bring the lady along because of the other guests likely to appear i didnt dare proclaim my date as being queen of the underworld gilbey was disinclined to quibble neither did he satisfy me that hed made any outstanding effort to protect the weiders i had cause to be touchy i was descending into a cone of trouble where the secret police the rightsists the outfit glory mooncalled and maybe even the business community might want to roll rocks down on me have a wonderful evening garrett miss im sure the weider family will be honored that you choose to share their joy manvil could lay it on with a trowel and belinda could make a determined holy celibate regret his vows gilbey certainly looked like he had suffered a stunning recollection of what women were all about he had trouble looking at anyone but belinda for the next several minutes inside the doorway stood gerris genord genord had a voice like a thunderstorm he refused to let me sneak in unnoticed he announced as though the end of the world was imminent and it was critical that everyone knew mr garrett and miss contague genord was the weiders majordomo i did not like him he sneered at me i did not belong in this society i suppose my chances of getting inside unnoticed with belinda along were as likely as those of the crown cutting taxes because the war was over we were early though so only a small horde heard genords bellows the goddamn parrot made his entrance separately sneakily wearing a parrot to a betrothal ball might be considered a lapse of etiquette we got down the steps all right but didnt make it twenty feet farther before i got pinned in the coldeyed crossfire of tinnie tate and alyx weider tinnie was closer i shifted course best get the worst over now i ignored tinnies expression ive got a letter for you from an old gentleman you know better than i do the goddamn parrot plopped onto my shoulder so much for good form he said read it pretty legs bust his head later tinnie gaped i wondered if i shouldnt have read the letter before i let her have it dean transcribed it for the dead man after i promised not to peek belinda glowered because i gave it to tinnie tinnie and alyx and everyone else with eyes as good as a moles eyeballed belinda in her vampiric heat and wondered frumpy garrett faded from their awareness though wearing one of tads outfits i was as spiffy as ive ever gotten well i didnt want to be noticed did i not in my line tinnie read tinnie gave me the fisheye tinnie coldeyed belinda tinnie glared at me some more the goddamn parrot cleared his throat i got his head in a onehand squeeze before he made things worse he flapped and squawked but didnt get any rocks dropped on my bean tinnie decided she needed some fresh air her stride was efficient her feet pounded the floor eating up ground her red hair tossed behind her alyx caught her they argued instantly belinda stayed close as i moved toward the far end of the hall the place wasnt crowded yet but was more so than id expected where i knew names i named them so belinda would know her name began to circulate too after somebody realized which contague she had to be yonder are the happy couple i said we ought to pay our respects they dont look happy i didnt think they did either ty looked like he had a bad case of constipation nicks looked like shed rather be anywhere else ty perked up when he saw belinda and how could you blame him he asked and who is your lovely companion garrett he never was nicer his own lovely companion bestowed a truly ugly look upon him she didnt really want him he didnt want her but boy he better not even think about being interested in anybody else and garrett was a naturalborn pig dog for daring to be seen with somebody as exciting as this wannabe vampire woman belinda contague belinda this is ty weider crown prince of the weider brewing empire ty failed to recognize belinda as the crown princess of organized crime but why should he her name was not a household word even her father was not universally known charmed miss contague how long have you known this rogue did they take a vote on what to call me maybe i could be a rake next time around almost forever ty he used to do favors for my father i winked at nicks she had made the connection maybe she and belinda had met in another context though belinda showed no sign of recognizing nicks nicks said ill bet your father doesnt know youre out with this rake garrett i didnt want to wait long did i i ought to get into the sybil racket how cruel to label a man a garden tool i was sure the women had met before belinda smiled wickedly daddy would have a heart attack if he saw us holding hands she grabbed my right mitt im still his little girl daddy contague might render me down for candle tallow if he knew the whole history of our friendship whatever the game nicks was ready to play belinda pulled me away she had to control her surroundings completely i watched nicks whisper to ty mischief in her eye she winked again these women might put me in more danger than the call the outfit and relway put together just for the longlegged redhaired howling wolf sexy fun of it the color left tys face chodo really did have a bad reputation genord bellowed mr marengo north english and miss tama montezuma whoa i barked this might be interesting why north english claims montezuma is his niece ive never seen her but shes supposed to be wrong angle belindas face darkened when would i learn rumor would lead one to suspect that north english regularly violates the rules about consanguinity not to mention he maybe cheats on his wife everybody loves a scandal dont they lets go over there ive never seen north english up close why bother he sounds like your typical sleazy male to me but she watched the entrance intently north english would be one connection she wanted to make sleazy male or otherwise youre too young and too beautiful to be so cynical its all your fault you ruined me you beast the newcomers paused to be seen before they descended to the great hall floor put your eyes back in garrett tinnie had materialized behind me and shut your mouth before swallows nest in it i did as i was told im a good soldier me but boy oh boy that tama montezuma was something she was as tall as me narrow of hip she moved like a panther on the stalk radiating an overpowering sexual urgency her face seemed animated by a secret knowledge an abiding amusement at the follies of the world which is after all only a dream her muscles were as hard as stone her walnutstain skin was without flaw showing no hint of a wrinkle and a shocking amount of square footage was available for inspection it glowed with a satin sheen of health so good it ought to be illegal her eyes sparkled with humor and intelligence her teeth were almost too perfect and white to be real she reeked animal magnetism somebody probably her uncle marengo had invested a fortune in her scant but flattering elven fashions down rover alyx whispered over my other shoulder i hadnt heard her sneak up either maybe i was a tad distracted i grumped you guys are wearing that out you know tinnie especially had a tendency to push the needling past the playful stage i thought you were just going to work it on each other tsktsk his skin is thinner than i thought tinnie lightly belinda observed i may be leaping to conclusions here garrett but that woman doesnt look like she could be that mans niece and not just because hes so pale north english did look pallid next to tama montezuma in fact she doesnt look much like anybodys niece she looks a lot more like something a dirty old man dreamed up she did indeed or even some purehearted young man tama montezuma had something that would make people suspicious of her even if she was out with her twin brother and wearing full nuns gear but her being marengos niece was not impossible technically darkskinned adventurers visit tunfaire all the time a few have stomachs strong enough to stay around north english didnt look at montezuma like she was any relative though guys who hit a number big and win buckets of cash get the look marengo had it says i do deserve this but i cant believe its real belinda asked can you introduce me to these people garrett me you know i dont run in their circles alyx her family did share those circles daddy invited him garrett hell remember me only as a little kid its been a long time since he was here last he and dad argued politics tinnie shook her lovely head i cant help i never met the man belinda demanded how would you suggest i meet him then hes got a hungry eye walk up and tell him who you are and say you need to talk hell find time tinnie grumbled something inaudible i bet it had to do with it not being right women taking advantage of their looks that from a lady who grabs every possible advantage out of being a gorgeous redhead at least when guys named garrett are around maybe ill do that he doesnt look preoccupied right now north english was posturing peacock proud basking in male envy not noticing that no one hurried to get close to him and ive got to desert you anyway its time for me to look for bad guys belinda touched my hand lightly the gesture entirely for the benefit of alyx and tinnie the big cats really try to hook their claws in one another belinda strode away tinnie smoldered alyx demanded who is that woman garrett why did you bring her tinnie answered for me her name is belinda contague alyx her father is the number one crime boss in tunfaire shes here because our friend the dead man asked garrett to bring her so that was what was in that letter but tinnie still wanted it to be my fault how long have you known her alyx demanded how come she acts like she owns you a few months but ive known her dad a long time same as ive known your dad for a long time she acts like that because she knows itll irritate tinnie and because she likes to make me squirm just like you that was a good shot but not good enough they didnt want to believe it i reiterated i need to wander around now youre really working tinnie asked yes gilbeys no professional and he knows it thats why i got an invitation i started walking both women followed uh ladies alyx said i can show you around tinnies expression said she was going to make damned certain alyx did nothing of the sort i sighed this was a fifteenyearolds dream at my age it was too rife with complications i sighed again suppose we stroll around and see how easy it would be for somebody to get in uninvited tinnie and alyx stuck like my shadow once when we were close and alyx was a step ahead i grabbed tinnies hand for a second i asked alyx how many people came in to handle the work on this what the extra staff how many outsiders a bunch in the kitchen a bunch to handle the service some musicians i dont know ask manvil or gerris or lance i guess she noticed me touching tinnie if somebody really wanted to get into the weider house coming now as occasional help would be a good way sometimes you just have intuitions or maybe you see something and dont recognize it consciously but your mind works on it and you come up with an idea that later makes it look like you read the future i said lets check the kitchen the largest mass of outsiders ought to be there the shindig would require tons of special food stay with me alyx said eager to regain my attention maybe she hadnt gotten her full share growing up the youngest of five with a father dedicated to empire building and a mother who was already dying slowly following alyx was no chore the hardest work i did was to pretend i didnt find being a few steps behind a shapely behind all that interesting youre not fooling anybody garrett tinnie whispered i glanced back she had her devil grin on i like her best when shes in that mood unfortunately alyx was right there to keep me in trouble we entered the kitchen several religions boast hells that are less crowded cooler and quieter the master of ceremonies was a devil woman so large that at first i thought she must be part troll or ogre but no she was just large and ferocious and determined that her domain should be an extension of her will she never shut up her voice was a continuously constrained bellow she was an immigrant with a strange accent platoons of cooks and bakers and their assistants and boys who stoked the stoves and hauled firewood and charcoal and worked bellows and whatnot in a wild rush to achieve the impossible were all lashed on by her scorn our entry attracted attention instantly she spun prepared to repel boarders she recognized alyx only after shed drawn in a bushel of air miss alyx she boomed you shouldnt be back here now you dey a party tonight dey are and you in your finest you mr garrett needs help finding his way around the big woman dropped her chin to her chest she glared at me from beneath eyebrows like hedges garrett be you dat garrett you which garrett i had no idea who she was but it sounded like the reverse might not be true she might even harbor some old grudge i dont recall our having met you never did you i an i want to know i be you de garrett he helps de mister sometimes him dis garrett was a marine him he saved my shoeman from de swamp him from de debil crocodile yes yes and im not sure we all pulled each other out of the swamp a few times i remember a guy named harman and somebody called bobby ducks nobody knew why dat be him yeah dat be my baby him he never like his god name him always want it be bobby him do i vanished into a huge and powerful hug me as my last breath fled me i reflected that bobby ducks daddy must have been a real mans man him the big woman turned me loose i gulped air like a freshcaught fish she told us but i have a big job to do now i an i an ifn i an i turn my back one solitary minute on dese lazy debils i interrupted how much outside help came in for tonight some of them may be here to hurt the weiders i hoped my imagination wasnt running too wild she understood immediately in de kitchen us added fourteen pairs of hands us for de work on de other side of de door genord he hired sixteen men him gerris genord we knew one another only well enough to dislike one another he was a bigger snob than even ty weider could be he spent his life scandalized because people like me were allowed inside the house unless he had orders from gilbey he wouldnt work with me at all maybe i could get around him maybe id be lucky and not have to do anything those the only outsiders here i asked besides our guests i recalled a mention of musicians the big woman nodded and turned away unable to restrain her bellows any longer and who would she be i asked alyx earlier contacts with the weiders hadnt taken me into the kitchen thats neersa neersa bintor she pronounced it nayearsah shes been in charge down here since before i was born even daddy is afraid to argue with her the big woman stopped bellowing turned back to me you garrett maybe you want to know dis you some of dese hirelings dey maybe not so trustworthy dem some keep trying to sneak away into de house dem maybe to steal someding eh dey have not get away from neersa yet but maybe i an i maybe not be so hawkeye sometime maybe thank you that was support for my hunch wasnt it i glanced around ill keep an eye open none of these people could melt into a crowd most looked like the sort who worked only as occasional labor even in a robust job market not backbone of de kingdom dem they all accounted for now neersa allowed as how she believed that was so by way of an imperious nod ill circulate here for a while see if i recognize any villains alyx asked what should we do like she suspected me of firstdegree intent to ditch wait i wont be long i promise the girl had a vulnerable air that made you want to make promises even if they were promises you couldnt keep maybe she did need daddy watching out for her i wasnt long either the odors of cooking combined with the smells of too many unwashed bodies crushed into too tight and too hot a space quickly discouraged me also few of these people appeared smart enough or stupid enough to get involved in a plot against the brewery and if they did get out of the kitchen my nose would warn me if i was a villain who wanted to make an impact id get in with the serving crew they would be more presentable and more socially adept and they would be welcome in parts of the house denied the kitchen staff i rejoined alyx and tinnie too hot in here i herded them toward the exit from the corners of my eyes i watched for anyone paying me any special attention once we were out i asked either of you notice anybody watching me i did tinnie replied uhm and i mean i watched you close she winked which irritated alyx for sure how about you alyx she stole my line she stuck out her tongue so maybe tinnie had no nobody even looked at you you blended right in looked like you belonged there even in that outfit belinda had assured me the tad weider handmedown was perfect for the occasion whats wrong with this outfit tinnie smirked were talking silk purses and sows ears garrett if i wanted verbal abuse id get me a talking parrot speaking of whom hed disappeared if there are any gods what i mean is if there are any responsible gods one or two might make sure the dead man didnt fade while the bird was here i shuddered to think what might happen if that gaudy cowbird became himself hes not here tinnie explained somebody has to take up the slack wherere we going alyx asked around the corner to where the serving folks should be getting ready to hello what i see a familiar face in fact i see two they belonged to trace wendover and carter stockwell erstwhile recruiters all spiffy in servants livery the outsiders were all dressed in the same threadbare outfits the contractor probably rented them trying to expand his margin trace noticed me an instant after i spotted him he didnt acknowledge my interest but did drift toward stockwell carter came alert before trace got close enough to whisper i was right i mumbled smug there was something going on what tinnie asked i see two rightsists who have no business being here stockwell and wendover werent the sort to be reduced to day work those pretty boys had to come from families of substance alyx asked should i get manvil no you guys just watch out behind me oh hell what id taken my eyes off the boys for a few seconds theyre gone but how there was no exit they could have reached that quickly nor did the server gang seem diminished but stockwell and wendover werent among them anymore youd better get manvil after all i didnt like the implications of what was happening gilbey brought ty s pal lancelyn mac and a brace of hulking uncomfortably outofplace dock wallopers you got something he asked he was ready for war i spotted two rightsists who definitely dont belong here they called themselves carter stockwell and trace wendover when they tried to enlist me yesterday interesting coincidence aint it though they came to my house claiming they wanted me to join a freecorps called black dragon valsung doesnt ring any bells not for me either just now they spotted me the same time i made them they did a grand disappearing act i rounded up mr gresser thats him with the ladies he says nobody named stockwell or wendover belongs to his crew gresser was boss of the contract servants they wouldnt use their real names would they only if theyre stupid entirely possible with tunfaires bad boys gresser did concede the possibility that he might have employed men who answer the descriptions of trace wendover and carter stockwell he doesnt seem close to his help gresser was a weasely little functionary type in a state of high agitation he was a naturally nervous sort terrified that his plans for the evening would collapse and his reputation would follow all because we insisted on making a fuss about a few of his people gilbey skewered gresser with a hard stare you know anything about your people gresser i sighed i hadnt been sure gilbey would take me seriously i still wasnt sure i ought to take me seriously i was running on hunch power hunches are one of my more sporadic talents i listened with one ear while gresser whined there just aint no way to check them all out you do the best you can in the time you got you come up with a job first you got to get word out that you need people then you take the ones you know then you look the rest over and pick the ones that seem the soberest and most presentable that aint gonna blow their noses on the table linen or grope the female guests then if you got the extra minute maybe you ask around does anybody know anything down and so on i kept one eye on tinnie she was put out about the whole situation i kept the other on alyx for her this had become a great adventure she remained poised on the verge of bouncing around like an excited kid she did bounce nicely thank you with my free ear i eavesdropped on gressers grumbling troops one voice stood out i whirled they all stopped talking startled i didnt spot the man but i knew the voice from the brewery stable i jumped again as lancelyn materialized beside me tense as a hunting dog on point you heard that then he relaxed must have been my imagination you thought you heard the big mouth from the stables yesterday yes so did i i dont see him and i just saw two guys who arent there now whats going on i dont know but it smells like sorcery wouldnt you know just when id started to think it would be straightforward and thats an odor i hate hows ty holding up hes in heaven hes the center of attention which is where he always wants to be nicks is the one hurting youre spooky in those clothes when i came up behind you you were standing exactly like tad used to sorry no need you think we need to do something more to protect the old man i dont think he should come out at all what about those guys in the stable they didnt know anything they joined a rights group just last week they were asked to discourage you if you started nosing around they didnt like bullying one of their own kind but you were always a pain in the ass so they didnt have much of a conscience problem until ty told them this could get them fired did they cooperate of course they werent so fanatic they wanted to go jobhunting but they didnt even know the names of the men they were helping they never introduced themselves they just used the right recognition phrases things are getting absurd i grumbled people are scared garrett times are changing it dont look like theyre going to get better people want to blame somebody you put thousands of men used to violence into conditions like that and it would be absurd to expect nothing to happen he was right i spotted a guy who seemed very interested in me i didnt recognize him i tried to keep track as he moved around lance asked have you seen kittyjo not for several years kittyjo was older than alyx by a decade like ty she was always unhappy rumor said shed tried suicide maybe theres one envious devil god determined to punish max weider for his success great villains steal and murder and torture and pay only if they get gobbled up by even bigger villains weider never played it any way but square his tools intelligence and hard work so he loses one son has another driven mad has a third crippled forever has a daughter twisted by severe emotional problems has a beloved wife dying unpleasantly by degrees seemingly never more than one breath away from the end and now the man who deserved none of that had poisonous political snakes trying to slither into his life much more and i was going to get mad she came down before you got here she couldnt wait she was so excited she was like a kid on her birthday its the first time shes broken through the melancholy in months i asked do i sense a more than casual concern lance showed me a sick smile you found out garrett i dont know how it happened i figured it would be alyx i worked hard at being interested in alyx common sense says alyx should be your choice if you have to fall for one of the weider girls shes the only normal one here besides the old man me id assumed he had an unhealthy attachment to ty goes to show you nobody is what they appear i stared at lance too long naturally when i checked the serving crew i couldnt find my interested man we need to pin numbers on these guys there was sorcery in the air for sure gilbey bustled up i sent word upstairs garrett max says screw you he dont care if youve got venageti rangers on the roof and commandos in the kitchen we go ahead with the show he says its time to earn your keep i hope his arithmetic is better than mine because i flat dont like the way things are adding up an uproar arose in the ballroom feminine shrieks preceded bellows of masculine laughter ohoh i had a bad feeling but headed that way anyhow my bleak premonition was dead on my partners control had slipped the goddamn parrot had done something women were trying to catch him men stood back offering valuable parrotstalking advice it occurred to me that i wouldnt enjoy myself much if that foulbeaked feather duster fled to me for help mom garrett didnt raise her boy to die for the sins of overtrained pigeons and nobody out there looked smart enough to believe i wasnt fooling around with some kind of ventrical locationism one of these days morley dotes one of these days arent you going to do something alyx asked and admit i know that babbling vulture but he wants to run his beak let him suffer the consequences manvil do we have enough friendlies to watch all of the serving staff gilbey made a noise like a infants whimper he sputtered in frustration the weiders wanted to throw the social event of the season its legs were wobbling already any more security headaches and the thing might collapse cant you just stay in the middle of them its a big ballroom and therere eighteen guys gresser had hung on he protested theres sixteen sir sixteen that was what was contracted righteous indignation bubbled off the man i wont provide more than my specific commitment i counted eighteen heads gresser twice you got many twoheaded employees the difference might be why gresser never heard of trace or carter though why dont we take care of this therere at least two imposters in your crew collect them up oh gods this is terrible im ruined no one will hire me gresser please well lie for you on your wedding night just dont hold us up now yes sir gresser hustled off to assemble his troops changeable sort gilbey observed where did you find him gilbey shrugged genord picked him hes supposed to be good mr gilbey mr gilbey gresser was back lance mac was right behind him lance looked grim alyx who had begun prowling out of boredom headed our way too mr gilbey yes mr gresser mr gilbey it is my sorrowful and shamed duty to admit that this gentleman was correct there were more men here than i hired they all agree there were more than sixteen estimates vary from eighteen to twenty i cant understand how that happened i concern myself deeply with the sanctity of my clients persons and properties im sure there were only sixteen of them when we entered the service gate ill bet gresser found himself in sudden deep sludge and wanted his butt covered when the brown stuff flew lance confirmed my suspicions a couple of waiters just did a dash into the kitchen i couldnt find them again when i looked alyx said garrett i just saw a waiter take off i know lance says two of them just headed into the kitchen not the kitchen this one grabbed a food tray and went into the ballroom another one i asked or one of the two gilbey frowned at gresser how many bandits did you bring i added my most ferocious glower to manvils gresser glowered back sullenly defiant we werent going to make this his fault we enjoyed a veritable glowerfest lance added his glower to ours and slid into position behind gresser i only hire them the little man protested for big jobs like this sometimes i have to take on people at the last minute that i dont know i explained that i asked anybody think the man is too enthusiastic in his protests yeah way too bet you he never saw any of those men before today gilbey acquired a remote look lance stick close to ty garrett im going to send some men to watch over max check in when you can will do meantime ill prowl wherever these villains go theyll stand out i was worried those guys had to have a definite plan stockwell and wendover didnt look like commando types but didnt have to be had i not been here they wouldnt have been found out which was cause for speculation how much had i been calculated into their plans i had to be first they tried to enlist me then they tried to scare me black dragon valsung had some strong interest in weider brewing i would worry what later right now we had baddies in the house probably not inclined to be good guests i glanced around lance and gilbey had left alyx and gresser awaited instructions carry on mr gresser make this the best damn shindig you can ill try not to bother you again and ill stop thinking bad thoughts about you he bowed damn was he eager to please you do realize that nobody is happy with you right now he bobbed his head stared at the floor scoot alyx said i dont trust that man garrett hes tiny and hes slimy and every time he looks at me i feel like he wants to pull my clothes off wow youre as smart as you are cute of course he wants to pluck you naked id worry about a guy who didnt give it a thought that improved her mood she began to look at me like she hoped i might indulge in some plucking myself i didnt need to open that hogshead of worms not tonight i quipped maybe he wants to wear your stuff himself how about you keep an eye on him for me what happened to tinnie the redhead had become as scarce as carter and trace i dont know she was irked that i would even ask when i was with her and some banter about getting more comfortable was on her own agenda she was here a minute ago ah well might be better not to have her underfoot i said im going to prowl before really big trouble caught up with me right here right now i took the main stairs to the second floor bad guys headed up wouldnt use an open route though so i set course for the back stairs after pausing outside weiders study door nothing loud was happening in there and there was no one on the floor except the people in that room i could hear nothing but the musicians tuning up downstairs i climbed the service stair cautiously the way these spooks faded out indicated a fair knowledge of the layout that suggested inside intelligence which wasnt a thought i cherished i had no weapon sharper than my wits which meant those guys might not have much trouble disarming me and the ones id bested before would be laying for me somebody fooled somebody or maybe i fooled myself i was sure i would run into an ambush getting to the third floor but nothing happened i didnt find anybody on that level either though i didnt check one suite the old mans own was sacrosant hannah was in there committed to the long slow process of dying miserably everyone else was downstairs a spinestiffening scream clawed its way downstairs tom would not join the festivities either but this shriek seemed different had the devils in his mind taken concrete form i didnt abandon caution i did feel naked without my headknocker but that thing just didnt go with formal attire i needed a fancydress something maybe a cane that could be applied to admonitory effect in genteel surroundings maybe a sword cane good for thumping and stabbing morley carries one of those i saw nothing useful around me the weider house is sparsely furnished above the second floor not even an old mace or morningstar decorated the walls all the stuff from downstairs was piled at one end of weiders study now out of temptations way another scream this one spoke of true physical anguish were my missing servants torturing tom why bother assume somebody had a grudge left over from the cantard how could he get any satisfaction out of hurting somebody who didnt know who he was tom lived in a world no one else could enter nothing made sense that was only because i didnt have enough information so the dead man would remind me the bad boys wouldnt be confused about what they were trying to do i heard a light step on the stair below me just out of sight around one of the tight turns somebody was being sneaky without being good at it easy meat if i could get out of sight i sat down and waited alyx appeared on the tight little halffloor landing she was watching her feet as she moved with exaggerated care she squealed when she noticed me got to watch where youre going darling i told her which by the way would be where what why are you up here im looking for you she made big eyes she could do cute and dumb really well but she couldnt work that one on me no sir not even when she leaned forward so the view down her bodice was open all the way to her waist not much i was onto her tricks i saw you go into the back stairs youre just as dangerous as you think you are alyx or maybe more so you get me boiling like an unwatched pot but weve both got to get along with tinnie alyx squeezed down beside me those stairs were tight and warm they were awfully warm alyx dont hurt me now garrett i clamped my mouth shut there are times when i can do that alyxs tone suggested that this time would be a good one shh alyx rested a warning hand on my knee i nodded id heard it someone had entered the stairwell above us carefully barely making the door whisper i signed alyx to stay still she nodded i shifted my weight slightly they made enough racket up there to let me rise without giving myself away i helped alyx rise too i pointed downward slow careful i mouthed not even whispering alyx was pale now this was no game carter didnt see me till it was too late to help himself he was burdened with the downhill end of a body backing downward hey carter he jumped at the bodys nether end trace froze i popped stockwell under the ear he sagged i thumped him a few more times while wendover gaped somebody still out of sight barked whats happening i climbed over carter trace groaned he was trying to hold all the weight at his end its me again i told the guy from the stable i need to see your invitation wendover went right on trying to keep the body from falling whether dead or alive i couldnt tell the guy from the stable came down behind trace he was angry i thought he might jump over trace to get at me he settled for slamming his fist into a wall so hard he dented the plaster he retreated whimpering and blowing on his knuckles trace finally let go and took off himself i was almost close enough to grab him i leapt got a pinch of his trouser leg not smart garrett even a clerk can hurt you when hes scared good old trace kicked me in the chops oh that hurt and me with bruises on bruises already still not recovered from my last adventure my eyes watered trace seized the day he undertook the oneman version of the retrograde action the corps would call an attack to the rear i was beginning to think that me and trace werent ever going to get to be good buddies somebody grabbed my leg the way id grabbed wendovers i fell on the body lying there facetoface with it i decided that it had to be tom the screamer the face was that of an older less vigorous ty weider was he breathing maybe no time garrett somebody is trying to pound you actually the somebody was climbing me like a ladder carter wanted to get back up the stair bright boy he only needed to get by alyx on the downhill side i sat up so i could pretend to defend myself alyx who had not listened and gone downstairs yanked off a shoe and clouted stockwell alongside the head with its heel thwack carter went down for his second nap thanks i wriggled out from under is this tom and why didnt you go when i told you yeah she didnt answer my other question garrett what the hell is happening why would anybody want to kidnap tom it makes no sense all right lets tie this clown up well ask him about it later i wanted to chase the others im no math genius obviously there were still two or three of them and one of me and there was sorcery in it i shouldnt forget that factor tie him up with what alyx asked and she had a point there wasnt one single coil of rope hanging on a convenient hook all right ill find something upstairs whap him again if he gets frisky i wasnt feeling charitable toward mr carter stockwell i hit the fourth floor reluctantly id worked out the math part now it wasnt impossible for a gang of clerks to beat up on a solitary marine if hed lost a step since his glory days the clerks however failed to discern their opportunity with equal clarity they were in evidence no longer the fourth floor was as still as a crypt this was my first visit in years the weider sprats and some senior servants had quarters there suites for the former and ratholes for the latter one door stood slightly ajar i approached carefully must be age making me cautious i miss the old morley dotes used to be whenever i went into something tight morley would be right behind me or even out front if the mood was on him but he was changing he might even go legit really and slide away from the underworld he seemed concerned about growing too old to keep up nobody jumped me when i did dash through that doorway the bad guys were elsewhere handling their business snickering because theyd left me coughing in their dust this was toms room the furnishings were spare a selection of restraints were available on pegs beside the doorway should tom get frisky the air was ripe enough to gag me maybe they should try tom in a different setting something pastoral or sylvan wondering why i bothered what with this world being just one endless bleak season milemarked by pain and death i held my breath and dragged myself out where there was air that was fit to inhale i stood gasping in the hallway while my head cleared amazed that a place could become so infected by its tenants madness or was it the other way around had the room created tom could it be that stifling air someone started to step onto the floor from the main stairway spotted me ducked back i caught just a glimpse of red fabric vanishing i tried to dash over there but a terrible lethargy slowed me i needed me a double shot of ambition just to keep on breathing there was nothing to see when i got there of course i checked the other rooms and suites found no one and nothing interesting where was alyx id expected her to be underfoot again by now despite my instructions as the mists of depression dispersed i grew more alarmed i headed back to the stairwell youre seldom disappointed when you always expect the worst but sometimes youre pleasantly surprised this wasnt one of the latter occasions alyx was out cold somebody had bopped her upside the head and was beating feet down the stairs mr carter stockwell was no longer in evidence tom weider was gone somebody had started undressing alyx before i interrupted not a project any redblooded karentine boy would disdain but i wouldnt consider a stairwell the most romantic site nor are unconscious lovers much to my liking wake up sleepyhead i said alyx snap out of it i considered swatting her the way they do in stories not a bright idea here i had plenty of people unhappy with me already alyx tried to sit up i helped asked what happened are you stupid somebody slugged me i could understand her mood they came from downstairs didnt you hear me yell no it was true i hadnt heard a thing well i did yell loud as i could and when i tried to run away i tripped over tom and got hit before i could get back up she became aware of the state of her clothing whats this you only need to say when it wasnt me i like my girls awake i dont know if i should be glad or have my feelings hurt i wouldnt presume to tell you women always take me the wrong way i assume they do it on purpose im wideawake now sweet as that sounds there isnt time therere bad guys in the house we dont have a clue why any idea what happened to tom they mustve just gone ahead with whatever they were going to do probably come on get yourself together im going to go see your father dont leave me here i dont intend to thats why i want you looking less frazzled oh the merry hoyden reappeared briefly fright chased it away again what do you think is happening i cant even guess i hoped stockwell would help us out stockwell the one who got away ive run into him before his name was carter stockwell do i still look like we just crawled out of the hayloft not quite darn the hoyden was back i kind of hoped somebody would think i got lucky lucky for you now would mean deep slop for me later girl shed changed a lot in the last few years i wont tell if you dont she was a little bit forward now ill bet i thought she seemed like a girl who would want to celebrate her conquests publicly despite alyxs efforts at selfreassembly she drew a hard look from belinda after we invited ourselves into weider s study belinda was head to head with marengo north english when we arrived their discussion seemed very amicable marengos niece was not in evidence the dark side always did get along well with the business community weider rumbled garrett perfect timing we were just talking about you weve got problems boss i said they just tried to kidnap tom they did alyx reminded me shes right i told it quickly then i asked north english you know anything about this black dragon freecorps or its commander colonel norton marengo made an effort to be egalitarian but only because he was a guest where i was held in high regard i doubt that he would have spoken to me ordinarily ive never heard of either one before but im no student of the war i put it behind me when i came home norton and his black dragons may have operated without my permission you sarky rascal they didnt get mine either but i wasnt in the army i didnt spend much time in the cantard proper im not up on all the unit names weider beamed like a cherub he was so pleased to see us kids getting along he told us therell be a bunch of generals in here later garrett ill ask questions i noted you dont seem much worried about tom how likely is it that anybody could carry someone out of here unnoticed tonight i dont know they got in they have a plan they must have a getaway scoped all the suicide commandos got used up in the cantard weider was not alone there with belinda and north english staying quiet but handy were several men from the brewery docks weider told them you boys spread the word about what you just heard and tell gilbey to come up tell everybody to watch for kittyjo too i told them i havent been able to find her max these people have some kind of sorcery going if you take your eyes off them even for a second they disappear that angle was scary it could mean black dragon valsung had dangerous connections on the hill weirder and weirder weider grumbled why me i dont know three people in the sorcery racket and none of them by their first names they wouldnt pussyfoot either theyd stomp me like a bug fire danced in the fireplace weider went to stare into the flames he crooked a finger calling me away from the others he murmured am i going to get hurt again at the moment he seemed lost stormtossed without compass or anchor not if i can help it i promised i gave north english a hard look he didnt melt somebody probably looked at him hard before he was all tempered up alyx hugged her father dont worry daddy garrett will take care of everything which garrett was that i wondered this one hadnt shown me a lot so far weider settled into a comfortable chair he looked befuddled unable to keep up with events i didnt blame him though that was a side of him new to me north english said i gather youre not in sympathy with the aims of the call mr garrett that was a leading remark if ever i heard one but i am in sympathy very much so i just have trouble with some of the individuals involved some of your biggest big mouths are they really the kind of guys we want telling us how to run our lives not to mention that most of them arent really interested in rights at all they just think they can grab something for themselves north english eyed me warily as though hed opened his breadbox and found a snake smiling back the most heartfelt cause will accumulate fanatics and exploiters mr garrett thats human nature its unfortunate but its difficult to recruit calm rational activists like yourself now who was shitting who us calm rational activists should keep the wildeyed woolyhaired types under control they alienate more people than they convert north englishs eyes narrowed he didnt like being lectured by one of the unwashed in his secret heart he approved of the calls excesses it doesnt take long for any of us to weave elaborate webs of justification and selfdeception i didnt think much of north english but he was max weiders friend and relway did hope i could slide inside the movement i suppose im still bitter about my runin with some of your rogue nutcases a while back north englishs negotiations mask came out yes i heard about that we do try to weed that sort out which is why so many splinter groups form those men were weeds already scheduled to be pulled i entertained a suspicion that marengo had misspoken but refrained from making myself less ingratiating than my history and social standing rendered me already relway wouldnt do me any favors if i wasnt in a position where i could help him please excuse me i said im just cranky ive been trying to help mr weider and things havent gone well i understand see me when youre in a better mood the call is looking for me like you men who have been south and who have seen the worst and have given their best and have returned to face indifference ingratitude or outright disdain men who came home to find everything they fought for controlled by creatures who did nothing to defend it pardon me without my niece to restrain me i tend to rant unfortunately ranting isnt a good way to attract worthwhile new friends either marengo north english was one of the richest men of karenta wealth is a superb insulator why did he find it emotionally fulfilling to involve himself in a workingclass movement guys at his level didnt come home to find there was no work they never worked anyway garrett mr weider time is passing yes sir that was as close as ever he came to telling me how to do my job i was lost i didnt know how to attack the thing and the complications would increase as more guests arrived these invaders if they were around still could be anybody in a waiters outfit and if they had applied half a brain while planning they would have arranged not to be handicapped by that the costume was just a way to get past the door i had a horrible thought an awful recollection really carter and trace had been inside my house within yards of the dead man but he hadnt caught a whiff of their villainy another horrible thought trotted in right behind the first it scarred my brain with its little cloven hooves the boys knew how to get around the weider house entirely too well alyx followed me whatre we going to do now i stood at the head of the stair that led down to all the excitement good question find yourself a safe place they might try to grab you or kittyjo or ty ty couldnt run and lance was no fighter wont i be safe if i stay with you the problem is i might not be safe with you oh garrett you say the sweetest things lets find gilbey gilbey was swamped the mob was arriving faster than the majordomo could holler genord would have a sore throat come morning what gilbey demanded peckish theyve grabbed tom at least three men were involved probably four they used the back stairs tom was alive but out cold when i tried to take him back also i cant find kittyjo i saw her a minute ago coming down the main stairs shes hard to miss shes wearing bright vermillion damn another one wholl want to see max privately he turned to greet a spear shaft of an elderly gent i recognized belatedly as a retired cavalry brigadier gilbey continued ill get word to the men watching the doors the old man sent word already wont hurt them to hear it twice keep looking they cant get out im on the job boss i muttered i moved off as gilbey offered a slight bow to the brigadier the old soldiers gaze tracked me looked like he thought he ought to know me maybe he had me confused with somebody else alyx stayed a step behind as i headed for the service area gresser pounced on me what am i going to do i no longer have enough men to cover misplace some more troops his cheeks reddened a vein in his temple throbbed your name is garrett i havent had a chance to change it i dont want to apologize for my failings again garrett if youd like to discuss something positive that might be done lets do recrimination wastes both our time point taken heres the problem the guys who sneaked in with your crew have grabbed tom weider i dont know why and it doesnt really matter i have this urge to mess them up though any ideas about how they might get out i didnt expect any help cynical in my old age i figured gresser was in on it somehow around the edge they might grab one of the catering vans the which the specialty baked goods the pastries and sweetmeats all come in from outside the delivery vehicles are in the back court the kitchen help brings stuff in so we can replace what the guests consume mr gresser i take back every wicked thought i ever had about you ill put in a good word with mr weider that might help but what can i do about being shorthanded have everybody use two hands instead of one i dont know its your area of expertise alyx tugged my sleeve garrett they might be taking tom away right now i let myself be led away alyx told me you looked like you needed rescuing i dont know sometimes you just have to be rude my mom insisted on good manners toward everyone this way alyxs manners were good only when that wasnt inconvenient her route wasnt very direct i spied tinnie in the distance headed our way would alyx be trying to avoid her i waved when the blond wouldnt notice tinnie waved back so did a handsome woman much older than me who seemed thrilled because shed caught the eye of such a goodlooking fellow alyx said sometimes you got to be rude to rescue yourself but i cant especially when im near a beautiful woman i thought you were worried about tom at the moment alyx just wanted to be friends good friends right here right now my wellknown unshakable resolve was wobbling like gelatin and my capacious capacity for withstanding torture was approaching its limit if i didnt get out of that unused pantry fast i was going to become the closest friend alyx had that pantry had missed spring cleaning for years i started sneezing then alyx started i staggered into the passageway outside tinnie materialized coming from the rear of the house whither we had been headed there you are i was beginning to think you got lost were looking for tom alyx said from behind me not the least embarrassed she was surprisingly presentable considering what shed been trying to do seconds ago those men took him from his room garrett stopped them once but they sneaked up behind us and got tom away again manvil says they couldnt have gotten out of the house yet so we were looking in all the outoftheway places only mr gresser said maybe they couldve tinnie wasnt fooled her glance said we were going to talk later she asked why would they want your brother alyx shrugged reverting to the shy naive child she used to be pulling it around her like a cloak of invisibility i wondered if she hadnt been faking when she was younger old man weider might not be as much in control as he thought he for sure fooled himself about kittyjo back when kittyjo had been more determined than alyx and in those days there were fewer interruptions i wasnt eager to renew our acquaintance kittyjo was a little past neurotic she was one of those people who hide it well initially i said gresser mightve been right about the vans theres so much dust around here wed know right away if anybody got dragged through alyx snapped somebody is going to explain how come it built up like this too it was a short way to a rear exit tinnie had to have come in through it to have approached from the direction she had you see anything out there red i opened the door and leaned outside exactly what you see right now what i saw was two cooks helpers lugging trays none of the wagons were big enough to require more than one horse lets look them over alyx announced im not getting horse dukey all over my new shoes tates best shoes too i would hope moments ago she was willing to get anything all over her new dress i didnt mention it that would be different tinnie wondered why dont you go back to the ballroom alyx ty cant handle it all forever and nicks is in no mood to carry him alyx didnt want to entertain alyx didnt want to do anything that alyx didnt want to do alyx had to do some growing up yet but that was something else she wouldnt want to do i stepped into the yard while the ladies chatted there were five wagons i dismissed two right away they couldnt carry anybody away i considered the others maybe one would tell me it was more than it pretended they were all seedy that dont mean much today you dont see anything new anymore i cant recall the last time i saw a building under construction before i went to war maybe when i was a kid people fix what they can and make do with the rest i checked the dray animals the great villains of this world horses have most humans fooled the bad guys animal might be as blackhearted as its masters and give itself away one was sound asleep a second was trying to get there the beast between those two though watched me sidelong from under lowered lashes with way too much malevolent interest a gelding it had a notion to get even by avenging its disappointment on me and cautious though i am around those monsters i got a step too close it snapped at me i dodged nimbly suffering only the loss of a few decorative buttons from my left sleeve youre the one i grumped got to be the one the beast wore hobbles that said plenty dray animals dont usually need hobbling not in the city it watched as i moved to check its wagon showing me big ugly horse teeth in a huge equine sneer why not just snooze in the traces like your pals another horsey sneer filled with contempt for all oldtimers and their slave mentalities the wagons side was made to fold out and lift up it was secured by a wooden pin on a leather thong i pulled the pin grabbed a pair of thoughtfully placed handles and lifted somebody whacked my bean with a gunnysack full of horseshoes i fluttered down into the darkness like a spinning maple seed i dont recall hitting bottom or the cobblestones whichever came first i groaned and cracked an eyelid couldnt be morning already could it damn not another hangover thered been too many of those lately an angel drifted into view she whispered i didnt understand but i had some good ideas about what i wanted her to say id take her up on it just as soon as i learned how to breathe again i mumbled i mustve died and gone to heaven thats the way things went in my mothers religion the angel continued talking i began to catch her words dont feed me any of your mouth manure garrett ive known you too long oh its the other place i always suspected you demons were gorgeous redheaded wenches or maybe the other way around flattery will get you everywhere garrett promises promises what hit me i patted the top of my bean i found no unusual number of soft spots couldnt have been a bird taking target practice unless maybe it was my bird i dont know when i finally talked alyx into letting up on you i came out and found you right there a man was getting set to hit you again i yelled the kitchen help came out so he ran away what about the wagon which wagon the one that was sitting here i was just going to check it out when that chunk of sky bounced off my noggin there was no reason she should have noticed that particular wagon i think weve got a problem a big problem if my fears were on the mark i managed a feeble shuffling jog to the tradesmans gate i recognized the sleepy guard only by subspecies very big very strong very stupid gatecrashers wouldnt get past him no sir did a wagon just leave he checked me from beneath brows like overhanging cliffs i was startled by the fact that they were hairless whore you he growled disgruntled because his nap had been interrupted names garrett chief of security for the weider breweries so i exaggerated a little couldnt hurt it didnt oh yeah i heard about you yeah the simon the pieman wagon went out thats cute aint it whats cute the name like how it rhymes kind of cute and catchy aint it sure i get you nifty keen next question how come you let it go didnt you hear we had bad guys in the house and we didnt want them to leave no the man looked baffled i aint seen nobody but that driver since i come on the bakers and stuff was already here oh hell i said without much volume or any real feeling all right but dont let anyone else leave till you hear from me all right how many bad guys went out with that wagon i told you just the guy driving he was beginning to resent my attention i grunted i hadnt thought that all my bad boys would clear off that easily they had a mission i turned to stomp away tinnie caught my arm she looked up with big fake moon eyes youre so forceful mr garrett her pearly whites looked particularly wicked in the torchlight what i am is irritated i had stitches on my head the other day i ought to wear an iron hat maybe one of those uglyofficer things with the big spike on top i bet i could get one of those cheap these days theyd just hit you somewhere else then you might get hurt you always see the bright side darling i try you could find some other way to waste your life i bet therere all kinds of careers where you dont have to deal with people who try to break your bones ohoh id better see the old man again tom mightve been on that wagon oh did she give me a scary look what a lowlife subjectchanging sewer rat that garrett is some things well never resolve i didnt think before i burst into weiders study id never encountered any reason to excuse myself around the weider place before little time though i spent there i plunged into a silence so sudden it was like the stillness after a thunderclap numerous pairs of eyes measured me marengo north english appeared to be conducting a summit of the chiefs of every nut group in tunfaire every rightsist nut group i didnt see any democrats or roundearthers belinda sat slightly behind north english and to his right partially shadowed the flicker of the fire in the fireplace lent her face a diabolic cast even that freecorps psycho thug bondurant altoona appeared to be intimidated until you experienced it you wouldnt believe that a woman this young and attractive could come across so threatening but no one in that room doubted her capacity for launching major mayhem i glanced around wheres max cool like i butted in on these things all the time its critical i could manage without him but his son was in deep sludge he ought to know he needed a say after a startled moment north english pasted on his paternalistic smile told me max just stepped out to confer with manvil gentlemen this is the garrett fellow miss contague recommended mr garrett wont you join us now that youre here im sure max will return directly i engaged in a brief internal debate decided i ought to find out what gave it was too late to run that wagon down now anyway it could be anywhere in any direction i moved a couple of steps into the room studied the men studying me a prime lot of political blackguards not one was in any danger from the nonhuman side of the community those who werent wealthy like arnes mingle and bondurant altoona had large bands of armed rowdies at their beck cynical me i wondered if the call wasnt just a device meant to separate my nonhuman countrymen from their wealth and community standing north english said garrett these gentlemen and i though separated by points of doctrine all reside in the same ideological camp inasmuch as we were all here we thought it might be provident to pool our thoughts concerning these puzzles that have arisen why tell me weve discovered that none of us is responsible for the attempts to embarrass the weiders max may not support our views but hes a friend to every man here before i could suppress my cynicism and respond he continued earlier you observed that none of us can be sure we know about everything happening in our organizations thats true but were agreed that none of us would ever turn on max belindas nod was barely perceptible she had witnessed the discussion north english forged ahead you said the villains responsible call themselves black dragon valsung that was not a question so i didnt respond none of us knows of any such group nor of a colonel norton weve agreed to start looking into that immediately the group could give our movement a bad name i kept my expression bland they arent imaginary i said several are in the house right now i came to tell max that theyve kidnapped his son tom murmurs looney and mad stood out they knew about tom i offered a sketch of my collisions with carter trace and the guys in the stable i avoided sounding antipathetic toward rightsist philosophy weider and a bodyguard blew into the room the sounds of the revels below came with them the festivities were in full swing garrett damn there you are we found tom how did you know alyx hes all right he was wandering around in the kitchen getting in everybodys way i frowned stared at weider he was so obviously relieved i wasnt something wasnt right something hadnt been right from the beginning but i couldnt pin it down are ty and kittyjo all right tys still holding court i havent seen kittyjo shes sneaking around like a commando nobody sees her for more than a few seconds at a time why did somebody knock me over the head gilbey pushed through the doorway he had tom weider in tow tinnie was a few steps behind them gilbey said i have him under control now max ill take him upstairs luke will stay with him something odd when did he change clothes everyone stared at me i said he was wearing different clothes a little while ago for an instant tom raised his eyes to look at me something hed never done before it was so fleeting i wasnt sure hed actually done it mightve been just a twitch you sure yes and alyx could back me up ill check it out when we get upstairs gilbey said i started to leave so i could help him i was sure the baddies were still around and still had plans marengo north english said would you stay with us a moment more mr garrett how could i resist when he offered the honorific to a man of my low station i shut the door behind weider reluctantly old max left me a meaningful look as he departed i turned to the assembled barons of bugfuckery they stared like they expected me to begin belching green fire i stared like i expected them to spout something incredibly bigoted and stupid finally north english said max tells me that youre very good at what you do i try hard anyway he also insists that youre sympathetic to our goals remotely i believe ive mentioned that myself i inclined my head slightly so i couldnt be convicted when times changed later then why havent you joined one of the rights groups im not a joiner unless you count the marine corps and i wasnt offered my preference that time when i do have a choice i make my own thats why im in the racket im in it lets me be my own boss exactly huh often i hide my razor wits so guys like north english will underestimate me this wasnt one of those times you appear to be the perfect man to winkle out the truth about these black dragon people why not i was working for everybody but the crown prince of venageta already maybe i could get in with black dragon convince carter and trace that i regretted my past transgressions and they ought to hire me to find out what that guy garrett was up to i knew a guy once pokey pigotta who used so many disguises and aliases that he did get hired to investigate himself garrett uh oh yeah sounds good we can work out the financial details ive got some bones to pick with those guys i caressed the back of my head ive been getting bopped way too often lately financial details even us idealists dont get much nutritional value out of serving a righteous cause north english scowled and muttered he was a notorious skinflint bondurant altoona suggested pay the man and get on with it you pinch sceats till the king squeals but put out his ransom in silver for youre right of course north english barked silencing altoona it would be petty of me to quibble over a few coppers he yanked a purse from inside his waistband tossed it at me i snatched it out of the air deftly a few coppers eh i started to tuck the bag into an inside pocket of my waistcoat north english squawked the goddamn parrot would have complimented him on his accent his companions grinned it didnt look like he had many close friends among his own kind he grouched i expect you to take only what you need to compensate yourself for your labors a guys got to try the grins got bigger when i opened the purse my eyes got bigger too what id assumed to be a rich mans walkingaround sack of coppers which might include a silver piece or two in case he ran into something really exciting turned out to be all silver salted with a few pieces of gold swiftly i calculated ten days fees and likely expenses tripled them and applied my special unpleasant crackpot counterdiscount north english didnt see what i took but he danced like a kid with a desperate need to pee silver still isnt cheap despite our triumph in the cantard there were whispers among the others some intentionally loud bets were laid as to whether or not north english would follow through to make sure i added several silver groats in case i ran into some big meal expenses like say with a particular redhead while we were doing research then passed the bag back eyes watched eagerly hoping north english would open it up and reintroduce himself to all the survivors and mourn the departed he resisted temptation ill leave your name with my gateman mr garrett hell have you brought to me immediately if you have anything to report just a glance at the rest of the room told me north english had numerous friends perfectly willing to pay nicely for an opportunity to learn what i discovered before i reported it to the man who had hired me north english told me that should be all for now mr garrett embarrassed he didnt take time to offer specific instructions fine i like it like that means they havent told me what not to do where not to poke excellent i backed out of there weider and his bodyguard were waiting the old man asked whatre they up to in there youd know better than me theyre your friends only a few north english and clive faudie and slink they asked me to invite the others they subsidized expenses they wanted to get all the names in the rights movement together where they wouldnt attract much attention i get along where i can it oils the hinges when i want something myself favor for a favor i understand exactly he nodded toward tinnie im all right well all be all right now you and your friend go have fun thank you i headed for tinnie but i wasnt about to take time off now let me sip a few pints of weider dark reserve and i turn into a dancing fool i made all the girls unhappy i danced with them all tinnie got the most attention but simmered when i took a turn with alyx or nicks or kittyjo once guardedly i even spun a couple with the matron who had fallen in lust with me earlier she told me she was dame tinstall that rang no bells dame tinstall had outstanding legs for a woman of her maturity she made sure i noticed them too alyx was less pleased than tinnie nicks was too friendly for a girl getting engaged though she didnt mention her feelings about that kittyjo who looked like a shopworn version of alyx had little to say good bad or indifferent she did seem willing to let bygones be bygones and dame tinstall left me in no doubt that she wanted to tuck me under her arm and take me home i didnt ask what her husband would think of her plan i took the occasional timeout to nurture my relationship with the bosss product im a very loyal kind of guy i wondered what had become of the goddamn parrot whats the matter tinnie asked somethings wrong with me im worrying about that damned talking ostrich of mine have you seen him yes i wouldnt claim him right now if i were you she had her devil smile on how come he got thrown out of the house youre lucky nobody remembers who he arrived with i hope the owls get him hed asked for it the majordomo genord who hadnt had a chance to yell much lately approached us he bypassed alyx and kittyjo alyx appeared incapable of harboring a kind thought about her big sister kittyjo though seemed only about halfalive and was completely indifferent to alyx the majordomo handed me a folded scrap of paper it had been used and reused a gentleman sent this in he husked he said it was important tinnie scowled sensing more trouble i feared she was psychic just when the evening was starting to roll too but that was my kind of luck wasnt it thank you gerris the note said must see you now critical r the handwriting was primitive r who or what might r be who would know where to find me tonight relway who else and didnt that stir up the mixed feelings now what tinnie demanded her psychic side simmering i dont know but i cant ignore it right now maybe sooner it would be significant i didnt doubt that relway wouldnt contact me unless it really did matter youre going to ditch your date what oh damn no i shouldnt be gone long and she isnt a date tinnie maybe not but i see how she looks at you when youre not paying attention like she wants to devour you kind of like i look at you even when you are paying attention the ghost of a smile twitched the corners of tinnies mouth right garrett try that line when i have time to notice all right ill tell her why you ran out huh that didnt sound promising i know you youll go out there and either get yourself knocked over the head and dragged off or youll get interested in something and forget everything else or therell be a pretty girl and your pigdog nature will take over and you wound me woman now that you acknowledge my existence again how can i possibly stay away more than minutes at a time im wearing new shoes garrett specially made dont pile it up too deep and theyre the most amazing shade of green ive ever seen they set off your eyes perfectly maybe i didnt need to find out what relway wanted not tonight anyway i looked into tinnies eyes for a few long seconds no i definitely didnt want to find out what relway had her devil smile wakened go on take care of it then get your big goofy self back in here well see if maybe this threat to the weiders doesnt require you to stay all night so everybody is protected whoohoo i moved out with a real bounce to my step mr garrett mr garrett yes mr gresser two more of my men have deserted what am i supposed to do how can i manage why me maybe gilbey and genord were fleeter of foot im here to handle gatecrashers and bad boys gresser not to make sure mr weiders guests are well served youre the professional surely you know your business better than i why not grab a tray yourself i pushed past him i almost made it before alyx caught up she pushed up close radiating availability wherere you going garrett she looked so damned kissable i had to bite my tongue why is it always feast when i cant do anything about it and famine when i can ive had an emergency message kid ive got to go out for a few minutes but ill be right back i glanced back to see if tinnie was scowling i didnt see her i did see kittyjo watching from a shadow thirty feet away she didnt look nostalgic for the good old days when wed been very close friends till she changed her mind she did look troubled i winked at alyx and headed for the door maybe kittyjo would warn her off me that would be useful i dont deal well with temptation morley has a personal rule he recommends often yield to temptation whenever you can because every opportunity might be your last i dont subscribe to that completely yielding could bring on the lastness but im weak when blonds brunettes or redheads are part of the temptation on the other hand a good rule of thumb would be never get involved with a woman crazier than you are the trick there is to recognize the craziness before you get pulled in some hide it well kittyjo did as i departed a rawthroated gerris genord began to croak for attention it was time ty and nicks made their announcement i stopped to see the security guys out front they knew me i told them id be right back i stepped into the street watching for the goddamn parrot as well as whoever wanted to see me i didnt expect relway himself relway prefers to stay out of sight but the little guy emerged from the darkness like a whispering ghost i squeaked you startled me sorry like hell he smirked sorry about interrupting your evening too but you have to see this its big enough to bring you out personally im here because every player in the rights game is here thats significant something i have to look over with my very own eyes i wondered if he had people inside i wondered again aloud as we walked i got only silence in response which was answer enough for me it was likely that several of gressers workers were secret police poor mr gresser its quiet tonight i observed that wasnt a good sign really not in tunfaire where by day or by night completely quiet streets generally mean big trouble very the silence deepened as we walked the flicker of torchlight shone around a corner we had walked only a few blocks to the far side of the brewery the torchlight had no noise attached no excitement we werent headed toward a street party or toward a riot we turned a corner there was my missing wagon there was my venomous new equine acquaintance four men surrounded them three carried torches the fourth held a short spear to the spine of a man lying facedown in the street two of the torchbearers wore gressers corporate livery how did they get away unnoticed hell they didnt gresser did complain but the guys covering the front hadnt mentioned them were they relways people too of course they were which meant they were everywhere too bad i couldnt con them into doing my job for me the wagon was open on the side id been about to investigate when somebody decided to put me away for the night or a slab of sky had fallen on my noodle relway told me these guys saw you get knocked down they thought it might be interesting to trail the wagon and see what was going on i forbore complaint i now had a notion about one guard who might be in with relway the fellow with the spear forced the captive to keep his head turned away relway didnt want his face seen these four would be among his best and most trusted men then i tried to memorize their faces without being obvious shit i said softly when i looked inside the wagon this is what i was afraid of when three corpses had been stuffed in there two were naked tom weider still wore the dirty nightwear hed had on when i was wrestling carter and trace aw shit i said again i couldnt express my despair any more articulately this would crush the old man you know them these two are weiders kids tom and kittyjo the other one worked on the brewerys shipping dock his name was luke he was helping tonight because he liked his boss i dont think he was getting paid he had four kids we got a major problem here friend an enigma compounded by a mystery as they say please be a little more specific i saw all of these people in obvious good health inside the weider place after this wagon left i saw kittyjo as i was coming out the door to meet you relway grunted that doesnt sound good listen we had gatecrashers who kept disappearing into the crowd whenever you werent looking but we never came up short on a head count relway had to say the nasty word first shapeshifters im willing to bet or at least somebody who always has some pretty tricky little spells handy changers have never been a problem here but but the colonel got a letter off the hill out of the blue he didnt share all of it but it had to do with shapeshifters weve got all these outsiders coming in some might be shapeshifters some up there would be interested traditionally shapeshifters have preferred to play their deadly games where there are no sorceresses or wizards to winkle them out they arent a beloved breed as they do with vampires most races murder shifters as soon as they give themselves away i didnt want to entertain the possibility until now i continued you never want to see anything this ugly shapeshifters have murdered people and replaced them for a lifetime but not often they prefer to hit and run impersonating someone theyve gotten to know well briefly without killing anyone even when they do commit murder they change guises frequently few have the ability to hold a shape and age it and fewer can fool families and lovers for very long their ultimate provenance is uncertain they appear to be human most of the time maybe like vampirism their malleability is the result of some bizarre disease what does seem to be true or at least what everyone believes to be true is that shapeshifters cant survive very long as themselves they have to mimic maybe they even have to kill occasionally in order to appropriate a new soul they dont appear to be related to werewolves though i expect they could become werewolves if they had one to pattern from anybody got any silver relway asked that made sense as vampires and werewolves do shapeshifters supposedly find silver poisonous relway wanted to run a test nobody volunteered so i fished out one of marengo north englishs groats the smallest silver coin i had youve got to minimize your risks looks like your racket pays better than mine does relway chided he knelt beside the captive i repeated my morality tale about the nutritional value of idealism relway laughed his life must be more fulfilled nowadays he didnt use to have a sense of humor relway slit the prisoners shirt down it back ill open his skin and flay it back so you can tuck the coin underneath he tapped the captives back in the spot you and i cant reach without a stick if they really dont like silver well just let him hurt till he offers to help us find out what we want to know he never spoke to the captive directly he carved with no more emotion than a battlefield surgeon the silver hurt the changer from the instant it touched him he twitched spasmed shook fought back a scream with every gasping breath relway said stay alert that letter was right this could attract more of them they supposedly touch one another mind to mind i noted shadows moving in the surrounding shadows did you bring a whole army enough so i could handle any rightsist trouble if it happened shapechanger minds were like a loghyrs might that explain why the dead man hadnt seen what trace and carter were ive never heard that about them being mind readers that could mean real trouble not like your roomie they can only read other shifters and only for general emotion not specific thoughts you sure no garrett im not somebody told the colonel he told me just in case he didnt tell me why he likes to pretend the hill doesnt really influence him did anything interesting happen in the weider place did you get a chance to spy on the big meeting i was mostly too busy i got in once by accident nobody gave anything away but while i was there they asked me to investigate the black dragon bunch you accepted that commission i hope thats what i said did i that groat youre abusing came out of north englishs own purse no i thought he squeezed them till they squealed the prisoner groaned he wouldve screamed if hed had any breath left relway covered his mouth and nose with a hand just to make life more difficult let me know when youre ready to talk a scuffle broke out in the darkness it lasted for several seconds i still marvelled at the absence of witnesses tunfairens always scatter at the first hint of trouble but once they feel safe personally they usually come back looking to be entertained maybe the changers were radiating some stayaway emotion so potent even humans felt it but then why would i be hanging around damn i said if these things really do read each other from a distance the ones at the house will realize that theyve been found out not necessarily not if they just feel emotions how did you know they were out here tonight block no i didnt know anything till i stopped the wagon which i did because i thought it might have something to do with what the rights people are scheming i wasnt looking for what i found seems like a lot of trouble just to keep an eye on the rights guys i gestured at the surrounding night theyre dangerous people garrett until i caught this thing here i wouldve said that rightsists are the biggest danger karenta faces they get people hurt and killed and businesses destroyed and its only going to get worse i cant just let that happen but the danger posed by these things might be even darker i think he passed out i indicated the changer so he did relway let the thing breathe you know anything about shapeshifters garrett no i ran into one once a venageti spy whod replaced a karentine counterintelligence officer thats it relway sat down on the changer ready to use his hand i was afraid of that of what not yet maybe this thing can confirm my suspicions relways men dragged someone over this one shifted slowly between several sets of features i recognized none of them relway searched it after making sure the other one would remain unconscious this is interesting he showed me a tattoo on the new captives right forearm it was black it resembled a dragon though the light could have been better it incorporated a simple karentine army crest that is interesting i do believe ill have to do some digging i suspect an untold story has begun to surface the changer recovered his features became fixed the tattoo faded we pretended not to have noticed it i glanced at the wagon i need to go break the news and grab the villains still inside bring the bodies back the old man will want them you need help send your waiters back mr gresser will be infinitely grateful relway grinned he had an allnew and challenging bunch of bad boys to eradicate i told him let me know what you get from those two goes without saying long as you let me know about the crowd in there theyre dividing turf making peace with the outfit and making rules about who they can and cant push around they dont want to irritate anybody who can send troops out and they dont want to waste time fighting each other ah too bad about that belinda contague is there speaking for her father a genuinely hard woman and so young out of a privileged household makes you wonder youre a friend of the family how come we see so much of her now and so little of her father chodo had a stroke he doesnt want people to see him until he recovers they might think hes getting weak but hes as hard as ever and getting meanspirited besides anything new on crask and sadler no but theyre out there those two were worth worrying about they were nightmares ill take these three to the alkhar relway told me drop by and find out what they had to say his people would wait outside the weider shack while i rounded up the changers inside i want these bodies i reminded go ahead take them i folded the door shut before he changed his mind pinned it climbed to the drivers seat i gathered the reins like they were covered with slime told relways thugs you guys want to make sure this monster stays headed in the right direction monster and thugs eyeballed me the horse smirked one of the thugs their names were ritter and abend but their attitudes left them undeserving of remembrance said you cant drive a cart get down from there i can drive a cart i muttered if i really want to i can drive a cart but im going to let you do it this time i can drive a cart i learned in the corps but watching the south end of a northbound beast knowing the critter is looking for a chance to visit disaster upon me isnt my idea of fun the big bruno on the back gate was on the job now he had let this very wagon scoot out along with relways guys whom hed forgotten to mention which you just naturally had to wonder about but now nothing was going to get past him whats my name i demanded youre garrett and whats my job youre in charge of bingo im in charge and im telling you to let us in but you never said nothing about im saying it now i gave you some hard road about letting this wagon get away then i went and got it back open the gate but relways men ran out of patience they vaulted the low wall and opened the gate the guard raised a loud fuss gilbey arrived before i finished proving i could drive a wagon and got it parked of course it might be sunrise before i got the best out of the damned fourlegged snake pulling the vehicle gilbey said i thought you went home with dame tinstall garrett your friend is fit to be tied which friend is that the one who came with you what have you got here i opened the side door there was light enough from the house gilbey threw his right forearm up against the side of the wagon closed his eyes froze that way he controlled himself before he asked whats going on shapechangers i told him what id been doing it explains a few things i just saw kittyjo now i see why she was staying out of the way tonight when she was so excited about everything this afternoon any idea why a shapeshifter gang would want to take over the weider family because they like beer because they want a brewery that wasnt some attempt at black humor gilbey meant it ill bite why would they want a brewery why right now better ask them garrett anyway the brewery might not have anything to do with it what now much as i hate to we have to tell the boss he seemed exasperated of course we do i mean what do we do about these monsters we need to catch them dont we sure and we need to move fast before they get the word change appearance and get away i think there are only three still here the others took the corpses away undetected and unchecked i was sure the changers still in the house would have brought in more of their own the weider place would have become a changer fortress and haven but why the weiders there were other families as wealthy others more iconoclastic others better forted up but suppose the presence of the leaders of the rights movement had something to do with it suppose the changers had come in because of the guest list suppose marengo north english and bondurant altoona got replaced they were goofy already would anybody notice whatever it couldnt be meant longterm shapechanger schemes get found out we liked to think anyway in tunfaire some real heavyweights would trample all over them once the news got around by tomorrow there ought to be a hue and cry the rightsists would be in deep clover shapechangers scare everybody alienists make fortunes proving to losers that their loved ones havent been possessed by demons or replaced by shifters or the other way around if thats where the profit is alienists are like lawyers right wrong justice the facts of the case none of that matters results are what count thats usually somebody else with empty pockets and a dazed expression the alienists client doesnt want to believe his beloved no longer loves somebody as wonderful as him the explanation has to be supernatural and sinister changers have served as excuses for murder too though it seems the corpses never change after death no murderer ever got off using that excuse i told gilbey we wont make anything happen standing around trying not to cry belinda was in the hallway outside weiders study standing delightfully hipshot listening to marengo north english the man had to have a side id overlooked she seemed enthralled he seemed to have forgotten his niece belinda spotted me her expression went colder than arctic stone then she recognized the damp around my eyes what happened garrett you two come with us max is there isnt he north english nodded he hasnt made it downstairs yet too many visitors so marengo and belinda had been standing around chatting for a while interesting gilbey remarked ty will be getting cranky he dislikes taking second priority i opened the study door slowly max was seated in front of his fireplace deep in a comfortable chair hed built the fire high the heat beat out in waves he stared into the flames as though he saw through them into an age when the world knew no suffering back again garrett yes sir your friend was furious because you left she gets that way my friend winced i had to see about something outside whats the news then how bad is it as bad as it gets tom and kittyjo have been murdered so has luke gilbey said thats the man we asked to look out for tom i said the change happened before that change weider muttered they were replaced by shapeshifters gilbey said i added it looks like black dragon is a shapeshifter cover it claims to be a rights group but its really something else nonhumans wouldnt be interested in human rights not quite the way the call is weider sighed im tired garrett he told me he sounded tired to the marrow sit down manvil garrett he indicated chairs i just want to put my burdens down i want to take a long long rest i dont have any fight left if there was anybody to surrender to id let destiny make me a prisoner of war you did your share max gilbey said take it easy garrett and i will handle it gilbey glanced at me i nodded he asked should we enlist lance lance strikes me as more the executive sort gilbey smiled not far from wrong garrett though the man can surprise you sometimes he twisted looked beyond me his eyes gleamed for an instant ill help belinda said id almost forgotten she was back there listening i didnt argue neither did gilbey i was beginning to develop a suspicion that gilbey would be incapable of arguing with belinda he told us that junk in the corner there was mostly for decoration but there was a time when all of that was real weapons help yourselves without hesitating belinda selected a wicked fourteeninch blade examined it with a professional eye gilbey chose a bronze gladius sort of thing and added a small coordinated buckler for the left wrist stylish i observed sighing now that i was sitting down i didnt want to get back up gilbey didnt smile except for miss contague he was all smiled out for the century nobody else smiled either i miss the old days nobody grins into the face of the darkness anymore you need a sense of humor when the going gets grim seldom do i lug lethal hardware but i couldnt find a simple headknocker anywhere at least nothing sure to stand up to harsh commercialgrade use a small crossbow intended for use by cavalrymen or centaurs caught my eye i used to be pretty good with one of those things though i hadnt had one in hand for a while marengo north english considered the choices gilbey suggested why dont you stay with max hes a little distracted north english relaxed visibly obviously the great champion of humanity volunteered only because of belinda oh what to do when the delicate flower chose danger without thought gilbey picked up a light thinbladed antique ive heard you were well regarded as a fencer he extended the weapon to north english when i was young good i said then we wont have to worry about max while were gone i gave his shoulder a comradely pat he puffed up like hed been handed the key role in the mission maybe in his mind thats what happened he seemed incapable of seeing himself anywhere very far off center we slipped into the back stairs i told belinda you dont have to do this i know and you didnt have to warn me dont waste your breath i wasted no breath id argued with her before and the stairs were steep i was shaky when we reached the fourth floor id been pushing my luck a lot lately and fate wouldnt give me time off for bad behavior it was one damned thing after another too often involving me getting hit over the head you cant roll the bones with the sickletoting guy without crapping out sometime i controlled the shakes i learned that trick in the corps the hard way i took a deep breath held it a moment asked gilbey is there more than one way out of toms suite possibly therere servants passages all through the house but if we hurry that shouldnt be a worry indeed and maybe i should have had relways guys stick with me just in case belinda said if i knew where we were going id leave you behind just to make you stop thinking garrett all my life ive been told i think too much except at girl time when im told i dont think enough so it goes you cant win i stepped into the hallway the luke replacement was standing guard right where luke was supposed to be his eyes narrowed suspiciously i pasted on a big grin belinda and gilbey marched along behind me i said hey luke the old man says bring tom down he wants the whole family there for the announcement whoever luke was really he couldnt argue without giving himself away he couldnt let tom out without courting disaster and i didnt give him time to consider his options a crossbow isnt a customary accessory when youre just going to escort somebody somewhere inside his own home fauxluke figured that out almost quickly he flung himself back just as i started to pop him with my free hand he tried to run into toms suite we didnt let him but he did make a big racket not getting there he went down belinda had a knife pricking his throat before he stopped bouncing gilbey and i burst into the suite and i said well there is more than one way out it stood open there was no light behind the panel except what ambled in from toms apartment that was just enough to show us that the shapeshifter could only head downstairs this almost qualified as a secret passageway it was barely wide enough for a grownup my size the stairwell was just slightly less steep than a ladder i thundered down to the floor below another door stood open exiting through a broom closet the main hall lay beyond it gilbey stayed with me we couldnt let the shifter get a big lead it would change faces on us again a door stood open down the hall still moving my mother would have been all over this guy he was a wonderful bad example we blew into the room and froze it was hannah weiders bedroom it smelled of sickness and despair the dying woman had been confined there for ages her face brightened when she saw us she tried to say something hannah weider was so withered and liverspotted she looked more like maxs grandmother than his wife words wouldnt come she wiggled a finger gilbey got it its under the bed trace wendover scooted out he headed for the door realized that i could get there first flung himself back at the bed he snagged hannah dragged her in front of him as a shield a knife appeared he didnt need to voice the threat alyx appeared in the doorway mama i brought you some of tys shit what the hell trace turned startled mama tried to admonish her baby about her language i shot wendover in the forehead i used to be pretty good with one of those things evidently i still had the knack shes gone alyx wailed it was too much for her there was no vinegar in her now she was about to fall apart she shook her mother like that might bring her back belinda arrived she had her changer under control she looked at alyx shrugged gave me a dontlookatme stare i didnt expect her to do any comforting she wouldnt know how i doubt that anyone ever comforted her get tinnie i suggested she knew tinnie or nicks trace had a bolt in his head but he remained active his shape shifted continuously until the bolt popped out it clunked on the floor theres a neat trick i muttered sure like to learn that one alyx jumped on the thing it tossed her across the room i shot it as it got up this time i followed up i pushed a silver groat into its new wound the changer lost control of its muscles i asked gilbey you want i should tell the old man this one still my place garrett but this time might be the one too much hannah was the reason he kept going belindas changer kept sliding out of his restraints he oozed like a slug by trial and error i found that a whack on the side of the head would do to them what it did to me a few yards of silver wire would come in handy about now nicks appeared on cue here garrett she shed silver chain necklaces tinnie will be here in a minute alyx you all right then nicks realized that hannah really was dead the look she gave the changer made me glad she was on my side i asked how come youre here your vampire girlfriend told me to come she had a sharp tongue on her nicks did i used her chains to bind the guy id bashed he started shaking and flopping i thought hed break the chains easily but he didnt gilbey knelt beside me gag them we dont want to upset anybody downstairs tinnie marched in belinda was right behind her the redhead said ty will be here as soon as lance gets somebody to help gilbey shook his head he doesnt need to do that better he should meet us in his fathers study if you ladies will see to hannahs dignity garrett lets drag this garbage downstairs we have another one running loose still i said as i gathered my share i know i know well deal with it i wondered if relway was right that one would know that something had gone wrong max surprised us all horrible news piled atop horrible news prodded him back to life instead of finishing him maybe the pain was just too big to encompass or maybe he was too long in the habit of meeting fate headon he glared at our captives but did not touch he would take a practical businesslike approach to revenge both changers still twitched and flopped they wouldve screamed if not for their gags gilbey left to divert ty and lance marengo north english belinda and nicks had been asked to step out max didnt want to share this with them lance followed ty into the study ty was on crutches you didnt see that much he was pale and angry fuck up again garrett be quiet max said his voice was calm and flat and cold ty responded instantly sit down ty sat likely he hadnt heard that voice in a decade this isnt garretts fault he wanted me to be more careful somebody meant to murder us all tonight who knows why weve stymied them because we let garrett do a little blame the mess on me we did capture five shapeshifters he hadnt been surprised to hear that the secret police were watching the house manvil what about the other one gilbey nodded he must have been up to something five ty croaked he stared at the two squirming in front of the fire that had burned down some now but still put out a lot of heat the changers didnt like that garrett dealt with three more outside the house he didnt mention tom or kittyjo yet he looked at me well get their story if it can be gotten theres another one here in the house ty weider said i expect to deal with it momentarily so gilbey had been up to something i shouldve warned him that the creatures could feel one anothers distress that we know about i reminded changers are almost mythical around here we dont know anything about them we see the giant meateating thunder lizards more often it was a bad time for thunder lizards though worst case i know of and thats probably a fairy tale involved a family of changers that operated in the forest north of town during the last century i didnt figure out what was going on here just because changers are so rare i wouldnt have thought of them at all if weird stuff didnt happen to me all the time i headed for the door weider frowned but understood when i leaned against the wall where id be out of sight when the door opened my timing was impeccable the pseudokittyjo walked in barely a minute later insufficiently suspicious of a summons from the old man that surprised me she didnt seem to sense the distress of the two we had collected already was the silver responsible gilbey stepped over to hold the door when it swung shut there were two of us behind her she didnt understand till she got a look at me ty broke the hard silence whats going on dad this isnt your sister its something that murdered her and took her shape dad kittyjo is dead ty believe it tom is dead lucas vloclaw is dead they were murdered they were replaced by these monsters he indicated the roasting shapechangers i had my little crossbow ready i let the changer have a look what did you things want weider demanded ty didnt get it jo what is this crap he did see that there was something strange about her though she seemed stranger by the second she was changing she was maintaining the outward appearance of kittyjo weider but inside she was doing something that would probably improve her chance of escape or if she was bloodyminded enough she was becoming something fast and deadly i said its changing people the kittyjo thing glared at me gilbey moved the changer turned his way i poked it felt like id slammed my fist into a leather bag full of rocks too the shapechanger didnt go down it just turned on me evidence was accumulating shapeshifters were not overly endowed with intelligence i ducked a blow like a lightning bolt gilbey applied a couple of kidney punches neither had much effect he barked in pain his knuckles leaked blood ty hollered something about leaving jo alone i plinked the thing with my crossbow in the throat my bolt penetrated barely an inch the changer stopped to fiddle with it gilbey was nearer the weapons collection he seized a ferocious antique mace topped the changer a few times i readied another quarrel the shifter decided it didnt want to play anymore it left without bothering to open the door i loosed another bolt it struck the small of the creatures back right in its spine the changer sprawled forward fingertips dangling over the brink of the grand stair i told gilbey i used to be pretty good with one of these things so i see the shifter couldnt get up it tried pulling itself forward that worked it tumbled ass over appetite all the way to the ballroom floor i galloped after it it looked nothing like kittyjo now in fact it had a distinct thunderlizard look developing armor plates clashed with kittyjos dress a nub of a tail wiggled under the red cloth people shrieked the orchestra stopped playing a crowd collected lance joined me over the changer shaking i told him she was probably the first one replaced she would have been the easiest ty joined us having come down by clinging to the stair rail he wanted to hurt somebody he stared at the thing that had replaced his sister and maybe grew up a little he put his anger aside found the hidden weider steel i apologize garrett i was out of line thats all right its tough this is too big for us to squabble amongst ourselves ill buy that ty nodded he scanned the crowd that spine shot was all that stopped it worth remembering still only looks temporary this looked like one of those nightmares where the monster keeps getting up and coming ty said lance giorgi went up to mothers room alyx is up there too theyll need some support i added tinnie should be there too i wondered where belinda was and somebody needed to watch the changers in weiders study max joined us am i presentable he was in control but barely you look fine dad ty replied then lets get our guests calmed down i hefted the little crossbow i had a pocket filled with bolts guests backed away presumably the shifter could become its nasty old self with a little effort i dug out another coin these things were going to break me the shifter expelled my bolt but its legs still refused to work nothing human illuminated its face now the creature was incapable of emotion in this form max stayed with me just a minor problem with a wouldbe assassin its over no need to concern yourselves go ahead enjoy marengo north english materialized among us over the changer sword in hand handsome posing he looked brave as hell he registered no claim that could be challenged but his stance made it seem that he must have been the target of a bizarre murder plot my opinion wasnt improving as i learned more about the man i hadnt seen any proof that he believed what he preached except that he did put cash where his mouth was i had a problem picturing a famous skinflint gushing coin without believing maybe tama montezuma knew the truth she appeared more stunning than ever when she rushed up to see if uncle marengo was all right despite being rattled in the extreme there seemed to be a certain ghastly hollowness to her doink i let the changer have it between the shoulder blades cut its shirt open i told north english i need to get to that wound the changer flopped again eager to go somewhere far from guys with crossbows knives and silver the guests backed away again but continued to watch even the musicians and servants wanted to gawk there wasnt an ounce of compassion in the house what does that say about the human folk of tunfaire valiant marengo stepped forward heroically with an elegant flick of his blade he slit the changers stolen dress the creature kept trying to wriggle away its limbs refused to cooperate i yanked the bolt out and pushed my coin in before the wound closed thiss the last one i hope six was more shapeshifters in one place than id ever heard tell of a few more wouldnt be a real surprise now weider stared at the changer he shook his head i dont get it garrett he was fighting the shakes he had a better chance of understanding than i did it was his house his family his brewery what i understood was he was my friend well find out ty agreed whatever it takes garrett he was shaking too no prisoners no quarter he refused to sit down ill need help dragging these things out of here on cue relways thugs materialized they must have been listening they slipped through the crowd like they were greased where were you guys when i needed some backup i grumbled this needs taking away i have two more upstairs ill show you where weider addressed his guests again please people celebrate be joyful he couldnt fake any joy himself his despair shone through my admiration grew max was like those oldtime aristocrats who had built the empire he soldiered on with what had to be done despite any personal pain he would not yet yield before his duties were satisfied i led relways men to the study one prisoner had slipped his bonds we got there just in time it cost me another groat to get it under control again i was grumbling like marengo before we finished ritter said well take them out the back way youll hear from the chief remind him he promised belinda was waiting when i went back downstairs she asked are we ready to go now i watched north english entertain a gaggle of hangerson flourishing the borrowed sword he seemed particularly animated i must have missed the most exciting part of the adventure a frown darkened his face when he saw me watching but he was too pleased with himself to worry miss montezuma offered me a speculative enigmatic almost frightened glance she looked like a woman who had found a snake in the breadbox though i doubted she would know what a breadbox was again belinda asked can we go now i cant not while there are guests still here and then there was tinnie belinda scowled there was a time not that long ago when you wouldve dropped everything it wasnt true we both knew it go if you need to belinda ill get in touch if youll let me she nodded unhappily belinda contague was powerful and deadly and a sad little girl not to mention dangerously willful sometimes id like to choke chodo for whatever he did to her ill go then she glanced at tinnie dont forget me damn she wouldnt get into a killer contague mood would she chodo got rid of belindas mother because he couldnt stand competition belinda she stalked away she muttered something i didnt hear as she passed tinnie and alyx she paused to say something to marengo north english he seemed startled pleased frightened all at the same time he looked at me speculatively belinda swept up the stairs to the outside door and gerris genord she and the majordomo were gone before i got my thoughts organized events had genord looking bleaker than they did max or gilbey nothing else happened the do was not the ball of the season too much crude excitement for people of refinement our sort dont let these things happen the biggername guests shortened their visits they began leaving soon after belinda those who stayed on were almost exclusively rightsists nabobs and men who wanted a private word with max weider im sure max wasnt much help tinnie didnt stray far the rest of the evening alyx tagged along gamely never grasping the truism that there is no outstubborning a redhead i should have told her i have some experience in the field even diehard friends of the weider and nicholas clans packed it up before the orchestra finished playing ty was unhappy nicks was outright depressed i caught the glimmer of a tear more than one time this is sad tinnie mused we were surveying the grand hall from the vantage of the front entrance gerris genord nodded as though she had spoken to him the man looked like he was fighting an ulcer i feel for nicks garrett if you make a huge sacrifice just to make your family happy it shouldnt turn to shit around you the way this has woman such language for such a delicate stick it in your ear garrett i mean it she didnt get any joy out of tonight i dont think that would be too much to ask in exchange for the rest of her life theres got to be a curse on max weider on the whole damned family it rubbed off as soon as nicks decided to join up i was beginning to wonder if such a curse could actually be managed it seemed unreasonable that a mans only luck ever had to be bad without really seeing him i watched gresser bustle around frantically as though his depleted crew had work to catch up tinnie said goodbye to some straggler she knew not bothering to introduce me i asked you going to stash me in the flour pantry and only take me out when you want to play theres an idea she gave me an arch look if i could keep the alyxes of the world out of there are you going to stay that was my secret plan coy doesnt become you me coy since when youre trying to fake it i dont think dean would ground me if i didnt come home tonight especially if i make up a story that has your name in it somewhere tinnie remains one of deans favorite people one of mine too what i love about you is your wild enthusiasm when you decide to do excuse me sir genord was back from escorting the straggler to his coach he looked grave theres someone to see you again not a gentleman definitely not a gentleman tinnie hissed angrily i knew something would happen i went out it was relway again of course who else knew where to find me certainly not my least favorite pigeon thered been no sign of the little vulture since he got himself evicted maybe the vampire bats got him or maybe he was just lying up somewhere waiting for the light he wasnt like the parrots in the islands who stayed up all night mimicking the cries of the frightened or wounded relway again definitely not a gentleman gerris genord would have messed his smallclothes had he known who this runt was relway looked beat it wearing you down i asked not yet whats up i need you to look at something again not something happy i assume no nothing its not a happy night it wasnt happy at all it wasnt far from where hed overtaken the murder wagon this time it was belindas ugly black coach empty one horse lay dead in the traces a crossbow had caught it in the throat the other beast was psychotic poisoned bolt relway explained one coach door dangled off a broken hinge a man i didnt recognize sat in the doorway he held his right arm and rocked slowly he was in pain two corpses lay in the street i did know them again spectators were noteworthy for their absence this is peckwood relway told me indicating the guy with the broken arm he saw it happen peckwood didnt look like hed been content to watch relway told him tell it again for my friend friend ohoh keep an eye on that hand patting your back garrett watch for a glint of steel peckwood spoke stiffly the coach came from back that way not in no hurry then i see two guys come from up yonder running hard up yonder meant northward the direction belinda shouldve headed if she was going home i figure they meant to do this someplace else only whoever was in the coach crossed them up im sure relway knew who was in the rig even if his man didnt why would belinda head west instead of north curious peckwood continued they didnt look like they was up to no good i tracked them one guy tried to plink the driver he missed he was puffing too hard to shoot straight the driver started whipping his team the villain didnt have no choice but to shoot a horse or let the coach get away i figure originally they planned to croak the driver and grab the whole rig a sensible strategy and the whole rig wouldve included the beautiful miss contague a lady with several deadly enemies one of the dead men was two toes harker hed been cut hastily and deeply and repeatedly his knife lay not far away hed had a chance to use it too it was bloody peckwood got his wind back soon as the coach stopped the driver jumped down and that other guy jumped out and the blood started flying everybody was surprised to see each other and the bad guys wasnt expecting a real fight know them relway asked meaning the corpses i indicated the smaller one cleland justin carlyle usually called ceejay chodos current number one cutter of throats and stabber of backs carlyle had done some cutting tonight a nasty blood trail led away from him two men did this carlyle was a pro hard to take peckwood nodded and they took miss contague a woman i dont know who she was tell him who they were relway said i know you dont know but ill bet garrett can guess crask and sadler i said the very ones and even all sliced up they worked peckwood over when he tried to stop them from taking the girl i got in my licks peckwood insisted gritting his teeth theyll carry some extra scars belinda left the weider place a while ago why was she hanging around and where did carlyle come from was he shadowing us before i hadnt noticed belinda would know crask and sadler had belinda i was tired i didnt want to face those two even if ceejay two toes and peckwood had torn a leg off each one theyd still bite with poison fangs got any idea where they went no relway said my people have orders not to leave a crime site if theyre alone peckwood carried out his orders shit i should encourage more innovation what good would it do if hed followed them we still wouldnt know anything happened and hed probably get killed for his trouble glad you see that garrett most people would argue i want to argue i just cant im in over my head here i dont know anybody inside the outfit well enough to approach maybe none of them would help well i could go to her fathers place but by the time i went out there and got back it would be tomorrow night ill bet they were in too bad a shape to worry about covering their trail there was plenty of blood in the street but nobody is filled with enough to leave a trail all the way to the sort of neighborhood where crask and sadler would hide i dont like ratmen did i ask you to like them relway smirked you need a good tracker garrett when you need a good tracker you have to deal with ratmen some races are just naturally better at some things ogres trolls humans elves dwarves none of us are much good at tracking in the city ratmen with the talent can sniff out a trail through the worst alleys better than any hound favorite trailcovering devices among those who can afford them include little sorcerous traps that crisp the nose and whiskers still smiling cognizant of my aversion relway said never be a better time than now garret its the middle of the night absolutely the ratpeople live on the underbelly of the night city we were at the peak or depth of their day any notion who or where i dont use ratpeople and you sneer at my prejudice the problem is their prejudice i dont use them because they start wailing when they find out who wants to hire them they think were the death squad branch of the call or something ratpeople are timid theyve learned the hard way i lug around a burden of prejudice but im nicer to them than most i make an effort to control my bigotry i sighed id wanted to stay away from morley as much for his sake as mine now that choice had been taken away relway asked youll let me know how it goes like he would not as soon as i did why not i started walking tinnie was going to promote me back to the top of her hate list who did i think i was running off to save some woman in trouble some other woman especially that woman it was all right when i saved her sweet patootie the goddamn parrot plopped onto my shoulder seconds after i parted with relway he was shivering it was cool out now or maybe he was scared there were a lot of night predators around they snacked on one another when nothing tastier presented itself the small nocturnal flying lizards will attack anything smaller than themselves including cats and dogs and the little people and they are too stupid to figure out that doing the latter is suicidal the price of thunderlizard leather and parchment might plummet my luck aint never gonna turn i grouched i thought sure you were catfood by now mr big had nothing to say cat got your tongue snicker what a joker still nary a word apparently the dead man had no minds left over for me nevertheless i talked to the bird all the way to the palms night people of all stripes watched nervously from the edges of their eyes they gave me room you had to be careful about humans who talked to themselves some conversed with ghosts or got messages inside their heads that resulted in attacks on imaginary foes with tooreal weapons a ploy worth remembering i told myself though with my luck nobody would be impressed the day i tried it or somebody would be rounding up recruits for the looney ward at the bledsoe i ran into a new waiter three steps into the palms he demanded can i help you sir he eyed me as though i suffered from some grotesque skin condition though his nose was so high in the air he must have checked me out with mirrors maybe i had bloodstains on me somewhere no i kept going i spied a familiar face dang me tama montezuma looked better than she had at weiders she seemed recovered from her distress she smiled like she wished we could be pals the fellow with her had a back that looked familiar too aha marengo north english brave and bold of course surprise i had my comradely smile on before he turned to see who his niece was ogling i nodded to both and kept moving i noticed others who had been at the weider mansion celebration becomes social disaster when people start dying that stuff is entertaining only when it goes on between the families of the bride and groom well at least ya tried ta dress decent oncet puddle grumbled goes ta show anyting can happen ya wait long enough what he ignored that what happent gang a pansies work ya over an make ya play dressup he whistled into the speaking tube i didnt hear a response but one must have come he said its dat guy wit da pet parrot yeah dat one agin i dont know what he wants i never axed garrett what da hell ya want plug your ears puddle gaped i mean it plug them up once he did shove beefy grubby fingertips into his furry ear canals i leaned to the tube crask and sadler just snatched belinda that would get morleys attention i need a tracker fast dotes was still buttoning buttons and hooking hooks when he hit the bottom of the stairs a plaintive call pursued him he ignored his startled customers eyed my apparel in mock astonishment what happened they knock you out and dress you up before they made the snatch snatch what snatch puddle demanded it was pansies done it boss i got dat on good autority his own i said he makes it up as he goes along i wasnt there ceejay was got himself dead for his trouble so did two toes harker harker was a good man dog loyal no virtue goes unpunished they did hurt crask and sadler before they bought it maybe pretty bad and so did one of relways guys who showed up during the excitement but couldnt keep them from getting away they left a trail they were bleeding puddle run tell reliance i want his best tracker right now tell him garrett will pay top marks he showed me sharp teeth dared me to argue i didnt ratpeople are venal someday morley will get his ass in a sling again and come to me and ill get even and then ill pile on the expense charges till ive got a lien on his soul then ill shop around and see if i cant get a couple brass tokens for that i didnt warn him if it comes as a surprise itll be more exciting for all of us puddle took off that shouldnt take long morley said reliance is desperate for cash was it smart you coming here being involved with rightsists my pal marengo north english is right over there with the gorgeous brown beast supposedly his niece incest is best hes seen me already ill worry about that after belinda is safe that would be the infamous tama montezuma the very child which you should know soaring at your new heights i ignore gossip garrett shes outstanding and completely wasted on a sour old fart like that absolutely so why dont one of us go over and offer to carry her away from her life of luxury and popular envy bet you shell jump at a chance to elope with a guy whos poor but handsome then i stunned dotes by going to squat beside north englishs table i pretended to speak to the lady while telling north english belinda contague was abducted after she left the weider place several men were killed i know who did it im collecting specialists to go after them would you care to join me north english eyed me coolly he glanced at his companion who seemed very distressed by the news then at the shadows to the rear of the palms it was hard to make out anything back there but he was without doubt cognizant of the managements background he was the sort of man who would have found occasional uses for a morley dotes he nodded graciously i appreciate the information mr garrett and i wish i could join you the young lady was quite charming but as you can see i have preclusive obligations do let me know how this tragedy plays out though wont you the preclusive obligation wasnt fooled i winked miss tama montezuma awarded me a very friendly twitch of her lip she seemed to be in a strange mood feeling no affection at all for her uncle north english seemed pretty cool toward her too montezuma was no bimbo whatever her reputation when i rejoined him i told morley i have a suspicion that that could be one very interesting woman darn and here you are already up to your ugly unpointed ears in interesting women what a pity he eyed the goddamn parrot what did you do to mr big he doesnt look right narciscio will be brokenhearted if you nothing morleys vain nephew had a place on my list only a couple of slots below his uncle and the talking buzzard he isnt talking not that i mind that right now right here understand like he feared that i would cozen that ugly jungle crow into being himself for a few minutes right here in front of the paying customers thiss where he learned to talk isnt it he really shouldnt hold back in familiar surroundings find him a cracker garrett hehheh come on pretty boy say something for uncle morley the little vulture persisted in his silence if there was a way to disappoint me he was sure to find it morleys anxienty faded he put on a smug smile offered me another fine look at all his pearly whites he had more of those than two predators deserved made me wish i was a ventriloquist after all ultimate justice does exist morley my hour will come all things are possible but it isnt going to happen tonight quietly he had begun flirting with tama montezuma already dont you have something going upstairs when i have a friend in desperate need i couldnt let myself be distracted by trivia i could and so could he when it suited him which was most anytime there was a tama montezuma type in the equation puddle joined us i indulged in silk purse and sows ear anatomical reflections however morley dressed him puddle couldnt look like anything but what he was morley takes care of his friends which keeps them fiercely loyal they go along with his every mad scheme even unto managing upscale vegetarian watering holes personal loyalty tells you more about most individuals than any surface glitter or grime puddle whispered to morley the name reliance occurred several times i knew it only by reputation reliance was a ratman getting just enough above himself to have become feared and respected within his own community he was part civic leader part gangster but as yet not in any way big enough to arouse the ire of humans ratfolk respect reliance because he has enough nerve to deal with other species they respect any of their own who are strong good or bad morley beckoned headed for the kitchen puddle oozed along behind us i glanced back past him several people seemed interested in us north english and his lovely niece in particular could there be a connection between the call and belindas predicament possibly but it seemed unlikely north english had thugs of his own by the battalion three ratpeople awaited us behind the palms one was reliance himself he was bigger than most ratmen and had gray in his fur he had survived longer than most ratmen did he was dressed better than any ratman id run into before colorfully including a pair of tall black pirate boots and an ugly purpleandwhite thing flopped on top of his head he was unusually confident for a ratman he needed something to complement the redandyellow shirt and the green trousers mr big really belonged on one of those skinny sloping shoulders morley introduced me reliance produced a pair of specially designed tenhagen spectacles and examined me dotes suggested i state my case myself i did so belinda contague chodo contagues daughter has been kidnapped the men who did it are notoriously vicious i didnt name names because crask and sadler were so notorious i didnt want to scare anybody off i need to track them so i can rescue belinda reliance glanced at his companions light escaping from the palms made his eyes turn red at the right angle would be valuable to have the friendship of chodo contague reliance hissed his karentine lay just this side of intelligibility rat throats dont handle human speech well they use a polyglot mess of their own their speech like most dialects becomes intelligible if youre exposed continuously like my brothers speech impediment i never noticed except when other people asked about it which doesnt happen much anymore the cantard wasnt as kind to him as it was to me it would i told reliance chodos friendships are unpredictable but legendary he did well by me i owe him really but how do you repay a debt to a human vegetable take care of his family i was doing that now reliance eyed us intently most ratfolk arent bright they fall between a brilliant dog and a slow human this guy was a genius for a ratman he indicated morley then me i have heard of you you worked with shote your reputations are sound he spoke slowly carefully so that we could follow him he knew neither of us ever did his people any willful harm shote was another tracker id employed i will help you and chodo contague will owe me absolutely he didnt want money ratmen always want money despite being weak on the causeandeffect relationship between wages and work they can make dwarves look fiscally indifferent though only at the pettiest level reliance looked at me sharply he suspected id committed chodo too fast too glibly tell the rat anything to get what you want but he knew chodos reputation too chodo always paid his debts he nodded this is pular singe all ratman sibilants tend to stretch out into syllables of their own while r and l sounds get confused she is young but very talented i checked his smaller companion she that wasnt obvious her apparel didnt differentiate her unlike most human girls she didnt have obvious female attributes i guess if youre ratpeople you can tell or there wouldnt be any ratpeople a youngish ratman moved closer bristling feebly i said if you say shes the best then she is and i owe you special thanks the ratgirl eyed me shyly unaccustomed to the company of humans i gave her a wink and a glimpse of one raised eyebrow gets them every time what do i call you pular or singe depending on the clan and i have only the vaguest notion how you tell that though it has to do with which sorcerer created their particular line surnames can come front or back she is hard of hearing reliance told me her talent is a divine compensation she does not speak human well her cousin fenibro must translate for you fenibro dipped his muzzle she prefers singe thank you singe i noted followed every word maybe reading lips easier done with humans of course time was getting away i asked reliance will you join us yourself i meant the question only as a courtesy it would be hard enough working with the other two this one might think he had something to contribute i do not think so i am far too old and slow ill tag along garrett morley announced come here puddle you will i thought you wanted out of this stuff you cant go after those two alone the ratpeople would scoot at the first sign of trouble that was a given you think too much youd get your candle snuffed i need you youre such a wonderful negative example he could be right or maybe i owed him money id forgotten about wed best go theyre getting farther ahead all the time he couldnt possibly want to tag along just on account of being my friend morley whispered to puddle puddle nodded he went back into the palms morley pointed a finger at the sky the moon and said im ready i told reliance thank you again sir singe fenibro ready i started jogging nobody had trouble keeping up despite ratmen not being built to run on their hind legs when they get in a big hurry they bounce off their hands sort of like a gorilla they move fast when theyre scared the goddamn parrot remained dumb which was a blessing he roused only once just long enough to emit a sort of puzzled interrogative squeak if id had time i wouldve been worried about the dead man took you long enough relway grumbled he didnt look much like the relway id left though the changes were cosmetic and subtle hed acquired a drooping shoulder and a slight dragging limp a lisp and a marked preference for shadows i doubted even morley would recognize him later changed and in a different light the runt even smelled different the ratpeople wouldnt recognize him later either took a while to set it up in the middle of the night i got the best relway eyed the ratpeople they were sniffing around and muttering all the violence upset them the best is pular singe thats her you know her only by reputation good for morley and reliance maybe not so good for me now i might actually find belinda fast which could mean a big fight with tunfaires two ugliest bad boys they would be like wounded animals even nastier now they were hurt like cornered rats snicker crask and sadler were like a malevolent force of nature beyond control subject only to laws they created themselves i gave the ratgirl another reassuring wink that seemed to calm her she responded with the wedgetoothed grimace her kind thinks constitutes a smile theres a certain pathos to the ratpeople most of them desperately want to be just like the race that created them poor deluded beasts trackers amaze me singe amazed me doubly and she wasnt fullgrown she was going to be a legend once on the trail she was limited only by her ability to walk fast and mine to keep up fenibro kept giving me the ratman equivalent of a big shiteating grin youd have thought he was running the trail pular singe kept looking to me for approval boy did i give her plenty evidently she didnt get much at home ratmen dont treat their young or females well everybody needs somebody to look down on and treat bad you wonder whos left for the young ratwomen though later i grumbled these guys must be headed for the arctic we had covered several miles leaving downtowns seething heart for a neighborhood called the plain of cavalry centuries ago when the citizen militia was tunfaires only army the mounted troops assembled there to practice up for scrimmages with neighboring citystates in those days the plain was outside the wall later the wall was extended to enclose the plain so it could be used as a bivouac in times of siege they started burying dead soldiers there eventually it became a vast graveyard its not much used anymore its become the object of endless dispute those who want to build there insist that land inside the wall is too precious to waste on dead folks already forgotten by their own descendants the descendants disagree the traditional position has prevailed only because many of the dead are oldtime heroes and imperials but adequate bribes might silence the opposition the cemetery is a bivouac again filled with shanties and crude tents slapped together by refugees this isnt popular with the neighbors who have to suffer more than their share of victimizations the call is popular around the plain wary tension filled the cemetery air there was very little light theres no free fuel to be had anymore i was uneasy because i hadnt thought to bring a lantern the moon wasnt much help though it gave singe all the light she needed squatter villages appear wherever theres open ground theyre unclean they stink its only a matter of time till some plague gets started it cant be long before the street conflicts engulf the camps hold up i told pular singe i gestured too she stopped waited watched me with a disquieting intelligence i suspected her hearing problem was less severe than reliance thought more a convenience than a handicap she got my deafanddumb sign language right away too though i was rusty it was a shame singe had trouble with the common speech i got the impression she had a real sense of humor she had to be some kind of mutant morley wouldnt this pesthole camp be perfect to disappear in people were moving around us despite the hour looking for nothing they could have articulated if asked movement itself was the destination the squatter population was a volatile mix including every type of refugee i saw people so exotic they had to be weird to themselves absolutely morley said youd have to be a woolly mammoth to get noticed around here is the tracking getting harder i asked singe she shook her head a human thing not natural for ratpeople pular singe tried hard to emulate human ways fenibro told me it is difficult but she can single it out shes amazing she is there is blood in it still no blood had been visible for miles i observed she sure says a lot with a headshake morley murmured the boyfriend likes to show off his talent too which is human speech oh think were being led you asking me if i think crask and sadler grabbed belinda hoping that you personally would try to rescue her its possible isnt it they might even have counted on you coming with me i might calculate a scheme like that garrett not those two they arent complicated thinkers they saw a chance to grab belinda they grabbed her they probably expected you to be with her things didnt go the way they anticipated yeah how did they know where to find belinda how did they know who she was supposed to be with you think they expect to be trailed here morley wasnt giving crask and sadler enough credit they werent just mountains of muscle they had brains thats what made them scary once they have time to think they left a heavy trail but they shouldnt expect trouble this soon i glanced around as a group we presented an unusual look but out there the unusual was the norm and inquisitive noses tended to get broken figure relway had us followed is the moon made of green cheese thats what i thought the tail wasnt obvious though go ahead singe youre doing wonderfully but please be careful fenibro looked at me like i wanted to teach granny to suck eggs but pular singe practically purred whereupon fenibro suffered a case of the sullens the change in our surroundings was miniscule but real surprisingly i sensed it before morley or singe i didnt need to prompt dotes though still i gestured to point out the fact that the refugee hovels shrank back from one particular mausoleum it was an antique from imperial times a family thing that had been used for centuries it would be as big as a house inside with several levels below ground the family must have fallen on hard times all families do eventually the mausoleum needed restoration though it remained sound enough for someone to have set up housekeeping inside pular singe sniffed pointed gestured uncertainly she dashed off she circled back before i figured out what she was doing she whispered to fenibro but looked at me from beneath lowered lashes eager for more approval fenibro told me the devils you seek are in there he was scared he wanted to get paid and go his speech was barely intelligible i understood singes rattalk almost as well they have bad odors sir they are evil even my blind nose tastes them now he fidgeted eager to go but afraid to ask for money morley squatted on his haunches i dont bend that way i dropped to one knee dotes murmured seems like weve done this thing before the vampire thing i stared at the mausoleum door it stood open just wide enough to admit a bulk the size of a crask or a sadler it seemed to sneer dotes asked me do you have anything in case we prance into an ambush i was thinking about throwing you in there to see what happens fenibro squeaked like one of his ancestors getting tromped he suffered a sudden sad suspicion that our natural inclination would be to elect him our tossee unlike singe he did not grasp the concept of humor singe spoke rapidly in rat polyglot i caught just enough to understand that she was telling fenibro to control himself then that their part of the adventure was over and it was time for them to take off i started mining my pockets for coins fenibro argued with singe he puffed his chest out male demonstrating dominance singe hissed fenibro wilted that left no doubt where real dominance resided he whined singe says to tell you reliance requires no payment someday he will ask a favor in return i groaned that arrangement always gets me into trouble eventually morley ignored the ratpeople he persisted i thought you might have something up your sleeve you often do not this time i wish though a light then surely we can come up with a light a glance around suggested otherwise the refugees and squatters had stripped the cemetery of everything burnable i nodded to singe go home now darling it might get hairy around here and be careful she took off instantly practically abandoning fenibro he whined as he tried to catch up there was no doubt that singe was his girlfriend only inside his own head morley grouched you never put any forethought into anything you do do you this was your idea you shouldve thought about bringing a lantern my idea youre stalling garrett yes i was in a good cause too im really fond of my skin its rough and its scarred but its the only one ive got crask and sadler might decide to use it to make wallets or belts morley heard the sound first but i caught it an instant later somebody was sneaking our way there was enough moonlight to show me morley he gestured i waved we sank down behind antique tombstones fate handed me a wonderful opportunity to look goofy yet one more time i jumped out at the sneaker expecting crask sadler one of relways goons a squatter determined to share my wealth anything but a terrified pular singe who shouldve been miles away already we bumped snoots she squeaked and started to run i caught her arm im sorry i whispered i thought youd gone home her fright faded as quickly as it had come she looked at my hand if shed been human she wouldve blushed she did shiver i let go but stayed ready to grab again if she bolted what is it i used my gentlest voice and wondered where morley was i brought those words were perfectly clear if few and shed heard me just fine she seemed too embarrassed to continue she couldnt meet my gaze she lifted a shuttered lantern and offered it youre a dream come true pular singe i might just steal you away from reliance she was painfully embarrassed she had a sense of humor but didnt understand teasing she was brilliant for her own people only i didnt want her expiring from a stroke of shyness thank you singe you know i didnt think about needing a light i owe you not reliance or fenibro or anybody else you personally you understand still avoiding my gaze she reached for the goddamn parrot that critter remained deadweight maybe when i wasnt looking somebody did stuff him and nail him to my shoulder maybe some wicked sorcerer cast a spell on him thank you very much pretty singe said you want him she looked at the ground shook her head in quick little rolling jerks then scooted away mr big has to be the most unwanted creature in this whole wide world i cant get anybody to take him singe made less sound departing than her unaltered cousins might have the noise shed made approaching must have been deliberate morley materialized another garrett conquest what maybe it was just an illusion cast by that devil moonlight but these elven eyes saw miss pular singe brilliant young ratwoman acting as smitten as any other teenager with a crush he giggled youd make a great team the curse again i shook my head vigorously no rat would find anything redeeming in me or vice versa morley kept right on snickering this was delicious he lingered over wedding plans and what to name the children or would you call them pups lets get on with this i grumped before were all too old to keep up this is rich garrett now i remember why i liked being part of your adventures they create so many memories for those lonely winter nights he exaggerated i think elves even breeds like him just dont think the way us humans do whenever you stop snickering i said you armed only with my wits never mind the cracks i wished i hadnt left that little crossbow back at the weider place take this he offered me a small flathandled dagger i hadnt seen on him anywhere no doubt he was lugging a whole arsenal not evident to the naked eye he was such a prankster hed have a trebuchet on him somewhere dont it seem awfully quiet in there it sure did crask and sadler really had it in for belinda a scream or two would have been reassuring thered still be somebody to rescue think they killed her already maybe but lets be careful anyway good plan after you he didnt argue i had him at a disadvantage now his night vision was better than mine he had no sound tactical argument against leading the way if we had to go at all once we were close enough to make out details it was obvious that the mausoleums builders had belonged to one of our more bizarre early religions the doorway was surrounded by carvings of fabulous creatures who glorified ugly i plucked the goddamn parrot off my shoulder planted him on an outcrop maybe he could go for help but for the color he fits right in and the breathing part i didnt clue him in though he might pick this exact moment to express one of his vulgar opinions dotes grinned revealing a lot of sharp white teeth enough moonlight leaked into the mausoleum for morley to see that no one lurked immediately beyond the doorway he reached back touched me found the lantern tapped it i cracked the shutter wed stirred up a little dust already the wedge of light swept around like a flaming sword it revealed nothing startling morley pointed downward there was evidence of recent traffic in the leaves and trash that had blown in over the years i fought back a sneeze dotes kept moving i kept a glimmer of light splashing out to probe the way even morley cant see in complete darkness again i wondered if crask and sadler hadnt set me up they knew i was a white knight dumb enough to roll the dice with death over a damsel in distress the trail in the rubbish ran straight to a wall damn i muttered not another secret door how come people think they can pull that off but it wasnt one of those the builder hadnt been trying to fool anybody this door was a massive wooden job i stabbed its huge hinges with my sword of light our friends hadnt oiled them they wouldnt operate quietly morley shrugged bounced into place beside the door whispered lets go what the hell might as well it was only crask and sadler on the other side of that damned thing only a couple of superhuman demidemon stone killers a pair of walking nightmares no big deal at all did it all the time i grabbed the rusty ring and heaved a slab of human meat the size of a small barn tipped out and crashed at my feet one of the villains i had no time to find out which morley slugged him in the temple with the pommel of a dagger cousin to the one hed loaned me air left the huge killer in a sigh like hed never wanted anything more than he wanted to lie down and sleep right now garrett the voice was weak but definitely belindas im here a piglike grunt from the darkness preceded the wobbly rush of a pallid behemoth bigger than the leviathan snoring at my feet a hand like a ham floated out of the darkness grabbed me flung me at the voice just starting to tell me to look out there were grunts behind me slaps and thumps and a growl of pain morley is good but he didnt get the best of this exchange brute force sometimes smothers style dotes cursed as he flew my way apparently in the feet superior mode he crashed into the mess on the floor before i could get my own feet under me again the door slammed a moment later i hit it with my shoulder an instant after that there cant be any nightmare worse than mine about being buried alive the door gave a little i let out a madsorcerer cackle and hit it again something bashed it from the other side the shock shot from my shoulder down to my toes and back crask cussed me and sadler at the same time get up get up he raged at his sidekick his voice was feeble between them two toes carlyle and peckwood had dinged him badly and hurt sadler even worse i shoved crask shoved back give me a hand morley the lanterns shutter was all the way open shining on the ceiling and showing me morley making points with belinda by asking if she was all right of course im not all right you moron she snarled im lucky they passed out before they could torture me much help garrett unless you want to spend the rest of your life here eating raw mice her voice was feeble but her will remained unflagging she was a razoredged chip off the old contague flint crask wedged something against the door we banged into it until my shoulder ached we moved it a fraction of an inch each time till morley was able to weasel through he muttered continuously this adventure was playing hell with his outfit he flung the blockage aside i stalked out belinda clung to my left arm she had no choice she had no strength left she grunted with every step crask and sadler had given her a taste of joys to come we hit the moonlight what now dauntless sidekick morley asked we dont have a tracker anymore you should have kissed her she wouldve hung around forever i did what i wanted to do i got belinda back it was time to head home only what were the chances i would run into crask and sadler in such reduced circumstances ever again less than zip i grabbed the goddman parrot which way did they go bird his highness did not deign to speak a silent bird wasnt a problem id ever expected to face i was worried about the dead man id heard nothing for too long he should have been nagging me mercilessly hed shown that he couldnt read shapechangers close up maybe they got to him while i was busy at weiders if one could pretend to be me long enough to get dean to open the door morley whispered didnt we decide that relway would have a man watching i counted on it when we went in there sort of then wouldnt you guess that relway will know where those two went probably come to think but would he let me know if i asked relway just might discover that he had some use for crask and sadler no one else could appreciate i said theyll never be weaker and you know they never forgive and forget morley patted my arm good to see my wisdom finally taking root but belinda is in no shape to chase anybody belinda snapped belinda will keep up belinda is in better shape than either of them and belindas got another score to settle whereupon her legs melted and she had to grab a handy tombstone i dont want to hear a word garrett her voice didnt waver something stirred out in the darkness it trailed the faintest whisper of disturbed grass it headed the direction crask and sadler must have gone dotes and i exchanged glances i asked belinda where were you headed when they grabbed you they meant to catch you on your way home only you no they were waiting on the way to your house originally they were really pissed off because you didnt take me home they wanted us both lucky for both of us i had to work then eh yeah isnt it belinda didnt sound like she believed that in her heart though where were you going i asked again she hesitated then admitted to the palms people from the reception were going to meet there oh neutrally recalling that she had spoken to marengo north english in parting and he had seemed surprised none of my business though except that later the same gentleman had seemed quite unhappy about being at the palms with his delectable niece i asked morley you want to take her back to your place she would be safe there if she wanted to be youre not going after them alone morleys tone told me nothing i did would ever surprise him maybe because this wouldnt be stupider than anything id ever done before im not going after them theyre relways now for now i was very worried about the dead man there was no deadly silence in my neighborhood the night people were out in force and they were busy commerce was king no political dialogue was under way i exchanged greetings with those i knew there was no tension in the air nobody seemed interested in my movements a stroll around the area didnt uncover anyone watching my house even mrs cardonlos was otherwise occupied i got a strange feeling as i climbed my steps not like something was wrong no it was more like something was missing an emptiness i hadnt felt for years whats the story here i asked the goddman parrot this close he had no excuse for being out of touch the bird was stubborn he still refused to talk old bones i tried my key miracle of miracles dean didnt have any bolts bolted or chains chained i shoved the door cocked an ear to the silent darkness the house didnt feel right it was darker than a priests heart in there dean hadnt refilled the feeble lamp we leave burning in the hallway i hoped he had a fire in the stove so i could light it again im not big on flint and steel though i manage if i have to it was way too late to go mooching from the neighbors i felt the wall till i found the lamp i took it and headed for the kitchen carefully there was no knowing what dean would leave lying around i completed my pilgrimage without getting hurt the stove was warm i dug in found some live coals got a kitchen lamp burning so i could find the oil to fill the hall lamp its wick needed trimming but i was bonetired i would mention it to dean tomorrow tinnie would be cussing me bigtime now i figured i ought to start rehearsing my apologies once i had a light i took the goddamn parrot to the small front room he was just aware enough to move to his perch maybe he was wornout too i put the hall lamp in its bracket and shoved into the dead mans room all right chuckles whats the story if youve gone to sleep on me im gonna he hadnt gone to sleep on me not this time no way what hed done was hed gone missing for a while i stood there with my mouth open then i retrieved the hall lamp and prowled the dead mans room like maybe a quarter ton of motheaten corpse might have gotten lost amongst the dust bunnies i faced the unusual and weird as a matter of course but this was beyond comprehension the dead man was gone how he couldnt have gotten up and walked nor could dean have carried him there were no signs of a struggle there wouldve been had he been abducted he was just gone dean was going to get rousted out after all no dean wasnt he didnt respond to my knock you awake dean i need to talk i pushed his door open hoping i didnt get him started cranking his room was empty it wasnt just untenanted or deserted it was barren not one scrap of clothing or stick of furniture remained my gods theyve eloped i didnt imagine dean when i imagine people i pick them put together like tinnie or nicks or tama montezuma i petitioned the air with the intensity of an actor in a passion play what the hell is going on a waste of time id asked already and hadnt gotten an answer i went back down to the kitchen a hasty inventory left me baffled i made something to eat drew a beer off the keg in the cold well shuffled around the ground floor balancing food drink and lamp while i searched for messages or clues i found nothing not even a dear garrett note hell with it i grumbled hell with them hell with everybody i dragged myself up to bed enumerating the names of everyone who ought to join the infernal pilgrimage i dont recall lying down i dont recall getting up my first clear thought surfaced when somebody groaned in pain a moment later i realized that the groaner was right there in my bedroom and he was making those noises with my driedout mouth then it dawned the pain was caused by sunburn of the backs of the eyeballs i was staring out at a morning where the gods or devils of daylight were putting on one of the great sunshine shows of all time it was almost noon the sun seemed to span half the sky that information developed i tried to reason out why i wanted to stare into that unholy furnace the proximate cause made itself apparent instantly which is to say that there were hundreds of idiots out there holding another political discussion sticks and stones and broken bones hundreds of guys in brown wearing a variety of rightsist armbands showing colorful standards and banners were proclaiming their message with enthusiasm not only to the fey but to any handy humans who had a foreign look on them or maybe just parted their hair a little strange maybe my mom didnt raise me right after all i dont quite grasp politics despite claims to the contrary substance has no relevance apparently conflicts are decided by whoever shouts the loudest and whacks away with the biggest stick why did they keep doing it in macunado street why couldnt they take it into the countryside nobody but farmers or mammoths or woods elves would be bothered out there i wanted to grab a big megaphone and yell people we got folks trying to sleep around here i dropped the curtain after a minute i felt fine i didnt have a hangover what did i drink one beer good still maybe i should ease up on the health food for a while as i descended to the kitchen i recalled my housemate shortage id have to build my own breakfast boy life just aint fair the goddamn parrot heard me moving around and squawked he started the thing where he pretends to be a small child begging not to be abused he was back to his old self id feed him if i started feeling generous and forgiving which could not possibly come anytime but later i got some bacon frying and some water heating for tea then went over the ground floor one last time hoping id find something i was too tired to notice last night i came up with the same big batch of nothing no getting around it dean and the dead man were gone there was no suggestion of foul play theyd gotten up and gone because theyd wanted to get up and go i sipped tea and nibbled bacon and snacked on halfway stale bread dipped in bacon drippings while i tried to get my mind wrapped around the notion that the dead man had moved voluntarily that would make twice in my lifetime last time was when i moved him in here give him another generation and hed be dancing in the streets i glanced at the keg in the cold well tempting but it was too early and i had work to do i shivered events had left me a mighty hill to climb shut up in there i barked at mr big who was singing the marching song of ten thousand verses each of which begins i dont know but ive been told i poured tea stirred in a spoon of honey found a muffin young enough not to scar the hardwood if i dropped it migrated to my office good morning eleanor the lady in the painting smiled enigmatically bemused by my morning dishabille she didnt surprise me when she didnt have anything to say the goddamn parrot was stuck on a verse about ratgirls it didnt flatter them he must not have been completely comatose last night me i thought better of ratgirls since meeting pular singe hers was an acquaintance worth nurturing so darling did the dead man take off so he wouldnt complicate my life now that im involved with righsists or did he feel unfulfilled and had to find himself and realize his potential that was a chuckle without continuous nagging old bones has the potential of an iceberg hell slide downhill if he isnt at the bottom already if you give him a push i finished my muffin and tea went for another cup i took the scenic route back to the office the goddman parrot shut up as soon as i gave him some breakfast nestled in my chair again i told eleanor listen to this and tell me what you think i started where i thought it began did black dragon crask and sadler belinda relway shapeshifters the weiders marengo north english tama montezuma so what do you think is it all connected or have i stumbled into several things all going on at the same time occasionally it helps to bounce the facts off eleanor or the dead man even though neither is inclined to respond sometimes the pieces fall into place i twisted and kicked and whacked away at the facts with a big faded steel hammer to conjure the mess into a couple of complete scenarios i was sure neither had much to do with reality neither made sense of what was happening i prefer the chaos theory i told eleanor shits flying everywhere and its by chance a lot is raining down where im standing im what ties the whole mess together oh right isnt this exactly what ive been waiting for eleanors smile turned more teasing than enigmatic she knows how thrilled i am when somebody pounds on my door i dont always hear them though the door replaced often lately is heavy im thinking about getting one of those mechanical bells so i can be sure theres somebody out there to ignore gods garrett colonel block growled you been on a threeday bender youre looking good yourself we saw one another just yesterday remember you really go to hell overnight dont you maybe i did look a little ragged all right so maybe i need a shave i let block come inside he doesnt come around unless he has something on his mind that would be a start want a cup of tea the goddamn parrot broke off crunching sunflower seeds long enough to excoriate the head of the guard then the head of the household can i drown that thing in it ill brew you a bucket if youll do it and take the rap whats up i shepherded him into my office he helped himself to a chair i wanted you to know what relway got from the prisoners and your thoughts about last night relways devotion colors what he sees it was pretty straightforward i told him what i knew once i wouldve held out just because he was the law im mellowing with age and accumulated head lumps i concluded what i dont have is a clue what it adds up to i find it productive to forget the big question while i root out little answers uhm instead of worrying about what it all adds up to work on why the shapeshifters chose the weiders there are a hundred questions you could ask you can paint the big picture one brushstroke at a time he wasnt offering advice that was new but there was a subtext an unspoken message he was reminding me that collecting brushstrokes would involve me in my least favorite pastime what i need to find is a way to cruise through life without having to work so whats the word did relway collect any brushstrokes he must have tormented up some random flecks of color hes got a bunch of words for you garrett but there aint many of them ones you want to hear the big thing is we didnt get anything out of the shapechangers i must have looked doubtful i dont know why maybe im getting cynical if you cant believe the secret police whom can you trust really garrett before relway got back to the alkhar the prisoners tried to escape the place is a sewer any sane person would want to get away from but how theyre shapeshifters garrett they cant turn into mice or roaches or anything thats not as heavy as they are but they can turn skinny or plastic enough to slide between bars and i get the picture damn we shouldve seen that coming i selected a quiver of choice expletives used them up this could turn real bad if those things could turn into furniture or the carpet underfoot so theyre all loose again not all three got away and they were hurt the others died trying relway says you can study the bodies if you want to did they all have tattoos how did you know wild and lucky guess let me guess some more the tattoo was a dragon with a karentine military seal worked in it was hard to see even when they werent trying to hide it youve seen them before he was squinting now suddenly troubled i have relway told me hed try to find out what the tattoo means he probably hasnt had time my guess is that theyre some special ops mercs left over from the war that would be my guess too which means that i made this walk mostly for the exercise im not telling you anything new exercise never hurt anybody im told come on in the kitchen well get that tea i was sure he had more to say but maybe it was something he didnt want to tell me i asked him to come along because in my house we try not to leave visitors unattended especially not winger or officers of the law both are almost certain to get into stuff id really rather they didnt i poured block communed with his inner demons i asked do you prefer the uniform he wore a slightly fancy version of the vaguely military undyed linen outfit recently adopted by the guard it did little for the dignity of his office most rightsists street thugs dressed better block accepted tea we dont have much of a budget so its become a point of pride shows people were dedicated maybe anything useful come from those changers no except that someone from the hill names i cant mention want the dead ones and there it was his secret burden and i thought you were saving them just for me block sneered a bunch of shifters turning up stirred a lot of curiosity think someone knew about the tattoos block shrugged i havent mentioned them yet how come i wanted to see what happened when they figured it out im just a dumb lawman i wouldnt notice anyway and what might he be holding out on me youll let me know if anything comes of it he nodded my coconspirator some bigtoothed hounds are going to be on this trail before long which was maybe as much as he dared tell me that didnt excite me i dont like sorcerers theyre dangerous and theyre unpredictable like lawyers you dont want to turn your back on one of them most of them arent even kind to their mothers still it would be stupid not to hear what block was trying to say you guys have been awful nice to me lately block shrugged again thats because you can help us we need to make you want to cooperate he sounded like chodo contague about to offer an infernal deal it might be easier to leave town my mother has cousins upcountry then youd be stuck wearing scratchy homespun and couldnt indulge yourself in all this elegant luxury he indicated my clothing i cant see you as a peasant anyway they raise sheep thats different youd never have trouble finding a girlfriend i liked you better when you were worried about hanging on to your job you were crabby all the time but he smiled im a much better person now all right much better wherere you headed on this lets not duplicate each others work then concentrate on infiltrating the call my loyalty is to max weider the call isnt going anywhere the weiders might ive lost three of them already when i was paying attention cant fault your logic yeah relway mention that we caught up with crask and sadler you fishing block isnt as dim as he pretends id like to know he did you rescued the fair maiden interesting relway apparently kept his boss informed relways boss continued you let them get away garrett what kind of hero are you the living kind i thought somebody was watching us lucky for you we got out of the tomb without help not what i meant you came home instead of running after the bad guys your unsavory friend also chose to abandon the hunt we can only assume that he was concerned for miss contague looking out for belinda was of course looking out for himself you have a point i asked yes somebody did stick to the bad guys came the dawn you know where they are sure do and we wondered if youd want that information i took them on last night with help and with them hurt they still mightve gotten the best of it did i say well stand around and watch these are famous villains and they dont have any friends now that chodo dont love them anymore that gives the guard a chance to put on a big show for some very important observers with the invaluable assistance of a certain publicspirited subject you want to be the publicspirited subject that why youre here i want to be visible when the guard is doing its job right lets walk up there and see what happens let me get myself organized i wouldnt want your reputation bruised because of the company you keep if that could hurt me id have been exiled ages ago you got a point i wont be long go settle in my office try not to poke around i knew the dead man couldnt keep an eye on block but block didnt i was beginning to like tad weiders sense of style i selected an outfit that he might have worn to the horse races it included a lot of yellow and red and brown there were ruffles at wrist and throat i spiffied myself considered the result in my little mirror oh the elf girls are gonna carry me off and make me their love slave i stepped back but if im going to dress like this id better get a new pair of shoes my ragged old cobblehoppers sported memorabilia of a thousand city adventures they didnt complement the look what happened to you block demanded when i got back he looked me up and down the weiders felt i should upgrade my wardrobe people been telling you that for years but you really need new shoes those clogs look like you wore them in the service thats on my list i thought we had a riot to attend im ready i said new door block asked as i locked up yeah somebody busted the old one theres still snow piled up here and there you sure you didnt have anything to do with that i hear rumors with your name in them how could i make it snow in the summertime even if according to tinnie everything is my fault you put in a key lock you must be doing pretty well id been doing very well lately but he didnt need to know that he might let something slip around crooks or tax collectors or crooked tax collectors or is that redundant doesnt it take a unique breed of pyschopath to prey upon his fellows that way the street was quiet except for the moans of stragglers nursing injuries sustained during the earlier debate this is better i said you shouldve seen it here a while ago i did id have been here an hour ago if it wasnt for that damned parade we walked i didnt like the direction he chose if he kept on we would stroll right into the bustee the ultimate slum and the most dangerous neighborhood in a city famous for bad neighborhoods the only law in the bustee is the law you make yourself outsiders wont go in except in big gangs i hope we arent headed where i think were headed north side of the bustee i was afraid of that another reason to make a show yes to show that the guard wont back off relway i could see playing to the bustee audience relway doesnt have sense enough to be scared i was surprised he got anybody to go in with him though let alone the sort of highlifes he and block would want to impress maybe i was out of touch when we arrived it was evident immediately that the guard had impressed both the locals and the observers already they had a dozen prisoners in chains none of them the great villains crask or sadler id expected troops or something but relway had brought only the dozen guards he would have assembled for the same job anywhere else observers outnumbered working lawmen even after we arrived block introduced me around i knew several of the witnesses though none well you run into people in my racket some are friendly some arent you rub some the wrong way if youre determined to do your job i was overdressed the most foppish dude there wasnt showing any lace they all wore grubbies i faded away from the names joining relway sullen neighborhood brats watched from a safe distance as friendly as feral cats waiting to spring their friends in chains or maybe to murder somebody from a rival gang they were filthy none wore clothing fancier than a loincloth several werent that dressy in the bustee sanitation is the exception rather than the rule the quarter doesnt have even the rudimentary streetcenter sewage channels found elsewhere there are few streets as we know them just stringers of space where there are no buildings the bustee has its own unique aroma and plenty of it figure crask and sadler know somethings up relway glanced at his prisoners then at me like hed suddenly discovered that i was retarded probably weve been standing around here way too long waiting to get started im sorry but thiss going to be a blow i know but as important as you are we werent waiting on your account im crushed so what is the holdup a dashing young gentleman sorcerer who uses the business name dreamstalker doomscrye or maybe doomstalker dreamscrye he wants in we dont tell those people no he was supposed to be here hours ago evidently as an apprentice he wasnt taught to tell time relways sarcasm was quite daring i was beginning to think the man had no sense in tunfaire we restrain our opinions concerning the lords and ladies of the hill they can do worse than turn you into a frog if you irritate them ulp what relway asked i forgot my bird then go fetch the prima donna chicken too late might as well enjoy myself i didnt miss the fancypants crow at all relways man ritter was headed our way a kid maybe fourteen blistered out of a dark chink between tenements he held a rusty knife extended ahead i knew the tactic he was a cutpurse he just wanted to steal and run before his victim could react it happened every day everywhere in tunfaire though elsewhere cutpurses usually selected more promising targets this kid had to be counting coup his pals were all set to cheer when ritter sidestepped snagged the thiefs long hair slashed him several times with a knife that appeared as though by magic the whimpering boy collapsed into the muck ritter came on as though hed done nothing more significant than stomp a bug that kind of cold demonstration was why the guard was becoming feared they were nasty these new lawmen believers so often are doomscrye is here ritter announced what a jerk hes already complaining about us wasting his valuable time these secret policemen were too daring hes young relway told me hell learn did he mean doomscrye or ritter as a place to squat the object of our interest was a long slide downhill from a tomb it was an ugly little leanto shanty hugging the hip of a threestory frame tenement that tilted ten degrees sideways while twisting around its own waist good thing we dont have to go in there i observed our weight would bring it down its tougher than it looks ritter told me ninetytwo people live there that was probably a short estimate the occupants might use the place in shifts i asked relway if the manpower shortage was so awful we let whole tribes of nonhumans immigrate how come people down here didnt take advantage some did and some are unemployable in any circumstance relways bitterness sounded personal he hailed from the underbelly of society he had been able to get somewhere he was outraged because so many people wouldnt even try plenty willingly made the effort to be unpleasant though we were attracting more watchers the age of the kid ritter had hurt i saw sticks and chains and broken bricks the weapons of the very poor my companions remained unconcerned ritter pretended to be in charge so relway wouldnt attract attention a donkey cart appeared headed our way the observers were getting nervous doomscrye complained incessantly he was very young for a sorcerer he hadnt seen military service he might be the harbinger of a generation never to get its rough edges knocked off where nobody was special when the reaper was on the prowl doomscrye did not understand that real trouble could climb all over him any second likely hed never faced even minor trouble fate handed him the opportunity to discover that nobody thought as well of him as he thought of himself a hunk of brick got him in the chest block snagged him and dragged him behind the cart ritter and several others struck back contemptuously bashing heads other guards shackled captives with chains from the donkey cart the only kid to get in a solid blow died swiftly his throat cut oh shit i muttered were in for it now there was a lot of racket i expected a riot i was wrong the locals were intimidated by ruthlessness particularly once doomscrye set the brickthrower on fire the kid was still screaming when we ripped crask and sadlers hovel apart and learned that all the buildup had come to an undramatic anticlimactic conclusion there was no epic battle no ferocious last stand by cornered baddies crask was delirious with fever sadler was unconscious it took four guardsmen to hoist the villains into the cart nobody insisted they be treated gently me neither though i did recall times when we were less unfriendly crasks delirium faded briefly he recognized me i said good morning bright eyes but looking into them was like looking down a dark well at a remote mountain of ice maybe the call ought to work on the problem of humans who have no humanity in them crask wasnt afraid fear to him was a tool used to manage others you going to question them i asked were a little slower than we like to pretend arent we relway sneered would this exercise have a point otherwise id sure like to know why they jumped belinda when they did relway smiled ill bet you would whats that mean i expect she has some questions like how they knew where to find her is this all there is then i expected more excitement myself garrett but im pleased there wasnt they dont seem so terrible now do they neither does a sabertooth tiger when hes sick on his ass you guys be careful they wont be completely harmless even if you hang them im always careful garrett that i believed but was he careful enough i stuck with the gang only till we cleared the bustee wouldnt do to be seen with them by my patriotic friends the chained kids would get five years in the cantard they would be aboard prison barges before the end of the day the mines always needed a few good men or whoever else they could get already they were the catchall sentence for any crime not a capital offense the mines would constitute a death sentence for many anyway so whats changed since i was young these guys would get shovels instead of swords and worse odds of getting home alive my favorite venue for exotic research is the karentine royal library over where all the midtown government buildings cluster clinging to the petticoats of the hill there are lots of books and no wizards to make them a highrisk objective the most interesting books in town are of course squirreled away under lock and key and deadly spell up the hill behind imputed beware of the wizard signs only brawnforbrains barbarians try to reach them which supplies the wizards with leather for bookbinding the royal library is a crown indulgence it isnt supposed to be open to walkin traffic i get around that i have a friend inside linda lee is a treasure and cute too especially when shes mad which she always seems to be whenever i drop by youre full of it up to your ears garrett she snapped how did you get in this time and how come you still have that trashbeak penguin parked on your shoulder id stopped by the house just in case my peripatetic sidekick had chosen not to cover up the fact that we were partners anymore youre one slow learner she was no fan of the parrot and was always very admiring of the way i put words into his beak without moving my lips even from another room the secret of getting into the library is you slide in through a small side door that has escaped the notice of most of the world as a rule though most of the world would be more interested in getting out of a library than getting in books are dangerous the library guards are so poorly paid that none of them really gives a rats butt who comes or goes and the most indifferent guards get the side entrance young or old the man on duty will be drunk or asleep or drunk and asleep or maybe not even there because hes gotten dry and had to go out looking for a drink i still have to go in on tippytoe the guards have their pride you dont make the effort they are going to yell you dont make the effort they cant cover themselves with the gargoyle who rules the place todays steadfast guardian of the priceless tomes was both drunk and snoring and had a huge smouldering weed banger dangling from his left hand which would burn down to bare skin any moment yeow echoed through the building a screech demanded what was that that was the head librarian a wicked old witch with a temper so foul that on her best days she was like a troll with very bad teeth she began to shift toward the guardroom in a streaking shuffle shed lost all sympathy for youth in recent centuries her sworn mission was to get in lifes way i whispered she mustve been sneaking up on us you keep those hands to yourself garrett which is all that i had done so far sooner or later she would have her way i always give in and give you whatever you want when you start that stuff so you just stop it i didnt argue we both knew she never did a thing she hadnt made up her mind to do but shes a lastword kind of gal wouldnt think of it darling according to morley im practically engaged to a pretty ratgirl named pular singe anyway is that thug going to be your best man uh i came by your place last night to see that dead man theyre pals sort of him and her hes never explained how he overlooks the fact that shes a woman a neighbor told me dean and the dead man moved out that they just couldnt take it anymore and that you were out whoring around with some trollop in black it took no genius to figure out which neighbor that would be you need to pick who you gossip with more carefully darling i try but you just keep coming back you went to my house me forgetting who the lastword kind of gal was i enjoy those conversations with your partner she gripped my arm looked up her eyes were huge pools of mischief sometimes i do just want to sit around and talk hes so interesting hes seen everything now whose hands are this is different funny i was breathing just as hard what do you want garrett huh the dead man doesnt get distracted uh hes dead even then youd probably shapeshifters i need to know about shapeshifters why always direct linda lee shapeshifters murdered some people i know we caught them and sent them to the alkhar but some got away before we could question them the rest died i need to find out whatever i can about them pant pant i cant help much the information we have here probably wouldnt be reliable linda lee cocked her head the head librarian was just warping into the guardroom from the sound our whispers hadnt reached her what you want youd probably only find in a specialized library whats that i had a feeling i didnt want to know a private library on the hill sorcerers im psychic i didnt like that answer you dont know anybody up there i know people met another one today they aint our kind of people you wouldnt know anybody in the call uh why you could try to get into the library at their institute for racial purity where they research racial issues they came here trying to hire a librarian they have a lot of stuff from private sources they wanted it cataloged and organized so they could use it to support their theories linda lee youre a treasure i know what made you realize it i do know somebody in the call aha the chief librarian shrieked in the distance ive caught you my pretty but she crowed too soon she always declares before she has me in sight i moved with trained silence and deliberate speed to the end of a stack i could remain unseen there till the old woman committed to a particular path linda lee would signal me id take a different route and once again the old woman would be scratching her head and wondering what shed really heard its unnatural that anyone her age would hear so well linda lee whispered ill see what i can find out then she glommed on and kissed me linda lee knows kissing better than she knows books i didnt start it but after about four seconds i was plenty read to continue weider who shapeshifter what i dont know no relway the chief librarian cackled ive got you for sure this time my proud beauty ill teach you to tryst with your leman in a holy place she stomped and clomped her way closer i slipped away from linda lee who winked and made noise heading another direction while i sneaked between stacks on little mouse feet wed played this game before linda lee probably more times than me awk shit said the goddamn parrot with impeccable timing help he started flapping id kill him for sure this time a vise closed on my right shoulder it turned me i gaped at the ugly grin of a foulbreathed ogre i hadnt seen before and whom i hadnt heard coming he was twice my size and twice as stupid i had a notion he wouldnt ask me to recommend a good book in fact i suspected he was the kind who liked to hit people and watch them bounce exhibit number one he had a gargantuan green fist pulled back three yards all set to whistle my way the old lady had foxed me i kicked the ogre hard where a sharp knock will drop any reasonably constructed critter puking the ogre just showed me more green teeth and put some moxie into his punch only trolls and zombies are less vulnerable there i never got a shot at his ears ogres drop like stones if you slap both ears at the same time so im told nobody i know ever got close enough to try the source is always a friend of a friend of a friend but its gospel garrett it really happens that way before the lights went out i had the satisfaction of knowing the old woman would need weeks to pick up all the books that scattered while i was flying through the stacks might be wise not to visit linda lee at work for a while if anybody robbed me while i was splashed all over the alley behind the library they sure overlooked the one thing i wouldnt mind losing i came around to find the goddamn parrot muttering like one of those psycho guys who stomp around shaking their heads and arguing with ghosts i hurt everywhere i had book burns that ogre had pounded me good after i couldnt see to make a getaway thered been way too much of this stuff lately i never recovered from one thumping before i stumbled into the next was i nurturing some kind of death wish time to tap an old resource time to drop in on the cranky old men i didnt look forward to it it wouldnt be pleasant but with my aches and pains and premature cynicism id fit right in they say theres more than one way to skin a cat undoubtedly true but why would you want to whoever the first they was somebody with strange habits who needs to flay felines i hear they keep right on shedding after theyre tanned maybe the saying was started by the guy who knocks out ogres with his bare hands the cranky old men are an ongoing crew of antiques who pooled resources to purchase maintain and staff an abandoned abbey where they await the reaper many because theyre so unpleasant their relatives dont want them around home somebody in a black humor named the place heavens gate in its prime the abbey housed fifty monks in luxurious little apartments more than two hundred cranky old men live in the same space three to the apartment and whos got any use for even one chapel let alone the three of the original setup the place is cramped and smelly and almost as depressing as the bledsoe and makes me hope that in my declining years some twentyyearold lovely with an obsession for chubby old bald guys who smell bad takes me in so i dont have to buy into anything like heavens gate of course with my luck and the way things have gone lately i shouldnt worry about getting old the abbey was constructed in a square around an inner court two stories high filling a larger than normal city block not an uncommon layout in tunfaire tinnies clan resides in a similar though larger compound which includes their tanning and manufacturing facilities in a display of misplaced faith in their fellowman the monks had included groundfloor windows around the street faces the cranky old men had adapted to modern times by installing wroughtiron bars most people just brick them up there are two entrances front and rear each is just wide enough to permit passage of a donkey cart both are blocked by double sets of iron gates the place looks more like a prison than the alkhar does somebodys grandson was on some scaffolding installing bars on a secondfloor window the deeper poverty arriving with the immigrants might make the place attractive after all i eased around the scaffolding to the gate it was comfortable in the shadows there eh you move along a creaky voice insisted no loitering a sharp stick jabbed between the bars too slowly to hurt anyone everyone got this treatment including favorite sons i came to see medford shale not strictly true but you do need to offer a name and i knew that one the hard way aint no medford shale here go away thats him back there under the olive tree on the cot which was true and handy so maybe my luck wasnt all bad the sharp stick jabbed again i didnt go away the old man on the other end came out of the shadows i said hello herrick the old man squinted he scowled he tried to stand up straight i aint herrick herrick passed im his kid brother victor sorry to hear about herrick victor he was good people i need to see shale victors eyes narrowed again you aint been around lately have you its been a while medford doesnt make you want to hurry back herrick passed two years ago all right it had been a big while im really sorry victor i need to see shale you got a name boy garrett we go way back victor sneered shale goes way back youre just a pup he started to shuffle off thought better of it maybe he decided hed given in too easily what you got there i didnt think hed miss the bundle little something for shale there was more on the way these sour old flies would need a lot of sweetening bigger than a breadbox victor muttered he considered the goddamn parrot you better not be carrying no birdcage there boy we got no truck with useless mouths i patted the bundle its edible the best bribes are the wonderful things the cranky old men know they shouldnt eat or stuff they shouldnt drink got a creme horn i do believe if shale will share victor fumbled with the inner gate he muttered to himself he didnt sound optimistic about shale sharing he had reason to be pessimistic greatgranduncle medford is a cranky old mans cranky old man maybe he had a little ogre or loghyr in him somewhere way back he hasnt aged obviously since i was a kid and my greatgrandaunt alisa was still alive hes one really nasty old man but hes got a soft spot for me as long as i come armed with molasses cookies victor opened the outer gate the instant it opened wide enough so victor couldnt stop me the goddamn parrot revealed his secret relationship with a lady pig the old boy just stood there poleaxed as i started toward shale i said bird these codgers dont get a lot of meat in their diet costs too much a buzzard in the pot might put smiles on all their faces i could see the little monster only from the corner of my eye but i swear he sneered somewhere somehow hed gotten the idea that he was invulnerable probably my fault hey you i sighed stopped turned yes victor whynt you say you was one of them ventriloquisitors a guy with a good and raunchy routine would be a big sell around this dump ill think about that might be a good career change i never saw a ventriloquist with his head bandaged or his arm in a sling lets see what shale thinks i just cant seem to get by without people thinking im flooding the dodos beak with nonsense how come his big silence couldnt last was some petty little god still carrying a grudge shale appeared to be asleep or maybe dead his chest wasnt moving maybe he was hibernating maybe that explained why he never got any older i hear you dont age when youre sleeping hed been in the same place so long the olive tree no longer protected him from the sun he was all wrinkles and liver spots and if all his fine white hairs were tied end to end they might reach his knobbly ankles his clothing was threadbare but clean medford shale had a thing about cleanliness shale thinks youre a notalent little peckerwood and its probably that mallard doing the actual talking and putting words into mouths shales withered lips scarcely moved maybe somebody from the great beyond was ventriloquising him you found yourself a wife yet good to see you well uncle medford nope still playing the field any other old boy in the place wouldve done a wink and nudge and boydoienvyyou number medford shale snapped you some kind of nancy boy aint gonna be none of that in this family what the hell you doing coming around here dressed like that no relative of shales ever did anything that didnt embarrass him the more sensitive sort never visit him generally that includes even those of us with hides like trolls your life is so full you dont have a minute to come ease an old mans last years thats right uncle given a choice between watching grass grow and listening to you bitch there aint no contest id always wanted to say that when i was a kid my mother stopped me later respect held me back though i think respect should run both ways shale is too selfengrossed to respect anything right now with a fresh crop of ogreinflicted bruises atop the other aches id collected recently i was crabby myself thats no way to talk to you want to be treated right you treat people right if i want to be pissed on and cut down i dont need to trudge all the way over here shales eyes widened he sat up more spryly than youd expect from a guy three times my age that parrot has become confused about what words to put into your mouth no kin of mine would talk to me that way all right im no kin and the buzzard is quacking he says you want things easier here help me i know where to find a bakers dozen of those molasses cookies you like i gave him a glimpse of the bundle medford shale wasnt stupid he wasnt the kind of character who didnt look out for number one either i learned to deal with him when i was a toddler before aunt alisa died and he bought into heavens gate thinking the staff would cater to him the way his wife had and they did almost but he could begrudge the most reasonable request human nature made paybacks inevitable one of the staff heard me mention cookies she was wide and ugly and tough neither tall nor entirely human probably a war veteran despite her sex she had the air female combat nurses did visit the cantard nothing sweet for him you nothing spicy they make him cranky really all my life ive thought he was just a nasty old man no shit you fambly she was so solid she recalled things id seen in foreign temples the sort of wide steadfast imperturbable creatures that guard doors and windows and roofs i nodded i see the resemblance shale observed a cookie never hurt nobody you ugly witch dont listen to a word she barks boy she tortures us she comes around in the middle of the night he thought better of continuing his rant possibly she did visit the troublesome ones in the night what do you want she asked me why she was surprised im in charge i need the residents are in charge you work for them very definitely a fambly resemblance i didnt come to see you unless you know something about shapeshifters then your company would be very welcome i was cranky not because the endemic crabbiness there was catching nor entirely because of all my pains i was going to have to pan a ton of fools gold to get any useful information here but gather a few nuggets i would if i persevered it never failed between them shale and his cronies knew something about everything and theyd lived most of it boy shale growled at me you cant talk to miss trim like you bark at some people you make nice over others you spring for a barrel of beer suddenly youre an honored guest at heavens gate even medford shale mellowed for six minutes before he passed out lay him out on his bunk like its for his wake i told miss trim she did say she was in charge didnt she her given name was quipo she said i could keep a straight face when i used it it turned into that kind of evening that old fart is so mean hell outlive me and any children i might father so i might as well enjoy a fake wake miss trim was all right once she got some beer inside her but shed never be a cheap date she put it away by the pitcher she chuckled a manly chuckle slapped me on the back hard enough to crack a few vertebrae i like a man wit a sense of humor garrett me too theres a guy i know name of puddle you really got to meet one of quipos henchwomen appeared she hadnt acquired her job through sex appeal few of the staff had the new barrel is here i groaned i hadnt ordered up this latest soldier but i knew who would pay for it and i hadnt gotten much out of anyone yet though id been offered the impression that id learn plenty if i just hung on have them bring it right over here where i can keep an eye on it some of them are indulging a little too much the old men were doing their damnedest to get ripped the staff were one scant stride behind boys and girls alike tried to light lanterns and swat bugs in the courtyard they did more harm than good but laughter filled the air this is a good thing youre doing garrett quipo waved vaguely these men need a party its an expensive thing that im doing not that my employer employers couldnt afford it i would bill them if ever i rooted out anything useful theyre lubricated now i really do need to find out something about shapeshifters for a moment miss trim looked like she might contribute something then she asked isnt that kind of an exotic concern her hand brushed my leg the goddamn parrot noticed stirred restlessly muttered under his breath how steep was the bill here likely to be word was out that i wanted information shale had said plenty most of it untrue wrong or just plain libelous and nowhere near the subject old or young rich or poor saint or sinner the human males of tunfaire have one thing in common were all veterans the tie binds us once invoked it can however briefly shove aside most other concerns one peculiar geezer named wright settling who never recovered from having been a career marine drew himself a sputter off the dead barrel he grumbled because the new one wasnt ready i told him jarhead i really need to talk about yeah yeah you kids always in a hurry after all these years it can wait a minute what can wait hold your horses trail and storey theyll tell you all about it endlessly evidently hearing all about it was one of the more painful costs of sharing heavens gate he glanced at miss trim and snickered maybe somebody elses got something for you too in more ways than one ever notice how some older people stop caring if theyre rude jarhead was a case in point often less politic than medford shale without complaining as much peoples lives do depend on me solving this solving what i had only a shadowy notion what was going on thats storey right there ill get him soon as i get my beer i fooled jarhead i didnt play his game i broke quipos heart by abandoning her too me and my delinquent feather duster went to storey mr storey mr settling says youre the one man here who can really help me never hurts to mention their importance he did did he jarhead why the hell is that old fool putting it on me who the hell are you im shales greatgrandnephew im sorry more significantly im the guy who bought the beer and i may not tap the new barrel i seem to be wasting my time why waste my money too i turned toward the newcomer me and trail was in the army together storey said not missing a beat i had a feeling i was about to hear one of those stories that define a lifetime during the myzhod campaigns we saw more shapeshifters than youd think could exist myzhod campaigns couldve been the bloodiest phase of the war but that didnt mean anything to me today a little before my time mr storey i didnt expect you to know he smiled resignedly we all learn to do that there must have been a hundred huge campaigns that nobody remembers now but them that survived them yeah dont i know it most times i mention what it was like in the islands guys who werent there just yawn and come back with a story about the really deep shit they got into so you ran into shapeshifters down there were they venageti they was supposed to be ours folks forget that they worked for us first special ops they wouldnt waste them as infantry would they i wouldnt but im not the brass you never know with them storey chuckled you got that right i recollect one time so what about these changers back then i didnt expect much anything might help they took the point on the myzhod offensive storey seemed a little dry i made sure he got first crack at the new barrel he sipped saluted me by hoisting his mug continued the myzhod is a driedup river the venageti had a string of bases on the south side they used them as jump offs in a bunch of different operations those bases were tough theyd stood up to some heavy attacks some big names were getting embarrassed high command was pushing hard they come up with a plan where shapeshifters would infiltrate a base and open the way for us commandos wed bust everything open for the regulars following on behind first night us guys carried off the bodies of the guys the changers replaced second night after those things wormed deeper inside where they would cause confusion and grab the inner gates we were supposed to attack where theyd prepared the way wed rip the belly of the base open before the venageti knew what was happening storey paused for a long drink a tear dribbled down his cheek another old man joined us this the myzhod massacre will yeah garrett thiss trail glad to meet you trail trail said will an me was almost the onliest ones what got away thats on account of we smelled a rat because things was going too slick wed already switched livery with some dead venageti so we just ran around like a lot of other scared crazy idiots till we figure it out then we cut out soon as we got a chance it was a setup storey explained the whole thing was from the beginning the venageti line troops wasnt told up front they was part of a trap so they didnt give it away the fact is them shapeshifters sold us out they led the whole damned army in there and got most of karentas best soldiers killed which probably made the war last forty years longer i guess the powers that be wouldnt brag about a defeat so severe it took two generations to recover i knew id learned something interesting but didnt see a connection with my situation now this was the first id heard about shapeshifters serving on our side except for what was implied by the dragon tattoos with their karentine motif of course when was this storey fortyone or fortytwo fortytwo trail said it was the year my mother died and my brother was killed that was fortytwo you remember will the news was waiting when we finally got back to friendly territory yeah would you believe they wanted to charge us with desertion storey grumbled trail grumped we demanded a truthsayer even then they didnt want to believe us because a disaster that big would ruin lots of careers but eventually enough others got back that they had to believe a story everybody told we won a kind of battle just getting back with the truth storey said the gods smiled on us we had to cross two hundred miles of desert without getting caught by the venageti or the natives if we didnt get back them shapeshifters couldve pretended to stay with karenta and led even more troops into the cauldron it was bad trail told me i still get nightmares about that desert i wake up and try to convince myself it was worth it cause ifn will an me didnt make it back maybe there wouldnt have been any war for you kids to win most of us try to think that way mr trail i shuddered recalling the islands mostly wed just wanted to stay alive but thered been a flavor of hanging on so somebody else could bring the slaughter to a favorable conclusion someday in fortytwo eh over fifty years ago and these old friends were still scrapping with the darkness maybe there was one more trick they could play on the nightmares you ever see those shifters up close up close storey growled shit we practically slept together the three months before the attack i reckon we saw them up close one ill never forget we called him pinhead pinhead sounded something like his name in his own language and it fit none of them was really bright it made him really mad when we called him that trail said they were so dumb we figured the gods made them that way to balance off how they could turn into something else when you wasnt looking like they had to be too stupid to take complete advantage storey said i dont think they had the ability to appreciate the blessing some of it they couldnt control some of it they had to do whether they wanted or not yeah trail said there was this one called stockwell he made a chicken look smart he was only a kid by their standards the rest of them rode him whoa stockwell for sure he was another one that got called what his name sounded like most of them did we turned this one into carter stockwell it was kind of a joke too on account of couldnt be the same clown could it after all these years ive been butting heads with a bunch of shifters believe it or not one of them calls himself carter stockwell really trail asked for the first time he seemed completely interested aint that interesting will sure is id like to run into carter stockwell again some time when i have a sack full of hot irons and silver knives you know its almost impossible to hurt them unless you use something silver i nodded i noticed trail said always been my pet theory that silver is the reason they got involved in the war in the first place that they never was on nobodys side but their own if they could glom onto the silver mines theyd control the best weapon that could be used against them you could be right i said though that sounded like a stretch to me interesting have some beer gents keep talking name some more names not that i believed their carter stockwell was mine he might be a grandson though talk to me about tattoos that drew blank looks and puzzled grunts the changers im running into all have a dragon tattoo right here its about six inches long but hard to see when theyre alive storey shook his head i dont remember nothing like that me neither trail said i do miss trim told me she was well sloshed now sliding out of focus she wore a lopsided trollish leer was she making it up to get my attention its a dragon squeezing the commando insignia in its claws i grunted were onto something quipo they were commandos mercenaries i didnt know they were shapechangers though they called themselves the black dragon gang said they came from framanagt which is an island so far east of nowhere that nobody would ever check was anybody named norton involved colonel norton was their commander but he was karentine stockwell and his pal had expected me to know something about their crew what did black dragon do to get famous nothing it was the other way around they did everything they could to hang around full harbor they only went out when they couldnt avoid it you dont make a name doing that thats where you were full harbor for nine wonderfully miserable years full harbor was where id had my only previous encounter with a shapeshifter a venageti agent masquerading as a karentine spymaster was there a connection should i have made one when did you separate six years ago quipo didnt want to talk anymore she wanted to act but the only guy around young enough wasnt interested six years was long before my own encounter i reminisced silently trying to discover if i knew something i didnt know i knew apparently i did or black dragon didnt realize that i didnt know was there ever any suspicion that the black dragon gang might not be trustworthy uh the beer was hard at work now i was about to lose quipo is there any chance those guys were really working for venageta miss trims eyes focused momentarily she gave it a good try uhm dwould splain a lot never fought a dat plop she melted on the spot the cranky old men became excited only the fact that quipo had a few sober sisters chaperoning saved her from a catalog of minor indignities and vengeances i became the crowd favorite i was an ear that would listen every old man wanted to tell his life story none of those had anything to do with shapeshifters part of the cost of doing business i might have to come back someday i hung in there bravely almost as long as the moon did but eventually the beer ran out and i fell asleep i had a hangover again surprise it was not yet a classic it was just an infant but it had potential this was practically the middle of the night still dawn was only a hint of color in the east victor nudged me with a toe in a spot that the ogre had thumped yesterday i woke up sprawled under an olive tree supported by cold damp stone the goddamn parrot was on a branch overhead muttering he made no sense but occasionally my name entered the mix get up garrett victor insisted pain blazed through my side oh no not another cracked rib some guy is looking for you some guy that didnt sound good i hadnt mentioned heavens gate to anybody ever nor had i noticed anybody following me not that id made much effort to keep track crask and sadler were in the tank the shifters ought to be licking their wounds nobody else should be interested get up damn you victor let me have it again in the identical spot harder he knew what he was doing victor was a teetotaller a member of tunfaires smallest and most viciously bizarre cult he was the only bornagain alcohol hater at heavens gate hed let me know again and again what he thought of me dispensing the devils sweat victor you do that again youll need to get fitted for a wooden leg victor chose discretion your party is outside the front gate my party was ritter from relways deck of jokers brother relway was looking like a mojo man who sees all and knows all i asked dont you guys ever sleep sleep whats that wait yeah i remember they used to let me do that when i was in the army once a week whether i needed it or not dont have time to waste on it anymore though this is card somebody unclear clinging to a shadow lifted a hand but didnt speak i told ritter i always knew you groundpounders had it sweet but youre the first one who ever admitted it whats happening boss wants you back at the weider place that doesnt sound promising how come theres been another killing shit who was it this time i shouldve gotten saucerhead in there i couldnt say nobody told me im just supposed to get you howd you know where to find me he looked at the thing on my shoulder followed the parrot droppings no really the boss told me you were here i dont know how he knew i didnt ask that cut me off quick im just a messenger garrett he picked me because youd recognize me you guys bring any transport besides being hungover and achy from the ogres handiwork i was stiff from sleeping on cold damp stone you kidding garrett you know what kind of budget weve got cant blame a guy for hoping though i expected the worst you do that and youre never disappointed sometimes youre even pleasantly surprised it isnt that far you know just a couple miles more like four and i have a hangover and fresh bruises that ogre thumped you pretty good eh relways crew seemed to know every breath i took relway had to want me to know that too ritter was hardly so dumb hed give it away if it was supposed to be a secret just dont get in any hurry ill hike as fast as i can i gotta do one thing before we go though i limped over to shales apartment he lived alone his personality guaranteed his privacy i slipped the packet of cookies into the crook of his arm he was a nasty old thing but he was family the closest i had anymore colonel block met us on the weider front steps good morning garrett he was in uniform he dismissed ritter and card eyed me as though he had developed major reservations a large muscular nameless bruno lurked close by in case block needed a ton of muscle in a hurry the mansion looked deserted from the outside i saw no light and heard no morning bustle people should have been stirring you came yourself i asked this is getting big a definite highlevel interest has developed things are going on that we cant see from down here in the bushes i got the impression that he was understating and was not about to go into detail why i didnt want to hear that wheres relway good question i havent seen him since yesterday he sent for me i sent for you garrett because you know these people they need to deal with somebody familiar theyre like trapped animals right now ritter told me theres been another murder yeah guy name of lancelyn mac he had a headon with somebody who tried to force his way into the house the cripple was there but didnt see that part happen ty ty then talk to him i cant tell you anything he cant where is he everyone in the house is in the family dining hall anybody who leaves has to go with someone else that rule applies to everybody my people included nobody should be alone ever which explained the muscular behemoth attached to him like a shadow jabbering like a stone you think changers killed lance maybe nobody else is interested in the weiders are they i shrugged sketched what id learned at heavens gate block listened without interrupting interesting he said the same name cropping up then and now you could cobble together some weird hypotheses if you made a few assumptions about shapeshifter thinking you sure could i had one notion i wanted to bounce off the dead man it regarded his hero glory mooncalled and plans the man might have regarding tunfaire they have a strategy they have a goal if we knew what that was we could figure out what theyll probably do next next time we catch one ill be sure to be more careful about keeping it caught theyre in here here was the family dining room that had served as mr gressers staging area during the illstarred engagement gala tinnie ambushed me at the door where the hell have you been out whiteknighting around i rescued a maiden then i rushed to the bedside of an old man who doesnt have long to live i took him some cookies to ease the pain we heard about belinda contague i want to talk to you about alyx materialized her bounce and deviltry had gone missing she was a kid who needed somebody to tell her everything was going to be all right the whole crowd seemed possessed by a universal despair hi alyx hang in there kid were going to turn it around gilbey max nicks ty can we get right to it ty was in his wheelchair nicks sat nearby at a long rosewood table earlier that table had been shoved against the wall and piled with the goodies gressers people had been serving to the rest of us nicks was nowhere nearby mentally although she did grunt in response to my greeting i needed to hone my charm skills ty i said come walk me through what happened all business is my middle name even when i have a beautiful woman hanging on both arms in my dreams block wanted to see a recreation ty had refused to do it for him ty pushed his wheelchair away from the table i guess his voice was flat he was ready to give up but was going on because he was expected to go on id seen it before it might armor his soul till he passed through the dark fire nicks positioned herself behind tys chair she moved like a sleepwalker the remnants of this family would need a lot of help though if i didnt get somewhere soon there might not be a family much longer i followed nicks into the great hall block followed me i heard feet shuffle well max had invited himself along gilbey paced him ready to help max looked like hed aged thirty years this way ty murmured weakly alyx trotted along she might be up for a fight before long ty directed nicks to the foot of the steps to the front door he beckoned me i couldnt sleep garrett my back was aching and my leg was burning i decided id get some work done if i was going to be awake anyway i dragged poor lance out and made him come down here with me to talk about how we were going to bring the furnishings back i was in the chair right here looking back along the hall when gerris said something from up there i was surprised to see him he said someone was at the door he wanted instructions he seemed rattled lance said hed take care of it nicks i asked would you walk through lances role alyx scoot up there and be genord a snooty voice suggested why not let genord be genord genord stepped out of the gallery which continued to grow behind max and gilbey perfect you be genord then and well walk through it nicks positioned ty according to his instructions he told me i was saying something to the effect that i hoped dad wouldnt insist on putting that ugly rustbucket suit of armor back by the green colonnade when gerris spoke genord now at his post stepped into sight and announced sir theres a very abusive young man here who insists on being allowed inside thats not quite right i think he used the word obnoxious ty told me whats he want gerris genord replied he just wants in sir ty said thats when lance said hed take care of it he was exhausted he didnt want to be awake he was in a mood to be very rude to somebody i told him kick his butt down the stairs if you have to he went straight to the door i looked up at genord he told me i stayed with him just in case i wasnt alert enough something did happen and it was over before i could react i nodded go ahead nicks genord moved nicks into position at the door returned to his own place freeze i told them genord is this where everybody was exactly ty were you still looking up the hall genord nodded ty told me no i was looking over my shoulder like this but i couldnt see anything lance or gerris i didnt have to bend or squat to see that he was right you had to be two giant steps to his right even to spot the tail of nicks skirts but you saw it all i asked genord i was down to the unexpected eyewitness he nodded the man was in shadow though and i was turned toward master ty when lancelyn squawked but you got a look at the visitor when you answered the door didnt you id recognize him if i ever saw him again did you recognize him then excuse me im wondering if he might not have been here for the betrothal party possibly as one of gressers serving crew i see where youre going i dont think thats possible though if you assume that the assassin was a shapechanger he could have been here before in a different guise but didnt you lock all of them up genord seemed to be enjoying himself now was he fond of being the center of attention block observed evidently the guy wasnt out to kill just anybody otherwise he wouldve sliced you up when you opened the door and he must not have wanted in all that badly or he wouldve just made his entrance over you and ty hes already made one kill hed have nothing to lose by another i snapped he say anything to you genord appeared rattled again uh yeah lets see genords snooty accent evaporated he closed his eyes after a deep breath he uncorked a string of rude demands for the return of a missing girlfriend i frowned so did everyone else genord stumbled uh thats what it sounded like to me i was puzzled that was one reason i deferred to lancelyn i couldnt imagine that the man had come to the wrong house there is no other residence near the weider mansion i exchanged glances with block the puzzle was growing bigger i said i mean did he say anything after he hit lance but before you answer that tell me are you saying that this killer was accusing lance of stealing his woman no genord appeared to be surprised by the question not exactly well he didnt use any names but he mustve meant lacelyn because he kept accusing lancelyn directly then he did what he did and i think he was completely stricken by it afterward i think he panicked and ran away ty said there couldnt have been any girl genord and you know it i didnt hear what was said but i know a girl couldnt possibly have been the real problem lance told you why himself garrett yeah his thing for kittyjo not to mention that only a psychic killer could have counted on lance answering the door if he had a quarrel with lance what was this guy wearing genord what he wasnt naked was he give me an overall impression upscale down neat rumpled threadbare how was his grooming genord paused he didnt seem to have thought about his much uh almost military yeah thats what id call it his manner was crisp like the training sergeants we all recall so fondly he could have been describing himself he was recovering fast turning almost cocky again a changeable guy gerris genord block asked did you notice an armband or medals or anything else that might connect him to a freecorps or a rightsist group i didnt see anything to connect him to anybody or anything but death but he stayed in the shadows i took a couple of steps to the side looked up toward the door i told block colonel lets you and me walk through this ourselves block looked puzzled but his instincts had been right when he had asked for a recreation genord frowned troubled again i said ill play the killer you go be genord genord get out of the way nicks you be lance again ty dont move at all all right not a muscle ahem tinnie said whatre you trying to prove im trying to understand what happened something isnt right this doesnt make sense genord glowered i checked the layout the players were in place i stepped outside without closing the door so the bogeyman couldnt get me without somebody noticing then walked through the murder with gerris genord directing reluctantly then we did it again so i could see things from lances viewpoint then i told everybody go back to the dining room tinnie tarried i winked she went but not without a frown block asked you got something maybe it all may hinge on what could turn out to be a stupid question seemed to me i had a gut feeling but a lot of times murder just doesnt make sense this one might not make sense even if it was right i think it happened pretty much the way we walked through nobody contradicted anybody but the question what was gerris genord doing awake and answering the door in the middle of the night shit youre right i never thought of that you felt it or you wouldnt have had a hunch you didnt see it because genord is supposed to answer the door sorry just family right now i told tinnie nicks you qualify i considered before telling gilbey and you he was irked because id thought about it lets go to yonder corner drag over some chairs i dragged one for myself i gathered them in a circle knee to knee what is it garrett max weider was experiencing a resurrection of will maybe he thought something was getting accomplished i hoped i could maintain the illusion some of you may think this is a stupid question but the answer could be critical can anybody tell me why genord would be answering the door in the middle of the night even im not superhuman enough to stay on the job all day and all night too ty chuckled weakly he said nothing in normal times he wouldve spoken just to remind us he was there his eyes went cold when the substance of my question connected i didnt think of that gerris is always just there you dont have a night porter somebody like that no lets take it a step further then how do we know there was anybody at the door we just have genords word shit ty growled i never thought of that even when i was there but genord wouldnt max snapped why was genord up in the middle of the night nobody told me maybe i was good at what i do nobody said hey garrett maybe youre onto something i suggested why dont we ask genord gilbey muttered id hate to pick which one i didnt like the most lance or genord but under the circumstances take it easy we dont know genord is telling stories i didnt want to lynch the majordomo yet but i sure didnt buy the tale hed told max raised a hand glaring hard max was back get him garrett ill do it gilbey said he was right in normal times hed summon genord manvil stayed a step behind genord as they approached genord looked worried he felt the string running out i said ive got a problem with this thing genord it goes right back to that guy at the door nobody saw him but you ty says he never heard the guy but you said he was shouting maybe i was so scared it just seemed like he was shouting genord shrugged i cant tell you anything else sure you can you can tell us what you were doing up in the middle of the night you can tell us why you were at the front door when ty and lance came into the great hall genord shuffled his feet he looked for a way out he didnt answer me they took you by surprise didnt they they couldnt help but notice you sooner or later somebody would ask you what you were doing you panicked you didnt think you just did the first damned thing that popped into your head and that was something really stupid which you compounded by making up an incredibly stupid story i just answered the damned door sure you heard the knock all the way up to your room on the fourth floor come on genord youre not that clever its obvious you were sneaking in after being someplace you shouldnt have been unless you were waiting for somebody or maybe you really were squabbling with somebody somebody who didnt get out of the way fast enough when lance came up and maybe recognized him that couldnt be quite right but it might be close colonel block uhm you did have somebody watching the house didnt you the shithead supposed to be out there wasnt he sneaked off he claims to get something to eat but dont your men operate in pairs the other now former guardsman wandered away even earlier he hasnt turned up yet you kept a few too many watchmen on the payroll evidently though the first shithead did yell as soon as he found out something happened give him that he did the right thing even though he knew his butt was in a sling genord relaxed visibly while block delivered his bad news not a soul missed that i asked anybody got a silver coin and a knife gerris genord was no shapeshifter but he was a villain i had no doubt about that he refused to talk though block predicted he will eventually a regular sibyl he was i suggested check his room gilbey see if theres anything there to tell why hed blow such a cush job blocks men took genord away he went silently but with defiant pride i asked anybody know that man well young old male female human or otherwise none of the staff knew a thing that this betrayal came hard on the heels of the other tragedies suggested treacheries of incalculable depths did he have any particular friends nobody even heard of gerris genord suddenly hed never had a friend gerris genord is that some tropical disease gilbey returned ive got something i want you to see garrett what we didnt know gerris well at all the man was a pig i started but then intuited he was fanatically neat wasnt he he was gilbey offered me a scrap of burnt wool i saw nothing remarkable what about it would you burn your clothing according to some i should oh genords room contained no fireplace there was a small charcoal brazier though that had seen use lately despite the season it contained curled fragments of burned paper mixed with shredded wool remnants and crumbled charcoal the air still stank of burnt wool i said genord had some time to himself before the guard arrived obviously and there were comments about the smoke when we gathered everyone downstairs i didnt think anything of it at the time the chimneys do need work i stirred clothing with a toe he didnt have a lot of time only a few minutes really then we might still find something and look here gilbey indicated a large sack in a corner looks like an army duffel bag and it is gilbey upended the sack clothing small personal items and trinkets cascaded to the floor well it looks like brother genord meant to leave his position without giving proper notice and in a hurry this explains why weve had so many valuables turn up missing lately it did look like genord had tried to provide himself with a handsome separation bonus he didnt wear jewelry did he he never seemed the type no garrett its obvious he expected to have to run someday soon gilbey extracted a heavy gold pendant from the pile this was kittyjos it was a gift from lancelyn i glimpsed something blue beneath a tattered shirt pointed bingo a rightsist armband i never suspected that genord came across as a political eunuch what group i plucked it out thiss freecorps brotherhood of the wolf gilbey frowned isnt that an armed branch of the call with a really serious hardcore reputation this gets interestinger and interestinger not to mention scarier and scarier we turned up nothing else genord had found time to do everything but get away which made me wonder if the armband wasnt a plant or if it hadnt been so special to genord that he kept it nearby even though discovery would deepen his troubles as we went back downstairs i told gilbey lets dont tell anybody but max if everybody knows one of the calls people got himself arrested here some of the goofier members of the movement might decide they have to give the weiders lessons in how to treat their betters we didnt know that could happen genord might have kept his work and his politics compartmented but i didnt believe that not with the family and its brewery attracting so much attention lately not with the hardcore reputation of the wolves good idea but it wont stay quiet forever probably not which suggested that my next move inevitable but one i didnt want to make had to be undertaken soon or the opportunity would evaporate i pulled block aside as soon as we got back to the dining room more trouble i slipped him the armband that came out of a duffel bag genord packed after the murder looks like he meant to take off but didnt move fast enough the wolves were tough garrett commando types genord dont fit the part maybe hes honorary or hes a good actor you never know about a guy who managed to survive the cantard he sure didnt stop to agonize over the morality of killing lance even though ultimately it was a stupid thing to do there is that but people do do stupid things when they panic what do you think i dont know what to think i dont want to but im going to try to get inside the movement maybe i can find some answers there i want you to take care of these people whoevers been trying to hurt them isnt finished he hasnt gotten whatever it is he wants ill keep this armband ill discuss it with genord you shouldnt know anything about the connection if youre going to get close to his friends good point and you might clean up a little youll do better if youre presentable consider stashing the wonder buzzard too some of those people have fairly refined sensibilities they even hate parrots they especially hate parrots with an attitude problem you see whats happening on the streets call people dont believe in selfrestraint and the more they get away with the harder they push worth remembering you be careful what stories you tell about yourself too block told me theyll know when youre stretching the truth uhm relway isnt the only one watching you really shit i have my pride and one thing im proud of is that im good at working a tail or detecting one set on me i hadnt noticed anyone there arent many guys that good i had a bad feeling i asked block he told me i dont know how theyre doing it relway hasnt figured it out yet either you know its a trick hed like to have in his bag ill bet how bad is it sometimes you have an entourage more agony for my bruised pride time for a subject change what do you know about the institute for racial purity ive never heard of it whats it supposed to be i told him something else to check in my spare time you be careful garrett im not leaving yet i was ready though but not for the place i had to go i preferred a destination where the beds werent stone where i could sleep off my residual hangover without fear of interruption i plopped into a chair told max what i knew what i was doing and thinking and suspecting he was attentive his anger burned hot enough to heattreat steel he didnt blame me for his pain as a lesser man might have done i started awake as an arm snaked around my neck a taut bottom began making itself comfortable in my lap ulp i said the goddamn parrot chortled he was watching from the chandelier the behind belonged to tinnie tate she was in a snuggly mood you fell asleep mr weider said to leave you alone because youve been working so hard she leaned back to let me see an expression saying she thought i had him fooled and now go home and get some rest she wiggled my head was so cluttered with sleep i missed her point ill just find a spare room and grab a nap before i hit the road then belatedly the message soaked in on the other hand therere some mysteries at home that need solving if i have the help of an amenable assistant the goddamn parrot snickered i did need to be seen around there once in a while or some bad boy from the neighborhood would try his luck against the fear the dead man had woven so powerfully around our place tinnie growled she was tired so was i i said so but like everyone who didnt have to be somewhere else i didnt want to abandon the dining rooms relative security block had left several men on guard there for what good their presence might do alyx heard me talking she decided to come over want me to show you a safe place to nap garrett the devilment was back if weakly the staytogetherinpairs rule remained in effect no thanks i winked tinnie shifted to a less uncomfortable position my reward for saying the right thing she murmured how about i show you my guest room a mans gotta do what a mans gotta do tinnie followed me to the weider front door she was dressed for travel in a peasant frock and sensible shoes stupid me i asked where do you think youre going stupid me should have started discouraging her about an hour ago not that i could have gotten anything through all that red hair successfully with you you need somebody with you thats the rule ive got my talking feather duster what good is he in a fight he squawks a lot and be careful how you answer this one garrett ohoh time to make that extra effort i had to remember my lines just right only i hadnt seen a copy of the playscript yet redheads will do that to you so will blonds and brunettes and all the lovely ladies of every other hue all right then youre in thatll cure you of wanting in real quick what could happen i was just going to visit one of karentas most beloved subjects at his big safe country estate i learned quickly that the countryside is still infested with country it isnt my favorite part of the world i prefer domesticated bugs cockroaches and fleas and bedbugs they dont get greedy if they bite at all they dont rip off an arm and hang it in a tree to come back to later it was wellgroomed out there close to town but still way too green you getting tired i asked tinnie she didnt look tired she looked fresh sexy full of vitality and likely to be all of those still when i collapsed you trying to get rid of me again again i never one foot starting to swing out over the abyss i shut up maybe i was learning oh look tinnie took off running frisky as a fifteenyearold she leaped into a patch of cornflowers i told her the blue detracts from your eyes i like them anyway yikes she jumped higher and farther than you would have believed possible for such a trim slip of a gel a tiny face peered up out of the flower patch it belonged to a grinning miniature man or boy actually he was a pintsized teen his grin was humorless it was a conditioned response to the presence of big people he was terrified the grin was supposed to buy time while he figured out what to do flower stalks swayed behind him i glimpsed brownandgreen homespun in motion a flicker of golden hair tossing tiny heels flying well i chuckled the goddamn parrot chuckled i took tinnies hand pulled let the kids have their privacy what you mean yeah oh actually thats not such a bad idea garrett when you think about it i do that a lot well if you really all this fresh air is getting me giddy theres a wonderful big patch of cornflowers over there in that pasture not to mention cows and horses i didnt know any little people still lived outside the wall because of the thunder lizards youre worried about a few cows no there were horses over there eventually they would recognize me but the company went to my head i didnt want you worrying about the livestock if they bought bullshit by the pound youd be the richest man in tunfaire ill never be anything but a poor second i replied while morley dotes is alive tinnie hiked her skirts with one hand she ducked between the rails of the split log fence im only giving in because you keep pressuring me she showed me a couple of hundred taunting pearly whites this was my tinnie the argumentative evil twin her family doesnt see very often i leaned on a fence post the tip of my nose an inch from hers i just had a thought i glanced back toward tunfaire wed passed through a small wood a while ago the top of the hill a few towers and the general miasma of evil air hanging above everything were all that could be seen of the city a naughty one i hope actually its more a troublesome one there you go getting serious again sometimes i dont have any choice all right what is it colonel block warned me that im being followed around all the time by some very clever tails which would mean that somebody might be following me now doesnt that just mean somebody takes you serious arent you always complaining because people dont take you serious right its great for the ego but it occurs to me that if i yield to temptation and vanish into a flower patch with the most stunning redhead north of the cantard and i cant think of anything id rather do i might get trampled by watchers running to find out where i went that tree line back there offered the last good cover for someone tracking me tinnie leaned a little closer her eyes were only halfway open her lips were parted she breathed most stunning you witch she laughed see you forgot all about she stopped stared to her right somebody had left the wood somebody who was in no hurry somebody who whistled while he scuffed along the dusty road staying close tinnie whispered its still a good idea garrett maybe on the way home sooner or later a rumble like the stir of remote thunder came from up ahead we would reach another tree line in half a mile the rumble came from beyond that now what tinnie asked horsemen a whole bunch the stroller behind us caught the sound he vaulted the fence and disappeared into tall pasture grass on the other side of the road hmm i got myself over on tinnies side fast head for those tall weeds why because we dont know whos making that racket it could be somebody we dont really want to know oh the war taught me to suffer inconveniences and discomfort stoically so i only grumbled a little about the thistles in the weed patch tinnie was more vocal poor spoiled city girl but she did clam up bugeyed when a squadron of centaurs hove into sight they were all males with the hard look of campaign veterans they maintained a warlike traveling formation they were armed and alert the army wouldnt like this i didnt count them but there had to be at least sixteen they might have been looking for something they didnt see it in the pastures though they moved on quickly what was that about tinnie asked when the coast was clear what are they doing all the way up here we had watched centaurs from hiding together before a while back in the cantard which is where centaurs properly belong i dont know but those guys werent your everyday refugees i dont like it it isnt far now north englishs dump is just past the next bunch of trees i hoped id never been invited out marengo north englishs digs were typical of karentas ultrawealthy gentry the centerpiece was a huge redbrick manor house that crowned a knoll half a mile behind a tall hedge of some plant consisting mostly of thorns there was a lot of green grass numerous wellgroomed trees sheep cattle and neat military squares of tents an illustration of the place would have overlooked the livestock and bivouac workaday aspects of the rural idyll always get overlooked you ever been here i shouldve asked earlier no i always heard hes kind of reclusive she indicated the tents lot of relatives visiting you been here my folks never moved in these circles tinnie started putting on her shoes shed been going barefoot claiming she wanted to feel the dust squish between her toes they were very nice toes even dustydirty but i decided to study the hoofprints outside the gate instead numerous oddly shod hooves had milled around there recently or maybe it was just a trick of the light the day was getting on why isnt anybody on guard tinnie asked between shoes she danced on one foot while she tried getting a shoe onto the other tucked up behind her her effort had its moments id been wondering myself was north english that confident i didnt believe it not in this world not this near tunfaire the gods themselves arent that confident i kicked at hoofprints it worries me too those centaurs hadnt looked like theyd been in a fight should we head back its late itd be dark before we got to the gate in darkness outside the wall is nowhere i want to be call it prejudice the owners and workers of manors farms orchards and vinyards get by just fine those without stout walls just dive into deep cellars via twisty tight tunnels if the big thunder lizards come calling anything else they kill before it kills them i dont take risks if i dont have to the night can hold things worse than death in the jaws of a hungry beast you scared garrett sure you understand what im doing if you dont youd better start were a team big boy you and me and our ugly baby the goddamn parrot lifted his head long enough to give her a baleful look i looked balefully at our surroundings the spread seemed almost lifeless something i can do for you folks here came the missing guard out of a cluster of evergreens not far inside the gate next to the road he was buttoning his trousers he had trouble concentrating on his fingerwork he was stunned by tinnie i know the feeling i get it all the time names garrett im doing some work for marengo he was supposed to leave word i guess he did i recognize the name his nose wrinkled but hes not here theres a big rally tonight he checked tinnie again probably wondering if shed like to change her luck in men things are bad when groatadozen brunos take on airs maybe belonging to the call boosts your selfconfidence he said go on up to the house front door only someone will be waiting i lifted an eyebrow started walking tinnie grabbed my arm the gateman looked sad soulful constipated life just isnt fair you little heartbreaker i told my little heartbreaker what you completely destroyed that man just by walking away with me what are you talking about she never noticed then she bumped me with her hip devil woman somebody was waiting she was long and lean and looked surprisingly regal observing our approach from above she also looked like she had a sudden toothache come on i dont think she was glad to see me tinnie offered me another solid hip bump thats for what youre thinking the woman must be half loghyr miss montezuma seemed less than thrilled to see miss tate too but put her disappointment aside she was cool elegant imperial this lady was always in control welcome to the pipes mr garrett miss tate youve chosen an inopportune time to visit everyones gone to town tonight is supposed to be important for the movement we joined miss montezuma on the porch i considered the manor which dated from the middle of the last century and was supposed to be a minor fortress some tightwad had been skimping on the maintenance it needed a lot of exterior work the surrounding protective ditch hadnt been cleared out in a generation if i had friends like marengos id keep it filled with acid and alligators i surveyed the vast lawns or pastures they were pretty enough one frazzled kid was trying to convince some sheep that they wanted to head back to their paddocks everybody went even marengo north english never included himself in the calls public exercises what happened out there one area of lawn was torn up as though cavalry had fought there maybe the livestock had been folkdancing tama montezuma frowned the cattle or sheep must have done it tollie has no help at all why did everybody go marengo doesnt tell me everything but he did say tonight will be a turning point for the call and karenta its a shame i missed him miss montezumas gaze brushed miss tate isnt it my luck turns fantastic when theres no possibility of benefiting tinnie kicked my ankle i glanced at her she had a flower petal in her hair the goddamn parrot snickered so what do i do now come in have supper i was about to start my own then ill find you rooms its too late to go back to town and you might not want to be there anyway we could talk about why you came out maybe i can help i said ouch sorry miss busyfeet took her heel off my big toe im so clumsy today the goddamn parrot snickered again who am i to argue with a beautiful woman she couldve left her shoes off though the goddamn parrot began to dance on my shoulder he had not yet eaten today he said something it was just a mumble garbled along the usual lines but intelligible only to me i hoped the impact of the presence of two beautiful women must have weakened the spell binding his beak or we were too far away from the dead man for him to control that beak completely or his nibs had become too distracted to stay on that job or maybe he had turned routine buzzard management over to one of his less attentive subsidiary minds none of those were very bright certainly he would not have taken his attempt to mislead rightsist observers so far as to abandon completely his ability to spy on me that would deprive him of so many opportunities to gather ammunition for future nag sessions yes old bones was still out there somewhere playing his own hand involved in some way whatever appearance he tried to project this case touched upon too many of his fascinations for his defection to be complete and real youre so sweet tinnie said she scratched the quacking feather dusters head how come you never say things like that garrett tama montezuma offered me a dose of my own medicine she raised one eyebrow and smiled a thin little smile that dared me to open my yap i took that dare shut your beak you perverted vulture to the multitalented miss montezuma i said besides reporting in i hoped to do some research on shapeshifters she jumped research on shapeshifters here ha id blindsided her with that the royal library referred me to the calls institute for racial purity which is supposed to have a library chockfull of books about nonhumans oh that im amazed any outsiders take it seriously the books are piled all over the old dining hall they keep collecting books without knowing what to do with them they cant get anybody who knows anything to come out here i suspect because they think a librarian should work out of conviction instead of for a salary they probably meant marengo north english wellknown skinflint tinnie said sounds like a job for garrett he can read and everything im no good at organizing which was why i hired dean way back when the old boy started out parttime next thing i knew hed moved in you hungry miss montezuma asked famished tinnie chirped i didnt doubt it the woman could eat a whole roast pig and never gain an ounce i smiled over her shoulder nodded i didnt want miss montezuma thinking my friend did all my talking for me tama was amused ill take you past the library on our way to the kitchen you can poke around there after we eat marengo wont mind marengo isnt here doesnt seem to be anybody here there was no sign of staff although marengos shanty dwarfed the weider hovel though how you can tell in all this gloom hardly a candle was evident there arent any servants anymore miss montezuma replied and were frugal with all consumables if we need light to work wed better get the job done in the daytime though i suppose i could find a lamp for you they just fall at my feet willing to do anything there arent any windows in the old dinner hall the goddamn parrot snickered you better do something about that sneeze bird i asked miss montezuma whats going on they say marengo is tight but the cause is a vampire its hunger never goes away he has to cut back somewhere did north english start out less rich than everybody thought the impedimenta of great wealth seemed plentiful enough if old and mostly threadbare at least he hasnt had to sell the candlesticks to make ends meet dont be cynical marengo believes he has a divine mission i doubted that being a cynic what about miss tama montezuma it doesnt matter what miss montezuma thinks shes just marengos fancy woman if i buy that will you try to sell me maps to hoards of fairy gold bargainpriced im sure miss tate is far too alert and levelheaded to let me take advantage of you i didnt look at miss tate i had a feeling miss tate would be hard at work restraining her redheads temper my smirk might overtilt the load im curious tinnie said reasonably enough if you have no servants how do you eat i cook better than i do what im famous for whew miss montezuma cooked very well indeed with tinnie and i following her instructions we collaborated in constructing a meal featuring a wild rabbit tama claimed to have caught herself a woman of many talents tinnie observed yeah i made a mental note to check miss montezumas background street legend didnt dwell on her antecedents which was unusual everybody loves a scandal during supper i was ordered to call miss montezuma tama and learned that north englishs place really was deserted the man from the gate was named stucker he avoided conversation with a passion tollie was a montezumastricken fourteenyearold who managed the livestock there was a silent old man who had one eye and a hook for a right hand venable constituted security at the pipes venable thought thunder lizards were the most wonderful things the gods ever created he couldnt understand why they were unpopular he could go on about them forever he kept a pack of his own as pets and security associates they would have the run of the estate tonight venable claimed his babies only ate strangers i suspected that if you got yourself eaten venables position would be that you couldnt possibly have been friendly an advantage of thunder lizards as guards is their stupidity you cant bullshit them but stupid is exploitable too theyll forget everything and go for the snack if you toss them something like say a squawking parrot with his wings clipped tama discouraged table talk though venable wanted to bring me uptodate on things to do with thunder lizard fandom tollie couldnt stand to look at tinnie or do much more than croak if he tried to talk to tama after supper we headed for the library i insisted marengo might say no if we waited his racist treasures might be damaged by eyetracks long ago i learned that nobody wants to share information that looks like a resource the room set aside for the library was huge and cluttered most of the stuff there had to predate any notion of a specialized library some id bet predated any notion of marengo north english tama said marengo wants to set up his research center here but hes never found time to get started i got the impression shed heard talk till she didnt listen anymore its not like hes short on manpower he could drag in a bunch of true believers and set up in a day hes too paranoid yeah i set my lamp on a dusty side table assayed the job ahead books were jumbled into small wooden crates in no obvious pattern scrolls were tied in bundles of four or five i selected a bundle how do you feel about what hes trying to do my thoughts arent consulted she wasnt going to offer an opinion did she know anyone well enough to take that risk tinnie prowled the room slowly she used her lamp to illuminate books where they lay maybe hoping to luck onto something luck did seem as sensible a strategy as any she harrumphed i said miss montezuma youre being disingenuous i asked your personal opinion not if youre a consultant to the inner council of the call tama garrett tama listen to me im marengos companion his mistress strictly utilitarian what i think doesnt matter any more than what the chamber pot thinks unless one of us actually says something i like my life here most of the time her eyes said and when the bloom begins to fade she understood shed thought about that that was obvious immediately i recalled how north english had slobbered over belinda uncle marengo was in a mood to expand his horizons i dropped the subject tinnie exercised uncharacteristic selfrestraint heres something her timing was flawless the volume she handed me looked like it might actually be useful it was werebeasts the monsters that walk like men the title turned out to be the most interesting part of the book it dealt only with people who turn into wolves or bears or big cats or critters of a more mythological conviction those gods or devils who turn into eagles or snakes or whatnot with no problems in the weight differential department were the only selfdirected changers mentioned the creatures i wanted to demystify were anything but divine tama neither dug in nor read over my shoulder was she illiterate probably a pity but common enough especially among women i learned to read and write because that was a good way to kill time in the long dull intervals between wars storms of high terror a lot of guys did it was encouraged written communications get less garbled over time and distance karentas more literate forces proved marginally more efficient and effective than venagetas over the wars final generation now karentas masters are troubled they have begun to suspect that allowing commoners access to books may have been a grave mistake literacy puts crazy ideas into heads more useful when empty books let guys who have been dead for a hundred years pass on the one original notion they ever had which meant immortality for countless social insanities there was scare talk about the mob possibly teaching their young to read too thereby perpetuating the abomination todays freethinking insanity might continue for generations it might destabilize the natural order few girls get much education tinnie is an exception because amongst the tates everybody produces the tates are more like dwarves than people some ways tinnie manages their bookkeeping in time tama said im no night person garrett and ive been up late a lot recently i need to get to bed i missed her point she reiterated more directly i need to hit the sack garrett marengo will strangle me if i leave you unsupervised oh ill show you your rooms ill trust you not to sneak off with the north english family treasure during the night without light tippytoeing between the thunderlizard pups wouldnt venable be pleased i didnt run with tamas straight line tinnie waited for it watching me with smouldering eyes tinnie noted tamas mention of rooms plural as in closed doors for everybody maybe with nobody knowing where anybody was i got assigned first presumably on the assumption that tinnie was less likely to go rambling it was very dark in my room beyond the circle cast by tamas lamp theres your bed she told me the chamber pot is underneath ill see you and the bird tomorrow she took off with tinnie i had returned to the door without killing myself on stealthy furniture leaned into a hallway filled with darkness the women were out of sight already tinnie hadnt left a trail of bread crumbs covered with foxfire bad girl or maybe not bad enough the goddamn parrot chuckled softly i was beginning to wonder if having the old gutterbeak version of the bird back might not be preferable there are things in the dark i told him beware i shuffled to the bed undressed the bed was a fine great mass of down that gulped me whole i was asleep in seconds too exhausted to be long disappointed by my solitude nor was i disappointed when later i wakened to discover solitudes end did you use a ball of string to mark the way tinnie hissed how did you know it was me who else how about that gaunt witch montezuma or has she been here already i know its you because i know the scent of your hair and the shape and feel of the rest of you i didnt say out loud also you are less bony than not to mention shorter than the aforementioned gaunt witch not yet she hasnt i find it hard to believe myself but not everybody finds me as irresistible as you do oh im the weak one you want me to show you just how resistible you really are hold it down will you youll wake the parrot up now youre trying to shush me up i knew just the thing to shush her up but it didnt take for very long it never does partly because tinnie really likes being shushed up two unpleasant things happened at the same time the goddamn parrot broke out in some kind of sea chanty about swords and silver and dead men while someone else gave me a quick savage finger poke with a nail probably specially sharpened for the task a soreness upon my ribs suggested that the offending digit had struck several times previously a whisper accompanied the pain garrett somebodys in here with us it was not a quiet whisper the woman was not ashamed i groaned youre evil let me rest the bird shrieked like his just deserts were trying to get hold of him tinnie snarled garrett theres somebody in here dammit which pronouncement was followed immediately by a racket as somebody tripped over some sly and belligerent bit of furniture the goddamn parrot screamed rape tinnie screamed fire presumably on the assumption that that was more likely to get attention i yelled be quiet as i climbed out of bed feeling around for something suitable for bashing undesirable visitors furniture crashed nearer and nearer the door said door opened for an instant a hunched shape shown in silhouette against a ghostly light from the corridor before the door closed i had taken advantage of that light to navigate past two pieces of furniture that would have ambushed me otherwise because they did not seem to be where i remembered them a third piece more patient than the others waited till the door closed to move into position the impact of plunging headfirst into a wall even with my arms thrown forward to absorb it was enough to leave me groggy and seeing double which i was doing when i opened the door and leaned out cautiously my night visitor was moving away fast vaguely illuminated by a weak lantern trailing from her left hand her the figure looked something like tama and also a little like the herd boy tollie yet distorted perhaps by the crack taken by my noggin so maybe the sweet thing had considered offering some special hospitality and been panicked by hearing tinnie speak as she was sneaking up on me maybe it could happen i could not think of a reason why the kid would want to sneak in on me unless he thought he was entering tinnies room whichever how come the wannabe visitors other hand was hanging on to a hatchet or cleaver or some such large heavy sharp piece of metal who was it tinnie whispered from behind me i dont know ill bet i can guess no doubt you can to the bleakest possibility and make it all my fault hey thats your place lover in the wrong you think we should barricade the door just in case i think we should barricade the door if what i thought i saw was real that was one nasty piece of iron just in case but youd better hope they dont hold bed check over to your room i sleepwalk right we moved some furniture then we went back to bed then somehow i got distracted and ended up falling asleep before i had a chance to spend any time figuring out what had just happened if tama montezuma knew anything about or had had anything to do with or had any feelings about the previous nights events she gave no sign at breakfast good morning garrett i wouldve wakened you earlier but tinnie told me you havent been getting much sleep lately damn i never warned tinnie but she was all right so it didnt matter he seldom gets up before the crack of noon anyway tinnie said thiss way early for him hey i protested then never mind tama tinnie tells me youve had word that marengo is headed home a messenger came a few hours ago said marengo is on his way and that he wont be in a good mood for just an instant her eyes seemed shifty evasive troubled last night didnt work out for him how come he left you here i had been thinking about that and not being a major aficionado of marengo north english had developed some suspicions concerning marengo and his interest in female persons who were not his wife or niece i refused to believe that north english was so devoted to his convictions that he had gone off to help bully tunfaires nonhuman population a dangerous level of confrontation was anticipated that sounded like a quote from marengo but before you jump to any conclusions i chose to remain here and that sounded like the truest thing she had said for a while i glanced at tinnie her thoughts had taken her elsewhere i hadnt seen anything yesterday to suggest that something dramatic was going happen on the other hand i had spent the whole day distracted tinnies presence seldom left me with attention to spare still you tend not to overlook big gangs of guys all dressed in brown marching back and forth singing and busting heads wherever they find somebody not dressed in brown and marching and singing their favorite songs i didnt pursue my question tama volunteered he said it would be too dangerous her mask of control had begun to show cracks the missing mob began returning first to appear were a dozen freecorps types who roared through the house demanding food they were ragged i observed the other guys must really look bad slings and head bandages were plentiful smiles and laughter were not maybe the other guys never got their hands dirty rightsists kept turning up alone in pairs in small bands many were injured the mood was grim i suspected some wouldnt return at all they paid me no attention they even ignored tinnie whats with those guys i asked tama back in the library at last shed spent some time helping feed them they dont act human they got their butts kicked their big show turned on them damn tunfaire had long dreaded some huge demonstration by the call and i missed it out of town gone fishing was i lucky or what how come they dont notice you or tinnie none of those guys is over a hundred marengo is inflexible when it comes to what he considers correct behavior he has made it clear he considers correct behavior a hallmark of the superior being these men are all superior beings therefore they must conform to the highest standards your friend and i are spoken for it would be incorrect behavior for them to surrender to their natural inclinations they must show themselves to be the superior creatures they claim to be marengo insists and marengo pays the bills tama said every word with a face so straight you knew she wanted to explode in giggles she whispered ill tell you a secret though when theyre in the city surrounded by persons of other stations and other races they act their ages and classes you can take the boy out of life but you cant take the life out of the boy ill bet you know what youre talking about too tuttut i had tried to talk to several men in passing id gotten nothing but grunts and scowls for my trouble it didnt seem politic to press did they get into it with centaurs centaurs tama seemed startled she recovered quickly i dont think so it just seems all the other races were ready to fight the rioting grew bad enough that troops were sent in some places bet that didnt do much good shorttimers who thought just like the call werent going to be fanatics about defending nonhumans their real mission would be to ensure the sanctity of the property of wealthy friends of the call anyway probably call me cynical the calls strategy was no secret theyd been pursuing it on a small scale for weeks they wanted to terrorize nonhumans and destroy their property so they would flee tunfaire last nights riots wouldve been intended to become so intense and widespread that the crown could do nothing but let them run their course the inner council of the call had expected the night to be a watershed theyd counted on the fire of human resentment to flare out of control everywhere it hadnt happened theyd gotten limited support and unlimited resistance the fire had blown back into their faces the most militant nonhumans had been ready for them somebody had snitched on the call it wasnt an ignominious defeat though it was just an acute embarrassment tinnie and i ever chaperoned by tama worked out a system for identifying and reviewing books of potential interest she sorted and identified i read nothing turned up quickly i fell behind tinnie normally an intriguing place to be she asked all right if i start a separate pile for stuff thats not in karentine i guess wed need translators too i sneezed wish we could do something about this dust the door opened miss montezuma are you ah there you are the speaker was an old man with a bad artificial leg his trip to town must have been hell the chief is expected soon hes probably wounded probably tama was moving already reports vary sometimes hes in critical condition sometimes hes only scuffed up a little but he is hurt garrett tinnie i have to go have fun i was sure that the direst reports about north englishs condition would originate closest to him id seen him in action come on garrett you know i cant leave you alone i let another great line slide as we strolled the hallway in tamas wake tinnie remarked youre learning huh wasnt i youve stopped sticking your foot in every time somebody opens a door a crack did i miss something i doubt it but if you did so much the better pain is a great teacher darling tama went out onto the same high porch where shed awaited us we joined her in time to see marengo north englishs coach arrive armed horsemen accompanied it they were ragged bandages were common somebody loved marengo a militarystyle honor guard turned out so did a haphazard medical team how bad had it gotten there was no smoke over the city so folks hadnt started burning each other out yet but if there were many casualties it could turn nastier fast clearly the fun had gone out of dressing up and bullying the neighbors an ugly little devilworm of a word wriggled through the muck in the pit of my mind i hoped it didnt get out and infect these guys they were in a mood to embrace the demon its name was war on marengos estate where there were no pesky nonhumans to make them look bad the members of several call freecorps sparkled though guys with different armbands seemed to have scant patience with one another did they fight each other when nobody else was handy the medical crew whisked north english out of his coach onto a stretcher headed for the house fast from where i stood marengo looked like a genuine casualty up close he was grimly pale like hed lost a lot of blood he was still leaking his clothing had been destroyed by people eager to patch him up he was awake and aware he frowned blackly when he saw me his gaze jerked to tama suspiciously tinnie joined me north englishs suspicion faded he knew about us what was his problem tama fussed over north english sounded like she meant it too it wasnt necessary to fake everything in the deal she had she moved with the litter spewing orders she knew what she was doing shed had practical medical experience sometime the pipes crowd seemed accustomed to the presence of mysterious strangers nobody questioned us we were with the bosss woman hed seen us himself and hadnt had a stroke we must be all right i did have to field questions about my shoulder ornament fortunately the goddamn parrot kept his beak shut i didnt have to explain how id become a ventriloquist unfortunately none of those bold young warriors were in the market for a pet think what a wonderful mascot hed make i said put him on your standard and have him squawk insults at dwarves the bird squawked an insult at me it was incoherent but it was there few of the returnees were alert mostly they just flopped down somewhere and closed their eyes safe for the moment i remembered that from the islands after a long hard emotionally draining fight the moment we felt safe we surrendered to exhaustion by collapsing on the spot i picked a guy who didnt look as beat as some what happened he focused on me momentarily remembered seeing me with tama he shrugged somebody tipped them off i thought it was gonna be the great big ole hairyassed mother first night of the cleansing i thought we was going to hit the skells and skuggs everywhere all at the same time not just the call and theverly but all the groups and freecorps thats what they were doing at weiders the other night slapping the last coat of paint on their plan using a joyous occasion to mask the stir of darkness so somebody leaked it eh they was waiting like that said everything that needed saying misfortune hadnt robbed him of his sense of humor though he observed ogres is bad in a street fight they are hard to dent i speak from joyless experience a blond character shorter and younger than me born with a board strapped to his back and a chip on his shoulder stalked into the morning light he spotted tinnie used her as a landmark by which to locate me came over you garrett i confessed the commander wants to see you north english is there another im new at this i thought maybe colonel theverly follow me please i did i caught tinnies hand as i passed her tama was working on north english when we joined them in a room reminiscent of max weiders study though this was much larger if the weather turned bad the freecorps goofs could hold their maneuvers indoors a world of plotting could be managed from there the gloomy nether reaches contained maps hung above sand tables boasting miniature structures that looked familiar two guys with spears for spines and no imaginations were camped between us and the tables i guess in case i suffered one of my outbreaks of curiosity good to see they trusted me as much as i wouldve had i been the old boy getting mummified sir i said as the officer and i approached you wanted me he looked less determinedly antagonistic now tama says you came to see me his voice was weak and high but stronger than id expected he winced as tama swabbed an abrasion naked to the waist he was a pasty doughy sort of man also a lucky sort he hadnt been treated kindly he had suffered cuts and stab wounds and bad abrasions most men couldnt have survived i said i wanted to bring you uptodate he lacked enthusiasm in his position it would be hard to be enthusiastic about anything less than life itself i edited my story only slightly if i was being followed my movements were no secret anything id learned if id learned anything could be learned by others there was little point holding out and none to revealing that i was reporting to block and relway too i was up to the centaurs they were a military unit disguised but definitely veterans north english waved a hand wait a minute he pushed tama away i waited while he ordered his thoughts that took a while let me get something straight you had no idea the call would begin the cleansing last night not a glimmer but youre the only one i know whod know about it you didnt warn me but youre generally well informed and a keen observer you would have noticed anything obvious he seemed to be having trouble thinking i thought so myself if you didnt notice then it wasnt something we did that gave us away my guess was hed just realized that he had a rat in his walls tama miss tate i want to chat with mr garrett privately ed you and your men step out with the ladies ed was the officer who had delivered me apparently bodyguarding was among his duties he was scandalized sir i wouldnt recommend do it ed ed stopped arguing tinnie didnt want to leave either tama didnt want to leave they did not argue marengo north english was in charge i chuckled you got ed worried boss north english frowned at my familiarity possibly and thats my fault he took the same attitude yesterday i told him to go away and i ended up lucky to be alive how bad is it i told you i was lucky damned lucky they meant to kill me but a gang of dwarves looking for rightsists to fight popped up and attacked them im confused i confessed maybe you started in the middle dwarves saved you from human attackers why would they do that it was interesting that terror and pain would put him into such a talkative mood but why with me they didnt recognize me and the men who attacked me were disguised as members of the movement maybe they were possibly thats not a thought i cherish but i do have rivals although i dont think any of these men were that because i didnt recognize any of them even so i did want ed and the others out of here so we could speak freely about what you must look into what happened while youre doing whatever else it is that youre doing im particularly interested in knowing who those men were i am confident that they were specifically committed to the extinction of marengo north english and my survival is due only to an ironic twist of fate i still feel like were going sideways ill start from the beginning last night was a big night for the call wed planned for months we put it off several times because we thought we could make a bigger splash later but now we were coming up on the dwarfish new year we had to move before all their rustic cousins came to town for the holidays north english composed his thoughts carefully before he continued he was much more businesslike than he had been at weiders as you may suspect like you i have a taste for toothsome ladies not long ago i met someone new and intriguing she seemed equally interested last night presented a perfect opportunity to pursue the possibilities the cleansing provided a reason to be away from the pipes and there was nothing i could contribute to actual operations short of getting out in the street throwing brickbats with the others i listened for hints of hypocrisy i still had trouble picturing marengo north english as a true believer maybe the insincerity existed only in my imagination so you had a date rough trade too looks like i walked into an ambush i couldnt have been much stupider ed warned me but i wouldnt listen its the way men get sometimes i admitted having been there its only sheer fool luck that im here now he snuck a glance to see if i was conscious of the irony i eschewed any observation about fools and drunks are you heading somewhere i am yes pause deep breath eight of the most influential men in the movement were murdered last night somebody tried to kill bondurant altoona burned his house down but he wasnt inside did i hear disappointment ladora ankeny was hurt worse than i was poor woman i was attacked of course set up and attacked thought you and old bondurant didnt get along we dont hes not well liked we left him out of our plans but he did hear somehow and left home to get in the way if i know the man at all just before the fires started maybe were the attacks coordinated i believe they were why i meant why did he think that but that wasnt what he heard the assassins were all human i cant believe that theres that kind of opposition among our own people therere only two kinds of humans eyes calculating he paused to read my expression those whore with us and those whore with us but havent yet awakened you might be surprised boss you know who got killed right who they were could tell you why what did they have in common evidently north english didnt want to face that question he had an answer already that didnt please him so i asked noting that he was still trying to read me everyone attacked was involved in fundraising or made decisions concerning raising funds i think i might be the only one who could see that connection so maybe that was why i was targeted which offered us both an answer he didnt want to face along with a reason why hed slipped off to meet belinda jumping right into a honey trap and now his ego hurt worse than his body because he feared hed been set up from the beginning belinda was her fathers daughter with extra weapons she could blind men with their natural weakness and she had no concept of mercy i said if you play on their ground you obey their law only the strong survive you mess with their money they kill you unless you kill them they dont think like kings and generals or like you they dont send soldiers to attack your soldiers theyll kill your men only if they get in the way they want you once youre dead your soldiers are no longer a problem that seemed the obvious way to operate too ive never understood why when we caught a bigtime venageti wizard or general or noble wed always ransom him or even just let him go if he promised not to fight anymore i wondered what belinda would say about last night not that id ask i try to separate business and friendship if a friendship is what we have i told north english ive known these people a long time im surprised theyve been as tolerant as they have that startled marengo tolerant by their standards it wasnt my intent to engage in criminal activities mr garrett im the most visible call leader but not the only one not even the supreme one other groups started raising money that way a long time ago i opposed the plan when the council proposed it i reminded them that the call wasnt founded as a criminal conspiracy i reminded them that one of our missions is to set an example we cant cut corners because our cause is just if we do were no better than the other races and it sets a precedent well pay for later the man was heated up for a speech maybe he was a true believer i cut him off looks to me like youve got a good counterargument now possibly but i doubt it he paused i had nothing to say so thats what i said he continued its all out of control garrett its like riding a lion the beast answers the reins if the mood takes it and the gods help me if i try to get off and again with the calculating look what do you want from me looks like the outfit sent a message emphatically you were lucky you survived it theyll let you alone if it looks like it took i say dont aggravate them chodo is way less friendly than belinda did she set me up probably my guess was belinda just thought on her feet and improvised maybe that was why she wanted to meet you his pride was bruised more deeply than his flesh marengo north english thought well of himself what kind of world was it where a woman could use him as knife fodder you know belinda talk to her was he going to whine if youve checked me out you know i know chodo better than i know belinda unless shed developed a trueconfession habit north english smiled enigmatically maybe he knew more than i thought he could he winced closed his eyes his wounds still hurt badly what actually happened last night i asked north english after we took time for him to rest and take a painkiller id arranged to meet belinda at a rooming house on the far north side she said the place belonged to her family remember the name of the street i dont that was the drivers responsibility when i frowned he said i dont think it had one he colored slightly you went into an elven neighborhood elves dont get excited about frills like street names or house numbers just the edge nobody would expect to find me there no but somebody did yes north english proceeded to describe the attack on his coach which occurred soon after it entered that street it mimicked the attack on belindas coach was that coincidence quite possibly hed had an earlier close call and didnt yet realize it belinda had asked him to meet her at the palms and ceejay carlyle had been with belinda when she headed for her postparty rendezvous did crask and sadler mess everything up i asked should i talk to your coachman if you know a good necromancer you might im the only survivor they didnt get me dragged out of the coach fast enough thered be no way of doublechecking details short of consulting the men who had tried to kill him i had a suspicion that was a longshot daydream the details didnt matter had to be belindas doing and marengo knew that but i wondered if she might not have had more than one motive her attack had been extremely vigorous even for her if indeed she had ordered the attack it risked warfare now and persecution later if the call enjoyed any enduring political success she mustve decided that the outfit had to make a clear definitive statement incapable of being misunderstood by anybody which might mean she hadnt just been responding to business encroachments just suppose marengo had had some remote connection with the attack on belinda i decided that he must have had based upon no evidence whatsoever poor marengo that made him a zombie dead but still walking toward the knife somebody had brought crask and sadler back those two were fearless but they werent stupid and were only marginally crazy they knew lots of people wanted to carve them up they must have been sure they could do their work quick and dirty and profitably and be gone before death could pick up their trail so somehow north english got word to them when belinda showed up with me cleverly grasping the moment he might not have known that those two thought they owed me but would he have cared i didnt think so either then belinda made a date probably hoping to let north english meet carlyle for an exercise in comparative knife techniques and north english agreed probably thinking hed have fun with belinda if his hitters missed no proof none whatsoever all speculation but i thought the dead man would agree and hed looked inside belindas head where the snakes and spiders lurk i can conclusionhop with the best ive run with villains for years people who play those kinds of games you can smell them out if you know the stakes and luck onto a few hints up front these scenarios fit the facts neatly they didnt toss light into the shadows surrounding the shapeshifters and the weiders though they gave me no mention whether or not the call was trying to strongarm the weiders or was connected to the shapeshifters somehow damn it the one thing id figured out didnt help much belinda and the call could work out their differences with bloody steel or rattling jaws that wouldnt touch me belinda might have let the nonhumans know about the advent of the cleansing the outfit had tentacles reaching inside shadows relway only dreamed of penetrating everybody owes them something somewhere somehow though in this case marengo was probably the leak himself i asked any way you can bully your council into backing off backing off he got that air of struggling to concentrate again to quit trying to horn in on the rackets i can try if i had a good reason if theyre really doing that how about staying alive is that a good reason they wouldnt do anything just on my sayso garrett again if theyre really involved why did he keep pretending heres a reason they can understand if you get in a war with the outfit it wont just be marengo north english who gets deadthey can get to anybody eventually theyll find somebody close willing to be corrupted they wont be impressed by who you are who your parents were how much youre worth or who you know you shouldve gotten that message last night last night is why i hope youll find us a basis for negotiation i was puzzled it showed what north english demanded whats to negotiate theyll tell you to go away or get dead then theyll kill as many of you as it takes to make you understand i exaggerated a little the outfit is no monolith and the people inside are as venal as any other it could be tamed by somebody who wanted to focus a lot of energy and resources somebody like relway someday when he doesnt have to deal with all the other distractions assuming belinda didnt get to him first why go for the rackets anyway i asked the call is festering with rich people not many of whom want to open their purses for the cause theyre investing their leadership skills yes he was sarcastic and bitter ive financed almost everything ive fed and armed and clothed a thousand men for colonel theverly before theverly it was the brotherhood of the wolf what became of those guys i still wanted to figure out where gerris genord fit they wouldnt be controlled they were disbanded when colonel theverly came aboard some joined the new corps the hardheads dropped out went somewhere else north english waved a hand weakly dismissing the brotherhood it was old news he had a hobbyhorse to ride do you have any idea how much weapons cost when you have to buy them from dwarves wouldnt it be something if the dwarves used this crisis to strip humans of their wealth wouldnt it be something if the dwarfish weapons were used to exterminate the dwarfish race life gets funny that way i grunted he could take that as thoughtful commiseration if he wanted he changed the subject have you found anything in the library no and i really hoped i could root out something about shapeshifters that bunch at weiders were part of something big if i can learn more about the race i might be able to guess what north english didnt get excited tama says youre sorting as you go i appreciate that i know gathering information and studying it is important but somehow we just never get around to the library how did you know about it i went to the royal library they said id do better here or in some wizards private library i dont know any friendly wizards does anybody you kidding but he was talking to himself bitterly maybe he had had an unhappy experience i must have risen in his consideration he was treating me like an old retainer now almost with respect but with cautious lack of trust did you have a problem with one of our sorcerers wouldnt exactly be unique if he had north english realized he had given something away he didnt like that didnt everyone who visited the cantard quick shift of subject tama overstepped herself by allowing you into the library without consulting me but it was a good idea let me know if you find anything interesting max weider is my friend too i was dismissed he accentuated the point by closing his eyes he wanted to rest he wanted to think to conjure some way he could take his special breed of liberty to tunfaire with better effect i left the room i found a crowd outside frowns prevalent everybody afraid theyd missed something important lost in thought i ignored them marengo had a connection with a wizard should that surprise me he was a powerful man wizards prefer the company of powerful men to that of slobs like me why i can be charming did it even matter tinnie and tama eyed me expectantly i told tama hell live and hes in a more charitable mood than id have thought it must have been love at first sight tinnie he wants to adopt you offered me three shiny new groats if he could have you for a niece thats not funny garrett thats what i told him i said you dont have any sense of humor he said just wait till i tickle her fancy tinnie snapped whyre you laughing tama im trying to visualize those words coming out of marengos mouth it isnt a pretty picture i said he told me to go ahead with the library and let him know if we found anything tama said since you have his blessing you and the nieceapparent go to it i have work to do tama pushed through the crowd even mistresses have responsibilities freecorps officers continued to gather maybe they were worried they might have to look for work tama did what none of them dared she entered marengos sanctuary tinnie murmured i dont know what to make of that relationship most of the time she acts like she doesnt care she cant afford to too much i said and she probably wonders about you and me too whats that supposed to mean that i dont understand either but my new years resolution was to stop trying to figure out relationships ill deal with what people show me tinnie paused to think shes bright but she sometimes forgets to wake her brain up before she lets her mouth take off two of us doing that at once causes problems dean says we were made for each other dean has said the same thing about me and several bright picturesque young ladies hes even said it about me and take my pick of his platoon of homely nieces real nieces dean believes i need more stability he doesnt like the way i live now youre drifting off on me didnt get enough sleep last night bragging or complaining i was thinking about dean why hes gone they both are really the news startled tinnie i never thought its the times uhm she became very quiet she didnt say anything until we were back among the books is it permanent garrett what the split with your partner i glanced around i tapped my ear you couldnt be sure who was listening the call were paranoid by nature after last night they would be doubly so it had to happen my sympathies arent what they used to be dean wouldnt see things my way he wouldnt listen to reason and so they sneaked out the facts awed me whenever i recalled that the dead man actually let himself be moved maybe even asked to be moved ah i could find him if i could unearth saucerhead tharpe must have been in on it he was one of very few people the dead man would trust to help id be expected to figure that out for myself far be it from my pet fruit bat to speak up if the split is permanent there was an edge to tinnies voice she had something in mind maybe something risky the goddamn parrot shuddered and twitched fell of his perch he flopped around amongst the books dust flew inarticulate noises spewed from his beak i dont know i stared had something happened to the dead man the bird seemed to be trying to talk maybe his nibs was making a desperate effort to get through or maybe darkness was overtaking him at last maybe before he checked out he would be kind enough to share his thoughts about what hed overheard if hed been paying attention chances were hed fallen asleep and this was one of his nightmares leaking tinnie said hes been acting strange for a long time i opened a book how would you know whats strange for that runt condor you werent in on getting me stuck with him were you her sense of humor could include a prank like the goddamn parrot especially if she thought i deserved it no but i think morley showed a lot of flair finding him that morley is a piece of work isnt he i grumped are we going to move in out here tinnie asked i havent been home for days i imagine uncle willard is starting to steam hell boil over when he finds out you were with me he likes you garrett sure from a distance hes not blind or stupid in a minute wed be back to me moving into the tate compound you want me to take you home i dont think my cute new uncle can do it for a while besides he tickles i looked around wed been through scores of books that didnt amount to ten percent of the heap less if some of the drifts had formed atop dunes of documents not immediately evident i didnt want to leave the library was a great excuse to hang around the heart of the call just being at the north english place would put me next to a lot of interesting stuff nobody would notice me after a while i would become part of the furniture this is a great opportunity no sense letting tinnie in on everything what she didnt know she couldnt share with friends whose politics were suspect i understand that i dont want you to waste it but uncle willard will be foaming at the mouth especially when he hears what youve been doing she grinned those devils wakened in her eyes we could give him one more reason for wicked wicked woman right here look around nobody ever comes in here click the door opened excuse me i hate to interrupt but thats all right ed i told the stiffbacked officer he winced the old man asked me to include you in our response to a problem thats just come up he told me id find you here he was right again what kind of problem murder ah shit not again i shed some dust and the book i was pretending to skim what can i do the old man says youre the expert ed looked tinnie over he had no trouble with his sexual identity and was one hundred percent in favor of redheads the guy might be all right after all lets go as we descended the front steps i said ed i need to take miss tate home sometime today shes overdue her folks will be worried why tell me i didnt think venable and his lovable lizards would care and youve got the next closest interest in security here right i thought youd want to know whos coming and going and why if you want to do me a courtesy id prefer you called me lieutenant not ed his voice was brittle i was supposed to be cowed all right ed i wont call you ed no more but dont look for any military crap im out of that i dont need it dont appreciate it dont like it if it helps think of me as a civilian contractor he didnt warm to that idea civilians are not to be trusted you dont have enough control but he said all right mr garrett on that basis call me mr nagit or lieutenant or lieutenant yes tinnie was tagging along the goddamn parrot had adopted her shoulder for the time being one of them snickered i have my suspicions which though both my trials showed straight faces i asked you interested in a parrot mr nagit i dont think so he can talk then definitely not mr garrett but when you decide to get rid of the other one he chuckled make me an offer i chuckled too garrett sorry darling mr nagit smiled wed made peace for the moment mr nagit led us toward the front gate a crowd had gathered out there more men were headed that way i said these guys need something to do the old man said give them a day to recuperate but youre right uhn whats this mess we had come to the tornup part of the lawn i said i noticed this yesterday i asked miss montezuma about it she didnt know what happened mr nagit eyeballed the hoofprints he moved a few steps this way a few steps that i tagged along he observed there were at least a dozen animals involved pretty light and poorly shod came this way from the gate swung around there then went back they were galloping when they came up to the turn but they walked back down i agreed they were chasing somebody this may connect with our murder nagit started toward the gate reconsidered the battered ground sure made a mess a mess bane of the military mind maybe they were playing with their prey what kind of people would tinnie and i saw a band of centaurs when we were coming out here i described the circumstances no point being secretive id told north english already and suspected he might have said a word to mr nagit centaurs hmm meanwhile tinnie tried to shush the goddamn parrot that clown rooster was having a mild fit i asked do birds behave strangely around here mr nagit not that ive noticed that buzzards had two seizures this morning i thought he mightve picked up something not here we soldiered on toward it developed the cluster of evergreens just inside the gate i observed these people shouldnt be tracking all over the murder scene i understand that i told everyone to stay out of the trees the body in there see for yourself i saw for myself mr nagit bullied the freecorps thugs into moving back i did admire their discipline there wasnt much smell yet but the flies were plentiful theyre always the first to know i heard them before i saw anything the first dead thing wasnt human it used to be a wild dog before something left nothing but a head and some feet and fur and odd bits of bone scattered amongst the welltossed pine needles i heard a little teehee i looked over my shoulder and wasnt surprised to see my oneeyed lizardloving buddy venable checking another savaged remnant of wild rover did your babies do this he tittered killed the wild dogs and ate them they did yes and never laid a claw on stucker he was dead already they wont touch carrion unless theyre absolutely starving even then sometimes the strong males will eat the weak ones before they touch cold meat hee the dining preferences of his pets didnt interest me mr nagit was less intrigued than i i asked whats this about stucker he looked pretty healthy when i saw him a few minutes ago venable looked baffled soon i saw why stuckers corpse was naked it was dirty and far from fresh the wild dogs had been at him during the night long before my glimpse of him in the house a while ago there was no doubt hed been dead half a day before the dogs found him i muttered but he was at supper with us last night the pine needles were well stirred here and there in the soft soil beneath were clear hoofprints why didnt they bury him i wondered aloud they did over there venable told me just not deep enough the dogs dug him up we pulled him over here and brushed him off before we sent for the lieutenant i wanted to scream and give venable a good throttling but that would do no good now i reminded mr nagit that we saw centaurs on the road just north of here yesterday and nobody was on the gate when we got here we were talking about that when stucker came out of here still pulling up his pants i figured hed gone off to take a dump but mr nagit looked puzzled the boss will understand its a matter of shapeshifters killer shapeshifters the light dawned he told us how he handled a couple of those at the weider masque i thought theyd all been captured some were and used their abilities to get away there seem to be an awful lot of them around they keep turning up wed better grab the stucker back at the house good idea only ill bet we dont find him why not if you were him up there and saw this mob down here what would you think that we found the body mr nagit showed me his comradely smile it wasnt that endearing venables pets smiled that way while they waited for your friendly status to evaporate exactly what else strange has happened the past few weeks any assaults unexplained deaths mysterious thefts people supposedly seen two places at the same time the shifters seemed to have the solution to that difficulty worked out though no mr nagit barked at the freecorps fighters gradually pushing into the grove wanting to sneak a peek at disaster he fingerpointed half a dozen you men go up to the house grab stucker but if you see stucker it wont be stucker stuckers right there already starting to ferment get moving i observed thatll teach those guys to get so close an officer notices them nagit smiled again this had to be a record day i suppose it will he glared around like he was thinking of something else that had to be done men backed away there was a lot of soldier in those guys still settle down i snapped at the goddamn parrot having decided he didnt love tinnie anymore he had jumped to my shoulder where he was practicing some weird tribal fertility dance lieutenant nagit said looks like hes trying to see the body but you keep moving he was taking up for the bird maybe hes hungry hes a vulture in disguise venable think he could play with your pets no that wonder buzzard is so damned useless i cant even turn him into lizard bait there was no sign of pseudostucker surprise surprise the shifter was somebody else now so i was not surprised when i spied one carter stockwell known shapechanger drifting behind the crowd moving toward the front gate evidently it never occurred to anyone else to wonder why an unfamiliar fellow would be wearing the same clothes stucker had had on for the past two days theres our man i told nagit right there that face is the one he wears whenever hes not replacing someone nagit looked at me narrowly briefly then gestured several men closer how do you know that mr garrett ive run into this shifter before he always collapses into this shape did that make sense it did to me the creatures really did have to be psychic when it came to threats carter looked at me suddenly as though responding to my interest he lengthened his stride immediately he knows ive made him mr nagit the lieutenant gave orders quickly softly everyone hurried to execute them these freecorps boys took their military stuff seriously the mob took off after stockwell determined little turtles vainly coursing a hare stockwell changed as we watched his legs lengthening until a foot of calf showed below each cuff he bounded away gaining ground fast he circled the tent city and disappeared into the woods beyond wow mr nagit said thats what i call putting on a burst of speed he kept a straight face stockwell dwindled into the distance what was his connection with the centaurs there had to be one tinnie and i had run into centaurs just up the road minutes later the stucker lookalike still buttoning his trousers comes out of the very copse where later we find whats left of the real stucker just downhill from a lot of ruined pasture the tornup turf the way it was torn up those centaurs helped catch the real stucker for the changer which meant that there must be a common mission between the centaurs and shapeshifters which i thought the dead man with his special interest in things and personalities out of the cantard would find very intriguing indeed i might even tell him about it someday the goddamn parrot took flight that little traitor would give the news away first chance he got for free apparently out of practice flying he had trouble staying straight and level getting across to tinnie how do i spot one of those things if they come back or if therere more of them around im trying to find out thats why i was in the library but i hadnt found anything yet i do know they dont like silver not even a little you could whap everybody with a solid silver ugly stick every once in a while why would they replace a lowlevel guy like stucker nagit looked at me like he had sudden doubts about my smarts he was on the gate eighteen hours a day he saw everyone who came and went valuable information to a lot of people id think plus he had the run of the house in his free time he couldve dug around in there whenever he wanted the perfect spy he was good too i didnt know him so he had no trouble with me but he did fool miss montezuma at dinner last night stucker was the perfect target he was a loner nobody knew him very well everybody knew he was totally committed to the movement though he did everything possible in spite of his social handicaps so the boss always said youd never suspect him unless the replacement stucker never got a chance to bury the man he replaced deeply enough on account of that meddlesome garrett turning up i shivered thinking a dark wing had brushed my soul in stockwells place i might have paid me a deadly visit during the night i assumed the boss was right about the original stucker you had doubts about stucker never the man had a minor job he did it well i notice people only when they dont do their jobs well i see i also saw that tinnie was headed our way oblivious to the mooneyes around her the woman put a definite strain upon these superior beings commitment to correct behavior every man in sight hated my bones the instant she slipped her arm inside mine she purred how much longer are you going to be i dont know darling thiss another shapeshifter incident the gatekeeper was a changeling too bad he seemed nice we only met the shifter the real gatekeeper was dead before we got here tinnie glanced that way she flushed i said it isnt pretty wild dogs got after him then venables little pals got after the wild dogs i know that garrett what about you being much longer i wasnt looking forward to facing uncle willard mr nagit im going to take the lady home ill be back mr nagit wasnt completely thrilled do what you need to do ill leave word to let you in in parting i suggested venable might try to set his pets on that shifters trail if you do catch him i definitely want to talk to him nagit scowled i suppose now what the soldiers had begun to stir looks like somebodys coming yes indeed and it was somebody who liked his ceremony he had outriders out fore and aft in numbers sufficient to stave off small armies a guy who didnt look old enough to be a veteran hobbled up its colonel theverly lieutenant hes coming and hed be in a bad mood after last night too i expected tinnie scrunched up close this looks like a real good time to start hiking boyfriend probably uncle willard wont be the only one mad at you if these people suddenly get all paranoid about us which on reflection seemed entirely possible the returning freecorps people we were about to encounter had no way of knowing that we were accepted guests and good old colonel theverly always had been one to leave a lot of unfamiliar bodies around for the gods to sort out renewing acquaintances with theverly could wait i expected to be back before nightfall we could get together then tinnie and i got out of the gateway to the pipes only moments before the leading horsemen turned in we stood across the road and gawked at the cavalcade quite a few cavaliers gawked right back at the redhead me i just stood there wrapped in my cloak of invisibility once we did start toward town the goddamn parrot began to get excited he sounded like he was trying to talk again what language wasnt clear however he cant stand country life i explained to tinnie hehheh maybe i can lose him in the woods speaking of woods tinnie said she gestured to indicate the last copse wed traversed before wed gotten to the pipes coming out what became of all those people you said were following us shed seen the feather of smoke leaning above the treetops a question definitely worth consideration my dear i said perhaps i shouldve offered to borrow something sharp before we left your new uncles establishment you sure shouldve its obvious we cant rely on your rapier wit how sharper than a frogs tooth i shouldnt have run so fast when that goddess wanted to be my girlfriend you run from anything female she was green and had four arms and teeth like one of mr venables pets but she was affectionate ill bet theres somebody in those trees her eyes were better than mine i didnt see anything but i took her word she wouldnt joke about danger much i picked up a stick this would be handy if it wasnt rotten it would shatter the first time i knighted somebody but if i carried it maybe folks would be discouraged from getting close enough to find out that it was mostly decorative i mused i need to stop by the house and arm up id help but i really need to go home uncle willards probably going crazy i told the goddamn parrot the ladys a gold seam of straight lines but im a gentleman i spotted movement at the woods edge someone wasnt good at sitting still then i spotted more movement elsewhere i hope those people arent all working together they werent apparently but they were aware of one another and wanted to stay out of each others way which made for a lot of rustle and scurry as tinnie and i strolled through the wood these are the people you never noticed before theyre city boys they dont do quite as well when theyre surrounded by a whole lot of country a not uncommon problem evidently hey im starting to think that youve been telling tall tales about you and the marines tell the truth you were really the guy who mopped the floors at expeditionary headquarters werent you you found me out dont tell anybody theyll kick me out of the call then what would i do for entertainment you could always harass yourself wouldnt want to horn in on your only hobby tinnie took my hand we ambled we strolled she didnt appear to be in a real hurry to ease uncle willards anxiety those following me didnt intrude guess they just wanted to play follow the leader its a different city tinnie felt it too though nothing was immediately obvious to the eye there were ample crowds of all ethnic persuasions working hard doing the things that need doing to keep a city going nobodys talking to anybody she was right and it wasnt just that people were being careful to give one another room and especially careful not to expose their backs to anyone not of a like ethnic conviction it was a wary city everybody expected something big to happen probably sometime soon the calls adventure hadnt been quite the disaster the boys at the pipes imagined the world was waiting for the other shoe to fall when marengo figured that out i was alert yet not paying close attention if you can figure that i ran everything through my head again trying to find a thread of sense to pick at but it wouldnt hang together in one big stinky lump no matter how much i twisted and shoehorned and ignored the usual rules i could only get it going if i assumed two or more things were going on at the same time but something down inside me wanted it to be just one big thing that i wasnt seeing right youre the common factor tinnie said huh i looked around we were approaching the tate compound you were muttering doing pretty good too you might have a future as a street character youve already got the wardrobe the goddamn parrot released a startled blat more like crow slang than the kings parrotese he flung himself into the air and flapped away i barked what the hell couldnt be my luck turning good tinnie asked how did you wake him up i dont know but i had a suspicion what was behind his excitement whats big and sits in the dark and doesnt breathe a lot im a common thread but i came in after the fact the goddamn parrot disappeared between buildings the way my luck runs nothing will get him you going to come inside tinnie asked she grinned she knew i didnt want to deal with uncle willard i have to get back into that library we crossed the street i noted that most people moved around in large groups and that more weapons than usual were in evidence some of them quite illegal cant stay away from tama montezumas bony butt eh has she got a bony behind i never noticed i see no one else but you i damaged my case by noticing a devastating set of twins exiting the tate retail outlet when you stop shaking and get your heels off your tongue you might try for something a little more convincing damn right behind the twins chattering at them came tinnies cousin rose rose is a brunette as gorgeous as her cousin but shes got snakes and spiders for brains her face lit up like a bonfire when she saw me here comes trouble i said shes not bad if you understand her tinnie said shell try to make something out of me being with you but uncle willard will say so what and shell go off and have a good pout she planted a long unsisterly kiss on me be careful come see me and stay away from strange women make up your mind i kissed her back rose was scandalized and excited i wont be gone long i hoped circumstance wouldnt make a liar of me it did have a habit of doing so i moved carefully homeward i hadnt spotted a tail since we left that woods but i was getting used to the idea that i could be followed without being able to catch somebody doing it i didnt like it though i was more concerned about the new malice in the streets trouble has a way of finding people who look like theyre vulnerable i spent a little concern on the goddamn parrot too but because i had no control over that situation i did not let it interfere with business approaching the house cautiously is ancient habit it felt justified today though i saw nothing indicating trouble unless the absence of mrs cardonlos constituted a harbinger nor did i note any damage to the house itself clearly the bad boys had not yet worked up the nerve to give it a try i let myself inside and froze before i shut the door all the way something was wrong i smelled an odor that didnt belong somebody had been inside somebody who wore lilac water to disguise the fact that he found bathing an unhapppy chore maybe saucerhead tharpe wasnt a stickler when it came to personal hygiene or maybe winger not winger nothing was disturbed winger couldnt keep her hands off stuff i moved along the hall slowly avoiding the creaky boards i dont know what cues there were other than odor but i knew i wasnt alone which meant somebody had gotten past the wonderfully expensive lock that dean had had installed i told him that damned thing was a waste of money i slipped sideways not into my office but into the dead mans room amongst the memorabilia were tools useful for removing uninvited guests i returned to the hallway prepared to repel boarders i had everything but my eye patch and my parrot a mountain of blubber wobbled out of the kitchen a platter in each hand puddle i barked hey garrett i was just havin a snack while i was waitin how the hell did ya get in wit out me hearin how the hell did you get into my house and why to swipe my food i come in tru da door ya got to get ya a better lock garrett dem hameways aint shit ya know what yere doin ya get out an get yaself a piggleton combernation with da tree tumblers as he nattered puddle eased into my office it was obvious that hed made himself at home there and that hed been around for a while and that he was used to having busboys there to pick up after him he plopped the platters onto my desk atop the abandoned battlefields of previous snacks my personal chair groaned as his ample behind settled make yourself at home puddle tanks to what do i owe the honor i wondered where the food had come from puddle definitely wasnt thoughtful enough to have brought his own supplies dean must have taken pity obviously i couldnt take care of myself well the whole moveout thing was just for show for the benefit of my new political pals i hoped boss wants ya garrett sent people out wherever ya might turn up whats the story i snagged a chicken drumstick i knew hadnt been in the house last time i was home i supposed i could hunt up mrs cardonlos and sweettalk her into telling me what id been missing was that a gang of pigs oinking as they fluttered around my chimney bossll tell ya all about it puddle had his mouth full maybe it was him making the porker noises give me a few minutes then well do it i headed upstairs theres a linen closet in the secondfloor hall that has no linens in it i spent a few minutes filling my sleeves and pockets and shoetops with assorted instruments of mayhem i should think about buying a couple of eggs from venable when i got back to the pipes i could hatch them and keep pets around the place if the dead man decided not to come back if i kept them a little hungry even wizards off the hill would have trouble sneaking in when i got back downstairs puddle was digging around in the kitchen again he had no shame i dont get much a dis tasty stuff round da palms you couldve picked a boss with fewer quirks puddle grunted ya ready ta go he shoved a couple of pieces of chicken into his pockets not quite i needed to get outside some food myself it had been a long time since breakfast sometimes ive got an edge like a brick we mustve traveled half a mile before i realized hey were not headed for the palms an i tole da boss yad never notice deys people followin ya ya know an deys maybe not all da kind what ya want to know ya got da boss for a fren theres times i wonder about that myself i grumbled having noticed a green and red and yellow and blue ringer amongst the nearest gang of eavesperching pigeons a puff of cooler wind raced down the street which seemed unnaturally calm for late afternoon in a city mad for bickering autumn would be along soon maybe if i got lucky the goddamn parrot would have a little goose in him and would head north for the winter i suspected we were headed for playmates stables though as a godsfearing righteous man playmate doesnt have much use for morley any tail who knew much about me probably developed the suspicion before i did i wasnt concentrating i had found a thread to worry we rounded a corner turning left puddle was street side of me two steps later he leaned into me hard i staggered through an open doorway before i could growl puddle started pushing i just glimpsed an old woman squinting at something she was sewing and a homely youngster probably of the female calling who shut the door behind the fat man then we reached the end of the narrow almost barren tailor shop i looked down steep steps a light burned a long way below go puddle urged i went a door closed behind us it hung crookedly the stairs had no business surviving our combined weight puddle picked up the light off the earthen cellar floor once we got down it consisted of a cracked teacup halffilled with oil the wick was a floating glob of lint puddle could carry the damned thing it looked hot and he knew where we were headed morley really this concerned bad tings goin on out dere garrett it dont hurt none ta be careful everybody in town was more paranoid than me maybe i should get a little crazy myself itll all work out historys drama has got a way of doing that but it sure can get rough on the cast and crew ya ever go ta da plays deys a great new one at da strand i been ta see it tree times already called atterbohns da toid on account of its about king atterbohns one a da ones from way back i was surprised the strand doesnt put on the kind of show id associate with a mind like puddles hardly anybody would take their clothes off the more excited he grew the denser his speech became dats da atterbohns what murdered his brodder and married his sister an had a baby by her dat grew up ta help his granma raise dis army aginst his fodder he whooped off and gave me every detail half of which were historically inaccurate not having seen the drama myself i couldnt tell if the fault was his or the playwrights the historical atterbohns married his brothers widow his sisterinlaw a perfectly respectable thing for the time though murder was a bit of a gaffe less respectable was the fact that the sisterinlaw orchestrated everything including numerous other murders and the revolt of the son who perished along with his grandmother in questionable circumstances later to be followed to the throne by a sixyearold brother whose paternity was somewhat dubious a play about atterbohns iii would have to be one of the new tragedies its moral would be too dark and heavy for a passion play or traditional comedy i might go see it just to see how much license the playwright took with history who wrote it i dunno we get ta da end a dis tunnel ya gotta be quiet it runs inta anudder one dat aint ours we dont wanna attrack no attention tunfaire has a million secrets they probably extend two miles down into the earth and two up into the air were there enough overlapping tunnels for me to sneak all the way downtown to the brewery caverns that sent me into a tumult of speculation if all the tunnels and caverns under tunfaire were connected control of them would be a major asset there were rumors and legends about people and things supposedly living underground one beaut involved a king of the ratpeople who was a sort of cross between a high priest and chodo contague a ratman wishfantasy something a reliance would be if he had a whole lot of brains and guts and luck surprisingly none of the legends featured dwarves puddle made a right turn when the tunnel ended i stayed quiet as instructed eventually we found a stairway from the same litter as the one leading down from the seamtresss shop a door stood ajar at the top a gray light outlined it i let puddle get all the way up before i risked the steps myself having survived him i knew they would support me i stepped into the entry foyer of a tenement that decades ago had entertained middleclass pretensions not a soul was around the place even lacked the usual squallings of infants yellings of husbands and fathers shriekings of wives and mothers whimpers of despair that characterize such places but you could almost feel the tenants holding their breaths behind their curtained doorways the cellar door standing ajar must be an omen of dreadful portent puddle was puffing so hard i thought hed collapse he wasted no energy he used his gasps to extinguish the light which he left on the step behind the cellar door he closed that we hit the street five blocks later we joined morley in a dwarfish holeinthewall none of the hairy folk seemed to mind his elven blood what was that all about i asked other than the obvious the people following you have a supernatural knack for keeping track it wanted to test its limits thats all theres more in back he nodded i preceded him past a dwarfish staff who saw nothing we were ghosts the quest for profit makes for strange bedfellows spooky people were waiting in a back room belinda contague and pular singe sat beside a crippled table with rags piled on top whats this morley let me have it behind the ear with a sap i said wha de grungle frunz ya it made perfect sense to me but apparently not to anyone else at least nobody tried to answer me the darkness never really came not entirely i remained vaguely aware of being manhandled and womanhandled and rathandled and halfelf handled around till i was the vain wearer of a tonsorial array fit to embarrass most guys who haunt alleys for a living puddle stuffed everything in a bag including my proud tools of mayhem and vanished morley and belinda tied me to the rickety chair formerly occupied by pular singe singe said something apologetic and drifted off after puddle the scow of consciousness pitched and rolled across heavy seas the thump had reawakened every headache id enjoyed lately i talked some more but only a drunk would have understood or maybe singe id understood her morley said something about if i was the real thing hed treat me to the gourmet best of the palms i could not express my joy belindas apologies sounded more promising the two of them rubbed me all over with silver a dwarfish voice gobbled something morley responded in the same tongue belinda began letting me loose i tried to turn her over my knee but had barely strength enough to raise a hand i said something in a tongue that sounded sufficiently dwarfish to me but drew no response from anyone else i understood belinda when she said you hit him too hard i hit him just right too hard and he wouldnt be breathing i think you scrambled his brains be a little hard to mix them up more than they already are hell come out of it bless him for his optimism i would take it into account when i got even for all his abuses sorry he told me not sounding the least bit contrite we had to make sure puddle got the real you been several garrett sightings lately and im sure that talented as you are youre not yet able to be two places at once im gonna work on it though i promised im gonna be having dinner with relway and colonel block while im stuffing that talking vulture down your throat sideways some of that dribbled out in comprehensible karentine morley seemed surprised by my attitude but he didnt let it get in his way something that looked like you turned up at the palms last night asking for belinda i glanced at belinda she was still hanging out there not what you think garrett she said crask and sadler did such a good job i can still barely move morley continued we knew it wasnt you right away uhn so a shapeshifter went there pretending to be me if there was an easy way to recognize one i wanted to know later after my head stopped hurting sarge offered you a mixed pepper platter one of his little jokes but you took it and dug right in now i know theyre completely stupid even a hog has more sense than to eat peppers morleys pepper platter is a gorgeous mix of colors and shapes kind of like parrot on a plate just the stench though wouldve had me gagging if id been into selfabuse far enough to let sarge shove something that nasty under my nose in the first place what did you do with it in a few hours one of those critters could destroy a reputation ive worked on for years we caught him but he got away as soon as we turned our backs those things dont have bones apparently it got out through a crack barely big enough for a cat my brain was up to about half speed and i had a cup in hand brought by the dwarf which smelled strongly of boiled willow bark id only have to suffer the headache another hour then make sure i never ranged too far from a chamber pot let me see it was after belinda with harm in mind we took more hardware off it than we did off you just now stranger and stranger we have shapeshifters attacking the weiders we have them attacking the call we have them going after belinda i stopped my mouth hung open a small but significant fact had caught up belinda youve been at morleys place since we dug you out of that tomb mostly sleeping but youve been in touch with your people as much as necessary how about with marengo north english north english why would i i raised a paw wait i let the brain limp along for a minute the call tried to bring on their season of cleansing last night it fizzled morley said he showed lots of pointy teeth in a wicked grin he wasnt disappointed while the rest of his gang were having a good time bopping heads and busting shop doors marengo north english was up north on the edge of elf town expecting to meet belinda for a nights indulgence in the labors of love what she barked how could he got a message it told him to meet you up there he believed it was real id believed it was real when he told me men sometimes surrender to wishful thinking if id thought about her condition id have been suspicious as soon as north english mentioned getting the message her family owned tenements in the area it seemed a handy trysting place if you thought in sneakaround terms obviously marengo did when he got there a gang dressed up as righsists tried to murder him they got interrupted by a gang of dwarves looking for rightsists to pound a marvelous irony morley observed absolutely straight of face i thought so myself i managed a feeble smile the first weak efforts of the tea had begun to make my fingertips tingle and my headache less assertive there is a common thread in everything i said however confusing shapeshifters all evidently members of a group of commando mercenaries once known as black dragon valsung what about crask and sadler belinda asked they arent shapechangers maybe im not thinking as clearly as i imagined my headache gave a particularly unpleasant throb probably crask and sadler wishing me evil from their cell if they were still healthy enough to entertain wishes they were hired by shapeshifters just to keep my theory alive or by a somebody who hired the shifters too morley said knowing that would put a twist on the evidence that i wouldnt like i grunted keep in mind that glory mooncalled has got to be shoehorned in here somehow too im pretty sure seeing those centaurs had convinced me organized disciplined military centaurs always have something to do with glory mooncalled no other commander had ever been able to to hold their attention long enough to sell them on the military virtues no other captain ever got them to fight for ideas instead of money or plunder pular singe eased into the room diffidently i wondered what had become of fenibro maybe shed decided she could get along without the boyfriend i had yet to see her affliction handicap her very much the watchers have followed the parcel of clothing she spoke slowly and carefully her diction was the equal of fenibros she was proud of herself i will have no trouble tracking any but one one leaves no trail at all i frowned at morley he shrugged belinda said it shouldnt take them long to figure out that puddle doesnt have garretts bones in that sack point taken can you walk garrett in circles pular singe said the one who leaves no trail is like the one who pretended to be she pointed at me that one had no scent either interesting could that be a way to detect changers add a ratman to your bodyguard who had a chance to plant something on you morley asked we were headed toward playmates for real dotes was the only one of us walking normally at a glance we must have looked like beggars i was dressed the part the clothes id been wearing lately all came from the weider place all tads stuff could have been anyone there though the list of suspects that occurred to me was very short and it had to be somebody at the weider mansion nowhere else had anyone had a chance to get to all the clothes and only a few people there had known i was getting them the actual mechanics did not interest me much somewhere in each pair of trousers perhaps would be a scrap of paper or a loose button with a spell attached i could round up a dozen halfbaked hedge wizards in an hour who would sell me something similar for enough to buy a bottle of wine there would be some gimmick like an enchanted tuning fork or a feather floating in a bowl of mineral oil that would point at me all the time its starting to come together i said i dont know who or why but im beginning to sniff out a how well morley asked after i failed to go on i turned to pular singe singe the parade following me following puddle and my stuff was the shapeshifter the one who was actually on my trail with everyone else following him singe had to think about it although she was intensely interested she hadnt been included in on everything so wasnt sure what mattered also some of what she had was human stuff that made little sense to ratfolk anyway the one who had no scent yes morley asked whats that look mean garrett it means the haze is clearing the clothes were marked so i could be tracked and watched by shapeshifters the clothes were delivered straight from the weider place before the engagement party but there were no shapeshifters inside the house before the party preparations began belinda you promise me you didnt have anything to do with the attack on marengo north english i promise darling cross my heart and hope to die though i wouldve done it if it needed doing does that extend to all his crackpot pals the human rights movement lost several big names id reached an understanding with those people they would stay off our turf they hadnt had time to violate it im sure they wouldve gotten around to it though not even using crask and sadler im not as hotheaded as you think garrett i considered that i decided that the marengo i met thought too much of himself and his prejudices to have hired those two hed use his own people i suspect that argument holds for other rightsists chieftains as well first try at least i recalled tama telling me they were having trouble finding a librarian because marengo and the other big fish were reluctant to pay actual wages i muttered that fits what does singe how would you go about tracking the one who leaves no scent i added deaf sign so we were sure to meet on a common border between our languages pular singe was a serious young woman determined to get the most out of the abilities she had she would go far if she remained motivated desire and determination do seem as important as raw talent in this world she thought hard i would track those who follow it the sighthunters if they do not give up that when they discover that you have outwitted it i hadnt outwitted anybody but myself lately didnt seem to be much point in reminding singe though morley and belinda both sneered at me when singe was looking the other way friends always have to get those little digs in just to let you know they love you the evidence suggests that the whole world loves me no point me hiding out at playmates i said if theyve done any digging into my background theyll know were friends ill go to the weider place id abandoned hope of getting back to the pipes it was getting dark singe whered she go off to tail your tail probably morley said shes infatuated garrett belinda chided it happens to a lot of women when they first meet you this ones still at that stage where shell do any damn fool thing to make you like her back give her a week reality will catch up they both had a good snicker so did something on a windowsill two stories overhead morley failed to catch the flash of green and yellow and blue and red as the little buzzard took off but i did possibly i was supposed to now that it knew where i could be found later pardon the expression but you look like shit on a stick max told me ive seen betterdressed bums what happened to the clothes we gave you gilbey said thats what hes come about manvil was a little cool i didnt turn up here sometime in the last twenty hours and do something unpleasant did i no why gilbey was just tired there was a copy of me running around trying to do naughty things and you seem a little standoffish excuse me unintentional possibly its because you havent gotten anywhere or because bad things happen when youre around i took it like a man it was true i think thats about to change its coming together what i want to know right now is who handled the clothing you sent me because somebody tagged them all with a tracking spell that let the shapeshifters stick to me wherever i went too bad i couldnt be two places at once that would be a really useful skill in my racket genord max said gerris genord handled the clothing and as soon as he said that i recalled genord being mentioned at the time the evidence was there maybe id gotten bopped on the noggin a time too many maybe i ought to stick to working for the brewery the news relieved me some i hadnt wanted to suspect gilbey i liked the guy maybe a connection with the shifters is why genord overreacted when lance and ty caught him sneaking in maybe there really was somebody at the door somebody he didnt want to be seen with how would he be connected with them we know he wasnt a shifter id already recognized one commonality between genord and black dragon the commando connection whether or not he seemed the type genord had had an armband that was worn by a small freecorps made up of former commandos once the fairhaired thugs of the call the brotherhood of the wolf had fallen out of favor since colonel theverlys arrival but i was willing to bet they were still in business still associated with marengo north english and a shapeshifter had been flushed at the pipes uhm gilbey repeated i said why not ask genord the guard do have him in custody dont they i couldnt imagine why they wouldnt but i didnt feel like walking back up to the alkhar id put too many miles on me already today can my friends and i get space to rest for a while the willowbark tea was wearing off i hurt and i needed a nap find them a place manvil weider said his tone suggested hed begun to grow disappointed in me too i didnt blame him i was disappointed in me myself carefully failing to alert the staff to our presence gilbey installed all three of us in a guest room probably reserved for visiting tradesmen belinda he failed to recognize morley he knew only by distasteful type he remained rigorously polite throughout gentlemen that we are morley and i let belinda have the one narrow bed i took the bedclothes to make a pallet for me dotes wasnt in a napping mood he kept muttering about how trying to do a small favor had become a career i asked you want to make yourself useful while im snoring work this out what could you do with a brewery besides make beer why thats where this mess started the shapeshifters wanted to replace the weiders which makes sense only if they wanted control of the brewery i snuggled down and went to sleep the floor was softer than the most yielding cobblestone a toe ground into my ribs i didnt have to open my eyes to know it belonged to belinda only a woman would use a toe like a forefinger a man would just kick you i grunted thats four hours garrett dotes and i dont have a life to devote to your snoring entertaining as it is if im out of touch much longer im going to find myself out of touch permanently i sat up groggy and disoriented but i remembered i wanted up sooner than this you needed the sleep morley said you really ought to go home and stay till youre completely recovered you look a little ragged maybe i did people kept mentioning it i pulled myself together belinda looked ragged too i felt a twinge of guilt she needed rest worse than i did but here she was chasing wild geese with me there something going on that you guys forgot to mention morley looked at me askance belinda ignored me mostly i appreciate you ambushing me and getting me loose from whoever was following me i rubbed the back of my head i think but i dont see why you bothered morley shrugged belinda without looking me in the eye said the ratgirl insisted she was scared those people might do something bad to you i smelled a scheme some kind of threecornered deal between the outfit reliance and morley dotes that would put me right in the middle i hoped their little hearts werent broken when i wouldnt go along morley sneered i dont know how you do it garrett that singe would gleefully follow you into hell and be your love slave besides sourly putting herself together for travel belinda said and that blond bimbo walked right in here a while ago she was really put out because you werent alone alyx alyx is just a spoiled kid morley grinned at me and flashed me his own version of the raised eyebrow trick maybe belinda begrudged she did come back with some food and we didnt even eat it all morley said your share is in that sack over there we saw no one as we left the house the place was a mausoleum infected by despair maybe that spread from toms room i felt a sudden fear that more evil might be headed the familys way this would be a good time for the shifters to come back unless blocks troops were on the job and alert the city was darker than usual the night people fewer than normal we drew unfriendly looks but never a challenge i did see evidence that some fainthearts especially among the refugees were getting ready to move on the calls botched cleansing had had an impact i didnt need to talk to anybody to sense the tension tunfaires population is half nonhuman most of whom operate nocturnally but numbers wont mean much if we humans gang up most of the other races dont get along with each other any better than they do with humans for some like dwarves and elves the enmity goes back millennia i said the call didnt splatter a lot of blood around but they won anyway you can smell the fear thats true but what you dont see is the people who arent running morley probably knew something he couldnt share with me though he wouldnt be involved directly in anything of course neutrality was a commodity hed marketed most of his life belinda said if marengo has half the brains i think hes hiding he wont do anything for a while allegruan and dryzkaksghul gnarrisson and the others really sucked up their pride to hold it together long enough to face the cleansing allegruan and gnarrisson were what you might call the urban elven and dwarfish war chieftains thatll all fall apart now if the call gives them time to remember old feuds youre right morley said theres talk about that already one of allegruans brothers got into a shouting match with dryzkaksghuls uncle during the rioting because gnarrissons greatgrandmother was a sister of the burli burlisson who ambushed the elves in zhenda canyon when they were headed home after attacking the dwarf caves in wrightwight mountain nerve of them hitting back like that i didnt know the incident the history of the karentine kingdom and its imperial predecessor is more than i can encompass and theres not nearly so many centuries of that nor does it carry such a burden of treachery and betrayal among fundamentalist rustictype elves treachery and betrayal are high art forms the brothers point exactly if nothing else burli and all his get forever are guilty of boorish manners i guess history sometimes is one of those youhadtobethere things ive always treasured your ability to see the absurd morley its only absurd by modern karentine standards garrett by those of the time dwarfish and elvish alike burli showed very bad form he didnt even take prisoners he killed all the raiders and cut off their heads and set those up on stakes outside the entrance to the forest thromdredril supposedly all because he spent a few years in oldtime tunfaire and contracted human insanity and this is where we part ways enjoy the alkhar he and belinda scooted deaf to my questions dont do it i barked as somebody wound up to bop me from behind right after i asked to see colonel block its the real me rub me all over with silver make me walk around with a crown under my tongue just dont hit me on the head anymore in seconds i was surrounded relways was the only face i recognized till block wandered in he took me at my word his troops held me down while a guy with a silver dagger tested me for a tendency toward morphism nobody apologized block said youve turned up here once already today but the first time you werent you no shit but howd you know we knew you were out at north englishs manor i can picture you being guilty of a lot but not of screwing up in two places at the same time relway demanded you learn anything i had a long private talk with north english this morning i could tell you word for word but i dont think youd learn anything you dont already know that bunch arent as secret as they pretend i told relway everything anyway almost figuring that would save time then i asked block what was this other me up to tried to get the duty jailer to release crask and sadler in his custody he sold his cockamamie story too wed have lost them if theyd been able to travel but the jailer came to me to try to arrange transportation i understood you were out of town i went down to check it out personally the shifter knew trouble when he saw it coming he took off before we could close in on him so the bad boys are still here we have a full house but theres pressure from the hill to release everybody being held for being public pains in the ass yesterday night what about gerris genord gotten anything out of him yet i just turned up evidence that he might be tied in with the shapeshifters or to somebody in between which is more the way i thought it would be i didnt think genord deliberately hurt the weiders i suspected he hadnt been knowingly involved in the infiltration of the shapeshifters i thought he was a pawn moved so that bad things happened around him his belated recognition of that fact might have caused the irrational state he was in the night ty and lance caught him sneaking around relway said we havent talked to him yet there hasnt been time too much excitement to cover outside though i noted he did have the resources to keep track of me can i talk to him ill collect a team and well visit him together i dont want to pull his toes off i just want to ask a few questions hell be more eager to answer if im behind you with a bunch of rusty tools ill keep quiet relway being relway he would be as interested in watching me ask as he would be interested in hearing genord answer that wouldnt cost me lets do it genord was asleep when we got there but he woke up fast he looked around wildly he was confined in a cell every bit as evil as imagination could make one the only positive was that he didnt have to share elsewhere captured rioters were piled in on top of one another comfy down here i asked i stopped in to see if theyre taking good care of you thered been a change in genord and it wasnt what youd expect of a guy who found himself buried in the alkhar hed hardened his eyes had gone cold he looked like a commando after all he was a shapeshifter but only inside his head he didnt respond ive had a thought i told relway about the changers and our friend here you think they know weve got him they do now if they didnt before the one who pretended to be you saw him when he came down to visit crask and sadler meaning if genord does know anything theyll want to get him out or shut him up relway and genord both thought they saw the direction i was headed i took a quick turn on them suppose we cut him loose what will they figure happened that he ratted them out block replied i like it turning him out would solve a problem for me too itd free up a cell that wouldnt have to be a single anymore and if we do hang on to him and his own buddies get in to cut his throat were spared having to feed him till a judge lets us hang him relway stagewhispered we got a budget we dont got to account for what we dont use that was bullshit id heard a little about the guards finances from block i told genord brotherhood of the wolf is made up of eliteforces types these shapeshifters operated as black dragon valsung in the cantard a mercenary commando group is there a connection from the war then i floated the suspicion id had for some time is there a connection to glory mooncalled not that genord knew of that notion startled him momentarily then he nodded yeah mooncalleds behind everything hes lying relway said he thinks hes lying thought he was when he said that hes already wondering though you could almost hear genord pondering the question of whether or not hed been duped he chose silence as the safest route he hadnt been in charge he had to have faith that his superiors knew what they were doing that they would come to his rescue commandos are like marines that way they dont leave their own behind i mentioned that to block he growled were prepared like how stupid did i think he was i might not have gotten names or a bloody knife but i was now satisfied that there was a connection between genords bunch and the shifters i needed to go back to the pipes to find out more i said hang on to him for a while yet just so i can get a head start and drop his name a few places then go ahead and kick him out ty was a vindictive sort he would find this kind of vengeance particularly satisfying provided of course genord couldnt talk his way out of the deep shit he hadnt shown much talent for that yet block left a man with genord in the unlikely event gerris opened his heart we were headed for the relative sanity of blocks quarters relway had disappeared block asked you need to check on crask and sadler i dont think so long as theyre locked up tight im happy they shown any signs of recovering unfortunately you be careful with them and dont forget theres people outside whore worried about them i have some ideas about those two assuming somebody really does want them out or dead he gave out a mockevil laugh i suggested youre gonna use them as bait in some stunt dont forget brother genord like he needed reminding again already hes already moved i expect block played with the evil laughter again were going to get them garrett i dont doubt it i just hope i have some friends alive when it happens they get to hell before you they can have the place all fixed up a keg in every room platoons of panting females thats your idea of hell oh you wont get to touch i dont get to do that now block made like a man playing a funeral flute ive heard about your bad fortune my reputation is entirely the product of mrs cardonlos imagination the name seemed to startle block he asked whats your next step back to north englishs manor im almost convinced that he isnt behind any of this though clever actors have fooled me before do you think hes a bornagain believer in the calls mission i try not to judge the sincerity of his type nor that of people off the hill i keep an eye on what they actually do you said there was pressure from up there itll slack off thought a lot of hill types support the call only if its successful they dont want to be caught out dangling in the wind if north englishs gang goes batshit and fucks up completely it was getting on toward the hour of the wolf the coldest cruelest time of night when despair rises up and gnaws the bones of even the strong and also the hour when the worst trolls and ogres are out when its plain common sense for a lone human investigator with too many enemies not to be wandering around alone you got a cell i can borrow for a couple hours just till the sun comes up i would nap my way into whichever future successfully conquered the city theres probably one around here with your name on it reserved but for now you can use the cot in mine i wont bother you im up i might as well work maybe interview a few of our clients block understood the hour of the wolf too there was no better time to question somebody who was chained up in a mass of filthy straw shivering in the cold desperately outnumbered by the rats and lice thanks get somebody to waken me at the crack of dawn before he could cut me down with a wisecrack i said i ought to see the damned sun come up once before i die i found the cot and stretched out wow two naps in the same night this was pure luxury and there wasnt one damned talking bird within miles the somebody who wakened me wasnt one of blocks regularly sanctioned gangsters the somebody was pular singe i almost whooped as i popped up startled how the hell did you get in here i scared her i had to calm her down before i could get any sense out of her she lisped much worse when she was frightened and her hearing went north in time i learned that shed just walked into the alkhar following my scent thered been nobody on guard she hadnt thought anything of that did you see any bodies no damn i hope that means they were ready for an invasion and just ran away because that was what a lack of guards meant somebody unfriendly had gotten inside but hadnt found anybody to kill not right away i suffered no overwhelming impulse to find out if block and relway were all right though why are you here i had myself together now i started easing her toward the nearest street door seemed a stroke of strategic genius to get ourselves far away from whatever big trouble was afoot reliance sent trackers after everyone following you garrett he believed they would run to their masters as soon as they knew you had shaken the one with no scent i teamed with two others to follow that thing it can be done i learned we were at the door i thought i heard blocks fake evil laughter from deep inside the jail howd you manage that by sight this creature is not smart it does not look back it does not see those who are not people that is why others were able to follow it even fenibro is smart enough to look back sometimes we took turns being closest it is easy to track one another hmm the ratpeople were working real hard to put me in their debt i had a bad feeling about that people who do that sort of thing always want something back usually something that involves me having to work there was enough light out to see a modest fog had come in off the river i understand that happens frequently but im seldom up early enough to see it for some early is late singe was uncomfortable being out after daybreak but she stuck with me valiantly trying to communicate everything reliances people had found out about my personal road show i must say i appreciated the unflagging interest of all the friends id made recently even though they were watching one another as much as making sure that they knew every little thing i found interesting only max weider wasnt watching me but relway was doing maxs share as well as his own he had a whole crew on my backtrail where did he find them all that fact that he could round up that many people fanatically devoted to law and order was as scary as the fact that our marengo north englishes and bondurant altoonas could find all the friends they wanted human folks were flooding the streets now starting their day many were the sort who worshipped marengo they did not like what they saw when singe and i strolled by it constituted a little lesson on what it means to be a ratman singes courage was not up to a prolonged test mine wasnt much less feeble singe told me i cannot remain with you i understand before you go though tell me did your people track the scentless one to others like it it went to a place where others of its kind waited ah and where might that have been how many of them were there three and the one we followed we did not understand the language they spoke nor could i get very close they were alert they were very troubled you did get close enough to listen singe made a dramatic effort to respond with a nod we are often closer than you think i hugged her with one arm she barely came up to my brisket somehow she seemed bigger when we were just walking talking you are the bravest child ive ever met did you know rats purr id heard cats and raccoons do it but never singe did i tried to be stern you cant take risks like that these creatures are extremely dangerous they think nothing of murder id hate myself if you got hurt singes purr grew louder i could hear morley and belinda mocking me now i cautioned myself not to let singe make too much of my praise wherere they hiding she had trouble explaining ratpeople dont think in terms of street names and addresses not that we have the latter anywhere but on the hill mostly you locate yourself as being so many doors some direction from an outstanding landmark like say a tavern most of those draw their names from signs easily recognized by the illiterate the merry mole the gold seam for dwarves the palms for people overburdened with wealth and selfopinion she made me understand a lamp is that it she got that across with finger speech when i proved too dense to get it verbally down by the river there arent any taverns the lamp brewery thats been closed up and abandoned for twenty what a wonderful place to squat the lamp brewery was no sprawling monster like the weider place but in its day it was a leading producer of workingclass lager it went before my time but the old men remember it fondly i suspect time improves the beer as it will do had the lamp product been superior the brewery would still be in business thats interesting singe very interesting id have to let relway know we could give the place a look when i got back from the pipes the shifters had themselves a brewery but not a functional brewery nor one that could be made functional probably anything of any use whatsoever wouldve been sold or stolen long ago i told singe i owe you she purred some more but i really dont want to be indebted to reliance i feel like hes up to no good the child wasnt completely smitten nor wholely thickwitted i didnt lead her into any verbal ambush she didnt volunteer anything i chuckled youre the best look i have to go out to the country you go home and rest you should stop taking risks for that old schemer she stopped walking for a moment she found the courage to look me directly in the eye which ratpeople are almost constitutionally incapable of doing then she extended a paw i extended my own she gave me a light nervous handshake thank you for not being cruel cruel what pular singe vanished into an alley more quietly than one of the creatures from which her race had been wrought headed toward the city gate i discovered that i was being tailed again there were three of them working as a team they were good but they didnt have the advantage of having tagged me with a spell somebody had to stay close to see me which meant i could see him if i paid attention one was a relway thug id seen in the background around the weider place so my pals at the alkhar did have time and manpower to watch me even when there was excitement going on right inside their own house who were the raiders if the shifters were all holed up at the lamp brewery crying in their beer could i assume they were genords pals relway or block would let me know if the mood took them mine was not a comfortable journey even with the guard watching over me i was without defensive resources again and i was alone my passage drew concerned or calculating looks everywhere already there was a general assumption that a man alone either had reason to be supremely confident or was a complete fool i tried to maintain a confident swagger i felt a puff of cool air i hadnt paid much attention to the weather clouds were piled up to the south we might be in for some thunderstorms this time of year they usually hold off till late afternoon if i really hustled i could get back to town ahead of the showers by the time i reached the pipes the temperature had risen and the clouds had become less impressive they would grow again when the temperature began to fall hey i dont recall anybody ever paying much attention to that kind of thing well maybe farmers but youd have a hell of a racket going if you could predict the weather stormwardens make a hell of a racket out of just creating small spots of weather but thats a tough way to make a living the magic is harder on the magician than it is on the world around him there was steady traffic on the road but i never worried i didnt draw attention to myself i was just one more vagabond drifting call uniforms and freecorps armbands were plentiful suggesting a lot of messages moving between the pipes and marengos satraps inside the city i expected trouble getting past the gate but marengo and mr nagit had left word the gate was welldefended now still not strongly enough to whip a troop of centaurs but probably enough to discourage that crew from attacking in the first place what had become of them did block and relway mention them to their military contacts or mr nagit or colonel theverly might have done so it needed doing we couldnt have random armed bands roving the countryside a youngster who reminded me of me six or seven years ago went to the house with me you walked all the way out here like he found that hard to believe you mustve been cavalry yeah figures whats that mean nothing personal i just dont like horses anything interesting happened since yesterday probably better change the subject cavalry types are goofy about horses you cant find an ounce of rational paranoia among ten thousand of them been a campout bigwigs been busy though the old man got mad once he got over having his feelings hurt north english let word of his pecadillo get out i asked nah he aint bragging but other people know word gets around interesting marengo told me he was the only survivor of the ambush i shouldve been the only one he told the real story just out of curiosity what story did you hear his story matched marengos interestinger and interestinger why would he want everyone to know most of us prefer to conceal our humiliations and screwups marengo north english struck me as very much that sort of man what was the tactical advantage or had he confided in someone who hadnt kept his secret or might one of his attackers have retailed the story my return must have been portentous for north english fifteen minutes after i entered his house i was alone with him in his dimly lighted sanctum his expression suggested he was unnaturally interested in what i would have to say before he could ask me anything i inquired are you aware that every man on the grounds knows what happened the other night not the official version but the version you told me if the men knew then tama must know might be a good time to find out if she had formed any opinions a darkness stirred behind marengos eyes perhaps it was veiled anger he growled i didnt tell anyone but you he watched me intently i dont know what he expected and i never told a soul i lied then i mused you did say that the men who attacked you looked like they belonged to the movement north english grunted he mustve thought about that more than he wanted to admit he mustve taken it to heart the kid who had walked me to the house had told me marengo was hiding out today letting no one in to see him but tama there were no bodyguards around so maybe he was getting paranoid about everybody i told him i saw belinda she swears she had nothing to do with the attack nor was she responsible for that invitation i believe her north englishs style was becoming plebian he grunted again evidently preoccupied with rearranging furniture inside his head he didnt seem surprised by what id just said eventually he pulled himself together and urged tell me what you think i offered some ideas that had occurred to me during the walk from town marengo continued more attentive than ever before somehow he mustve come to the conclusion that i was a real person youre convinced theres a connection between brotherhood of the wolf and this black dragon gang theres no absolute proof but the circumstantial evidence looks strong to me and thiss something you just came up with on the way out here oh no the guard are looking at the possibilities from another angle there may have been a previous connection during the war and the shapeshifters may be associated with glory mooncalled somehow it was obvious that was something marengo didnt want to hear you have a plan the north english i wanted to believe in the one who could contemplate mass extinctions without qualm seemed about to emerge from behind the mask marengo sounded harder and more angry by the minute i said i have some ideas therell be risks do you have any men you trust completely bearing in mind that the brotherhood of the wolf was practically your bodyguard hard marengo glared he didnt like my plan already i can find men on my own if you prefer like he was in whether or not he liked it talk to me i explained he frowned a lot he seemed confused by several points like his memory was a little rocky he muttered to himself interrupted himself to ask does this mean youve lost interest in the library pretty much what the hell brought that on i reviewed briefly then continued marengo asked will weider cooperate i think so putting words into the old mans mouth id guess so too hell want to balance the books how many men will you want say twenty enough to put up a fight even if a few arent trustworthy good good when do you want to do it he seemed eager to cooperate now marengo north english seemed a different man when he wasnt on in front of his followers no sense of conviction came off him at all as soon as we can which would be tomorrow night at the earliest probably theres a lot to pull together at this end too but i think we need to do it find nagit dont tell him anything just send him to me ill talk to him then send him along with you to run messages so you dont have to ride out here and back every few hours all right but i wouldnt be riding id be walking as i started toward the door he demanded why the hell dont you get a horse i thought he knew i need the exercise they mustve done some research on me that was common sense he smiled wickedly thats right and now i got the feeling he did know all about me i had the feeling that he was taunting me somehow or maybe he was just letting me know that i wasnt inside anything here yet and there was no way i was going to get inside this was a marriage of convenience only north english suggested tell nagit to dredge you up some decent clothing itd be a shame if everything went in the shitter because you got dumped into a vagrants home the shitter why would he suddenly start using language like that it didnt fit the superiorrace image i ran into tama in the hallway outside she was carrying tea and rolls for two the tea smelled good she seemed delighted to see me yet infinitely suspicious will you stay a little longer this time her voice husked my spine quivered my knees jellied boy could she suggest a lot without saying anything her smile broadened it told me tinnie wasnt here to save me this time i gobbled i wish i could she slithered closer long dark fingers spidered up my chest to my hair my cheek then drifted down again the woman was pure devil some chances come once in a lifetime are you done in there uhm i was done i was crispy around the edges i need to find mr nagit i gulped seemed like i needed an awful lot of air suddenly he went out to the stables probably trying to stay out of colonel theverleys way they dont get along do take advantage of the tea while its hot she stepped very close again that demon hand marengo north english was one lucky man she never stopped smiling and never turned off the raw animal attraction i took a cup and stared and tried to find my lost breath as she went on to serve marengo i dont know what tinnie meant tamas behind didnt look bony at all in fact i found mr nagit out back he couldnt have been more thrilled to see me if id been the old boy with the sickle but he was a gentleman he was polite i told him what i thought he needed to know hes going to plug the leak wonderful then the attack did wake him up do i detect a tremor of distrust of the high commands wisdom weak smile you are a detective yes ive had to stand around in the background keeping my mouth shut during an ongoing debate about how much it matters if somebody warns the other races that were coming i thought the boss had yielded to the majority opinion that it doesnt the boss might be smarter and tougher than people think he might be sandbagging nagit grunted the one thing theyre all forgetting or just dont want to remember is that glory mooncalled is out there somewhere nobody wants to listen when i say hes dealt himself into the game ill listen because youre right i think hes in the game big i just dont know how yet but youre right marengo didnt like that idea at all when i brought it up hes been a little odd since the attack more so today today hes staying locked up in there not letting anyone in but the montezuma woman youll want a change of clothes before we go right so many people disapprove of my wardrobe i just have to assume that that might be appropriate and i wouldnt mind borrowing a few knives and whatnot so ill feel more comfortable while im roaming around i expect we can find you a nice outfit and a suite of cutlery there was something sly about the way he said that pick yourself a horse while youre out here uh im giving up my time to help you garrett youll make a few accommodations for me too what was this did everybody in karenta know i dont get along with horses probably everybody whos already fallen under the sway of those monsters did they gossiped behind my back those strange people who actually like the beasts probably understand what theyre saying somehow i grumbled point me toward the old plodders if thats what you want personally id rather have something that could get up some speed if we ran into those centaurs what theres a large band of centaurs in the area on the move just as you told us the colonel has patrols out looking for them mr nagit sounded like he begrudged having to say anything positive about theverly the patrols havent been able to pin them down theyre doing better watching us than were doing finding them i made masculine noises as long as we know where theyre not luck wont love you forever garrett pick a good horse seemed to me luck wanted a trial separation already all right ill go to the library and wait when im done dont forget to see the boss id like to ive got troubles enough without having to hold his hand and run his errands dang me sounded like there was disillusionment in paradise whats going on besides the centaurs ive got another dead man ive got a missing man and ive got a man missing a limb ive got livestock scattered everywhere ive got berserk thunder lizards staggering around biting everything that moves including each other and ive got a selfproclaimed heroofthesoldiers colonel whos completely indifferent to all those problems i lifted an eyebrow high that works differently when you show it to a man what happened in a tone hopefully dripping empathy the shitstorm started last night when venables pets went crazy they spooked the cattle and sheep went after each other tore up venables other arm when he tried to get them under control and killed somebody apparently an outsider whos torn up too badly to identify tollie was missing this morning but the corpse isnt him because the dead man was shorter fatter and older than the kid i say the dead man must be a stranger because none of the other men are missing and venables pets only attack strangers says venable even this morning even this morning he claims they had to be poisoned or ensorcelled which is a troubling notion too and theverly could care less about that either im not a man who swears much mr garrett but i do wish this shit would come to an end and we could concentrate on our mission i asked several professionally oriented questions all of which had occurred to mr nagit and none of which had yet generated conclusive answers he grumbled none of that matters anymore because right now ive got no greater mission than to go get orders to join you in your adventures probably mainly so i can bang you over the head if you manage to irritate the boss or his honey i detect a note of disaffection perhaps complicated by a dollop of cynicism not a note mr garrett a whole damned opera id leave if there was anywhere better to go but where bondurant altoona arnes mingle the sad part is this here is as good as it gets parker i need you mr nagit drafted parker to help me with a mount then stalked off i started my search i looked each beast directly in the eye hunting for fast and strong but stupid enough to have no intellect left over for malice reluctantly i made a choice and had her prepared on my way i encountered mr nagits favorite colonel moches theverly evidently theverly didnt remember that wed served together in the islands at least he didnt seem inclined to drop everything and rehash old times he didnt seem inclined to acknowledge my existence and that was fine with me there might come a moment when i didnt want him to recall who i was i noticed that he still surrounded himself with the same cronies hed had years ago and still projected the same air of immense competence and still bore the scars of the wounds that had gotten him pulled out just before the big venageti hammer came down on those of us who stayed behind i studied him while i had the chance and soon decided that he probably didnt signify in anything that was going on with me he was just somebody who happened to be around an actor who walked across the stage i amused myself sorting books and snatching peeks at anything that sounded intriguing until after a much longer delay than i expected mr nagit showed up with a selection of personal weaponry and a change of clothing i didnt find quite suitable a uniform i complained its all thats available that amused nagit no doubt hed conspired to contrive a shortage of more normal apparel dont get the idea that because im wearing the suit im one of the troops next time i enlist i plan to start my career as a general and work your way to the bottom i suppose listen garrett the call wouldnt take you in if you did want to join youre one big old tangle of unanswered questions and nobody wants to bother digging and just a few days ago everybody in the rights racket wanted to sign me on for the full nightmare when i still had a nonhuman partner and friends of questionable ethnic purity i mustve stopped being the ideal recruit while i was looking the other way maybe black dragon valsung still wanted me or brotherhood of the wolf we could let bygones be bygones couldnt we as i dressed i chewed on the sour certainty that my position had been marginalized all along by everyone theyd all wanted me to poke hornets nests somewhere else but hadnt wanted me getting intimate with their own schemes i was a ball bouncing randomly off any number of walls no more than what morley would call a finagle or a confusion factor a bee annoying everybody not a bad fit i said checking over each shoulder the styling is a little too army but i do look almost dashing the ladies will swoon mr nagit fought a smile i asked you ever see glory mooncalled what id startled him with the sudden shift no i dont know anybody who has why i just wondered i used to have a partner he practically worshipped glory mooncalled because of his irreverent attitude though i couldnt imagine how someone could be more establishmentarian than a loghyr gone sedentary for folks like that revolution or change were not good things used to be a lot of that going around you dont hear much of it anymore suppose we get this circus rolling the sooner we handle it the sooner i come back home im ready i looked myself over again i wasnt pleased i looked like one of the boys i hoped that didnt confuse me or anyone else tama montezuma was in the hallway talking to somebody when we left the library the guy scowled at us mr nagit glared back i paid the man no mind because tama turned on the heat and made herself the focus of my existence garrett look at you whyd they ever let you out of uniform the guy she was with sidled off past mr nagit plainly unhappy that anyone else was getting miss montezumas attention men are that way we cant help it tamas eyes seemed twice as big as normal what a case every woman i ran into seemed determined to fry my brain mr nagit said garrett uh yeah he was marengos right hand sorry miss montezuma got to run work to do she smiled a smile both promising and predatory moved on down the hall i just couldnt imagine where tinnie got the idea that tama was bony whew i said mr nagit agreed yeah what was that all about when tinnie was with me hed seemed a normal redblooded karentine sort of guy what that woman doesnt take a deep breath unless it has something to do with her meal ticket and she just took you over the jumps my ego cant handle it huh she wants to throw the boss over for me exactly i thought she seemed extremely nervous were we speaking the same language when we stepped out of the house i checked to see what the clouds were doing my earlier expectations wouldnt be disappointed rain was coming a real disappointment stood closer to hand the horse id chosen now looked terribly ferocious for a swaybacked mare almost my own age and then there were the dozen guys in freecorps outfits all looking like they were headed for the parade ground i did a quick paranoid scan of armbands making sure noboby was dumb enough to wear his brotherhood of the wolf allegiance on his sleeve is this necessary somebody has to run messages and those unfriendly centaurs are still out there unfriendly to you fellow i felt vulnerable despite having acquired a cutlery sampler something slammed down on my shoulder for an instant i thought an ogre had jumped me from behind but when i turned my head i found myself beak to beak with the goddamn parrot damn i thought i lost you for good i told mr nagit you know these things live a really long time someday youre going to want to have a family think how much fun your kids could have with their own talking bird i wouldnt deprive your own future scions of the opportunity to enjoy such a wonderful experience he laughed him and his pals found my plight entertaining not one of them wanted his own talking shoulder ornament no matter how dashing the look i gathered my dignity and mounted up getting it right way forward first try i mouthed the notes of the trumpet call for charge and off we rode a threelegged centaur wouldve had no trouble running me down gilbey didnt like my idea even a little we dont want any more trouble here max the old man turned the letter mr nagit had given him as though marengo might have scribbled a secret postscript on its blank side he saw only what i saw which was the north english seal well do it manvil he turned the letter again whatever north englishs message it made a difference but it left his old friend max puzzled north englishs word obviously was gold to weider clear the great hall again wan smile let this young gentlemans friends help that was a subtle dismissal of nagit and gilbey both will this work garrett i dont know my record hasnt been outstanding lately no it hasnt on the other hand most of our troubles couldve been avoided if wed listened to you in the first place i understand that youre handicapped by the head start i allowed evil but who could believe that such things might happen the latter he directed toward himself north english will send in freecorps people he trusts i assume you trust him but even so i intend to bring in friends of my own whatever you think of the man garrett hes my friend i confessed i do see him through different eyes ill also bring in some guards people that colonel block trusts everybody can watch everybody itll be like party night at the pickpockets hall wan smile you missed the funerals you had them already of course he had it was summertime this morning early im sorry nobody told me i wouldve been there no matter you were doing the work of the lord i hope max wasnt demonstratively religious but he did belong to one of the oldtime hellfire and brimstone rip off an arm for a finger and a head for an eye type of cults because of hannahs incapacity hed gradually lost interest in the workaday details of brewing the worlds best beers he remained the grand lord of the brewery with the final say about everything but he had abandoned the detail management to ty and the brewmasters i feared hannahs passing might cause him to turn away from the business altogether and possibly even from life vengeance is mine can you pull it together by tomorrow i can but id be one tired boy when i was done good youd better get started now i was being dismissed as i opened the study door max said lose the uniform garrett if youre going to be roaming around alone you dont want to ask for more trouble max was right the comings and goings of freecorps messengers got noticed the news spread at the speed of rumor tension soon filled the streets tempers grew shorter fast i had arrangements of my own to make i couldnt use nagits men or brewery hands to complete them my proud destrier and i put on the miles i visited the palms morley told me he could make it and he suspected that puddle and sarge and a few of the boys wouldnt mind a party either i left a message for belinda which dotes promised to have delivered then i dropped in on playmate who not only was available and willing but saved me several hours by knowing where saucerhead tharpe was holed up i then swooped down on heavens gate where i talked to trail and storey and miss trim and unfortunately medford shale since i didnt have a keg under either arm or any treats for shale any welcome was less than enthusiastic shale could just keep on wondering why nobody came to visit him my weatherprediction skills proved acute it was late afternoon when i went to see saucerhead it was raining at times the downpour turned unseasonably ferocious through everything the goddamn parrot never made a sound that critter had to be trying to spook me out not that i missed the old foulbeaked mr big not even a little playmates in morleys in i told tharpe who wanted convincing the dead man might be in if i can find him and i particularly need you in i dont think i can make it all happen without you of course i could but everyone wants to be wanted saucerhead more so than most and i had some special requests each of which i explained carefully the big guy grumbled gonna be a major pain garrett thats a lot of work you got something else going in the past hed always had a good work ethic not really winger had an idea about youve got to get away from her man you ever notice how she never gets hurt in any of her schemes yeah i know its not real nice but all right garrett dont start that shit i really hate it when somebody reminds me that i owe him i offered an evil chuckle reminiscent of the one id last heard from colonel block the head guardsman was next on my list i hit the street once i finished twisting saucerheads uh giving mr tharpe his instructions with cold water drizzling down the back of my neck i have to get myself one of those bigass riding cloaks now that im a cavalier that a horse saucerhead called after me from the tenement doorway are you riding a horse he didnt mention the condition of the monster ive seen everything now it really must be important i better get on this right away he had a hat on his head already how many times have i said he and winger didnt have sense enough to get in out of the rain made me wonder he did have sense enough to wear a hat while he was out in it pular singe caught me leaving the alkhar after i made arrangements with block who guaranteed relways cooperation the good colonel was in a festive mood an attempt to rescue gerris genord had been crushed without guard casualties one invader was dead two now shared genords cell a couple of others whose interest had been crask and sadler instead of their old pal gerris had gotten out again very interesting i hated myself for thinking singe looked like a drowned rat but i couldnt help it she did a drowned rat in a wet shirt i hoped your people would notice me running around whered you get the shirt it used to be mine it was tad weiders before that from the stuff you threw away it would be a sin to let that go to waste the shirt didnt flatter her ratpeople just arent put together like human people you could get trouble from the shapechangers she tried to smile it was an obvious conscious effort to ape the human expression they have been disappointed already many times the clothes had gotten scattered amongst reliances dependents and they didnt care if the shirts had been tagged im glad to hear it what about my tools tools she didnt understand i reminded me to keep it simple and slow she might be a genius of her kind but she was still ratpeople the weapons i was carrying that stuff wasnt cheap even when you took most of it away from the bad boys you ran into still with a little creative billing amongst my various employers hehhehheh i do not know i tried to recall if any could be traced to me or the weiders if they turned up at the scene of some major villainy i didnt think so would reliance let you go out to a party tomorrow night i knew id picked the wrong words even before the goddamn parrot loosed the first noise to pass his beak in hours slow and simple stupid before she leapt too far in her conclusions i said ill be working there i want to hire you to unmask the creatures with no scent nobody is as good as you are i couldnt restrain a grin which seemed to help but it was sure misplaced what must people think of this rainbedraggled crew hatless me a soggy parrot scrunched on my shoulder leading a motheaten antique horse practically hand in hand with a ratgirl who looked like shed been drowned once then thrown back for good measure the thought made me look around for witnesses by chance i glimpsed another drowned rat did you know fenibro is following you singes immediate anger made it clear the wannabe boyfriend hadnt been invited i told him not to i couldnt follow what she said it isnt important maybe reliance sent him to watch out for you one day reliance will learn that i am not a belonging i caught that easily enough she added it may take a very painful lesson i will help you look for the shapechangers in seconds her enunciation had become nearly flawless speaking of whom are they still holed up in that old brewery yes singe looked over her shoulder she showed her teeth in an unfeminine threat display if id been fenibro id have gotten the hell out of there fast max waved me to a seat lay it out thiss only tentative subject to change as dont bullshit me garrett the man had exhausted his store of patience with everything all right in temporal sequence gerris genord was a plant part of a part of this that goes back a few years and just one of a bunch of plants that put wolf people inside rich families and businesses they were after money plain and simple it was the wolves who approached ty he or the brewmasters may recognize some of the prisoners gerris wouldve known when alyx decided to bring me in he wouldve reported at some point some of the wolves wouldve run into some of the dragons theyd remember each other from the cantard the wolves asked for help or maybe hired the dragons but the dragons had their own agenda they started using the wolves when the wolves thought they were using the dragons for their own reasons the dragons decided to make your family their main target when genord reported that alyx was trying to contact me the baddies did some research and decided i could cause trouble they tried to distract me by involving me in the rights movement the dragon crew tried to recruit me they were recruiting guys at the brewery already when i showed up there one of those guys reported me and the shifters sent over a team from the lamp brewery ruins they failed to discourage me genord marked the clothing you gave me so i could be tracked my part in events since then you know more or less manvil gilbey stirred the fire max needed a lot of heat to keep going weider mused dragons and wolves using each other the wolves after money what did the changers want a functional brewery dont ask me why i still have to figure that out maybe changers came with a big thirst but ive got a feeling supported by not much more than intuition so far that glory mooncalled is in all this right up to his mysterious neck an implication in part dependent upon my interpretation of my partners arcane nonbehavior i also think that whoever is managing the wolves has been blackmailed into helping the dragons i keep picking up little whiffs of disharmony i have a hunch that that manager brought crask and sadler back to deal with the blackmailers belinda turning up complicated life belinda is dedicated to turning those two good old boys into fish food so this mystery wolf decided to uncomplicate life by getting rid of belinda and me he gave crask and sadler the goahead without consulting the allies he planned to ambush later oh what an elegant theorist am i i was probably off the mark on half of this but i didnt let a little thing like maybe being wrong slow me down after the excitement at the engagement bash genord began to understand how badly he and his pals were being used he sneaked away to raise hell about it he got no satisfaction and possibly pursued was in a highly disturbed state when lance and ty surprised him at the front door since then things have been falling apart fast for the wolves and dragons both meantime not one person involved in this has dealt with me straight everybody including you has had an agenda they didnt want to abandon although everybody told me a little something here and there so i could have a tool or two to go make things uncomfortable for some other guy i dont know what your problem was boss maybe you just didnt want a guy with dirt under his nails making the guests nervous by tracking real life all over the place im offended but ill stipulate that its your house your party your call maxs gaze flicked to gilbey for an instant ah his idea huh gilbey asked you have any idea who this mysterious manipulator is just a feeling no evidence but if this turns into the pressure situation i want it to become somebody will point a finger and say he made me do it gilbey stirred the fire again max looked thoughtful i said theres more but those are the assumptions im working with tonight well see how things come together i stood at the head of the grand staircase overlooking the weider great hall tinnie wriggled in under my left arm morley had reminded me to add her to the guest list possibly saving me several centuries in purgatory or what shed make seem like several centuries morleys thoughtful effort balanced off about one talons worth of the goddamn parrot tinnie said if it wasnt in bad taste id ask who died there were a lot of people of various persuasions and allegiances below us mostly gathered in sullen clumps the main folks circulating other than mr gressers serving crew were hardeyed men from theverlys freecorps the brewery my friends and even a few of belindas some parties just never come to life damn what saucerhead brought winger winger might decide that being up to her eyeballs in toughs and lawmen represented a challenge i glanced up a gaudy glob remained perched on the main chandelier gawking at the mob the bird was vitally alert and his beak hadnt gushed an abomination in the past hour he was way out of character i was concerned but even morley hadnt noticed if we could just keep it that way manvil gilbey came out of maxs study going to be much longer still missing some key faces speak of the devil here come colonel block and the secret police more hardeyed men probably not relways undercover goons because he wouldnt want their faces this exposed came in through the front door some pulled chains a few of my guests wouldnt be willing participants examples hove into sight crask sadler gerris genord and his captive friends genord seemed particularly unhappy about returning to the scene of his crime him and his buddies got dragged to a bench that was chained to a pillar they wouldnt be lonely there the bench already supported eight desolate brothers of the wolf who hadnt scooted fast enough to avoid lieutenant nagits roundup at the pipes apparently nagit even caught north english by surprise with that hed told me that marengo had been put out in the extreme according to tama montezuma who continued doing most of his talking for him alyx joined us thats an awful lot of men who dont like each other crammed in nosetonose in one place shed dressed gorgeously she looked like she wanted to go down and set the mob at one anothers throats im surprised you got them all to come hey we serve the best beer in town and its on the house my gaze drifted to trail and storey and miss trim and medford shale shale had refused to be left at heavens gate all four were demonstrating an heroic dedication toward making sure they got a fair share of weiders best the real reason most of these people had come was that they were afraid not to they might miss something critical it was a tense time in the history of tunfaire it was a time not to let yourself fall a step behind it was a time when the future was rewriting itself from minute to minute and you wanted your hands and nose right in the middle of anything that might nudge the pen of destiny manvil tell he was gone oh good better late than never saucerhead had completed his mission below ty had entered the hall from the family dining room he was on crutches nicks was beside him trying not to look like she was there to catch him if he fell ty was directing a crew from the brewery who were dragging one of those huge thousandgallon wooden settling tanks where beer sits briefly while the grossest sediments settle out later the holy nectar would migrate onward to occupy the kegs and barrels the customer sees questions about the tank stirred every little cluster but people were too wary of their neighbors to ask outside their own cliques ty gave me a thumbsup i blew him a kiss we were getting along today i told alyx go tell your pop i just dealt myself another ace everythings set and were just waiting for relway waiting for relway right hell understand she went tinnie asked think shell remember all the way over there youre vicious and shes your friend you keep that in mind all right youve got everybody that youve ever met gathered in one place what the devil do you plan to do with them oh im going to make them all unhappy real unhappy unless i manage to make me real unhappy by making a complete fool of myself you think the bookies are giving odds is there a point spread lift your skirt right here i can be conned into a little adventure sometimes garrett but three inches will be far enough her hemline dragged the carpet ha i thought so what youre wearing the green shoes i dont know if they turn you wicked or you just wear them when youre feeling wicked but somebodys here yes somebody was the boys from the lamp brewery had arrived they looked sexy in their shiny new silverplated chains id expected the logistics to be a problem but relway had been on the job already having anticipated having to control shapeshifters again and better five six of them i thought thered be more there should be more hell therere only five of them the sixth was a ringer relway himself in disguise and not really part of the coffle he was pretending to be a little hunchbacked torturers apprentice jingling the ends of the chains probably no one but singe and i recognized him singe showed more courage than id thought possible not only was she on the scene she was out where people could see her she stayed close to the walls though the rightsist types were surprised by her presence but it didnt distress them not nearly so much as did the presence of morley dotes and belindas swagging toughs ratpeople knew their place everyone i wanted there had arrived singe had not yet found any shapeshifters other than those relway was delivering but she kept on looking i was counting on surprise visitors of several kinds marengo north english wove his way through the crowd hurriedly headed my way he seemed to cringe from the touch of the crowd he wanted out of the press fast his lovely niece trailed a step behind him tama seemed uncomfortable and deeply troubled maybe that was because there were so many really bad people around though i couldnt picture her having much difficulty managing in even the direst circumstances shed already impressed me as a firstclass survivor capable of cool thinking and quick decisions while marengo had been eyeing the belindas and tinnies and wingers and developing an itch she had been formulating plans of her own i was sure whatever silverware marengo still had lying around the pipes might not be there much longer now colonel block was whispering with a fawning relway both kept glancing my way he nodded several times started toward the stair himself marengo arrived first he asked are you ready to start oddly tama seemed more interested in my answer than he did i was though i hadnt achieved the perfect and optimal mix id hoped for but the crowd was better than the one id expected the front door had been locked sarge and puddle stood between it and the room looking like some pudgy guardian temple trolls them dressed up formal was a vision to behold out of a bad dream unfortunately id never get joy out of having seen them looking pretty i was outfitted in ty weiders second best getup i looked like some limpwristed lilacscented lordlet bent on embarrassing his family publicly yes singe moved around the edge of the room marengo glanced down at her frequently unhappily playmate saucerhead and winger were never far from the ratgirl winger cleaned up astonishly well marengos gaze brushed her a time or three i wouldnt interfere if they decided they were made for each other they deserved one another and i had a parrot that would make a wonderful engagement present a glance showed me that the future nuptial knickknack was still paying attention singe drifted off to check mr gressers crew and neersa bintors kitchen gang block puffed his way to the head of the stair he clung to the rail sucked in a bunch of air gasped out youve got to stall garrett but got a good reason max demanded from behind me as i made a small gesture that brought a colorful lightning bolt down to strike my shoulder i guess alyx had gotten all the way there with the message her old man sounded darkly suspicious which is probably the healthiest attitude if youre dealing with minions of the crown i think so block said though youre free to disagree of course what i asked i knew it would be ugly the goddamn parrot cocked his head the better to hear an acquaintance took the liberty of inviting himself down slight weight on the last word i understood perfectly but max didnt catch it blocks waysomysterious chum from the hill had decided to stick his nose in that was wonderful that was more than id hoped for that made my evening nearly faultless that was one snake i hadnt really expected to lure in out of the weeds now if just one more old shitdisturber lately of the cantard republic couldnt control his curiosity and chose to become a surprise guest i wouldve contrived a flawless machination block continued he cant make it for a while yet and ill tell you youll feel more comfortable once he is here he winked a very unblocklike action i think meaning block was going to feel more comfortable his mystery guest must have been riding him hard max clucked his tongue irked maxs opinions of folk from the hill were blacker than mine marengo didnt seem to be disappointed in fact he seemed more relaxed then i realized he wasnt listening to us just to the crowd on the floor below i asked is your buddys identity a secret hes the stormwarden perilous spite never heard of him i didnt say because max got in the first word why he seemed distinctly unfriendly now could this be somebody he knew and disliked did everybody know spite but me im supposed to know things its what i do know where to make connections but i couldnt connect this glorified witch doctor to anything because the stormwarden is extremely knowledgeable in matters having to do with ranger commando special forces and covert operations inside the cantard he was involved he has unfinished business hes been following this since he heard about the dragon tattoos how did he hear i wondered would colonel westman block be saddled with standing orders to report certain discoveries to certain interested parties might such reports be a condition of his appointment why garrett how could you be so cynical you developing a case of creeping realism block surged onward ingenuously i dont know why garrett but that got his attention in a big way hes been nagging me like the proverbial fishwife and seems to know more about whats going on than deal does block decided he was talking too much which is a liability in his trade he finished him joining us was his idea but he keeps hill time of course i grumbled meaning i figured the stormwarden couldnt be bothered catering to the schedules of us lesser creatures but that was all right i wanted this devil out in the open where i could see him tell me old buddy how did this guy hear about my party in the first place block shrugged i dont know not from me i told you hes well informed hmm i glanced at marengo there with his old pal max weider being mousy quiet the very man who was grumbling and muttering about the caprice of sorcerers the other day i see north english lacked the grace to be embarrassed i see max said too so well wait garrett use the delay to build the pressure till these fools blow smoke out their ears then let the stormwarden land in their midst like a cat in a mouse nest i said youre the boss a little time sweating might indeed make somebody a tad more amenable excuse me block had retreated halfway down the stair then had stopped looking my way he had something on his mind i went to find out the colonel whispered relway says to tell you you have to come visit the lamp brewery he find something interesting apparently so he wouldnt explain he did say that he didnt understand it but that you might and you probably ought to see it before you go ahead with what youre doing here now maybe he didnt notice but here is just a wee bit busy and every time he wants me to see something that turns out to be dead bodies ive seen enough dead people oh shit medford shale and his heavens gate cronies had been admiring the settling tank like it might be the doorway to paradise id been keeping an eye on them in case they decided to try tapping it the results of which were sure to amaze and distress almost everyone bird go down there and get those drunks headed in another direction go on shoo the arrival of the talking bird had the desired effect the old folks retreated toward the kegs already tapped but their bickering orbit around the settling tank brought them facetoface with the arriving prisoners storey went berserk he flailed away at one of the shapeshifters with his walking stick i murmured apparently it can be the same carter stockwell who was involved in the myzhod campaigns what long story those old men were soldiers a long time ago some shapeshifter mercenaries sold them out to the venageti it was a big disaster for our side looks like these could be the same shapeshifters storey thats the guy being so stylish with the walking stick mentioned the one hes whipping by name i do believe im beginning to get an idea of why the stormwarden is interested me too if perilous spite was what i suspected lets go calm them down lets have a whisper with deal storey settled down only after for a moment it looked like trail had suffered a stroke several shifters bled liberally the silver fetters took the strength right out of them trace whimpered like a whipped puppy the voice of the guy whod been in the stable and on the stair to toms room said we shouldve killed the sonofabitch when we had the chance i couldnt tell if he meant me or storey the boys from brotherhood of the wolf were chained to the next pillar over several seemed stricken they saw faces they recognized faces that belonged to people who werent even human people who had been manipulating them a glance at gerris genord told me hed figured that out already maybe while he was in the alkhar maybe even the night he killed lancelyn mac maybe he knew the key answer too who i had an idea name of mooncalled only i couldnt make him fit going strictly by the available evidence marengo north english seemed more likely there was no coolness toward genord on the part of the other wolves block and relway hadnt sold them a thing they trusted their buddy kind of touching that these days trust is moribund and fading fast it did mean i had guessed wrong about genord not being the commando type it takes going through hell with a man to develop that kind of trust i asked genord you want to put somebody on the spot he looked through me he wasnt going to tell me jack if there was any settlement due his pals would handle it we couldnt hold them forever that attitude came out of the going through hell together too i remember that attitude i miss it but all the guys i shared it with are gone im left with just the pale ghost of it in my friendships with morley and a few others an uproar loud enough for all the guests to hear erupted out in the kitchen neersa bintor bellowed like an angry sheelephant before i finished making sure everybody didnt rush that way and thereby leave the rest of the mansion unwatched the big woman stormed into the great hall she had a body over her shoulder a shifter caught in midchange flopping like a crippled snake in her offhand she carried a kitchen maul that looked like it could be used to drive the stakes that hold up circus tents she searched the gawking crowd spotted me flung the shifter from thirty feet away it left some skin on the uncarpeted floor i an i i be tryin to manage de kitchen you garrett you you be gettin me better help dan dat tief you you be keepin you rat out a dere too you behind her pular singe managed to look sheepish and proud at the same time shed winkled out the interloper it occurred to me that wed neglected our obligation to inform neersa bintor of our full plans not an oversight the goddess of the cast iron would easily forgive in the heirarchy of the weider mansion neersa bintor ranked right behind max and just possibly manvil gilbey i apologized profusely in front of the mob a certain gaudily constumed woodpecker had a grand laugh at my expense lend me your cane there storey i whacked the side of the settling tank three or four times the bird said gleep and flew back to his perch on the chandelier you listen you birdboy you i an i got no room in my kitchen for vermin be dey talk or no you unnerstan you i will catch my own tiefs i an i the shifter at my feet stirred neersa bintor raised a prodigious sensible shoe brought it down hard then exorcised her venom through a hearty application of her maul she kept her foot in place while a couple of guards got the changer fitted with chains i whispered to singe as though she hadnt understood what had been said maybe youd better stay out of the kitchen she whispered back you tink so you singe the wonder child she was being sarcastic yeah scoot when i turned back to the crowd i saw the bintor phenomenon withdrawing i told the guards you guys better get this thing shackled to its friends before it remembers what kingdom its in i suspected the passivity shown by the changers was partly due to their psychic connection which must be charged with a communal sense of despair block near relway beckoned impatiently relway is predictable some ways for example you can count on him to bring out the melodrama in any situation he did that at the lamp brewery where he had guys with torches creeping around the interior ruins generating wonderfully creepy dancing slithering shadows its in worse shape than i thought it would be i told the little guy the brick exterior remained sound but the inside walls and floors were falling down and caving in smells odd too morley said he drifted over and through rubble and ruin without attracting a speck of dust relway grumbled the smell comes from what were here to see he wasnt pleased with his pal garrett garrett had let morley dotes and pular singe tag along deal relway wasnt dim he knew morley would try to memorize some identifying detail about him and that singe without even realizing it would accumulate a battery of olfactory clues i hoped he didnt feel threatened enough to consider some unpleasant form of rectification later through here relway ducked under a sagging floor joist i had to duckwalk in order to follow him the dust showed that there had been a lot of traffic before us what a glamorous life they lead relway grunted block made a small speech about evil always seeming glamorous from a distance but being squalid and ugly when you saw it up close it was hard to argue with that i saw proof every day on the other hand the wicked do prosper while the upright perform hopelessly in the theater of their own despair kind of like my shoulder ornament you mean the goddamn parrot who hadnt wanted to miss this adventure made a sneering noise really and morley announced i resent that that avian gem was a gift from me for which youll never be forgiven yech the smell was getting stronger fast though repellent it had a familiar edge a malty here relway said indicating a couple of old copper fermenting kettles that shouldve been stolen for their scrap value ages ago take a torch and climb up there he indicated a crude platform fashioned from old crates you too wes i borrowed a torch from a guard colonel block snagged another we accomplished the climb with a minimum of injuries though the wonder buzzard also lost some tailfeathers to a waving torch the kettles were full of stuff a big bubble broached the surface of the one nearest me oh thats foul some people shouldnt be allowed to brew their own thats what they were doing badly thats why the stench seemed familiar relway said thats right take that paddle and push the scum out of the way a sixfoot pole with a wide square end lay across the top of the pot i followed instructions shit block exclaimed what the hell is that i had to keep pushing the surface gunk aside to see it it was a slug olive drab thing four feet long and humanshaped no monkeyshaped caught it better its limbs were long and skinny and it had a tail it had a round head with large round lidless lemurlike eyes and no ears there was another in the other kettle not as completely developed what do you think relway asked think whats in them pots maybes got something to do with why theyd want to grab control of tunfaires biggest brewery theyre cooking up baby changers damn makes you understand their behavior some makes you kind of sympathize if thats how they have to reproduce i smelled ancient sorcery of the same sort that had created singes people but theyre still dangerous monsters from where we stand i wonder if itd make any difference to max that his family didnt die just because of somebodys greed grief aint big on caring about why block observed singe suddenly squeaked garrett danger and scooted into the darkness like well like a scared rat something stirred back the way wed come somebody barked something relway started to drag out a black knife that started everybody else grabbing for weapons deal block snapped relax relway froze instead a wicked vision seemed to materialize slowly from the uncanny shadows like that mythical breed of vampire that spends part of its unlife as a mist capable of passing through the finest fissure as it moved into the torchlight i saw that it was someone in black robes with golden lightning bolts embroidered on his face concealed behind a silver mask clearly the aforementioned stormwarden perilous spite clinging to the traditions of his kind which have spooky behavior and bad clothes as their foundations but people off the hill dress like theyre expected to dress i sometimes wonder where they find their tailors i also wondered if i really wanted this guy to turn up after all already he felt like clabbered bad humor the goddamn parrot decided he wanted to go for a fly with pular singe probably a good idea i didnt want him attracting attention block caught my eye he jerked his head i stepped down he followed his pal the wizard took our place he stirred the kettles and examined their contents i call him he for convenience there was a one in three chance that a woman lurked behind that mask not that sex made much difference those people are all misery on the hoof block tugged my sleeve gestured with his head it was time us grunts made ourselves scarce i departed still reflecting upon whether or not it was a good thing to have the stormwarden join us his presence might be enough to guarantee the continued sinister shyness of the specter general from the cantard whose appearance would be much preferable to me as we strode toward the weider mansion relway asked you gotten anywhere finding out anything for me garrett nope and im not going to either theyve flat out told me im not getting inside anything nor am i getting anywhere near any information they dont already want the whole world to share but youre the perfect recruit i think i was the perfect recruit until i started talking to you hmm just a hunch but if i was you and block id keep an eye out for one of your guys who maybe feels as strong about human rights as he does about law and order the ugly little mans face turned to cold iron thou shall have no other gods before me max stared the length of the hall at the stormwarden the sorcerer had come inside just far enough to be seen and cause a stir hed made himself shadowy and nine feet tall teensy lightning bolts slithered through the nimbus surrounding him he was accompanied by two apparently ordinary menatarms who on closer inspection showed a slight golden shimmer sarge and puddle were pleased to abandon their posts to the newcomers the hall had become a tomb with spites advent everyone anticipated the moment when he no longer just stood there the shapeshifters seemed particularly unhappy which suggested they recognized the sorcerer and knew him well enough to believe they had reason to be unhappy and marengo north english seemed to have faded into the very woodwork weider listened closely while i explained what wed found in the ruined brewery he nodded occasionally then observed they mightve created themselves a small army if theyd gotten hold of my place then which was probably their plan but why would they get help from a faction of the call we still need to dig that out but im pretty sure the wolves thought the help was going the other way we know these shifters are old now we saw that when storey had his fit trail and storey and the heavens gate contingent remained dutifully attentive to the keg they had staked out theyve had lifetimes to practice telling karentines what they want to hear and showing them what they want to see hadnt you better get on with the digging that spookwrangler gives me the creeps hes got a bad feel to him try to get him out of here before he starts something ill regret you heard of him before boss perilous spite no but i dont cross paths with those people much im in trade a brewer a brewer doesnt have much contact with anybody but people who buy beer even during the worst days of the war the brewery had no intercourse with the wars managers and manipulators i want to keep it that way go to work garrett quit swearing i surveyed the mob and grimaced im not big on getting up in front of crowds not when i have to share the spotlight with a lord from the hill especially when that lord is a complete unknown block seemed impressed by him though and nowinvisible marengo hadnt too far from being petrified quiet down i bellowed immediately every thug from the call and the brewery and the guard redoubled the racket by trying to shush everybody else i wouldve done better just standing there letting them come to the notion that things were about to ripen though tardily silence did find its way among us a sea of ugly faces turned my way not a one looked happy i wasnt overflowing with joy myself i hadnt thought this part through get them all together let it turn into a pressure cooker slip a couple cards up my sleeve that nobody but ty knew about see what the situation produced that was the plan should i explain some of these people had no idea why theyd been summoned the rest probably had the wrong idea i decided to let the thing unfold mr trail mr storey you gentlemen became exercised a while ago please explain why to everyone else i could imagine the rumors that had begun to go around already trail couldnt get a word out while surrounded by so many people who outranked him socially storey didnt have that problem though he had bolstered his courage mightily at weider brewings expense he repeated the tale of the myzhod campaign i let him ramble and editorialize but he didnt embellish much the stormwarden demonstrated an intimidating willingness to bestow cruel attention on any member of the audience inclined to become restless i suspected that a lot of my guests knew more about spite than i did i suppose if id had one of those posh army sinecures instead of a real job as a marine i might have heard something about him too storey made it clear that he and trail believed these shifters right here right now in this very room were the same damned treacherous shifters whod led an entire karentine army to its destruction fifty years ago once storey depleted his store of vitriol i announced miss quipo trim lately of his majestys royal army medical corps is going to tell us whatever she recalls that might be germane quipo told the crowd what shed told me adding details shed remembered since then then in succession i got statements from everyone else whod had contact with the shifters i revealed my own history i exempted only relway who wasnt present anyway according to official information almost everyone had to see that this assembly wasnt about me and the weiders as many might have expected ultimately it was about the security of the karentine crown the stormwarden weighed on my mind when i said that establishes the picture these creatures have pretended to serve the crown for ages but everywhere they go disaster follows rather like glory mooncalled i havent dug out much more about them theyre a big secret their commander in modern times was a colonel norton valsung miss trim tells me valsung was karentine but shes the only person ive found who ever met the man i consider his existence problematical he may have been a particularly clever shapeshifter i was fishing but somebody might remember something and volunteer it heck somebody might even volunteer to tell me who was behind the brotherhood of the wolf and all the calls embarrassments somebody might but i wasnt going to bet the family silver that someone would the stormwarden moved ever so slightly over by the front door a sourceless whisper sounded beside my left ear years of practice with the dead man kept me from jumping valsung existed his continued survival is however indeed improbable he was of use to them no longer i nodded slightly letting him know id heard i guessed i was supposed to use the information somehow i didnt see what use it might be though i glanced up at the goddamn parrot the old hen was observing alertly from the chandelier while taking care not to draw attention excellent remarkable bizarre but excellent because if the stormwarden figured out how the wonder dodo was being used i was going to have one very irritated sorcerer on my hands it wasnt possible that anyone would get the blame for me thats garretts law i murmured i hope you stay very very quiet and let the wizard carry the load the pressure hadnt yet had the effect id hoped nobody had lost control and started spouting secrets i turned to brotherhood of the wolf with them my footing was speculative and personally dangerous they remained an enigma despite being subject to human motives they were in bad odor with the call but i couldnt question the purity of their politics those remained rigorously correct by the strictest standards espoused by the most fanatic of rightsists the silence in the hall continued but the overall restlessness quotient kept rising to hold the crowds attention i began moving down the stair as i did so i said theres a circumstantial but evident connection between the black dragon creatures and brotherhood of the wolf the fact that your dialectic might be impeccable and your treason accidental would not impress some true believers lack of imagination and compassion being leading marks of the beast i made no direct accusations i wanted genords friends to come to the light on their own to decide that they owed amends genord himself was hopeless he had decided to protect somebody i hollered back up to the balcony boss you want to weasel your goofball pal back out of your den max grunted nodded to gilbey manvil went he returned leading a marengo north english still trying to avoid being noticed by the stormwarden i had no mercy tell us about the wolves where did they come from why did they go away marengo didnt want to talk that sorcerer really had him spooked north english must have pulled some truly stupid stunt he spoke only with the greatest reluctance hastily stumbling obviously not always certain of his facts morley materialized beside me he whispered why do you keep talking cut their throats and be done with it city elves are direct folk theyll chuck out the baby with the bathwater counting on the gods to look out for the tad if he deserves it because if i go slicing shifters up ill probably piss off about half the people in this zoo look around every one of these clowns is looking for an angle and trying to figure out how to use this if they can sneak around the stormwarden beforehand anyway we need to find out how widespread this changers cancer really is which we cant do using dead men that being a stormwarden over there not a necromancer and i for my part being obsessively curious wanted to ferret out a few whys as well as the whos and whats and that took getting peoples minds into the right frame by asking the right questions so the right answers would float to the surface marengo didnt say much interesting about brotherhood of the wolf theyd been his first effort to give the call real muscle a band of unimpeachable war heroes accomplished skilled and dedicated but having grown accustomed to deal with the kings enemies unsupervised for weeks or months at a time they tended to act without consulting their superiors when they tried to drive the inner council to adopt policies they favored by means of an unspecified intervention that left the council no other option said council ordered them disbanded they would be replaced by less elite more pliable believers the new groups grew haphazardly till colonel theverly came along most of the wolves joined the new freecorps a few like gerris genord dropped out and went elsewhere marengo insisted that the wolves disaffected or not would never knowingly ally themselves with karentas enemies only the thickestwitted witness would have failed to understand that just from observing the captive wolves devotion to the crown is a foundation stone of the freecorps ethic we had plenty of evidence that shapeshifters did not share that dedication north english said his piece and retreated as fast as he could his courage was extremely inconstant tonight perilous spite really worried him i got the impression that the reverse wasnt true the sorcerer was indifferent to everyone but the shapeshifters i studied face after face while others spoke those not anticipating punishment were growing impatient only the stormwardens presence held them in check i went down to genord tried one more time you meant well but you were conned and not just by these things i indicated the shifters thats not really your fault you didnt know they werent human even though youd worked with them in the cantard genord showed me the same blank face hed worn since hed come through the door i got down on one knee look guy im trying to give you something to work with they dont hang you for stupid but they sure will for stubborn who got the wolves back together who got you into this who are you covering for you think maybe he knew about the dragons eh genord and i both knew that brotherhood of the wolf never disbanded but we could pretend who decided to target the weider family and why them genord wouldnt talk but his buddies werent as singleminded theyd gotten a grip on the notion that they didnt have to throw themselves on their swords there might be a way out of their fix if theyd been tricked into serving evil you guys havent killed anybody have you except lance there wouldnt be any getting out of that for genord gerris remained donkey stubborn he believed he was a good man fighting the good fight too bad his determination was wasted one of the wolves volunteered we havent killed anyone the restlessness around us lessened immediately people jockeyed for vantage points they might hear something interesting genord gave the talker a black look his attitude was shared by none of the other wolves the man speaking looked like he was used to being in charge were guilty of nothing but striving to serve the movement and the crown he glared at the balcony at the unseen north english angry clearly feeling betrayed suppose you explain that i surveyed the audience i leaned back to check the chandelier the ugliest bird of the century stared back still alert good i glanced at the settling tank i had hold of a thread now finally things might start to unravel which could mean some real excitement get away from that tank i yelled trail storey and shale were back trying to figure out how to get beer out of the vat quipo trim though had established herself permanently beside an active keg of reserve dark she muttered with winger as she sucked it down winger was putting her share away too instead of looking out for singe no beer disappears faster than free beer with my luck the women were swapping garrett stories i growled i did not want winger getting drunk she loses all sense of caution once shes had a few the goddamn parrot launched himself off the chandelier swooped around the room people ducked people cursed the bird landed on wingers wrist just as she started to take a drink beer flew she glared up at me i indicated morley remember the jungle chicken was his fault the bird roosted on the chandelier again i glared at wingers mug she began to get the idea but how long could it stick upstairs belinda and nicks joined alyx andtinnie they mustve gotten a cue from max or manvil they had north english surrounded and were keeping him out where he could be seen if they added tama montezuma theyd create a coven of heartwreckers of diabolic magnitude where was marengos favorite niece i couldnt see her for the surrounding crowd hadnt seen her for a while now come to think the wolf continued his story privately we were told that we werent disbanding that the announcement that we were would get that asshole theverly down off his high horse the wolf spokesman seemed determined to stare a hole right through north english weider and gilbey had joined the ladies now compelling marengo to face his critic max was extremely unhappy with his friend we were told we were going underground to do the stuff wed trained for some of us should take positions in the private world openings would be arranged some should join theverlys command and monitor it from inside taking as much control as we could some of us should move over to other rights groups so we could keep track of what they were doing these were all things we were convinced we shouldve been doing already i gave north english the fisheye myself that was exactly the sort of stuff a guy like him would pull but he called down thats not true i told the brotherhood to disband because i wanted it disbanded i agreed with theverly they wouldnt be managed obviously time has sustained the wisdom of our decision nevertheless he remained shiftyeyed and kept his face averted from the stormwarden the man in chains didnt buy north englishs protests we got orders from you every day the last couple of months youve sent word three or four times a day it got to where you were practically controlling every breath we took the man believed what he said i didnt doubt that a bit the wolf had said sent word and it hadnt been that long since id mentioned the changers talent for telling karentines exactly what they wanted to hear this wolf had been fed a story exactly suited to his emotional need north english looked baffled maybe he believed what he said too the wolf plowed on the call was going broke they wanted to get ahold of a lot of wealth fast two two and a half weeks ago not long after we started working with black dragon we got word that the weider brewing empire would be taken over wed worked on that project for a long time just in case the dragons tried to recruit brewery workers in our name that was hard for us you kept us tied up in meetings all the time the mans conviction began to waver in the face of north englishs steadfast headshaking north english was getting angry enough to ignore the presence of the sorcerer marengo said i havent spoken to you three times in the last year fellow you couldnt could you colonel theverly would throw one of his tantrums you pular singe squealed saucerhead tharpe bellowed playmate boomed something sarge roared the goddamn parrot shrieked a sorcerous voice whispered beware in my ear just as look out rumbled inside my head a woody crash came from the direction of the dining room shrieks followed that something was headed my way that something was a whirlwind of horror that looked like a troll with a bad case of the uglies it had claws like scimitars it had fangs like a sabertithed tooger top and bottom it was preceded by breath foul enough to gag a maggot it bulled straight toward me bodies flew and people screamed there wasnt a hero in the place whatever direction the thing looked it saw flying heels my first impulse was to show it one more pair so was my second i listened to that one down said the little voice in my ear down insisted the big voice inside my head im a bright boy i can take a hint i flung myself down and clung to cold stone like the gods had announced that they were going to do away with gravity came a sound like somebody slapping a brick wall with the flat side of a big wet board the sound of big bacon frying followed instantly the ugly apparition shrieked louder than all the shrieking around it put together it collapsed upon itself passing through repeated twisting changes before it assumed the shape like those in the lamp ruin tanks a huge sourceless voice filled the hall stand back its stunned not dead the thing began to assume human shape evidently young shifters adopt some base form to which theyll revert automatically if they cant maintain a shape theyve chosen the shifters bound in chains made unhappy noises their despair was so strong i felt it maybe because id been exposed to the dead man for so long stunned didnt last an arm grew to an impossible length one incredibly nasty sicklelike claw tipped it that claw slashed at me i was just fast enough to dodge or the shifter was just slow enough to miss a waterlogged blanket slapped a stone floor big bacon crackled the shifter leapt into the air shrieked then flopped around like its back was broken i told morley i think ill back off a ways clever fellow sign me on as your assistant i noted that he wasnt watching the shifter whatcha looking for just keeping an eye out he used his ive got an idea but im not ready to talk about it tone i looked around too block and relway were busy making sure men kept guarding every entrance i looked up at tinnie and the girls they hadnt fled but they had let marengo get away again two large gentlemen from the shipping dock had joined the ladies max manvil and ty now formed a glowering knot at the foot of the grand staircase evidently concerned that my new playmate might develop a taste for toothsome wench a taste i cant say i begrudge almost anyone i limped over to genord id banged my hip good getting down onto the floor here we go again want to tell me anything now gerris still wasnt talking live a fool die a fool now what another racket from the kitchen thats what neersa bintor was very upset about something had singe no singe was there by the diningroom door just steps away from relway shaking like a last autumn leaf looking at me in a stance that begged forgiveness for failing to expose the changer in time still looking around morley asked you want some bad news no id cherish some good news though just for the novelty what crask and sadler went missing during that excitement gah youre shitting me sure enough their fetters were empty how the hell theyd been out of the way and everybody had been distracted but i stormed toward relway you want to tell me how crask and sadler could do a disappearing act in the middle of a hundred people what they couldnt i ve got the only key a twisted hand came out of a pocket empty hunh he was flabbergasted its a memory ill cherish relway is seldom at a loss somebody picked my pocket he started growling at his own people forgetting for the moment that he didnt want to reveal himself i went to pular singe told her you did just fine you couldnt be everywhere at once once the shifters understood that you could identify them they just stayed out of your way are you all right you think you can work i might need you to track those bad men again never mind the bad men morley said from behind me she turned them loose strictly for their diversion value slap and bacon crackle happened again people who shouldve been concentrating on that last shifter had let themselves be distracted by trying to keep track of me that changer was off the floor again it lurched toward its brethren sprouting scissorlike claws capable of snipping silver it seemed to be developing an immunity to the stormwardens sorcery a double application was needed to put it down this time someone would have to know me pretty good to think id drop everything if they of course somebody who controlled the resources of brotherhood of the wolf and black dragon valsung could find out all about me somebody whod had me dogged since before i knew i was getting into this mess somebody who who i could look around me and see everybody involved in the case except crask and sadler but they were pawns of the rest only marengo remotely fit like the lead wolf said north english might be one hell of an actor but he had been behaving strangely ever since hed gotten hurt a fact which left me squintyeyed with suspicion wait what about the redoubtable lieutenant nagit mr nagit was an excellent candidate he probably felt underappreciated then i recalled something hed said something i hadnt taken the trouble to hear at the time an evil globule of bright feathers hit my shoulder hard goddammit do not be willfully stupid garrett do not be willfully blind people stared only morley dotes grasped the full significance right away he turned stared at the settling tank briefly said youre one sneaky bastard garrett he showed about a hundred pointy teeth in a grin ive taught you well my disciple i ignored him i told the bird no im not being blind on purpose i really just got it block colonel block he was close enough that i didnt really need to yell find the woman the mistress montezuma its her that ties everything together stupid garrett stupid it was right there in front of you all the time but she was gorgeous so you just didnt think she could be anything else if shed gotten lucky with you you might have ended up as thick as gerris genord or well nicked by a meat cleaver how did she know crask and sadler from her old days before she got her hooks into marengo we didnt know much about her nobody bothered to find out no matter what wed discussed why backcheck a whore however remarkable she might be she might have grown up with the nightmare twins above marengo had found nerve enough to show himself his mouth was open but nothing came out mr nagit had told me the woman never did anything that didnt relate to her meal ticket that explained why she had hooked up with marengo in the first place it explained why shed work all the angles against the day marengo lost interest shed started that as soon as shed arrived at the pipes already old enough and wise enough to know that the ride couldnt possibly last tama montezuma would be one more reason marengo north english couldnt finance his bigoted revolution tama would have found a hundred ways to suck herself a comfortable retirement out of marengos and the calls cash flows it was amazing what vistas opened once i embraced the possibility that the luscious miss montezuma might be a villain the probability of a connection with glory mooncalled laid itself out as though announced by trumpeters i already believed that mooncalled was behind the shapeshifters somewhere i had hoped tonights festivities would somehow lure him to the weider mansion too probably in deep disguise but no disguise would help as long as he came within a hundred feet of that settling tank mooncalled wouldve gotten his claws into tama the instant the brotherhood of the wolf included black dragon valsung in their plans how shed manipulated the wolves was clear enough based on the testimony of our witnesses shed pretended to be marengos gobetween which the wolf acknowledged when asked directly tama wanted to be rich she had only one thing to sell the shifters wanted a brewery they had nothing to market but their talent for infiltration glory mooncalled wanted what where mooncalled came from and where he was going never had been clear even my partner who made a hobby of studying the man no longer understood what he was about and the rest of the world knew only that mooncalled traveled his own road and was a real pain in the ass about letting himself get pushed off of it the vistas stretched but i still had questions lots of questions how did tama get them to attack marengo that night why try to eliminate all the main leaders of the rights movement or was that all staging where was glory mooncalled now why hadnt i pulled him in because of perilous spite or had he sensed the trap and where was tama montezuma had she worked her magic on mooncalled that would be a real marvel those two getting all tangled up in each other and where were crask and sadler the noise volume rose as everybody decided to do something they teach that in leadership school do something even if its wrong karenta might have been a lot better off for a little more inertia in recent decades i have to confess some admiration and sympathy for tama she might not have lost me if people hadnt died i understood what moved her but she was too selfish and too sloppy all the despair now haunting the weider mansion could be laid directly at her feet mooncalled is in the area garrett said the voice inside my head he is upset i sense that he had plans for tonight too but nothing has gone his way there may be trouble we didnt have trouble already lets dont just stand around garrett block said weve got people on the run morley chuckled i dont think anybody will get very far right garrett im not that optimistic old buddy something will go wrong it always does singe i couldnt mention mooncalled that would spark too many questions i waved but pular singe didnt have courage enough to risk the center of the floor which wasnt a good idea anyway almost everybody not in chains was now headed somewhere else in a hurry many with their eyes closed in fear or in sheer determination not to become a witness to anything the gang from heavens gate however remained preoccupied with their personal hobbies so didnt contribute to the general uproar trail and storey remained determined to tap the settling tank they wouldnt enjoy that particular vintage if they succeeded though it was particularly bitter well beyond skunky i headed that way will you two leave that damned tank alone shale at least had had the grace to pass out or just fall asleep theres all the goddamn beer you can possibly suck down over there by quipo miss trim youre supposed to keep these antique idiots under control but quipo had reached a point where she was having trouble managing herself garrett heard bout you from your fren winger quipo was speaking fluent drunkenese whered she go winger wheredjou go garrett max wanted me what must these people destroy my home block i bellowed north english get your people under control speaking of control bigger trouble was on its way nobody was managing the shifters especially that last one it still wasnt yet properly shackled in silver the stormwarden descended into the chaos he went among the handful of shapeshifters like a venageti triage sorcerer specialists who had used their talents to decide which wounded should go to the surgeons and which should be put out of their misery those guys hadnt saved many karentines this guy ended two lives just like that suddenly viley noisily shifters never went easily it seemed the survivors evidently tendered an offer of submission the stormwardens golden buttboys got them up and moving they went docilely chains tinkling i wondered what would happen if the sorcerer turned his back i asked max you want i should do something about that what weider demanded its your house i kept my outrage well hidden karentines learn to do that when our lords from the hill are out people who wont control their emotions will suffer severe humiliations at the least let him have them they deserve him tell marengo to shut up and get his ass down here hes been acting like a fool north english was harassing his own people from the balcony apparently convinced that by yelling insults he could make them catch tama sooner i didnt yield to my urge to give him a swift kick nor would i give in to my inclination to let tama get away while i got north english rounded up so max could calm him down morley assembled his friends and mine he beckoned me youve got to get singe on montezumas trail garrett if she gets a big lead well never catch her she was ready for this why do you care ooh hes thick winger observed dumb as a stump wed say back home she had a strong beer flavor even from six feet away ive got a notion i dont want an explanation if youre interested in it i noted the notyetdeparted stormwarden watching us from near the front door i shivered morley said garrett even saucerhead figured out that montezuma has to have a cash stash possibly a very large one shes been milking north english for several years oh exactly what id expect of the whole gang barring playmate and maybe pular singe hustle out there and disappear the stolen riches before the rightful owner could reclaim them then look innocent id seen morley do it before the problem was winger was the sort of accomplice who wouldnt have enough sense not to start spending like a sailor before the sun came up dumb luck and brute strength keep that girl alive i dont think saucerhead understood that someday hell be genuinely unhappy about letting her talk him into things i glanced up at marengo he still didnt want to mix with us peasants on the main floor all right go tama i didnt mind him losing his money and him being broke wouldnt hurt max or any of those gorgeous ladies up there in fact itd be a better world if marengo north english couldnt afford to be a shithead what do you think latrinebeak i asked my shoulder ornament the goddamn parrot was out of words again which was just as well hed given too many people too much to think about already i had a few of my own left though crask and sadler are out there somewhere morley replied your pal the secret policeman can handle them if he hasnt caught them already relway had vanished while i was blinking many of his people were missing as well i asked singe you want to be part of this double share dotes offered generously which made winger sputter you wouldnt have to kowtow to reliance anymore he knew his ratfolk or this ratgirl anyway but this ratgirl was smart enough to know when somebody was blowing fairy dust too she did a credible job of lifting an eyebrow when she looked to me for my opinion a double share of what garrett i said i cant go ive got work to do here you guys catch her you bring her back to me i tried warning them with sudden shifts of my eyes toward the sorcerer but the fire of the hunt was upon them winger stuff it bring her back here i know it sounds improbable but therere issues in this world as important as your greed ohh saucerhead purred listen to the man growl shut up winger hes probably right be careful i told singe and she understood that i meant she shouldnt ever trust her present companions completely their expedition never hit the street garrett beware we are about to enjoy a badly misjudged and mistimed rescue effort a what a racket broke out up front a centaur galloped in through the front door a javelin in each hand it bowled over the stormwardens glitzy henchmen while seeming utterly amazed to find them there another minute and the collision would have taken place outside the stormwarden had just given up staring at me suspiciously whats this morley asked glory mooncalleds been watching i said but evidently not closely enough to have seen the truth because that centaur had come inside with no idea whatsoever what he was charging into he was astounded by the mob looking his way after toppling the guards he tried to stop suddenly but shod hooves just wont do that on polished stone he skidded he howled he tumbled he whooped he reached floor level traveling chin first his language was enough to make the goddamn parrot cover his ears it wasnt karentine but every man in the place had been to the land where that language was spoken more centaurs arrived each was as surprised as the first their faces revealed their determination to free mooncalleds allies and an equal intent to stifle the mans enemies but they faced big problems achieving their ends not the least of which was that they hadn t come prepared to deal with so many enemies i got the feeling that theyd expected to just prance in and prance back out i guessed the first wave of people rushing out had lulled them none of the later arrivals suffered the full ignominy endured by the first that fellow started getting thumped before he stopped sliding funny though at first only my friends and colonel blocks showed much enthusiasm for the sport youd have thought the guys from the call would be particularly unfond of centaurs centaurs are the most treacherous natives of the cantard in a moment the stormwarden had a nebula of slithering lights clutched to his stomach the ball persisted less than an eyeblink there was another splat of waterlogged board against stone the latecomer centaurs got a mighty assist in their efforts to get back out of the house sadly none collided with the doorframe along the way what must have been sold as an easy massacre had turned into a rout of the killers before they ever got started letting blood i looked around i didnt need outside help to realize that the centaurs had expected to get support from allies already on the ballroom floor but nobody raised a hand to help which suggested that mooncalled had staged his rescue in nearignorance trusting too much in unreliable allies which didnt fit his reputation at all did i smell desperation love is blind stupid oh no oh yes i fear your craziest speculation was correct there were more centaurs outside the uproar out there made that clear it sounded like a pitched battle i grinned my more noteworthy guests must have brought extra help just in case its getting to be a sad old world people just dont trust each other the way they used to the excitement had ended the centaurs had fled the rescue attempt had failed without ever having become clearly identifiable as such to some people colonel block and a badly shaken poorly focused marengo north english soon worked out a tentative fragile alliance they would work together to catch tama montezuma i suspected that alliance would collapse about as soon as somebody actually caught sight of tama both men had plans both were counting on me too if i couldnt get pular singe to track tama she might never be caught she might not be anyway she was a survivor shed had a long time to get ready for the inevitable i figured there was a very good chance wed find no trace of her i told max it didnt go the way i planned does anything yes sometimes sort of we did get to the bottom of it didnt we sort of and some good might come of it suspicion would attach to the call for a long time plenty of people would believe marengo was behind everything and had sacrificed his mistress to cover his ass i planned to keep a foot in that camp myself until tama offered a public confession no matter what my sidekick claimed i had a need to demonize north english to see him as slicker and slimier than he could possibly be perilous spite departed leaving echoes of sorcery fading in the street with him went the surviving dragons and the wolves brief feeble protests from the rightsists had had no effect being a cynic i suspected the stormwardens captives might not enjoy the full rigors of justice a tame shapeshifter would be a handy tool if you were in the sorcery and dark master rackets guys like spite have no interest injustice anyway most are incapable of grasping the concept why didnt you do something i asked the goddamn parrot perhaps because i had no inclination to become a part of the stormwardens booty garrett i knew that but it still seemed he should have done something i am doing something rather more interesting than what you would have me waste myself doing spite will reap no benefit from those he has taken into his possession his conscription was far too public that sounded a lot like one of those circuitous mollifications he always claims id misunderstood when things went to hell later i couldnt recall why id been worried about him the past few days my friends stuck around still hoping id give them the chance to beat everybody else to the bad girl miss trim and the crew from heavens gate wouldnt leave there was still some beer left i told saucerhead you and winger and playmate take the old guys home make sure wingers pockets are clean before she leaves after you deliver them come back here and help get rid of that settling tank garrett remove the tank then kindly get on with your chores i am expecting company it will go much easier if the crowd is smaller i threw up my hands in exasperation that told me that he had managed his end not so he could be a card up my sleeve but in order to hook a fish of his own am i going with you morley asked im not going anywhere bullshit garrett i know you you want to duck out with your furry girlfriend so you can get to montezuma first not so you can grab some money but because you dont want the pretty lady to get hurt im not as squishy as morley thinks id done some thinking about that night at the pipes about the wouldbe visitor and the knife or cleaver i might have seen i wanted to think id seen a changer in montezuma shape but i was keeping an open mind my failing to survive that night might have solved several problems for tama particularly if she knew what was supposed to happen to her uncle marengo up on the edge of elf town i was sure shed known now she almost certainly did will you quit dawdling what do you mean almost certainly you had plenty of time to dig around inside her head easier said than done garrett her thoughts were terribly murky she had some sort of protection well of course was he lying his motives arent often clear hell with it i turned to morley i dont mind him thinking im soft its an edge you figured me out i turned away again i talk to the wind that left him looking puzzled after all this excitement tonight i thought youd want to run back to your place and snuggle up with your favorite squash unless youre romancing an eggplant these days winger was leaving with saucerhead shooing the oldtimers and quipo but she wasnt happy or moving fast she snarled at block as she passed him where he was hanging around hoping id help him marengo north english lurked on the balcony above nursing the same foolish hope id have to ditch them both without being obvious morley and i had been whispering so singe hissed what do you want me to do morley offered a show of teeth amused i told singe thiss your choice you want to be independent to do that you have to make your own decisions that would be tough ratwomen are more oppressed than most human women they never learn to think in terms of selfdetermination a smirking morley dotes drifted off to send his henchmen home do you want me to do it singe asked of course i want you to do it thats why i asked you what i dont want is for you to decide to do it just because i want it i want you to make a choice thats your own made in your own interest gah that sounded like one of tinnies serpentine evolutions its certainly easier being the kind of guy who just uses people a stir at the door saved me any more skiprope a man who appeared to be in his seventies paused to survey the hall before descending to its floor the guard who shouldve kept him out seemed not to notice him maybe the old fellow was a ghost he stood stiffly erect partially supporting himself with a walking stick carved to resemble a fat black cobra his skin was dusky but not dark like playmates or tamas his eyes were gray he seemed to be going blind he came downstairs slowly with a marionettes jerkiness feeling his way with his stick he looked nothing like the image id carried in my head across the years since hed started acting up in the cantard dammit this guy was just too old manvil gilbey directing a crew already starting to clean up asked friend of yours not hardly friend of a friend maybe he should be harmless and he shouldnt be here long i said that directly to the goddamn parrot try to work around him dont bother him unless he misbehaves which didnt seem likely i could recall no instance when that old man hadnt had somebody else do his dirty work for him glory mooncalled walked stiffly to the beer keg jerkily he drew a drink in a mug formerly used by trail or storey a glimmer of fear burned in the backs of his eyes i was sure that a lot of calculation and clever manipulation had gone into making this moment possible no doubt id been played like a cheap fiddle for days just so my pal in the tank could manage a sitdown with his hero with none of that having any real impact on everything else that i was doing he was good old bones was or i was getting too cynical and suspicious its an occupational disease that who i think it is morley whispered i expect so but nobodys ever seen him what do you think bird was the mystery man plooking tama montezuma the goddamn parrot said pretty boy with a sneer in his voice that does it into the pot singe i will help not because you want my help but because by doing so i can help myself excellent makes you just like the rest of the team morley damned if he wasnt flirting with alyx or maybe nicks oblivious to the fact that the weiders father and son were looking at him in a way more often seen in rightsists observing nonhuman behavior dont do this to me morley he grasped the situation instantly youre right not smart but itll be torture holding back tell me something i havent had to live with for half of forever i collected block and joined north english who still refused to come down from the second floor singe says she might help track tama but she refuses to help either one of you i doubted that she knew who either man was really but neither was beloved of ratpeople and a refusal would be no surprise to them why is that old man here north english asked i noted he kept his back to the visitor did he know the man was he afraid he might be recognized the oldtimer took his mug and settled into a chair he dragged over beside the settling tank there was a quiver in his drinking hand i had a distinct feeling that it would be a long time before glory mooncalled was again a major factor in karentine affairs after this interview it would take him an age to reclaim his confidence and build a new underground the secrets of which were known only to his friends he would have no secrets after this interview and he looked too old to start from scratch i hoped the bag of bones inside that damned tank had the godsgiven good sense to do like id asked and rifle the minds of marengo north english bondurant altoona and their like tonight if we robbed them of all their secrets we could disarm them too in fact if he hadnt been just too damned lazy he mightve spared a mind to sneak a peek at what was going on inside the heads of block and relway and maybe even that scab of clabbered misery off the hill perilous spite but i doubted he had the nerve to try the latter too much personal risk involved nobody friend of a friend i went back down to singe do you have a scent yes she was a marvel picking it out of the mess that had to be in that hall i was surprised immediately instead of heading for any door tama had marched right into the kitchen past a flabbergasted neersa bintor into the pantry and from there had descended to the cellars below the house which i shouldnt have been surprised connected to the caverns beneath the brewery this woman definitely had everything worked out ahead of time morley said absolutely i hadnt known about this way out or in maybe if you had connections at the brewery end had tama been through there occasionally say to visit gerris genord having someone special to protect certainly would explain his stubborn silence and tama knew how to get her hooks into a man i wondered what she wouldve done if mooncalleds rescue gang had shown up on time would she have pretended there was no connection and have tried to stick with marengo as we dithered trying to get lights for my feeble human eyes the goddamn parrot squawked then abandoned me garrett do not overlook the chance that a great many watchers will be prepared to follow you a possibility very much on my mind i ignored the odd looks that remark earned me morley cursed softly somehow cobwebs had gotten onto the lace of one of his cuffs soil was supposed to avoid him this isnt the fun it used to be garrett fun fun doesnt have anything to do with it were the last righteous men standing with jaws firm in the face of the chaos pular singe giggled morley cursed again but conceded it is a great way to meet interesting women cant disagree with that strange ones too what is it singe had stopped she sniffed i couldnt see a thing the one lantern id come up with hadnt lasted all the way through the underground passage we were in the wagon lot behind the brewery loading docks having exited the brewery through the storage caves i hadnt been able to stop and share a tankard with mr burkel whod been disappointed but hed told us we were only minutes behind tama who hadnt been able to negotiate the tunnels with our ease she got aboard a wagon singe told me there were at least twenty of those crowded into the lot waiting for sunrise morley grumped something about have to search them all singe said no the wagon left i glanced back at the dock there were two dock wallopers on duty snoozing on stools under a single feeble lantern nights of course they only loaded independent haulers i woke them up with sullen cheer they admitted having loaded a small wagon a short time earlier one driver one told me out of dwarf fort they re fixin to celebrate one of their holidays shes on a cart out of dwarf fort i told morley then wed better move fast dwarf fort wasnt far away she wont be headed there herself she knows about singe and shes improvising shell get off before the wagon goes inside embarrassed singe informed me i cannot trail her well if she is riding so how about you follow the wagon or the horses if you can stand the stink you knew she got into a wagon and theres only been one go out of here lately seems like you could singe brightened instantly that hadnt occurred to her yet it would have she sniffsniffsniffed then headed out not only brilliant and talented and beautiful but fast as well morley whispered you dont want to let this one get away did marengo north english and bondurant altoona rub off on you he was ragging me at singes expense whoa he started to argue but decided against all right lets abuse the parrot who conveniently wasnt around to defend himself hed chosen to stay behind apparently i was always the last to know what that overdressed crow was up to or even what that critter who figured everything out for him was up to for that matter we were in for some headbutting after this mess settled out wish youd decided that a year ago then maybe held him underwater to see how long he could go without breathing singe flinched she still wasnt used to our banter it always took her a moment to realize we werent really about to skin each other im thinking about spiking your goulash with catnip then youd wake up married to winger couldnt shes already got a husband somewhere and im engaged really when did that happen oh back before i was born i just dont talk about it much my grandparents arranged it they were immigrants they stuck to the old ways they still try to ill bet youre a major disappointment they weep human tears at every family gathering when are you supposed to start making this poor woman miserable oh a long time ago but she never showed up for the ceremony smart woman she just hadnt met me if she had i dont know if i couldve talked my way out of that the old folks are stubborn as rocks they still carry on like it was my fault they cant blame it on indalirs family they have royal blood as if every elf who ever walked doesnt the way those people tumble anybody who cant outrun them im glad you arent the kind of lowlife who finds women interesting definitely one weakness you cant pin on me pular singe stopped she turned slowly nostrils flaring morley shut up and began searching the night too he loosened his swordcane i said i hoped theyd lose us because of those tunnels singe said no not watchers it is the two evil men who escaped they met the wagon here she dropped to all fours circled sniffed i muttered coincidence or prearrangement morley asked the important question how could they know where shed be she didnt know she was just running if she thought tonight might be the end of her run she mightve had somebody waiting outside whos going to pay any attention to a dwarf making a beer run there is the smell of fear singe said mostly from the driver but also from the woman i think she did not expect to encounter the evil men she wouldnt want to run into them morley said after what theyve been through theyd have a few bones to crack with her if they got this far ill bet it was because they were allowed to i said therell be somebody else on this trail real soon singe probably the little man who tries so hard to hide who he is morley tested his cane again you carrying anything im not military but im fixed i did wish that i had my headknocker i needed to have some more of those made up notice the streets are empty theyre never busy down here and there were centaurs around maybe there still are it was unusually quiet though singe squeaked blood the direction changes that way im blind here i reminded them im cursed with human eyes over there singe said i went morley followed he confessed her eyes are better than mine too the treasure at the end of this dark rainbow was a broken dwarf he wasnt dead but that was only because crask and sadler hadnt felt any urgent need to kill him theyd only wanted his wagon we left him for master relway singe picked up the trail again she wasted no time getting on with the hunt the cynic in me or maybe the practical businessman told me i had to get in good with her now because she was going to be a phenomenon later all she needed was a little more confidence a little more experience and a little more force of personality i kept up puffing i gasped im wornout these last few days just never made much sense everybody i know was mixed up in it all of them banging off each other and getting in each others way sometimes the world works that way garrett morley replied when everybody heads a different direction nobody gets anywhere i understood that but it didnt satisfy my sense of propriety everybody jumped into the mud they all clawed and slashed in squalid pettiness all the while espousing grand ideals i grunted morley chuckled then said here you go launching another clipper of despair because all the humans you know act like human beings we really are a tribe of sleazeballs but i dont like being reminded of it it would be nice to believe that at least some of us are climbing toward the light without pursuing a hidden agenda singe slowed i took the opportunity to recapture my breath before it got away completely the ratgirl whispered the wagon is just ahead i knew that i heard its ironrimmed wheels banging the cobblestones it is a small one drawn by two ponies which was no surprise dwarves not being inclined toward big wagons and plowhorses i smell fresh blood the coldness that always comes when i think about crask and sadler began to engulf me i was almost superstitious about those guys i wasnt strictly speaking scared of them but i dreaded a confrontation because facing them was like challenging forces of nature morley observed theyll still be in bad shape their jail time couldnt have been any holiday in tone more than word he sounded like he wanted to convince himself so maybe he had his own reservations the villians had set a course headed north soon theyd leave this quiet neighborhood for one where the night people thronged nobody likes to work with strangers looking over their shoulders we had to do something soon you go along the right side and grab the driver morley said ill take the left me youre taller and heavier youll have more leverage no point arguing with the obvious now without all that stomping you dont want them to know youre coming stomping i wasnt making a sound all i could hear was the whisper of singes nails on the paving stones now there was enough diffuse light that i could make out vague shapes and keep from crashing into walls and watering troughs soon i made out the dwarf wagon morley loped beside me in step i murmured i see it do it my heartbeat increased rapidly this confrontation had haunted me for years from somewhere came a loud awk in distinct parrotese it didnt sound like a warning so it must have been only to let me know there was a friendly witness which wasnt much comfort since it was hardly possible for reinforcements to arrive in time if i screwed up singe mustve been more scared than she let on she began to fall behind any noise i made got covered by the curses of the man driving he couldnt get those stubborn ponies to move faster than a walk dwarf ponies have one speed slow the only alternative gait is dead stop inevitably exercised in the event of excessive brutality funny dwarf ponies are a whole lot like dwarves i grabbed the drivers right arm used my momentum to pull him down i couldnt tell which man id grabbed but that didnt really matter crask and sadler might as well have been twins i didnt see the other one he had to be inside the wagon probably in worse shape i glimpsed a surprised face as my victim hit the cobblestones foul air blew out of him he groaned then lay still i moved in warily there was no need the anticlimax was real sadler had bashed the stuffing out of the street with the back of his head shaking with the letdown i tried to decide how to tie him up so hed still be there when relways crew arrived i got mine i said the goddamn parrot offered a pleased squawk from somewhere overhead the wagon stopped morley said crasks inside hes unconscious another anticlimax whatre you talking about for years ive expected this it was going to be an epic battle bodies flying around knocking down houses busting holes in the street going on for hours everybodyd have to bring a lunch instead we butt heads with them three times in the last few days and hardly got a scratch for our trouble so we caught them when they were weak thats the smart way to do it hang on this ones bleeding hell hes got a knife stuck in him im not so sure i want to snuggle up with tama montezuma after all i used strips torn from sadlers jail smock to bind his wrists behind him he made vague gurgling sounds i asked where is she she in there bad news garrett more bad news theres nobody in here but me and crask and ten kegs of weiders cheapest beer and the dwarves will come looking for that before long awk eight pounds of outrage in a threepound package slammed down onto my shoulder i lurched toward the wagon morley was right there was no beautiful woman in there at all let alone the marvelous miss montezuma where did she go how could we lose her singe singe where are you singe didnt answer me i scurried around calling her name morley started laughing he gasped weve been had garrett you realize that weve been snookered by a ratgirl yuck it up you glorified greengrocer he kept laughing we cant go anywhere without pular singe not if we want to get there ahead of relway or north english or belinda only question left is did the kid do it on her own or did reliance put her up to it you really think its that hilarious well no actually i dont enjoy getting slicked either id rather it was me doing the slicking but you and i dont really need the money we just think itd be nice to keep north english from getting it back and you want montezuma for what she did to the weiders i grunted grumped i think ill just go home and go to bed now why i shouldve expected this nothing in this whole damned mess had gone the way youd expect it to or made any sense while it was going to hell so i think ill just wish singe good luck drop out now and let the loose ends tie themselves up on their own garrett theres sure to be a fortune involved you just told me you dont need the money i didnt say it wouldnt be nice to have it tinnie is still back at the weider place so was my sometime partner but he could look out for himself i was little peeved with him you want winger to score on this one you think shed ditch the old guys i think saucerhead will actually have a thought somewhere along the way will say it out loud will get no answer and will discover that he no longer has one of his companions playmate is so honest hes easier to flummox than saucerhead is he wont suspect a thing if she tells him she had to step into an alley to get rid of some of that beer tharpe would be suspicious though hes dim but his light isnt all the way out and hes had experience with winger relways troops began filtering out of the darkness that put an end to all speculation the goddamn parrot began swearing his black heart out maybe my partner took singes coup personally even though it didnt really have much to do with him that really shouldve been the end of it i thought most of the guilty had been exposed as villains the whys and some of the wherefores of their crimes had been dragged sniveling into the sunlight clever exposure of truths dredged from evil minds and a judicious stimulation of wicked rumor by my sedentary sidekick mainly behind my back resulted in an indefinite postponement of the cleansing it particularly disarmed glory mooncalled by laying waste to his beloved rebel image the more exciting rumors even stirred a royal inquest into the behaviors of perilous spite when some of his peers began to wonder if those rumors had substance and spite might plan to use captured shapeshifters in some wicked scheme of his own the dean man hadnt dared touch the stormwardens mind at weiders but four centuries of observing human misbehavior closely had allowed him to manufacture rumors that got the hill churning like an overturned anthill spites enemies soon resurrected old questions about his management of the secret and special services during the war even his friends began to wonder aloud about several mysteries surrounding his tenure working with ty weider whom he liked for some reason his nibs even helped fashion a facesaving formula whereby ty weider and gorgeous giorgi nicholas could honorably evade an alliance not even their parents found particularly desirable anymore that mostly took exposure of the truth that only inertia was keeping any of the principals committed and quiet revelation of the fact that ty would be unable to father an heir life was good for garrett i had plenty of time to do what i do best which is nothing but tama montezuma was still on the run and pular singe hadn t been seen since shed deserted me though reliance and fenibro both accused me of having squirreled her away in my harem neither belinda nor relway eased up on their machinations and malfeasances neither gave a rats whisker if the dead man did know what they were doing the dead man of course didnt make their mischief public as he did with the call perilous spite and his own personal fallen angel glory mooncalled the stormwarden was particularly not happy but didnt get a chance to look for the source of his embarrassment odds were he never would he had to devote all his genius to the manufacture of plausible explanations of how a man with his talents could blunder so often and so egregiously while karentas chief spymaster and still have grown filthy rich rumor began to speculate about possible past connections with the dragons the day had been saved i think at times i wonder though if tunfaire really deserves saving whether the threat is from our own homegrown monsters or those from outside our experience if we didnt have a thousand religions already i d get me a black outfit and a big black book grow a scraggly beard and start squawking about salvation and redemption i know where i can get a black goat grudgingly of course i admit that the dead mans efforts had made it possible for life to return to normal at the garrett homestead or as nearly normal as a place can be while infested by a menagerie it was a good week not one wannabe client came pounding on my door dean had the place looking respectable again saucerhead and winger had gotten the dead man back onto his wooden throne not obviously the worse for his adventure he looked like hed never left home but certainly didnt think like it he remained way too excited to fall asleep strategically it wouldve been a great time to take on another tough case old bones was up for anything that would let him show off the only downside was that he just would not leave off complaining about having been stuffed into that settling tank and never mind the fact that the ruse had been his own brainchild entirely id nothing to do with the planning or execution of his scheme id had only the shortest and most ambiguous warning that he intended to come to the party dean complained more than the dead man did he hadnt enjoyed having to move out even for just a few days never mind that it had been for appearances sake he refused to accept that explanation he was going to make sure i shared his unhappiness fortunately tinnie came around several times to help him clean and to cheer him up and to make him feel guilty about being alive her visits offered me blessed respites from both cranksters i caught up on my gossip with eleanor i scandalized mrs cardonlos by telling her that i knew she was a police spy but i didnt mind that im now convinced that she is relways creature but i dont care me telling her i know she is a police spy has her backing off its clear she doesnt want such ideas to afflict her less tolerant neighbors to my complete and eternal astonishment everyone who had hired me paid all the fees and expenses i claimed i was boggled because there were so few quibbles marengo north english astonished me by not holding a wake for each copper he had to let go i got the distinct impression that he was in a huge hurry to get me the hell out of his life despite all the good news my life was not very satisfying a lot of people had gotten hurt and not many of the ones who did had deserved it i couldnt help feeling there mustve been more i couldve done to keep evil at bay something i should probably be doing still sometimes life may make no sense but you cant give up on it youve got to soldier on you probably cant win but if you abandon the struggle the darkness rushes in and swallows everything but on the other hand you do get tired fighting the good fight me block even relway sometimes we all feel faded like the steel has gone leaving no heat i was relaxed i was comfortable it was time to go review with old chuckles he had to be over his worst grump about how unfair it was that everybody had done things exactly the way hed told them to i strolled across the hallway up forard capn beaky rehearsed his lines for his next effort to incite mutiny or mayhem once i entered his room i found that his nibs still hadnt started snoring can we talk now youve had a week thats time enough to get over it he didnt say no that old man at weiders the other night that really was glory mooncalled wasnt it yes he was a big disappointment eh indeed time as ever is a villain i waited he added nothing though so i had to ask what wicked trick did time play you time caused change the fiery idealist of yesteryear has become a cold blooded cynical powerseeking opportunist indistinguishable from those he wanted to displace when he was younger my illusions are dead my innocence is gone pardon me i gasped once i regained control my stomach muscles ached id laughed so hard thats the best story ive heard since the one about the blind nun and the snake with no teeth and i was just about convinced that you didnt have a sense of humor your sophmoric jocularity provides striking evidence in condemnation of that entire concept which is an entirely human conceit i might note and highly overrated humor you mean hell even ratpeople have a sense of humor old bones in fact fewer humans have a good sense of humor than do members of almost any other race speak of the humorless dean interrupted before we got going good he was carrying two chairs he dropped them and left he was back a minute later with a sawhorse then left again next time he lugged in a couple of planks i asked what the devil are you doing making a table why for a dinner party thiss the only room thats big enough dinner party what dinner party i invited several friends in for the evening you invited several friends without bothering to consult your landlord or even bothering to invite him i want to talk about my friends you had a couple of hours to burgle brains what did you learn give nothing of significance which you do not already know he seemed unusually reticent that suggested his ego was involved which meant his productivity had disappointed him you didnt get anything what were you doing helping trail and storey suck down the beer dean brought two more chairs i hadnt seen them before he mustve borrowed them somewhere he reported both mr weiders send their regrets but mr gilbey will attend miss alyx and miss giorgi will accompany him the proximity of the stormwarden made extreme caution necessary and a great deal of attention had to be invested in tracking and in time controlling glory mooncalled likewise the parrot i had little attention left for mental espionage he wasnt usually so defensive his testiness was a clue to his mental state he couldnt brag about his efforts that night which suggested he had done very little that i might find useful normally he can discover something selfaggrandizing in almost anything but you already gave me enough to wreck the stormwarden and cripple the call so what was going on inside north englishs head did he put tama up to running the wolves i do not know i was not able to penetrate the mans mind what uh not able or didnt try some of each mainly the latter as it appeared it would be a difficult task he appeared to possess the same protection that the montezuma woman did but he had had time to shop through the heads of nicks and ty and max and discover that nobody really wanted the wedding to go on many is the time i have had to remind myself that he isnt human that his priorities arent human and especially that what might seem important to me will be trivial to him you did dig into bondurant altoonas head didnt you and belindas and those of other principals i attended that confabulation humiliating myself by allowing this once proud flesh to be embalmed within a demeaning noxious cask only because by doing so i could at last come facetoface with glory mooncalled i invested a great deal of effort in making that meeting possible anything i did on your behalf was incidental the appearance of the stormwarden which i did not anticipate because i had been out of touch with your researches complicated matters immensely in any event you brought the matter to a successful conclusion but not a satisfying one and now i have to deal with yet another dark suspicion old bones simply wasnt interested in my problems he shifted his attention to dean who was back with more lumber and another report mr relway wont come however colonel block has indicated that he will be present lieutenant nagit will attend the old man never glanced at me this was between him and the dead man and my opinion was irrelevant and it was my fault alone that both these vipers resided in my house not to mention that bundle of colorful snake snack camped out up front though that i could blame on morley he did say lieutenant nagit the dead man shouldnt know nagit from a hitching post nor did he know manvil gilbey for that matter what the hell was he up to lieutenant nagit though we might could have become friends if he wasnt so bigoted his taste in redheads was impeccable i might want to keep an eye on him in that area unless a redhead with malicious intent to make me sweat was behind his having received an invitation dean continued marengo north english wont be here now there was a surprise would marengo dine with the hired help who coincidentally had become far too familiar with his affairs and who had a tame loghyr on staff not likely particularly in light of my sudden new suspicion which shouldnt have been that new come to think of it i had to take a few minutes to settle and reflect upon our interactions miss tate will be here well of course she would would she ever be far off if alyx or nicks were close enough to cause palpitations again not likely whats the point i asked we cant learn anything new from any of those people the goddamn parrots laughter echoed down the hall the little monster launched a rant almost certainly stimulated from outside occasionally i have an agenda of my own garrett only occasionally miss contague will come as well what why get belinda in here amongst the gentler lovelies she was in one of her manic deadly phases these days people who had challenged her rule or who had just irritated her lately were finding themselves dead in alleys or turning up missing all over town though to belindas credit she did restrict the mayhem to the realm of business but when she got into one of these moods where she heard murderous commands in her fathers voice inside her head i preferred to avoid tickling her interest in me i had hopes that interest would fade into complete indifference eventually you left out shale and his pals mr thorpe and miss winger too this is neither a reunion nor a rogues ball what was it then is morley coming i believe mr dotes is arriving now somebody banged on the door dean responded evidently he was so excited by the challenge of managing a real dinner that he was willing to assume his other duties without quarrel why i asked i wanted the dead mans plan he was up to something not much to do around the palms morley said from the doorway things are slow nobody wants to come out while thats going on he inclined his head toward the street the racket raised by a really bad marching band was winkling rotten mortar out of old masonry for half a mile around the less disciplined and crazier rightsist gangs were attempting to cash in on recent embarrassments suffered by marengo north english and the call they were everywhere day and night often armed usually in the biggest crowds they could muster trying to appeal to the disenchantment swamping north englishs troops in the short run the rightsist movement was on a roll as the faintest of heart of the other races hit the road their stronger cousins became more cautious fringe rightsists were making themselves ever more menacing by riding the crest of a wave of fear not ameliorated by the relative restraint characteristic of the call but they were just more public not more numerous i thought the absence of the call from the streets would hasten the collapse of the more marginal radical crazy factions without the image of the call they couldnt maintain a credible camouflage of respectability rationality and patriotism i was sure their popular support would evaporate i expected the whole rightsist mess to collapse within a few months and i hoped recent emotional shocks were enough to keep marengo north english from pulling himself together before it was too late to keep his curdlebrained brother idealists from stumbling over the precipice of chaos it amazed me that nobody agreed with me even the dead man seemed convinced that the madness could only feed upon itself and grow worse instead of eating itself up the other races those who hadnt yet run for the boondocks contributed to the misapprehension with their bickering and fingerpointing id bet bondurant altoona and his cronies were feeling pretty cocky about their chances of replacing the call as the flagship goof troop but all that would change if i was right strange thing is the streets are actually safer today then ever before during my lifetime bizarre but true only the stupidest craziest most desperate crooks try anything with dedicated rightsists everywhere making sure the rest of us humans live up to their righteous standards anybody remember to invite pular singe morley asked he couldnt resist a smirk like it was all my fault that the ratgirl had outsmarted us i didnt invite anybody to anything i grumped i dont have anything to do with this whatever this might be its the chubby guys shindig i just live here i just own the place im going to go up and take a nap while you all party miss pular has been invited that mustve been some trick he was chairbound and could get word to her when i couldnt dig up anybody even willing to admit knowing her name during my infrequent outings she wouldnt come here shell be here morley crowed count on it which meant he was in on the dead mans scheme whatever that was she isnt your average rat morley you couldnt trick her that easily anyway we dont know that she had any luck robbing tama montezuma and outstanding luck that wouldve had to be tama montezuma was older smarter stronger more experienced harder and deadlier than the baddest ratperson around the hunt for the missing mistress was one undertaking the call had not deferred marengos snoops were everywhere he had told them tama had been the spy responsible for the failure of the cleansing and i would be amazed in the extreme to learn that he was wrong although sabotaging the cleansing might not have been her primary purpose she wouldve had to keep her changer allies posted and they wouldve jumped at the chance to embarrass the call morley showed me more pointy teeth than might one of venables babies after deciding that id make a nice snack i knew dotes meant to mention how disappointed tinnie and dean would be once i revealed my new infatuation with singe but he restrained himself so i would owe a moment of charity when i got even for the goddamn parrot dotes said she is smart garrett youre right and shes as cunning as a rat but weve both had ample opportunity to discover that brilliance alone wont protect you from what you dont know and what pular singe doesnt know is that the rumors shes been hearing are pure fairy dust what rumors hows she going to hear any rumors if shes hiding from reliance oh were counting on her being underground if she is she cant check out the stories what makes me think something has been going on behind my back intuition tempered by experience youre behind this whatre you trying to do to me old bones make you rich right after we save you from your dread terminal disease of course ask a foolish question what disease im healthy as a horse no healthy as something decent and sane a randy thunder lizard maybe no one outside this house knows that you have not been seen since the day you bearded mistress cardonlos shell come because she worships you garrett morley said still wrestling with inner mirth shell come because she wont be able to miss the opportunity to say goodbye shell come because despite what shes heard she doesnt really believe in this glob of carrion you call a partner i dont call him a partner he does far as im concerned hes just in the meantime morley said gleep and leapt into the air goosed by the glob of carrion he didnt come down the glob was not amused i grinned some enjoying his predicament i wondered if i could get him to take the goddamn parrot back in return for my good offices in getting his feet turned back around below his head and maybe even on the ground chuckles i dont have a clue what you expect to accomplish tonight sounds like youve been spreading rumors that im dying if im that sick why do i want a bunch of people cluttering up the place you want to say goodbye morley said hanging bottom up from the ceiling like some kind of prettyboy bat evidently didnt bother him much so youve asked some of the important people in your life to come visit one last time the pain and despair must be overwhelming me i cant remember why id invite marengo north english and lieutenant nagit but not saucerhead and winger and playmate all my minds will be employed fully i will have no attention left to monitor and prevent miss wingers miscreances nor did it seem likely that invitations to your real friends would attract nearly so much attention which maybe tells you something about the crowd you hang with garrett a crowd that includes you old buddy speaking of hanging around keep him up there chuckles dean see if you can find a stick well let morley be the piñata for this soiree dean had just come in with a disreputablelooking pair of chairs he must have found in an alley he considered morley i believe i saw something suitable in the cellar while i was recovering these chairs for once in his cranky old life he agreed with me dean our other guests will begin arriving shortly garrett play along for the time being morley turned over and drifted to the floor you shouldve let him have an extra gallon of beer last night a hangover might help even in this light he doesnt look like hes dying though any honest tailor would be overcome by grief after just one glance what will i be going along with if i dont go upstairs what do you hope to accomplish anyway i wish to locate miss montezuma i believe she is still in the city and i suspect that pular singe knows where she is hiding i believe that because she has broken her ties with reliance miss pular has been unable to take advantage of her knowledge i believe we can form an alliance beneficial to all of us if we can draw her close enough for me to initiate negotiations now i knew just enough to feel completely at sea and i got to ask no more questions because the dead mans guests began to arrive very nearly in a rush when lieutenant nagit came in as starched as a paradeground martinet he was in animated conversation with the redheaded despair of my life tinnie scarcely spared me a glance and a feeble wave which was no way to treat a dying man of course shed be in on the gag somehow shed been to the house enough to know that my health crisis must be somewhat exaggerated and since they werent loading me into a hearse i was fair game for torment which explained lieutenant nagit manvil gilbey managed a timely arrival accompanied by the expected brace of lovelies alyx looked as tasty as ever but nicks miss giorgi nicholas had made an effort miss giorgi nicholas must have left a trail of broken hearts all the way to my humble shanty miss giorgi nicholas looked like what the devil was dreaming about when he invented temptation and shed thrown an extra log on the flirtation fire tinnie ditched lieutenant nagit so fast his hair streamed in the breeze as she headed my way i suggest this as an opportune time to exercise extreme caution garrett go teach granny to suck eggs old bones tinnie arrived you look lovely tonight i managed to croak with one of my last few hundred dying breaths i dont want to see you even looking at that tramp which tramp would that be my sweet the lothario with the epaulets on his shoulders and the board strapped to his back exercise extreme caution garrett he did have a point nicks does clean up surprisingly nice but youll still outshine her on your worst day much better i knew i shouldve worn my hip boots peace had been declared for the moment whats this all about anyway youll have to take that up with the resident haunt i just found out im dying and you all are here to help me through it you look pretty healthy to me alyx said striking a little pose meant to test her hypothesis to my destruction ladies please ive only got a few thousand heartbeats left dont make me use them up in the next three minutes tinnie scowled at alyx alyx remained oblivious maybe that was how she was getting by these days by just not seeing anything she didnt want to see belinda made her appearance she too had taken some trouble though all that black still made her seem a gorgeous beast of prey after a somewhat cool greeting for me she fell into conversation with lieutenant nagit who had been worshipping nicks from across the room where had she gotten to gilbey edged close enough to observe you dont appear to be in any immediate danger im having one of my good spells check me again after the ladies go home and i have nothing more to live for that earned me a nail in the ribs from the handiest lady once again i had to explain that i had no idea what was going on gilbey nodded but didnt understand should you go into remission max wants you to oversee our interviews for replacement staff huh he decided to fire everyone who had anything to do with the conspiracy he wants to pick up some trustworthy replacements to do that were going to have to go outside and take on people we dont know max doesnt want to get stung again youll interview and youll background some of the candidates all that time cruising on retainer was back to haunt me again howd skibber kessel take it his nephew had been one of the villains in the stable back at the start of it all thinks we let the boy off easy skibber is loyal and he hates politics he hates anything that might interfere with his art good for skibber most people should understand that brewmasters are genuine artists the best brewmasters anyway dean showed colonel block into the room at that point i discovered morley missing that made two of them one of each persuasion one of whom was a rake and a rogue and a ruffian not in my house you tailors dummy what block had come over to offer his greetings if youre as weak as rumor says you shouldnt be getting excited i didnt need to anyway nicks came through the doorway lugging the goddamn parrot morley was right behind her but seemed chagrined was it possible his charm had failed him i need to live forever because the wonders never cease nicks had the oversize magpie perched on her left wrist the bird basked in her attention he didnt say a thing was his behavior one of those projects that would preoccupy the dead man tonight i told gilbey you tell max to say when ill be there i dont have anything else on my calendar gilbey glanced at tinnie sighed a little sigh to tell me i was hopeless turned to accept a glass of wine from dean colonel block told me we could always use your talents should you recover righteousness dont put food on the table howre my two favorite professional killers not real good they were in such bad shape we had to put them in the bledsoe sadler died from his wounds crask passed too but he might have had some help block looked belindas way as he said that an interesting family id like to get to know them better no you wouldnt miss contague and lieutenant nagit seemed to be hitting it off the dead man i noted was not a participant in anything he seemed to be sleeping but id been around him long enough to sense that he was anything but right now he was totally focused i said ill be upstairs if anyone needs me a dying man has to get his rest once i reached my room i lay down on my back tucked my hands behind my head and began systematically reviewing every encounter id ever had with marengo north english and my memory is very good there are ratpeople in the neighborhood i jumped i must have dozed off i listened his dinner party certainly hadnt gotten rowdy too many people with too many agendas for everybody to relax and have fun especially since everybody down there assumed that id had some sinister purpose for inviting them here i was confident that not even morley really believed that the whole thing wasnt my idea i am unable to penetrate a rat mind with sufficient finesse to remain undetected but i do sense at least three such minds out there all interested in this house i assume them to belong to pular singe and her confederates in defying the ratkind uncle some ratfolk call bosses like reliance uncle presumably because the bosses treat everyone like favorite nephews and nieces as long as they behave i did not ask the dead man why he figured singe would have accomplices that seemed selfevident somebody had to be helping her stay hidden had to be bringing her food and news and warnings fenibro would head my initial list of suspects but i suppose he would receive the same honor from reliance and thus would never be trusted by anyone as smart as singe it is time for you to stop sulking and rejoin our guests whose guests this aint my shindig chuckles come down here garrett your presence is required well if he was going to get nasty about it i drifted into the dead mans room as unobtrusively as a servant who didnt consider himself one of the family things seemed to be going fine without me though the merrymaking hadnt turned into a rowdy kegger on the way i had tested my office door and found it locked dean could do good work when he wanted following the meal dean had broken down his makeshift table and left folks free to circulate around the ground floor the dead man must be a better entertainer than i thought nobody had pulled out yet i stood back and observed not without company for long tinnie wriggled herself in under her arm you all right now i needed to figure something out did you no but thats probably because of my personal prejudices soon afterward manvil gilbey developed a strong need to get back to the weider mansion dragging two unhappy young women with him alyx and nicks had flourished under the gallantries of lieutenant nagit and morley dotes they werent quite ready for the game to stop even belinda had received some intriguing attention cautiously from colonel block and much less cautiously from the amazing mr gilbey whose inhibitions may have gotten a little assistance looking the other way so the evening was not a complete disaster despite poor sick old garrett not having come floating belly up it couldve gone on indefinitely had not the dead man lost interest next day the whole lot would be wondering what the hell it had been all about and their confusion would be all my fault of course i offered nicks another opportunity to take the wonder buzzard home but she passed again but you can bring him over to visit she suggested with husking voice and smouldering eye and just a hint of a mocking smile because the good ship tinnie tate away momentarily refreshing her teacup was closing fast under fulldress sail cutlasses flashing like lightning morley overheard the part where i offered the goddamn parrot he took the opportunity to remind me that parrots often live longer than human beings do a fact which amused him greatly i can see it now i said me and the crow in the clown suit still together fifty years from now living it up in heavens gate by then the bird and my socalled friends ought to have made me crankier than medford shale on his blackest day and a certain contentious old woman would come around every day to bang on the bars of the gate just in case i started to get comfortable or showed signs of beginning to enjoy myself youd better not be talking about me garrett tinnie declared im twentysix i like that just fine and im never going to get any older i was surprised she confessed she was that long in the tooth generally she admitted only to a half decade less and pulled it off pretty well im glad to hear it maybe youll keep me young too manvil i need you to do something ask max if he noticed anything unusual about north english when we saw him think about it yourself let me know right away if you think of anything what gilbey frowned suspiciously its probably nothing ive got a bee in my bonnet thats driving me crazy im eighty percent sure im wrong but im just as sure that i shouldnt be i think that answer is in north englishs behavior but the most unusual thing i can come up with myself is that he paid my fees without complaining ever still frowning gilbey nodded and resumed the difficult task of herding alyx and nicks toward the front door i turned to say good night to lieutenant nagit you overheard what i said youre around your boss all the time you notice anything unusual about him lately i know where youre going and youre way wrong but he frowned a long way from convinced there was something bothering him he confessed he does seem to have developed a strong spiritual streak since he dodged the reaper i can see how that might happen is he more social now that he doesnt have montezuma to talk for him no but i do see more of him because i have to did you find tollie did you identify that dead man no and no and good night nagit went away not happy at all then there was just morley and tinnie and belinda belinda was surprised to find herself on the front stoop with me as her coach rolled up almost as though someone had been reading minds she offered me a darkly suspicious look i turned on the boyish charm you knew it would be dangerous when you came here when you didnt have to come that touched her sense of humor she flashed a quick smile then swamped me in a brief impulsive hug that left tinnie tapping her toe they go off together morley asked as i closed the door no nagit might be just smart enough not to swim with the sharks i wouldnt be surprised if he didnt volunteer to make sure gilbey gets home safely though garrett it is time we moved to the final phase to do so i must have colonel block removed from the premises damn i almost forgot he was here the good guardsman had been making himself small perhaps hoping to find out what everyone was up to now and my brilliant associate would be interested in what the guard was up to what block himself might not know directly he could infer from experience and reference to other sources a modicum of respect at last the colonel im on it what about morley and tinnie mr dotes special skills may prove useful pular singe will not be the only observer in place though i have yet to detect any obvious watchers of course brother relway would have his eyes anywhere any pair of my guests crossed paths surely therell be no need for excitement that will hinge upon how badly the interested parties wish to gain control of pular singe or tama montezuma ah the ratgirl has summoned her courage and is approaching i suggest you see her in the kitchen i will ask miss tate and mr dotes to remain out of sight here with me what about dean he will have to answer the door singe might bolt if you do and she sees that your ill health has been exaggerated you set this whole thing up just to pull her in not just it was a tapestry a work in progress pular singes arrival is the final thread you learn anything while you were slithering around inside their heads i can figure things out im a skilled detective enough meaning youre not going to share not unless it becomes necessary singe is standing in front of the stoop she will find enough nerve to knock establish yourself in the kitchen how about the other watchers her showing up will excite them pular singe is invisible go to the kitchen try to look sick dean answer the door singe knocked as dean and i passed one another in the hall me wondering how much of that exchange morley and tinnie would recall later not a word they are enjoying a visit with mister big go to the kitchen i did my best to hunch over and look miserable as the sound of claws on wooden flooring rasped toward me dean was talking but the words coming out of his mouth definitely were not deanish damn that meant i would have to listen for a week while the old man pissed and moaned about the dead man taking control without asking i suggest you muster what charm you can garrett this child is more difficult than i anticipated i cannot examine her thoughts without alerting her to my interest i muttered im beginning to wonder just how much good you are seems everybodys opaque to you lately the kitchen door swung toward me i sipped tea but thought about getting together with some beer dean said heres mr garrett mr garrett its long past time i retired ill see you in the morning please remember to lock up i grumbled something uncharitable turned my head to look at singe i did not see singe not immediately i saw a bent old woman bundled in layer upon layer of rags the way some street folk do a huge ugly hat that could only be of dwarfish provenance cast a shadow deep enough to leave her face indefinite she must have bound her tail up behind her somehow because it wasnt out where it could be seen she leaned on a heavy cane which went a long way toward disguising the strange way ratpeople walk very good you amaze me yet again youre going to conquer the world tea something else theres beer you were expecting me i wasnt until a few minutes ago take a seat ratpeople can sit on their behinds although they find human furniture difficult associates of mine wanted you to come see me youre not dying this is a trap her karentine seemed to be improving by the hour she didnt have much more accent than winger now though her sibilants still gave her difficulty im not dying sorry to disappoint you on the other hand this isnt a trap you have my personal guarantee on that whatever anyone else might have had planned that was a clever trick you pulled on us last week maybe but foolish her l sounds still gave her trouble too i did not think through the consequences a common failing of my people a common failing of everybodys people go ahead sit she sat i patted her hand then poured her a cup of tea pushed across the pot of honey she showed manners enough not to gobble the stuff straight from the container her hand was unsteady as she drank her tea which she found difficult with a human cup i felt a little guilty even though this encounter was not of my manufacture she was smart enough to understand that her emotions had been manipulated which meant that they were no secret to those who had manipulated her which of course she would find embarrassing why did you want me here i reminded her that this was not of my doing but then admitted tama montezuma my associates believe you know where shes hiding singe sighed of course i whispered montezumas money means nothing to me except that i dont want it to get back to the kind of people who would use it to finance cruelty toward those they hate i am afraid you know very much afraid i did not foresee the interest others would show in finding that woman i thought that once she disappeared they would forget about her human people have very long memories singe particularly in regard to grudges which is a thought to keep in mind if youre ever about to cross someone that is a thought to keep in mind even if you are going to cross a nonhuman reliance i am told has been very bitter about my show of independence ill warn him not to be unreasonable do you know where tama montezuma is hiding she had to think about her answer it took her several minutes to decide to trust me and nod i didnt become restless waiting unlike other members of the household i was willing to accept whatever decision singe made i found it both amusing and a tad disturbing that the dead man couldnt snoop around inside her head at least not subtly undetected maybe she could teach me the trick yes i know where she is garrett will you show me am i wrong about you are you just after the money too like your darkelf friend up front she tapped her nose to tell me how she knew morley hes my friend but youre right you have to keep an eye on him he has his own agendas hes interested in tama mainly because of the money im interested because the things she did caused a lot of people to die some of them were people i was supposed to protect i cant let that go not even if i wanted to not even though i understand what made her do what she did she is very unhappy she has not moved since she entered the place where she is hiding now it was prepared ahead she can stay there a long time she cries a lot she sure cant wander the streets somebody would recognize her before she walked two blocks i had trouble imagining tama montezuma in tears they must be on her own behalf she has disguises but she is waiting for a time when she is mostly forgotten my look caused her to add she talks to herself out loud i found a way to get close enough to listen that is where i have been hiding most of the time fenibro and reliance himself came here looking for you several times theyve been at the palms nagging morley too uncle will have to accept what he cannot change she shuddered yes i will take you there i want morley to go along ill keep his greed under control he will be disappointed anyway and the copperhaired woman hunh she is in that room with the darkelf and the bird and something else with an odor like death buried deep she was at the mansion where the shapeshifters were caught what is her part a very neutral response was in order i suspected a friend of long standing who heard the rumors you had and came here the same as the others tonight she wont join us i hoped tinnie made some strange choices when the mood took her and she was hard to dissuade she just hadnt left yet when you came to the door no telling what was going on inside singes head she accepted my explanation for the moment i suggest you be on your way before she changes her mind do not dawdle exiting the neighborhood i will bewilder and confuse any watchers but i can manage that only for a few seconds certainly less than a minute i grunted grumpily any watchers would want to follow me not the ragged crone singe made an unhappy noise too whats the matter i was dizzy for a second it was like there was a buzzing inside my head hunh she had some slight psychic sense too amazing quite a comedown from a manor in the country morley observed the structure before us wasnt abandoned but certainly deserved to be there was no charitable way to consider it fit for human occupation we stood in shadow waiting while singe shed her disguise i mused but its probably the kind of place she lived before she found out what she could do with what nature gave her and went to work on tunfaire where the streets are paved with gold everyone comes to tunfaire to find their fortune mostly the survivors find despair but there are just enough success stories to keep the gullible coming fools gold ready singe whispered follow me she darted from cover to cover her true nature guiding her the goddamn parrot fluttered across high enough to be heard only not seen scouting from above morley and i followed the ratgirl dotes continued grumbling about not being allowed to bring along any of his friends from the palms i stopped listening we practically stumbled over a trio of ogre teenagers one of each sex who were way out of their territory and almost certainly up to no good themselves they never saw singe they turned tail quickly once they glimpsed the equipment morley and i were carrying i decided i had yet another reason for wringing the goddamn parrots neck what the hell kind of scouting was he doing he shouldve warned us the encounter did shut morley up which wouldve happened anyway he shows no lack of concentration when the situation gets tight we took the rat route inside no front door we wriggled through a huge gap in a broken foundation that placed us inside a cluttered stinking cellar so dark even morley couldnt see and had to be guided to a rickety stair by singe she murmured stay close to the wall especially you garrett it might not take your weight otherwise sounded like she was trying to crack wise she needed practice maybe id let her work with the goddamn parrot the stairs groaned in protest i sneezed despite a struggle to avoid that morley was having trouble with the musty air too i wondered why we hadnt just come in using the people route maybe id ask later maybe the simple thing hadnt occurred to singe were all creatures of habit tama montezuma was multitalented but being a light sleeper didnt appear to be amongst her skills moreover she snored like a drunken boatswain that seemed way out of character the memory of a cloying sweetish odor hung on the air as singe struck a spark to light a lamp for my benefit i recognized that smell burnt opium opium smoking is an uncommon vice in tunfaire its an expensive dangerous indulgence in an area where far cheaper safer substitutes will whack your brain just as far around sideways and leave you drooling and acting even more stupid i had seen nothing to suggest she was an addict but many addicts do function quite well much of the time if they have money the light revealed a woman who had fallen apart not at all the tama montezuma i had encountered at the pipes this tama had fled all the way back to her roots and beyond in almost no time this wasnt the tama everybody wanted to find this was a tama overcome by despair a tama who had no more reason to live this was a tama who couldnt possibly have a stolen fortune hidden you could have taken her morley murmured to singe you didnt need our help he looked at me i could see the same thoughts flaring behind his eyes as were exploding behind mine yes but it did not seem there was anything to be gained our talk roused tama she struggled to sit up she hadnt been eating well or keeping herself clean she managed to look up at me you finally got here im a little slow singe had to come fetch me i didnt tell her i hadnt been looking she reached for her pipe morley pushed it out of reach if she was addicted she would cooperate more fully if he kept that carrot dangling just out of reach morley said get a ring on singes finger before she gets any older or cleverer garrett she played not just you but the dead man this time wouldnt have a coin on you would you shes wearing a silver wristlet so is the woman so was the woman they werent shapechangers tama you want to tell me something the fortune everyone thinks i got i didnt they knew they found it it wasnt where it was supposed to be when i got there tamas eyes wouldnt focus but her brain seemed sharp enough they only left the silver i took and the opium i bought as an investment they expect me to destroy myself for them i had a mind like a razor tonight i saw the answer shed give me before i asked but i asked anyway and who might they be the shapeshifters the dragons maybe but i didnt think so more likely the wolves hoping tama would think dragons and point a finger that way when she got caught why would the dragons leave opium behind it has value even it its not popular it can be exported theres a good market in venageta but you got all of the shifters didnt you morley asked me in as close to a whine as id ever heard pass his lips no we missed at least one for a while i thought that one might be north english i figured he really did die the night he was attacked it had taken only a slight adjustment of viewpoint coupled with recollections of odd behavior particularly at the weider place when marengo steadfastly avoided joining the rest of us on the main floor to make me intensely suspicious id decided he mustve wanted to avoid running into singe and her marvelous nose thered been other indicators too but once i cleared my head lay back considered nothing else id been forced to conclude that the marengo who had returned to the pipes the morning after the aborted cleansing could not have been a shapeshifter much as i might want to stick him with something but i was just as sure that he was supposed to have been killed that he was supposed to have been replaced after he was attacked that he was supposed to return home apparently badly injured as a means of covering and explaining the differences betrayed by the replacement as he took control of the call i had a feeling he might have gone into seclusion temporarily while tama montezuma relayed his orders to everyone exactly as she had done with the brotherhood of the wolf i had a strong suspicion that marengos bacon really did get saved by marauding dwarves contemplation of which irony ranged alongside various betrayals by supposed true believers explained north englishs newfound spirituality only i couldnt quite buy that either maybe because it didnt satisfy my prejudices maybe because there were still loose ends i kept telling myself that there are always loose ends where there are people involved nothing ever wraps up neatly truth becomes more elusive than leprechauns hell ive downed a few beers with leprechauns truth when i run into it often is dressed up in a cunning disguise this is new i told tama gesturing at her opium paraphernalia pushing her pipe a little farther when she reached for it again was marengo supposed to be replaced the night he was attacked you knew about the shapeshifters didnt you you were already working for glory mooncalled by then she tried to ignore my questions by focusing on her addiction she continued to try for the pipe i could almost hear it talking to her she whined they forced me they knew what i was planning gerris must have told them she showed no contrition as she confirmed my suspicions by adding gerris thought he was going to go with me when i went away it was you outside the weider front door the night genord killed lancelyn mac it struck me like a lightning bolt of course tama nodded gerris figured it out he was extremely upset we were arguing then the cripple and the other one appeared and gerris made up a stupid story to cover himself but the one who came to the door saw me i didnt take them seriously enough they did this to me to get even by they you mean genords friends right the brotherhood of the wolf i intended to take her confession with a twelvepound grain of salt the woman was a professional liar and now at that stage where she would try to lay the blame on anyone she could make fit marengo made up with them after he almost got killed they were thrilled they were ready to do anything tama dont bother your heads not clear enough you cant make up believable stories marengo couldnt have made up with the wolves he was far too angry with them what theyd done could destroy all his work it could destroy the call he didnt know anything for sure until that last night at the weider mansion but ill bet he had some strong suspicions not exactly on the mark because he was terrified by perilous spite but close enough to worry you when did glory mooncalled recruit you im sure you didnt fight hard then you got your talons into him exactly the way you had marengo and gerris and your other accomplices didnt you a spark of honesty men are such idiots garrett especially older men a point a good point i propose the thesis that the span of time during which a man can be manipulated via his appreciation of a woman shrinks as he ages because eventually when hes been through it a few times reality sets in ever more swiftly after the initial rush you say the wolves did this to you yes of course there were wolves out there who hadnt been captured who hadnt been sought and more who had been released when the rest of the hill turned on perilous spite just minutes ago you said the dragons took everything they did before things fell apart the wolves found me and did this to me and then hid me here so marengo wouldnt find me until it was too late could i believe this any more than her claim that north english and the wolves had gotten back into bed singe touched my arm lightly the opium is their revenge tama began to weep her hands wouldnt stay still i made a mistake once long ago when life was very cruel i told gerris about howd id broken the habit afterward but i still craved it almost every day when the wolves came they knew they forced me in gerris name it took them very little time to get me going again but they left me only this much opium and only this much money so when the opium runs out and craving gets so bad i start throwing up and suffering cramps and screaming about things coming after me out of my memories ill have to go out looking for an opium seller that time isnt far off now and i dont know any opium sellers it will take me a while to find one it will take marengo less time to find me i dont expect him to be in a forgiving mood that rang true but a lot of people were looking for tama montezuma not just marengo north english and tama montezuma stood out somebody would get her avengers try to be as cruel as their imaginations allow not many softhearted men survive to become the breed who make up groups like the wolves what about glory mooncalled and his friends i dont know he must have run away the wolves theyre going to destroy marengo because they think he betrayed them because the lying weasel really did keep them together and did send them underground then he never did anything with them i was using them when i gave them orders singe thought you should know i dont care anymore tunfaire can burn to the ground the world will end when i die anyway morley muttered a solipsist in despair interesting i still care singe told her i wondered how much of this the dead man knew or had reasoned out without bothering to tell me i also wondered why so many people had been able to dodge around his nibs was he starting to fail or was it just the way the dice had come up the unlikely does happen my life is a testament to that possibility how many of those changers were there morley asked do you have any idea how many are still running around loose tama shrugged her hands remained busy crawling all over her but her eyes had glazed over we werent going to get anything more from her until shed smoked a pipe and then had had time to ease back out from behind a veil of dreams that were sweeter than life dotes muttered well end up all having to wear silver amulets if this doesnt get wrapped up soon he had a point i didnt have to invest much imagination to foresee a future in which if the shifters reproduced successfully a silver test would be part of every transaction every home that could afford them would have silver and spells worked into its doorways the price of silver would soar well find out i know wholl know the dead man had been inside glory mooncalleds head mooncalled wouldve known exactly how many shapeshifters had come to tunfaire we could work it out from there what shall we do with her morley asked singe watched me with big eyes as though this was some kind of test i had a feeling i would disappoint her i still owe max weider she chose the targets she sent the killers i considered my first night at the pines that night visitor with the knife might have been carter stockwell thinking about settling up might have been but it might have been tama montezuma with a special surprise for the troublesome fellow who turned up just as she was about to take over the call completely separate bedrooms eh i owed that little sneak tinnie an extra kiss no telling what id have gotten myself into if she hadnt been there right now miss montezuma looked like the ideal gift for a friend in the secret policeman racket nor did morley demur she no longer having any fiscal capacity for arousing his sympathy singe did feel for her as for a sister in despair but even she wasnt prepared to excuse the evils tama had wrought of which those known to us were likely to be only a fraction i sent a note asking lieutenant nagit to visit me when next his duties brought him into the city i received a polite formal reply to the effect that he was under instructions to have nothing further to do with me insofar as marengo north english and the call were concerned we had nothing to say to one another anymore i didnt try again i took it up with max while i was helping interview prospective employees morley tagged along and stood around looking bored probably because what i was doing was as dull as watching rocks mate nicks sent lieutenant nagit an invitation to dine with the weiders to no ones surprise but hers nagit not only showed up he arrived early polished till he shone reeking of rosewater a bouquet of posies in hand he was less than thrilled to discover that hed share the dinner table with me and my feathered haunt but chose to endure the bad with the good the goddamn parrot attached himself to nicks as soon as i went over to the mansion early in the afternoon they were made for each other those two why couldnt they see it themselves nagit never scowled once at tinnie or alyx he didnt know what to make of morley since theyd never been introduced morley paid him no attention dotes was charming to alyx and all her male relatives nagit had no trouble with max or gilbey or ty either so it had to be the way i parted my hair or something but he was coldly courteous to me at best the servants brought dinner all at once instead of in courses then withdrew except for neersa bintor who made sure the kitchen door stayed closed she kept her giant maul in hand there was little conversation while we ate though the lovely ladies all tried to get something going each in her own unique way max growled get on with it garrett hed barely nibbled his venison and had touched nothing else at all i made a small gesture morley excused himself from the table he and neersa bintor left the room with no apology for tricking him i said mr nagit we have one final problem one more shapeshifter to expose now that he had demonstrated that he could eat using real silverware off real silver plates process of elimination says its inside the call now for a while i thought it had replaced your boss then i decided it hadnt youve just demonstrated that it couldnt be you yes boss max had begun to glower he wanted me to get on with it i said if it wasnt marengo i wouldnt much care except that having a shapechanger inside the call means glory mooncalled still has a foothold there a reliable witness tells me that mooncalled has become an evil old man with terrible plans this shifter could help mooncalled do truly wicked things to tunfaire then i realized that even though marengo hadnt been replaced by a shifter the way id worked it out at first back when he was attacked he still couldve been later at the pipes in the last week or so but why should i care marengo is mr weiders friend they went through the cantard together and max is my frjend so i arranged to get you here so i could fill your head with my suspicions you can deal with the threat to the friend of my friend you can find the last shapeshifter the one who left us wondering what happened to tollie and the onemitted thunderlizard lover venable morley and neersa ushered tama and singe and a short incredibly ugly little woman into the room montezuma was more frightened than the ratgirl was she had been in the clutches of the guard for twenty hours with nary a whiff of opium the short woman pretended to be a terrified servant of some sort nobody bothered to explain her presence i stifled a grin relway made one truly repulsive woman but hed insisted that he couldnt loan out his prisoner if he couldnt come along himself i hadnt had the nerve to disappoint the head of the secret police particularly when i had no good reason to shut him out i do believe he nurtured some idea of making a connection and being invited to the pipes with lieutenant nagit nagit never noticed relway he blurted you found montezuma how we never caught a trace somebody out your way sure did ed some of the wolves whod gotten a word or two from gerris genord remember they werent wiped out either nobody had a big enough grudge hell the wolves were heroes to a lot of men whose minds followed the same paths theirs did good old bondurant altoona was publicly very vocal about the treachery of the call altoona might have profited more had he not been blessed with the personality of a toad i told nagit the whole story the way i saw it now and added tama says shell cooperate reluctantly she was a survivor the only way she might get out of the pit she was in now would be to help save a man who might then hunt her for the rest of his days i asked nagit hows your status with north english its weak i know too much hes reminded of that every time he sees me but he does still talk to me he doesnt have a choice until he finds somebody dumb enough to want my job i dont believe hes been replaced figure out how we could be alone with him long enough to check his reaction to silver if we have to meantime tell him whatever he wants to know and you could isolate your senior officers and check them one at a time that shouldnt be difficult the real trick will be dealing with the shifter if you find him nagit shook his head he didnt want to hear it there is one out there ed has to be otherwise tollie would still be chasing sheep and mr venable would only be short the one hand nagit rose he made appropriate remarks concerning his invitation and the quality of the meal he bowed in neersas direction to let her know he knew who was responsible for the latter then he asked can i take montezuma weider said no like it was his call he was grim in his heart max had convicted marengo of being a changeling already the wounded max within was looking for somebody to share his pain nagit didnt argue he did remark the boss will be disappointed max observed mr nagit should you find that your employment with marengo has become too honorous for your conscience dont hesitate to contact manvil we can find a place for a man of your caliber dont you think garrett i cant see any objection to that well except for a sudden sparkle in alyxs eye and a little smile nicks failed to keep corralled and a dig in the ribs in the same old sore spot that i got for noticing those responses and maybe turning just the faintest bit dour nagit headed for the street door relway went after him i didnt hear anything he said but i assumed he was selling himself somehow while nagit was distracted by a headful of horrible possibilities satisfactory i asked weider satisfactory im going to turn in now as gilbey rose to help max he said well be continuing those interviews tomorrow garrett you and ty will need to make yourselves available directly after sunrise he smirked he knew well my feelings about that godsforsaken chunk of the day forced in before the sun is sensibly standing directly overhead the goddamn parrot laughed and laughed i just sighed nobody promised me the world would be fair or even a little sane i thought that would be the end of it as dramatically unsatisfactory as it seemed i judged nagit to be the sort who would save me the trouble id set myself up for just to keep everything inside the calls goofball family but life mine anyway doesnt come stocked with a surplus of dramatic unity i resigned myself to the boredom of posing trick questions to men interested in replacing workers dismissed from the brewery everybody in town wanted to work for max weider but halfway through the third day of tedium following that dinner the gloom parted when giorgi nicholas stepped forth for no better reason than wanting to see me or maybe just to visit my stylish shoulder accessory i concluded when her killer smile and sparking eyes seemed to be aimed off center of what i considered the appropriate target she extended her hand i started to take it this came hidden inside a note i got from ed nagit its addressed to you it might be important the goddamn parrot began charming her as she started scratching his head i made a growling noise she was getting letters from nagit now brother ed wasnt wasting any time lieutenant nagit wanted to meet he offered suggestions as to how we could manage that without distressing colonel theverly whose influence in the call had swollen substantially lately theverly had strong ideas about how a freecorps should be run those included excluding contacts with outsiders as questionable as me be those business or social i might be dressed in human flesh but the true believers could smell the other hidden inside me i assume youll be answering your own mail tell him ill meet him there it was a nice autumn day big hunks of cotton cruised around a deep blue sky the birds and bees were extravagantly cheerful and the temperature was almost perfectly comfortable it was almost possible to forget this was morning that half of the day the gods laid on us as punishment for original sin lieutenant nagit awaited me in that same pasture where tinnie and i had hidden from the centaurs who had been only yesterday finally discovered by cavalry supported by several sorcerers off the hill official tunfaire had a big hunt on for the dead mans onetime role model glory mooncalled too i was sure nothing would come of it that old man had been running his enemies in circles for decades thanks for coming nagit told me how could i resist his note insisted he had identified the last shapeshifter but claimed he couldnt do anything about it without help and he wouldnt name names why not handle this inhouse i had an overdressed dwarf turkey riding one shoulder and a fullgrown shrike of paranoia nesting on the other colonel theverly insists the matter is closed very pointedly theres no one else i can ask for help out here they all want to believe its over they want to get on with the mission and they especially dont want to catch theverlys eye by doing something hes forbidden what about you hes a pain in the ass not a god a declarative statement which seemed somehow evasive lieutenant nagit had something on his mind and didnt want to share gee i never ran into that phenomenon before why me because you could bring her he indicated tama montezuma whom i had borrowed back from the guard by sweettalking colonel block and making several promises i have no intention of keeping and with her along we can get to the changer before anybody reacts he was right about that he definitely held back on me nobody challenged us at the gateway to the pipes even though an increase in security had been mounted nor did anyone prevent us from entering the house there was a lot of gawking and whispering and finger pointing because of tama though montezuma looked worse than she had when i found her winger wouldve said she looked like death on a stick well warmed over her will had collapsed in the cruel torment of withdrawal she had little reason to go on but shed been lucky in a way relway hadnt been around to abuse her i didnt go in there with nerves of steel i had only tama and nagit to count on and no faith that either would stand behind me i was betting to an inside straight and moms garrett had taught me better over twenty years ago was lieutenant nagit conning me or worse the man was a true believer in the raging lunacies of the call he shared a domicile with numerous gentlemen who bore me huge grudges id seen several familiar wolf faces already then came a shock that flipped the old pump we ran into the ugly little woman who looked so much like deal relways twin sister scrub scrub scrubbing the hallway floor lieutenant nagit considered her beneath notice even though it was his fault she was haunting the manor apparent inconsequence is relways great and frightening strength the man guarding marengos sanctum didnt quite know what to do when lieutenant nagit stomped past without bothering to ask to see north english the fellow must have been a soldier in his earlier days marines are taught to think on their feet we were through the doorway before he reacted as lieutenant nagit had promised as we walked there were several men cozied up with north english one was my old skipper colonel theverly who still didnt remember me another was the gent who had spoken for the wolves at weiders what was his name tilde evidently he was back in good odor there were others all elderly great i didnt see a spry bodyguard anywhere around our advent interrupted a heated discussion a frustrated theverly wanted north english to approve something operational north english seemed unable or unwilling to grasp the fact that this was the perfect moment for whatever the colonel had in mind i did catch the weider name though there was a lot of anger in the air it blistered in north englishs eyes he surged out of his chair about to vent that rage on whatever idiot had dared to enter his sanctum uninvited he saw tama he froze there couldnt have been anyone he less expected to see we kept moving lieutenant nagit said see what mr garrett caught i was sure youd want to see her right away uh yes confused and puzzled as well as angry north english finished rising and fear began to drive earlier emotions off his face that seemed to shimmer momentarily as he gawked at tama maybe that was a trick of flickering bad candlelight or of my imagination theverly tilde and the old men gawked too they hadnt expected to see tama montezuma again which effect was exactly what lieutenant nagit wanted her to produce tilde seemed almost distraught was it possible that tamas hoard hadnt found its way back into the loving embrace of the chieftain who had denied the wolves repeatedly i shoved tama forward she fell at north englishs feet he would be target the first tama played her role flawlessly she was a superb actress her skills honed in a harsh school i couldnt have pushed her around if she hadnt been willing to cooperate tama lunged into marengos legs he squawked flung himself backward colonel theverly had an impulse to help north english but he couldnt manage much on one leg he would be target two chosen so because of his handicap i kept an eye on him because the way id worked it out he was more likely a villain than north english despite my prejudicial preferences lieutenant nagit surprised me by slipping a silverchain noose over marengos head he got behind north english i grabbed marengos right arm tama caught his left and held on for dear life which was about all she could expect to get out of this nagit had scammed me mildly i hadnt thought he believed his boss was the shifter but he had started murmuring a mantra of a prayer that hed figured this correctly if he hadnt he was going to wish he was doing his time in hell already with me right across the dining pit saying please pass the brimstone when this was over i was going to kick his scruffy butt he couldve given me a little more to go on if i needed to change my mind again as nagit had hoped north englishs companions remained so stunned they did nothing for the vital few seconds it took him to get marengo under control a long moan escaped north english he shimmered began to get soft spongy loose and i knew for sure now that max weider had yet another loss to mourn and i had to go back and tell him and i had to go back and think all the evidence through yet again because id been ready to give north english a pass despite his odd behavior when did his replacement occur the old men began to babble in confusion as it became obvious that their boss not only wasnt mama north englishs beloved son he was one of them one of the other races north english gave one violent surge then just lost control he strained to change but couldnt manage it in any useful way silver poisoning caused his body to grow more and more limp by the time tilde managed a lame effort to pull tama away the arm she held had stretched two feet marengos face had waxmelted into something not human at all it looked like a giant slugs head i used a foot to push tilde away said find more silver soldier anything silver theverly kept hopping and i kept watching him closely a glare was enough to control the old men the paranoia id brought with me began to whisper of the possibility that there were still more shifters to be found i was developing the suspicion that i might spend the remainder of my life as worried about changelings as i was about horses in a few strange years i could be one of those street prophets who screech doom and despair and weird conspiracy at the most embarrassing times the marengo changer didnt fight with the ferocity and vigor wed seen from others earlier maybe he was young not yet at his full strength and wickedness maybe hed worn himself out passing as marengo maybe it was because he was alone the last of his kind lacking the psychic support of fellow changers he had sunk to the floor before tilde and the old men began to jabber about the implications this had for the call i held on shaking wondering what insanity had put me here i couldnt imagine myself committing deliberate murder even though that was the custom in these situations i felt the changer weakening losing its plasticity soon it just lay there shivering i kept that eye on colonel theverly every second his gaze locked with mine i let go the shifter with one hand plucked my own silver chain from inside my shirt id brought it just in case i hadnt wanted to reveal it theverlys face changed but only into a slight frown i should know you from somewhere shouldnt i yeah you should the islands campaign i couldnt find a sir inside me anywhere ah i was there only a few three force black petes bunch sergeant peters you were the kid who could find a girl anywhere even in the middle of an uninhabited swamp garrith garrett shucks he was embarrassing me did i pass garrett no changer couldve learned all that i nodded the door opened a butler type with a refreshments tray invited himself into the room damn my eyes i muttered what a clever pose for a mastermind the tea you requested sir mooncalleds eyes bugged as he took in the scene the tea service crashed and splashed through clenched teeth i told anyone who cared to listen grab him thats glory mooncalled hes the one behind everything thats gone wrong theverly responded instantly unfortunately the race seldom goes to the onelegged man the old man was spry he was out of there before anyone else made up his mind that i might be right they were just getting their minds around the fact that marengo north english wasnt marengo north english anymore and tilde was handicapped by his opinion of colonel theverly who tried to order him to get after mooncalled that old man hit the hallway and vanished into thin air never to be seen again even now i dont quite accept relways assurances that the man didnt change shape as soon as he was out of our sight relway isnt what i call an unimpeachable witness but the dead man also insists mooncalled was no shapechanger however it hasnt exactly been that long since the world proved that his nibs can be fooled too no matter like tama montezuma glory mooncalled is a survivor but hes definitely out of business now we didnt finish strangling the shapeshifter once lieutenant nagit got a good controlling choke on the thing and had breath of his own left to gasp out a few words he started lobbying tilde and theverly alike his chatter became a constant in the background like a ringing in the ear eventually he won his point his mutiny was excused but theverly and the wolf having formed an alliance without a word being spoken insisted on taking possession of the changer both men looked like they had a score or two to settle both were wondering just how long this thing had been managing and manipulating the movement i didnt tell them it couldnt have been more than a few days already it was their messiah of misfortune assuming the blame for every screwup in the last three millennia damn if they were clever enough they could gain back everything the call had lost and more by playing the existence of the changer off against rightsist prejudice you could see theverly and tilde evolving the way humans do when huge changes in their power ecology occur i made a small sign to tama i let go of the shifters nowrubbery flaccid limb its all yours now ed i grabbed tamas hand time we made ourselves scarce darling let this family clean its own house next time youre in town ed if youve got nothing better to do come by the house well round up tinnie and nicks and go out to this romantic little ethnic place i know maybe i could find a place that served stuffed roast parrot ill look forward to it tama and i hit the hallway i pushed hard getting out of the house heading across that big pasture out front i whispered keep moving woman get as big a head start as you can nobody else promised you anything actually nagit had but wed all known that he was lying you going to keep your promise i always try to no matter what even if id rather not because my word is really the only thing ive got to sell we were moving fast headed toward the gate all id ever really offered her was a running start if our paths crossed again id pick up my grudge on behalf of the weiders instantly i wouldnt have any overriding obligation to society as the dead man had argued in our discussions of marengo im not much on remorse garrett but i do regret that what happened happened it wasnt planned for what thats worth its not worth much but i do understand im going to have a regret or six when i look back on all this myself maybe well have better luck in the next life maybe see you there tama turned south after we left the estate broke into a longlegged groundeating lope i turned north never the twain to meet but meet something i did in just a quarter mile it looked a whole lot like deal relway in drag he must have been planning a party because he had a whole lot of friends with him i observed i take it youve given up the day job how had he gotten out here with all these secret police thugs i hoped he didnt have some dumb idea about trying to raid the pipes those people up there were confused but they wouldnt be shy about burying a few nosy guardsmen in the back pasture then my paranoia returned there were lots of secret policemen and only one garrett and i was handicapped by the weight of the worlds premier talking chicken but relway just wanted to chat soon as you exposed north english as a changer i knew there wasnt much future in scrubbing his floors nobody else in the call can hold that mob together i got out and waited out here i never did see what his followers saw thats because youre a cynic and a pessimist functionally incapable of believing in anything bigger than yourself the goddamn parrot began to snicker like hed just heard a potent offcolor joke bird you and me and a roasting pan got a threeway date when we get home relway mused now that its happened im not so sure im happy with the outcome spared their racial theories the call wouldve been good for tunfaire he would appreciate their interest in law and order and proper behavior heres a challenge you still need to meet glory mooncalled hes weak now but hes still out there somewhere if you dont get him now hell try to put something back together someday he cant help himself its still great day for tunfaire garrett one of pure triumph i dont know if he meant that or was being sarcastic you never quite know anything with relway and he wants it that way i liked the way you put it garrett faded steel heat id mentioned that to him the night hed discovered the tanks in the old lamp brewery but the war goes on the war never ends tell you what send me a note when you do decide to roast that pigeon ive got dibs on a drumstick ha you hear that bird your times almost up help please dont hurt me anymore chuckling relway said dont forget to pick up your rat friend on your way home huh the guys say shes hanging around in those trees over there lurking and skulking general rodent stuff probably worrying about you wouldve been amazing to see her try to rescue you from all those thunder lizards and rathaters the goddamn parrot had a good laugh at that i couldnt think of a thing to say then or when i did see singe lifes a bitch but it does go on
