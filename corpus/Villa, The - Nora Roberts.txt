 prologue on the night he was murdered bernardo baptista dined simply on bread and cheese and a bottle of merlot the wine was a bit young and bernardo was not neither would continue to age like his bread and cheese bernardo was a simple man he had lived in the same little house in the gentle hills north of venice since his marriage fiftyone years before his five children had been raised there his wife had died there now at seventythree bernardo lived alone with most of his family a stones throw away at the edges of the grand giambelli vineyard where he had worked since his youth he had known la signora since her girlhood and had been taught to remove his cap whenever she passed by even now if tereza giambelli traveled from california back to the castello and vineyard she would stop if she saw him and they would talk of the old days when her grandfather and his had worked the vines signore baptista she called him respectfully he had great appreciation for la signora and had been loyal to her and hers the whole of his life for more than sixty years he had taken part in the making of giambelli wine there had been many changes some good in bernardos opinion some not so good he had seen much some thought too much the vines lulled into dormancy by winter would soon be pruned arthritis prevented him from doing much of the hand work as he once had but still he would go out every morning to watch his sons and grandsons carry on the tradition a baptista had always worked for giambelli and in bernardos mind always would on this last night of his seventythree years he looked out over the vines his vines seeing what had been done what needed to be done and listened as the december wind whistled through the bones of the grape from the window where that wind tried to sneak he could see the skeletons as they made their steady climb up the rises they would take on flesh and life with time and not wither as a man did such was the miracle of the grape he could see the shadows and shapes of the great castello which ruled those vines and ruled those who tended them it was lonely now in the night in the winter when only servants slept in the castello and the grapes had yet to be born he wanted the spring and the long summer that followed it when the sun would warm his innards and ripen the young fruit he wanted as it seemed he always had one more harvest bernardo ached with the cold deep in the bones he considered heating some of the soup his granddaughter had brought to him but his annamaria was not the best of cooks with this in mind he made do with the cheese and sipped the good fullbodied wine by his little fire he was proud of his lifes work some of which was in the glass that caught the firelight and gleamed deep deep red the wine had been a gift one of many given to him on his retirement though everyone knew the retirement was only a technicality even with his aching bones and a heart that had grown weak bernardo would walk the vineyard test the grapes watch the sky and smell the air he lived for wine he died for it he drank nodding by the fire with a blanket tucked around his thin legs through his mind ran images of sunwashed fields of his wife laughing of himself showing his son how to support a young vine to prune a mature one of la signora standing beside him between the rows their grandfathers had tended signore baptista she said to him when their faces were still young we have been given a world we must protect it and so they had the wind whistled at the windows of his little house the fire died to embers and when the pain reached out like a fist squeezing his heart to death his killer was six thousand miles away surrounded by friends and associates enjoying a perfectly poached salmon and a fine pinot blanc part one the pruning a man is a bundle of relations a knot of roots whose flower and fruitage is the world ralph waldo emerson chapter one contents prev next the bottle of castello di giambelli cabernet sauvignon auctioned for one hundred and twentyfive thousand five hundred dollars american a great deal of money sophia thought for wine mixed with sentiment the wine in that fine old bottle had been produced from grapes harvested in the year cezare giambelli had established the castello di giambelli winery on a hilly patch of land north of venice at that time the castello had been either a con or supreme optimism depending on your point of view cezares modest house and little stone winery had been far from castlelike but his vines had been regal and he had built an empire from them after nearly a century even a superior cabernet sauvignon was likely more palatable sprinkled on a salad rather than drunk but it wasnt her job to argue with the man with the money her grandmother had been right as always they would pay and richly for the privilege of owning a piece of giambelli history sophia made a note of the final bid and the buyers name though she was unlikely to forget either for the memo she would send to her grandmother when the auction was over she was attending the event not only as the public relations executive who had designed and implemented the promotion and catalogue for the auction but as the giambelli family representative at this exclusive precentennial event as such she sat quietly in the rear of the room to observe the bidding and the presentation her legs were crossed in a long elegant line her back conventschool straight she wore a black pinstriped suit tailored and italian that managed to look both businesslike and utterly feminine it was exactly the way sophia thought of herself her face was sharp a triangle of pale gold dominated by large deepset brown eyes and a wide mobile mouth her cheekbones were icepick keen her chin a diamond point sculpting a look that was part pixie part warrior she had deliberately ruthlessly used her face as a weapon when it seemed most expedient tools she believed were meant to be used and used well a year before shed had her waistlength hair cut into a short black cap with a spiky fringe over her forehead it suited her sophia knew exactly what suited her she wore the single strand of antique pearls her grandmother had given her for her twentyfirst birthday and an expression of polite interest she thought of it as her fathers boardroom look her eyes brightened and the corners of her wide mouth curved slightly as the next item was showcased it was a bottle of barolo from the cask cezare had named di tereza in honor of her grandmothers birth this private reserve carried a picture of tereza at ten on the label the year the wine had been deemed sufficiently aged in oak and bottled now at sixtyseven tereza giambelli was a legend whose renown as a vintner had overshadowed even her grandfathers this was the first bottle of this label ever offered for sale or passed outside the family as sophia expected bidding was brisk and spirited the man sitting beside sophia tapped his catalogue where the photograph of the bottle was displayed you have the look of her sophia shifted slightly smiled first at him a distinguished man hovering comfortably somewhere near sixty then at the picture of the young girl staring seriously out from a bottle of red in his catalogue thank you marshall evans she recalled real estate second generation fortune she made it her business to know the names and vital statistics of wine buffs and collectors with deep pockets and sterling taste id hoped la signora would attend todays auction shes well very but otherwise occupied the beeper in her jacket pocket vibrated vaguely annoyed with the interruption sophia ignored it to watch the bidding her eyes scanned the room noting the signals the casual lift of a finger from the third row brought the price up another five hundred a subtle nod from the fifth topped it in the end the barolo outdistanced the cabernet sauvignon by fifteen thousand and she turned to extend her hand to the man beside her congratulations mr evans your contribution to the international red cross will be put to good use on behalf of giambelli family and company i hope you enjoy your prize theres no doubt of it he took her hand lifted it to his lips i had the pleasure of meeting la signora many years ago shes an extraordinary woman yes she is perhaps her granddaughter would join me for dinner this evening he was old enough to be her father but sophia was too european to find that a deterrent another time shed have agreed and no doubt enjoyed his company im sorry but i have an appointment perhaps on my next trip east if youre free ill make sure i am putting some warmth into her smile she rose if youll excuse me she slipped out of the room plucking the beeper from her pocket to check the number she detoured to the ladies lounge glancing at her watch and pulling the phone from her bag with the number punched in she settled on one of the sofas and laid her notebook and her electronic organizer on her lap after a long and demanding week in new york she was still revved and glancing through her appointments pleased to have time to squeeze in a little shopping before she needed to change for her dinner date jeremy demorney she mused that meant an elegant sophisticated evening french restaurant discussion of food travel and theater and of course of wine as he was descended from the la coeur winery demorneys and a top account exec there and she sprang from giambelli stock there would be some playful attempts to pry corporate secrets from each other and there would be champagne good she was in the mood for it all followed by an outrageously romantic attempt to lure her into bed she wondered if shed be in the mood for that as well he was attractive she considered and could be amusing perhaps if they both hadnt been aware that her father had once slept with his wife the idea of a little romance between them wouldnt seem so awkward and somehow incestuous still several years had passed maria sophia neatly tucked jerry and the evening to come away when the giambelli housekeeper answered ive a call from my mothers line is she available oh yes miss sophia she hoped you would call just one moment sophia imagined the woman hurrying through the wing scanning the rooms for something to tidy when pilar giambelli avano would have already tidied everything herself mama sophia thought would have been content in a little rosecovered cottage where she could bake bread do her needlework and tend her garden she should have had a half dozen children sophia thought with a sigh and had to settle for me sophie i was just heading out to the greenhouse wait catch my breath i didnt expect you to get back to me so quickly i thought youd be in the middle of the auction end of it and i think we can say its been an unqualified success ill fax a memo of the particulars this evening or first thing in the morning now i really should go back and tie up the loose ends is everything all right there more or less your grandmothers ordered a summit meeting oh mama shes not dying again we went through that six months ago eight pilar corrected but whos counting im sorry baby but she insists i dont think she plans to die this time but shes planning something shes called the lawyers for another revamp of the will and she gave me her mothers cameo brooch which means shes thinking ahead i thought she gave you that last time no it was the amber beads last time shes sending for everyone you need to come back all right all right sophia glanced down at her organizer and blew a mental kiss goodbye to jerry demorney ill finish up here and be on my way but really mama this new habit of hers of dying or revamping every few months is very inconvenient youre a good girl sophie im going to leave you my amber beads thanks a bunch with a laugh sophia disconnected two hours later she was flying west and speculating whether in another forty years she would have the power to crook her finger and have everyone scrambling just the idea of it made her smile as she settled back with a glass of champagne and verdi playing on the headphones not everyone scrambled tyler macmillan might have been minutes away from villa giambelli rather than hours but he considered the vines a great deal more urgent than a summons from la signora and he said so now ty you can take a few hours not now ty paced his office anxious to get back into the fields im sorry granddad you know how vital the winter pruning is and so does tereza he shifted the portable phone to his other ear he hated the portables he was always losing them macmillans vines need every bit as much care as giambellis ty you put me in charge here im doing my job ty eli repeated with his grandson he knew matters must be put on a very basic level tereza and i are as dedicated to macmillan wines as we are to those under the giambelli label and have been for twenty years you were put in charge because youre an exceptional vintner tereza has plans those plans involve you next week tomorrow eli didnt put his foot down often it wasnt the way he worked but when necessary he did so ruthlessly one oclock lunch dress appropriately tyler scowled down at his ancient boots and the frayed hems of his thick trousers thats the middle of the damn day are you the only one at macmillan capable of pruning vines tyler apparently youve lost a number of employees over the last season ill be there but tell me one thing of course is this the last time shes going to die for a while one oclock eli responded try to be on time yeah yeah yeah tyler muttered but only after he clicked the phone off he adored his grandfather he even adored tereza perhaps because she was so ornery and annoying when his grandfather had married the giambelli heiress tyler had been eleven years old hed fallen in love with the vineyards the rise of the hills the shadows of the caves the great caverns of the cellars and in a very real sense hed fallen in love with tereza louisa elana giambelli that whipthin ramrodstraight somewhat terrifying figure hed first seen dressed in boots and trousers not so different from his own striding through the mustard plants between the rising rows of grapes shed taken one look at him lifted a razorsharp black eyebrow and deemed him soft and citified if he was to be her grandson shed told him he would have to be toughened up shed ordered him to stay at the villa for the summer no one had considered arguing the point certainly not his parents whod been more than happy to dump him for an extended period so they could fly off to parties and lovers so he had stayed tyler thought now as he wandered to the window summer after summer until the vineyards were more home to him than the house in san francisco until she and his grandfather were more parents to him than his mother and father shed made him pruned him back at the age of eleven and trained him to grow into what he was but she didnt own him it was ironic he supposed that all her work should have formed him into the one person under her aegis most likely to ignore her demands harder of course to ignore the demands when she and his grandfather unified with a shrug tyler started out of the office he could spare a few hours and they knew it as well as he the macmillan vineyards employed the best and he could easily have absented himself for most of a season with confidence in those left in charge the simple fact was he hated the big sprawling events the giambellis generated they were invariably like a circus with all three rings packed with colorful acts you couldnt keep track and it was always possible one of the tigers would leap the cage and go for your throat all those people all those issues all those pretenses and smoky undercurrents he was happier walking the vineyards or checking the casks or plunking down with one of his winemakers and discussing the qualities of that years chardonnay social duties were simply that duties he detoured through the charming ramble of the house that had been his grandfathers into the kitchen to refill his thermos with coffee absently he set the portable phone he still carried on the counter and began rearranging his schedule in his head to accommodate la signora he was no longer citified or soft he was just over six feet with a body sculpted by fieldwork and a preference for the outdoors his hands were wide and tough with calluses with long fingers that knew how to dip delicately under leaves to the grape his hair tended to curl if he forgot to have it trimmed which he often did and was a deep brown that showed hints of red like an aged burgundy in the sunlight his rawboned face was more rugged than handsome with lines beginning to fan out from eyes of clear and calm blue that could harden to steel the scar along his jaw which hed earned with a tumble off a stand of rocks at age thirteen only annoyed him when he remembered to shave which he reminded himself he would have to do before lunch the following day those who worked for him considered him a fair man if often a singleminded one tyler would have appreciated the analysis they also considered him an artist and that would have baffled him to tyler macmillan the artist was the grape he stepped outside into the brisk winter air he had two hours before sunset and vines to tend donato giambelli had a headache of outrageous proportions her name was gina and she was his wife when the summons from la signora had come he had been happily engaged in eyecrossing sex with his current mistress a multitalented aspiring actress with thighs strong enough to crack walnuts unlike his wife all the mistress required was the occasional bauble and a sweaty romp three times a week she did not require conversation there were times he thought gina required nothing else she babbled at him babbled at each of their three children babbled at his mother until the air in the company jet vibrated with the endless stream of words between her the babys screaming little cezares banging and tereza marias bouncing don gave serious thought to opening the hatch and shoving his entire family off the plane and into oblivion only his mother was quiet and only because shed taken a sleeping pill an airsickness pill an allergy pill and god knew what else washed them all down with two glasses of merlot before putting her eye mask in place and passing out shed spent most of her life at least the portion he knew of it medicated and oblivious at the moment he considered that superior wisdom he could only sit his temples throbbing and damn his aunt tereza to hell and beyond for insisting his entire family make the trip he was executive vice president of giambelli venice was he not any business that needed to be conducted required him not his family why had god plagued him with such a family not that he didnt love them of course he loved them but the baby was as fat as a turkey and there was gina pulling out a breast for its greedy mouth once that breast had been a work of art he thought gold and firm and tasting of peaches now it was stretched like an overfilled balloon and had he been inclined to taste flavored with baby drool and the woman was already making noises about yet another one the woman hed married had been ripe lush sexually charged and empty of head she had been perfection in five short years she had become fat sloppy and her head was full of babies was it any wonder he sought his comfort elsewhere donny i think zia tereza will give you a big promotion and well all move into the castello she lusted for the great house of giambelli all those lovely rooms all the servants her children would be raised in luxury with privilege fine clothes the best schools and one day the giambelli fortune at their feet she was the only one giving la signora babies wasnt she that would count for quite a bit cezare she said to her son as he tore the head off his sisters doll stop that now you made your sister cry here now here give me the doll mama will fix little cezare eyes glinting tossed the head gleefully over his shoulder and began to taunt his sister english cezare she shook a finger at him were going to america youll speak english to your zia tereza and show her what a smart boy you are come come tereza maria screaming over the death of her doll retrieved the severed head and raced up and down the cabin in a flurry of grief and rage cezare do as mama says in response the boy flung himself to the floor arms and legs hammering don lurched up stumbled away and locked himself in the sanctuary of his inflight office anthony avano enjoyed the finer things hed chosen his twostory penthouse in san franciscos back bay with care and deliberation then had hired the top decorator in the city to outfit it for him status and style were high priorities having them without having to make any real effort was another he failed to see how a man could be comfortable without those basic elements his rooms reflected what he thought of as classic taste from the silk moire walls the oriental carpets to the gleaming oak furniture hed chosen or his decorator had rich fabrics in neutral tones with a few splashes of bold colors artfully arranged the modern art which meant absolutely nothing to him was hed been told a striking counterpoint to the quiet elegance he relied heavily on the services of decorators tailors brokers jewelers and dealers to guide him into surrounding himself with the best some of his detractors had been known to say tony avano was born with taste and all of it in his mouth he wouldnt have argued the point but money as tony saw it bought all the taste a man required he knew one thing and that was wine his cellars were arguably among the best in california every bottle had been personally selected while he couldnt distinguish a sangiovese from a semillon on the vine and had no interest in the growing of the grape he had a superior nose and that nose had steadily climbed the corporate ladder at giambelli california thirty years before it had married pilar giambelli it had taken that nose less than two years to begin sniffing at other women tony was the first to admit that women were his weakness there were so many of them after all he had loved pilar as deeply as he was capable of loving another human being he had certainly loved his position of privilege in the giambelli organization as the husband of la signoras daughter and as the father of her granddaughter for those reasons he had for many years attempted to be very discreet about his particular weakness he had even tried a number of times to reform but then there would be another woman soft and fragrant or sultry and seductive what was a man to do the weakness had eventually cost him his marriage in a technical if not a legal sense he and pilar had been separated for seven years neither of them had made the move toward divorce she he knew because she loved him and he because it seemed like a great deal of trouble and would have seriously displeased tereza in any case as far as tony was concerned the current situation suited everyone nicely pilar preferred the countryside he the city they maintained a polite even a reasonably friendly relationship and he kept his position as president of sales giambelli california seven years they had walked that civilized line now he was very afraid he was about to fall off the edge of it rene was insisting on marriage like a silklined steamroller rene had a way of moving toward a goal and flattening all barriers in her path discussions with her left tony limp and dizzy she was violently jealous overbearing demanding and prone to icy sulks he was crazy about her at thirtytwo she was twentyseven years his junior a fact that stroked his welldeveloped ego knowing she was every bit as interested in his money as the rest of him didnt trouble him he respected her for it he worried that if he gave her what she wanted he would lose what she wanted him for it was a hell of a fix to resolve it tony did what he usually did regarding difficulties he ignored it as long as humanly possible studying his view of the bay sipping a small vermouth tony waited for rene to finish dressing for their evening out and worried that his time was up the doorbell had him glancing over frowning slightly they werent expecting anyone as it was his majordomos evening off he went to see who was there the frown cleared as he opened the door to his daughter sophie what a lovely surprise dad she rose slightly on her toes to kiss his cheek ridiculously handsome as ever she thought good genes and an excellent plastic surgeon served him well she did her best to ignore the quick and instinctive tug of resentment and tried to focus on the equally quick and instinctive tug of love it seemed she was forever pulled in opposing directions over her father im just in from new york and wanted to see you before i headed up to the villa she scanned his face smooth almost unlined and certainly untroubled the dark hair wisped attractively with gray at the temples the deep blue eyes were clear he had a handsome squaredoff chin with a center dimple shed loved dipping her finger into it as a child and making him laugh the love for him swarmed through her and tangled messily with the resentment it was always so i see youre going out she said noting his tuxedo shortly he took her hand to draw her inside but theres plenty of time sit down princess and tell me how you are what can i get you she tipped his glass toward her sniffed approved what youre havings fine she scanned the room as he walked over to the liquor cabinet an expensive pretext she thought all show and no substance just like her father are you going up tomorrow going where she tilted her head as he crossed back to her to the villa no why she took the glass considering as she sipped you didnt get a call about what loyalties tugged and tangled inside her hed cheated on her mother had carelessly ignored his vows as long as sophia could remember and in the end had left them both with barely a backward glance but he was still family and the family was being called to the villa la signora one of her summits with lawyers im told you might want to be there ah well really i was he broke off as rene walked in if there was a poster girl for the trophy mistress sophia thought as her temper sizzled rene foxx was it tall curvy and blonde on blonde the valentino gown showcased a body ruthlessly toned and managed to look understated and elegant her hair was swept up slicked back to leave her lovely pampered face with its full sensuous mouth collagen sophia thought cattily and shrewd green eyes shed chosen diamonds to marry the valentino and they flashed and shimmered against her polished skin just how much sophia wondered had those rocks set her father back hello sophia sipped more vermouth to wash some of the bitterness off her tongue rene isnt it yes and it has been for nearly two years its still sophia yes for twentysix tony cleared his throat nothing in his opinion was more dangerous than two sniping females the man between them always took the bullet rene sophias just in from new york really enjoying herself rene took tonys glass sipped that explains why youre looking a bit travelfrayed were about to leave for a party youre welcome to join us she added hooking her arm through tonys i must have something in my closet that would work on you if she was going to go claw to claw with rene it wouldnt be after a coasttocoast flight and in her fathers apartment sophia would choose the time and the place thats so considerate but id feel awkward wearing something so obviously too large and she added coating her words with sugar im just on my way north family business she set her glass down enjoy your evening she walked to the door where tony caught up with her to give her shoulder a quick placating pat why dont you come along sophie youre fine as you are youre beautiful no thank you she turned and their eyes met his were full of sheepish apology it was an expression she was too accustomed to seeing for it to be effective im not feeling particularly festive he winced as she shut the door in his face what did she want rene demanded she just dropped by as i said your daughter never does anything without a reason he shrugged she may have thought we could drive up north together in the morning terezas sent out a summons renes eyes narrowed you didnt tell me about that i didnt get one he dismissed the entire matter and thought of the party and just how he and rene would look making their entrance you look fabulous rene its a shame to cover that dress even with mink shall i get your wrap what do you mean you didnt get one rene slapped the empty glass on a table your position at giambelli is certainly more important than your daughters and rene meant to see it remained that way if the old womans calling the family you go well drive up tomorrow we but its the perfect opportunity to take your stand tony and to tell pilar you want a divorce well make it an early night so well both be clearheaded she crossed to him slid her fingers down his cheek with tony she knew manipulation required firm demands and physical rewards judiciously melded and when we get back tonight ill show you just what you can expect from me when were married when we get back tony she leaned in bit teasingly at his bottom lip you can do anything you want lets just skip the party she laughed slipped away from his hands its important and itll give you time to think of just what you want to do to me get my sable for me wont you darling she felt like sable tonight rene thought as tony went to comply she felt rich tonight chapter two contents prev next the valley and the hills that rose from it wore a thin coat of snow vines arrogant and often temperamental soldiers climbed up the slopes their naked branches spearing through the quiet mist that turned the circling mountains to soft shadows under the pearly dawn the vineyard shivered and slept this peaceful scene had helped spawn a fortune a fortune that would be gambled again season after season with nature both partner and foe to sophia the making of wine was an art a business a science but it was also the biggest game in town from a window of her grandmothers villa she studied the playing field it was pruning season and she imagined while shed been traveling vines had already been accessed considered and those first stages toward next years harvest begun she was glad shed been called back so that she could see that part of it for herself when she was away the business of the wine occupied all her energies she rarely thought of the vineyard when she wore her corporate hat and whenever she came back like this she thought of little else still she couldnt stay long she had duties in san francisco a new advertising campaign to be polished the giambelli centennial was just getting off the ground and with the success of the auction in new york the next stages would require her attention an old wine for a new millennium she thought villa giambelli the next century of excellence begins but they needed something fresh something savvy for the younger market those who bought their wine on the run a quick impulse grab to take to a party well shed think of it it was her job to think of it and putting her mind to it would keep it off her father and the scheming rene none of her business sophia reminded herself none of her business at all if her father wanted to hook himself up with a former underwear model with a heart the size and texture of a raisin hed made a fool of himself before and no doubt would again she wished she could hate him for it for his pathetic weakness of character and his benign neglect of his daughter but the steady abiding love just wouldnt shift aside which made her she supposed as foolish as her mother he didnt care for either of them as much as he did the cut of his suit and didnt give them a thought two minutes after they were out of his sight he was a bastard utterly selfish sporadically affectionate and always careless and that she supposed was part of his charm she wished she hadnt stopped by the night before wished she wasnt compelled to keep that connection between them no matter what he did or didnt do better she thought to keep on the move as she had for the past several years traveling working filling her time and her life with professional and social obligations two days she decided she would give her grandmother two days spend time with her family spend time in the vineyard and the winery then it was back to work with a vengeance the new campaign would be the best in the industry she would make sure of it as she scanned the hills she saw two figures walking through the mist the tall gangly man with an old brown cap on his head the ramrodstraight woman in mannish boots and trousers with hair as white as the snow they trod a border collie plodded along between them her grandparents taking their morning walk with the aging and endlessly faithful sally the sight of them lifted her mood whatever changed in her life whatever adjustments had been made this was a constant la signora and eli macmillan and the vines she dashed from the window to grab her coat and join them at sixtyseven tereza giambelli was sculpted razorsharp body and mind she had learned the art of the vine at her grandfathers knee had traveled with her father to california when shed been only three to turn the land of the ripe valley to wine shed become bilingual and had traveled back and forth between california and italy the way other young girls had traveled to the playground shed learned to love the mountains the thatch of forest the rhythm of american voices it was not home would never be home as the castello was but she had made her place here and was content with it she had married a man who had met with her familys approval and had learned to love him as well with him she had made a daughter and to her lasting grief birthed two stillborn sons she had buried her husband when she was only thirty and had never taken his name or given it to her only child she was giambelli and that heritage that responsibility was more vital and more sacred even than marriage she had a brother she loved who was a priest and tended his flock in venice she had another who had died a soldier before he had really lived she revered his memory though it was dim and she had a sister she considered foolish at best who had brought a daughter more foolish yet into the world it had been up to her to continue the family line the family art she had done so her marriage to eli macmillan had been carefully considered scrupulously planned she had considered it a merger as his vineyards were prime and nestled below hers in the valley he was a good man and more important in her calculations a good vintner he had cared for her but other men had cared for her she enjoyed his company but she had enjoyed the company of others in the end shed thought of him as the merlot the softer mellowing juice blended to her stronger and admittedly harsher cabernet sauvignon the right combination could produce excellent results her acceptance of his marriage proposal had been contingent on complex and detailed business arrangements the arrangements had benefited both their companies and had contented her but tereza who was rarely surprised had been so to find comfort pleasure and simple satisfaction in a marriage now approaching its twentieth year he was a finelooking man still tereza didnt discount such matters as they spoke of genes what made up a man was as important to her mind as what that man made of himself though he was ten years her senior she saw no sign of him bowing to age he still rose at dawn every day and would walk with her regardless of the weather every morning she trusted him as she had no man since her grandfather and cared for him more than she had any man not of her blood he knew all of her plans and most of her secrets sophia arrived late last night ah eli laid a hand on her shoulder as they walked between the rows it was a simple gesture and habitual for him it had taken tereza some time to grow used to this casual touching from a man from a husband a longer time still to come to depend on it did you think she wouldnt come i knew she would come tereza was too used to being obeyed to doubt it if shed come straight from new york she would have been here sooner so she had a date or did some shopping terezas eyes narrowed they were nearly black and still sharp in distance vision her voice was sharp as well and carried the exotic music of her homeland or stopped off to see her father or stopped off to see her father eli agreed in his slow comfortable way loyaltys a trait youve always admired tereza when its earned there were times much as she cared for him when elis unending tolerance infuriated her anthony avano has earned nothing but disgust a pitiful man a poor husband and a mediocre father which made him eli mused very like his own son yet he continues to work for you i let him into giambelli too intimately in those early years shed trusted him she thought had seen potential in him had been deceived by him that she would never forgive still he knows how to sell i use whatever tools perform their task firing him long ago would have been a personal satisfaction and professionally unwise whats best for giambelli is whats best but i dont like to see my granddaughter cater to the man uh she tossed aside thoughts of her soninlaw with an impatient wave of the hand well see how he takes what i have to say today sophia will have told him i called her home so hell come eli stopped turned and thats exactly as you wanted it you knew shed tell him her dark eyes glinted and her smile was cool and if i did youre a difficult woman tereza yes thank you he laughed and shaking his head began to walk with her again your announcements today are going to cause trouble resentment i should hope so she stopped to examine some of the younger vines supported by trellis wires canepruning would be required here she thought only the strongest of them would be permitted to grow and to be trained complacency becomes rot eli tradition must be respected and change explored she scanned the land the mist was raw and the air damp the sun would not burn through it that day she was certain winters she thought grew longer with every year some of these vines i planted with my own hands she continued vines my father brought from italy as they grew old the new was made from them the new must always have room to sink their roots eli and the mature are entitled to their respect what i built here what weve built in our time together is ours ill do as i think best with it and for it you always have in this case as in most i agree with you it doesnt mean well have an easy season ahead of us but a vintage one she said this year she reached over to turn a naked vine in her fingers a fine and rare vintage i know it she turned watched her granddaughter run up the slope toward them shes so beautiful eli yes and strong shell need to be tereza said and stepped forward to catch sophias hands in hers buon giorno cara come va bene bene they kissed cheeks hands tightly linked nonna sophia eased back studied her grandmothers face it was a handsome face not soft and pretty as the girl on the label made so long ago but strong nearly fierce carved sophia always thought as much by ambition as time you look wonderful and you she shifted to throw her arms around eli here it was all very simple he was eli just eli the only grandfather shed ever known safe loving and uncomplicated he gave her a little lift with the hug so her toes just left the ground it made her laugh and cling i saw you from my window she stepped back as her feet hit the ground again then lowered to pat and stroke the patient sally youre a painting the three of you the vineyard id call it she continued straightening to button elis jacket at his throat against the chill what a morning she closed her eyes tipping her head back and breathing deep she could smell the damp her grandmothers soap and the tobacco eli must have secreted in one of his pockets your trip was successful tereza asked i have memos my memos have memos she added laughing again as she hooked her arms through theirs so they could walk together youll be pleased nonna and i have some brilliant ideas she says with due modesty on the promotion campaign eli glanced over and when he saw tereza wasnt going to comment patted sophias hand the trouble he thought would start very quickly now the prunings begun sophia noted the fresh cuts on the vines at macmillan as well yes its time it seems a long way till harvest nonna will you tell me why youve brought us all here you know i love to see you and eli and mama but preparing the vines isnt the only work thats required for giambelli well talk later now well have breakfast before those monsters of donatos are up and driving us all insane nonna later tereza said again were not all yet here villa giambelli sat on a knoll above the center of the valley and beside a forest that had been left to grow wild its stones showed gold and red and umber when the light struck them and its windows were many the winery had been built to replicate the one in italy and though it had been expanded and ruthlessly modernized it was still in operation a large attractively outfitted tasting room where patrons could by appointment sample the products along with breads and cheeses had been added to it wine clubs were welcomed to lavish affairs four times a year and tours could be arranged through the offices there or in san francisco wine bought from the winery itself on those occasions could be shipped anywhere in the world the caves with their cool damp air that pocketed the hills were used for storage and the aging of the wine the fields that had built villa giambelli and its facilities stretched for more than a hundred acres and during harvest the very air smelled of the promise of wine the central courtyard of the villa was tiled in chianti red and boasted a fountain where a grinning bacchus forever hoisted his goblet when the winter cold had passed dozens and dozens of pots would be set out so that the space was alive with flower and scent it boasted twelve bedrooms and fifteen baths a solarium a ballroom and a formal dining room that could accommodate sixty there were rooms dedicated to music and rooms celebrating books rooms for work and for contemplation within its walls was a collection of italian and american art and antiques that was second to none there were both indoor and outdoor pools and a twentycar garage its gardens were a fantasy balconies and terraces laced the stone and a series of steps afforded both family and guests private entrances and exits despite its size its scope and its priceless treasures it was very much a home the first time tyler had seen it hed thought of it as a castle full of enormous rooms and complicated passages at the moment he thought of it as a prison where he was sentenced to spend entirely too much time with entirely too many people he wanted to be outside in the raw air tending his vines and drinking strong coffee out of a thermos instead he was trapped in the family parlor sipping an excellent chardonnay a fire was snapping gaily in the hearth and elegant little hors doeuvres were set around the room on platters of colorful italian pottery he couldnt understand why people wasted the time and effort on bits of finger food when slapping a sandwich together was so much quicker and easier why was it food had to be such a damn event and he imagined if he uttered such heresy in a household of italians hed be lynched on the spot hed been forced to change out of his work clothes into slacks and a sweater his idea of formal wear at least he hadnt strapped himself into a suit like what was the guys name don don from venice with the wife who wore too much makeup too much jewelry and always seemed to have a shrieking baby attached to some part of her body she talked too much and no one particularly her husband appeared to pay any attention francesca giambelli russo said little to nothing such a contrast to la signora ty mused youd never make them as sisters she was thin and drifty an insubstantial little woman who stayed glued in her chair and looked as though shed jump out of her skin if anyone addressed her directly ty was always careful not to do so the little boy if you could call a demon from hell a boy was sprawled on the rug smashing two trucks together elis border collie sally was hiding under sophias legs great legs ty noted absently she was looking as sleek and polished as ever like something lifted off a movie screen and dropped down in three dimensions she appeared to be fascinated by whatever don was saying to her and kept those big dark chocolate eyes of hers on his face but ty watched as she discreetly slipped sally hors doeuvres the move was too slick and calculated for her to have had her full attention on the conversation here the stuffed olives are excellent pilar stepped up beside him with a small plate thanks tyler shifted of all the giambellis tyler was most comfortable with pilar she never expected him to make endless empty conversation just for the sake of hearing her own voice any idea when were going to get this business rolling when mamas ready and not before my sources tell me lunch is set for fourteen but i cant pin down who were waiting for whoever it is and whatever this is about eli seems content thats a good sign he started to grunt remembered his manners lets hope so we havent seen you around here in weeks been busy she said even as he uttered the words then she laughed naturally what are you up to other than business what else is there with a shake of her head she pressed the olives on him again youre more like my mother than any of us werent you seeing someone last summer a pretty blonde pat patty patsy not really seeing just sort of he made a vague gesture you know honey you need to get out more and not just for you know it was such a mother thing to say he had to smile i could say the same about you oh im just an old stickinthemud bestlooking stick in the room he countered and made her laugh again you always were sweet when you put your mind to it and the comment even from a man she considered a kind of surrogate son boosted the spirits that seemed to flag all too easily these days mama youre hoarding the olives sophia dashed up plucked one off the plate beside her lovely composed mother she was a fireball crackling with electricity the kind that was always giving you hot unexpected jolts if you got too close or so it always seemed to ty for that single reason hed always tried to keep a safe and comfortable distance quick talk to me were you just going to leave me trapped with don the dull forever sophia muttered poor sophie well think of it this way its probably the first time in weeks hes been able to say five words at the same time without gina interrupting him believe me he made up for it she rolled her dark exotic eyes so ty how are you fine hard at work for macmillan sure know any words with more than one syllable some thought you were in new york was she said mimicking his tone as her lips twitched now im here she glanced over her shoulder as her two young cousins began to shriek and sob mama if i was ever that obnoxious how did you stop yourself from drowning me in the fountain you werent obnoxious sweetie demanding arrogant temperamental but never obnoxious excuse me she handed the plate to sophia and went to do what shed always done best make peace i suppose i should have done that sophia said with a sigh as she watched her mother scoop up the miserable young girl but ive never seen a pair of kids less appealing in my life comes from being spoiled and neglected at the same time she considered studied don ignoring his screaming son and gina making foolish cooing noises to him good call she decided then because they werent her problem thank jesus she turned her attention back to tyler he was such a man she decided he looked like something carved out of the vacas that guarded the valley and he was certainly more pleasant to contemplate than the fouryearold temper tantrum behind her now if she could just pry a reasonable conversation out of him she could be nicely occupied until lunch was served any clues about the theme of our little gathering today sophia asked no would you tell me if you knew he shrugged a shoulder and watched pilar murmur to little tereza as she carried her to the side window she looked natural he thought madonnalike he supposed was the suitable word and because of it the irritable angry child took on an attractive appealing look why do you suppose people have kids when theyre not going to pay any real attention to them sophia started to speak then broke off as her father and rene walked into the room thats a good question she murmured and taking the glass from his hand finished off his wine damn good question at the window pilar tensed and all the simple pleasure shed gotten from distracting the unhappy little girl drained away she felt instantly frumpy unattractive old fat sour here was the man who had discarded her and here was the latest in the long line of replacements younger lovelier smarter sexier but because she knew her mother would not pilar set the child on the floor and walked over to greet them her smile was warm and easy and graced a face much more compelling than she thought her simple slacks and sweater were more elegant more feminine than renes slick power suit and her manner carried an innate class that held more true sparkle than diamonds tony how good you could make it hello rene pilar rene smiled slowly and trailed a hand down tonys arm the diamond on her finger caught the light she waited a beat to be certain pilar saw it registered the meaning you look rested thank you the backs of her knees dissolved she could feel the support going out from under her as completely as if rene had rammed the toe of her hot red pump into them please come in sit what can i get you to drink dont fuss pilar tony waved her off even as he leaned down to give her an absent peck on the cheek well just go say hello to tereza go to your mom ty said under his breath what go make an excuse and get your mom out of here she saw it then the diamond glint on renes finger the blank shock in her mothers eyes she shoved the plate at ty and strode across the room mama can you help me with something for a minute yes just let me itll only take a second sophia continued quickly pulling pilar from the room she just kept moving until they were well down the hall and into the twolevel library there she pulled the pocket doors closed behind her leaned back against them mama im so sorry oh trying to laugh pilar ran an unsteady hand over her face so much for thinking i pulled that off you did beautifully sophia hurried over as pilar lowered to the arm of a chair but i know that face she cupped her mothers in her hands apparently so does tyler the rings ostentatious and obvious just like she is oh baby her laugh was strained but she tried its stunning gorgeous just like she is its all right but already she was turning the gold band she continued to wear round and round her finger really its all right the hell it is i hate her i hate both of them and im going back in there and telling them right now youre not pilar got up gripped sophias arms did the pain she could see in her daughters eyes show as clearly in her own and was that her fault had this endless limbo shed lived in dragged her daughter into the void it solves nothing changes nothing theres no point in hate sophie itll only damage you no sophia thought no it could forge you be angry she demanded be furious and bitter and crazed be anything she thought anything but hurt and defeated i cant bear it you do it baby she ran her hands soothingly up and down sophias arms so much better than i could to walk in here this way to just walk in and shove it in our faces he had no right to do that to you mama or to me he has a right to do what he wants but it was poorly done excuses she admitted shed spent nearly thirty years making excuses for anthony avano a hard habit to break dont let it hurt you hes still your father whatever happens he always will be he was never a father to me pilar paled oh sophia no no furious with herself sophia held up a hand i am obnoxious this isnt about me but i just cant help making it about me its not even about him she said winding down hes oblivious but shes not she knew what she was doing how she wanted to do it and i hate her coming into our home and lording that over you no damn it over us all of us youre ignoring one factor baby rene may love him oh please so cynical i loved him why shouldnt she sophia whirled away she wanted to kick something to break something and to take the jagged shards of it and swipe them over renes perfect california face she loves his money his position and his goddamn expense account probably but hes the kind of man who makes women love him effortlessly sophia caught the wistfulness in her mothers voice shed never loved a man but she recognized the sound of a woman who had who did and that the hopelessness of that emptied her of temper you havent stopped loving him if i havent id better promise me one thing dont cause a scene i hate to give up the satisfaction but i suppose chilly disinterest will have more impact one way or the other i want to knock that smug look off her face she walked back kissed both her mothers cheeks then hugged her here she could and did love without shadows and smudges will you be all right mama yes my life doesnt change does it oh and the thought of that was damning nothing really changes lets go back ill tell you what were going to do sophia began when they were in the hall again im going to juggle my schedule and clear a couple of days then you and i are going to the spa were going to sink up to our necks in mud have facials get our bodies scrubbed rubbed and polished well spend wads of money on overpriced beauty products well never use and lounge around in bathrobes all day the door of the powder room opened as they walked by and a middleaged brunette stepped out now that sounds wonderfully appealing when do we leave helen pilar pressed a hand to her heart even as she leaned in to kiss her friends cheek you scared the life out of me sorry had to make a dash for the john she tugged at the skirt of her stonegray suit over hips she was constantly trying to whittle to make certain it was back in place all that coffee i drank on the way up sophia arent you gorgeous so she shifted her briefcase squared her shoulders the usual suspects in the parlor more or less i didnt realize she meant you when mama said the lawyers would be coming and sophia thought if her grandmother had called in judge helen moore it meant serious business because pilar didnt know either nor did i until a few days ago your grandmother insisted i handle this business personally helens shrewd gray eyes shifted toward the parlor shed been involved one way or another with the giambellis and their business for nearly forty years they never failed to fascinate her she keeping all of you in the dark apparently pilar murmured helen shes all right isnt she i took this latest business about changing her will and so on as part of this phase shes been in this past year since signore baptista died as far as i know healthwise la signora is as hale as ever helen adjusted her blackrimmed glasses gave her oldest friend a bolstering smile as her attorney i cant tell you any more about her motivations pilar even if i completely understood them its her show why dont we see if shes ready for the curtain chapter three contents prev next la signora never rushed her cue she had planned the menu personally wanting to set the tone for the lavish and the casual the wines served were from the california vineyards both giambelli and macmillan that too was meticulously planned she would not discuss business at the meal nor would she much to ginas annoyance allow three illmannered children at the table they had been sent to the nursery with a maid who would be given a bonus and terezas considerable respect if she lasted an hour with them when she deigned to speak to rene it was with chilly formality because of it she felt a grudging admiration for the womans spine there had been others many others who had withered visibly under that frost along with family and helen whom she considered one of her own she had invited her most trusted winemaker and his wife paulo borelli had been with giambelli california for thirtyeight years despite his age he was still called paulie his wife consuelo was a plump cheerful woman with a big laugh who had once been a kitchen maid at the villa the final addition was margaret bowers the head of sales for macmillan she was a divorced woman of thirtysix who was currently being bored senseless by ginas chatter and wishing desperately for a cigarette tyler caught her eye and gave her a sympathetic smile margaret sometimes wished desperately for him too when the food was cleared and the port passed tereza sat back castello di giambelli celebrates its centennial in one year she began immediately conversation stopped villa giambelli has been making wine in the napa valley for sixtyfour years macmillan has been doing so for ninetytwo that is two hundred and fiftysix years combined she scanned the table five generations have been vintners and wine merchants six zia tereza gina fluttered my children give you six from what ive seen your children are more likely to be serial killers than vintners please dont interrupt she lifted her port nosing the wine sipping slowly in those five generations we have earned a reputation on two continents for producing wine of quality the name giambelli is wine we have established traditions and have blended them with new ways new technology without sacrificing that name or what it means we will never sacrifice it twenty years ago we established a partnership of sorts with another fine vintner macmillan of napa valley has run side by side with giambelli california the partnership has aged well its time for it to be decanted she felt rather than saw tyler tense she gave him high marks for holding his tongue and met his eyes now changes are necessary and for the good of both the next hundred years begin today donato he snapped to attention si yes he corrected remembering she preferred english at her california table yes aunt tereza giambelli italy and california have been ran exclusive of each other separate this will no longer be the case you will report to the chief operating officer of the newly formed giambellimacmillan company which will have bases in both california and venice what does this mean what does this mean gina exploded in italian shoving awkwardly from the table donato is in charge he is next in line he carries the name he is your heir my heir is who i say is my heir we give you children gina slapped a hand on her belly then waved an arm in disgust at the table three children and more will come no one gives the family children but me and donato who will carry on the name when youre gone if not my babies do you bargain with your womb tereza said evenly its fertile she snapped back even as her husband tried to pull her back into her chair more than yours more than your daughters one baby each thats all i can have a dozen then god help us all youll keep your fine house gina and your pocket money but you will not find yourself mistress of the castello my castello she added coolly take what youre given or lose a great deal more gina basta enough don ordered and had his hand slapped for his trouble youre an old woman gina said between her teeth one day youll be dead and i will not so we will see she swept out of the room zia tereza scusi donato began and was cut off by a sharp gesture your wife does you no credit donato and your work falls short of my expectations you have this year to correct those matters you will remain in your position with giambelli until the time of the next pruning then we will reassess if i am pleased you will be promoted with a salary and the benefits that apply if i am not you will remain with the company on paper only i will not see one of my blood removed but you will not find your life so easy as you have is this understood his tie was suddenly too tight and the meal hed just eaten threatened to revolt in his belly ive worked for giambelli for eighteen years you worked for twelve you have put in appearances for the last six and even those appearances have been inconsistent recently do you think i dont know what you do or where you spend your time do you think im not aware of what your business is when you take trips to paris to rome to new york and california at giambelli expense she waited for this blow to land saw the faint sheen of sweat skin his face and was disappointed in him yet again your wife is foolish donato but i am not have a care hes a good boy francesca said quietly he might have been perhaps hell be a good man yet margaret youll pardon the family histrionics were temperamental of course la signora you will if you choose to accept oversee and coordinate the heads of sales of giambellimacmillan california and venice this will require considerable travel and responsibility on your part with the appropriate salary increase youll be needed in venice in five days to establish your base there and familiarize yourself with the operation you have until tomorrow to decide if you want to consider this arrangement and if so we will discuss the details i dont need time to decide thank you margaret kept her voice brisk and even and her heart pounded like wild surf ill be happy to discuss the details at your convenience im grateful for the opportunity she shifted to eli nodded grateful to both of you for the opportunity well said tomorrow then paulie weve already discussed our plans and i appreciate your input and your discretion youll assist in coordinating the operation in the fields the winery you know the best men here and at macmillan youll serve as foreman i have nothing but respect for paulie tys voice was calm even if temper and frustration had twin grips on his throat his skills and his instincts i have nothing but admiration for the operation here at the villa and the people involved in it and the same from what i know of giambelli venice but we have a topflight operation and people at macmillan i wont see that operation or those people overshadowed by yours la signora youre proud of what you and yours have accomplished of the legacy youve inherited and intend to pass on so am i of mine good so listen and think she gestured to eli ty tereza and i didnt come to this decision overnight nor do we do it lightly weve discussed this for a long time youre not obliged to bring me into those discussions ty began no eli interrupted before the heat he saw building in his grandsons eyes could flash were not weve worked out with helen how the legalities and formalities should and must be met weve strategized how to implement this true merger to the benefit of all involved not just for this season but for the season a hundred years from now he leaned forward do you think i want any less for macmillan than you any less for you than you want for yourself i dont know what you want i thought i did then ill make it clear here and now by doing this well become not only one of the biggest winemakers in the world but the best in the world youll continue to oversee macmillan oversee with paulie as foreman and you as operator as vintner with some addendums you know the fields ty tereza said she understood his resentment it pleased her that hot choking anger meant it mattered to him it would have to matter a very great deal you know the vines and the casks but what you do what you learn stops at the bottle its time to go on from there theres more to wine than the grape eli and i intend to see our grandchildren blended grandchildren sophia interrupted when is the last time you worked in the fields tereza demanded of her when is the last time you tasted wine that wasnt uncorked from a pretty bottle taken from a cabinet or a chilled bucket youve neglected your roots sophia ive neglected nothing sophia shot back im not a winemaker im a publicist youll be a winemaker and you she said pointing at ty youll learn what it is to sell to market to ship youll teach each other oh really nonna quiet you have the year pilar sophia wont have as much time to devote to her usual duties youll fill that gap mama pilar had to laugh i dont know anything about marketing or promotion you have a good brain its time you used it again to succeed well need all the family tereza shifted her gaze to tony and others you will remain in sales and will for now keep your title and privileges there but you will report as does donato and all department heads and managers to the coo from this time on we have a business relationship only do not come to my house or to my table again uninvited it was a downslide his title was one matter his salary and longterm benefits another she had the power to strip him clean he used the single shield he had im sophias father i know what you are i beg your pardon signora rene spoke with meticulous politeness underlined by steel if i may speak you are invited or not a guest under my roof what do you wish to say i realize that my presence here isnt particularly welcome her tone never varied her eyes never left terezas and that my relationship with tony doesnt meet with your approval but he is and has been an asset to your company as i intend to be one to him that can only benefit you that remains to be seen youll excuse us she scanned the table helen eli and i must speak with sophia and tyler coffee will be served in the parlor please enjoy you say it sophia began trembling with anger as the rest filed out of the room and its done have you gotten so used to that nonna that you believe you can change lives with a few words everyone has a choice where is the choice unable to sit she surged to her feet donato hes never worked outside the company his life is absorbed by it tyler hes given all his time and energy to macmillan since he was a boy i can speak for myself oh shut up she rounded on him five words in succession tie your tongue in knots and im supposed to teach you how to market wine he got to his feet and to her shock grabbed her hands jerking her forward as he turned them palms up like rose petals pampered and soft im supposed to teach you how to work i work every bit as hard as you do just because i dont sweat and stomp around in muddy boots doesnt mean i dont give my best youre off to a hell of a start both of you eli sighed and poured more port you want to fight fight itll be good for you the problem is neither of you has ever had to do anything that didnt suit you down to the ground maybe youll fail maybe youll both fall flat on your asses trying to do something else something more sophia tossed up her chin i dont fail you have a season to prove it would you care to know what youll have at the end of it helen well this has been fun so far helen lifted her briefcase onto the table dinner and a show for one low price she took out files laid them down and set her briefcase back on the floor adjusted her glasses in the interest of brevity and comprehension ill keep this simple and in laymans terms eli and tereza are merging their respective companies streamlining them which will cut some costs and incur others i believe its a very wise business decision each of you will carry the title of vice president operations each of you will have varied tasks and responsibilities which are set down in the contracts i have with me the contract term is one year if at the end of that year your performances are unacceptable you will be shifted back to a lesser position those terms will be negotiable at that time and in that eventuality as she spoke she slid two thick contracts from the files ty you will remain in residence at macmillan the house and its contents will continue to be available for your use sophia you will be required to move here your apartment in san francisco will be maintained by giambelli during this year for your use when youre required to do business in the city ty when youre required to do business there accommodations will be provided travel to other destinations for the company will of course be arranged and paid for by the company the castello in italy is available to either of you whether your travel there is business pleasure or a combination of both she glanced up smiled so far not so bad right now the carrot if at the end of this contract year sophia your performance is acceptable you will receive twenty percent of the company onehalf interest in the castello and the title of copresident reciprocally tyler should your performance be acceptable you will receive a like twenty percent full interest of the house where you now reside and the tide of copresident you will both be offered ten acres of vineyards to develop your own label if you wish or the market value thereof should you prefer she paused and added the final weight pilar receives twenty percent as well if she agrees with her own contract terms this gives like shares to everyone in the event of elis or terezas death their respective share passes spouse to spouse on that unhappy day when neither of them are with us their fortypercent share will be disbursed as follows fifteen percent to each of you and ten percent to pilar this will give each of you in time thirtyfive percent of one of the biggest wine companies in the world all you have to do to earn it is adhere to the contract stipulations during this year sophia waited until she was certain she could speak and kept her hands tightly gripped together in her lap she was being offered more than shed ever imagined or would have asked for and was being slapped down like a child at the same time who decides on the acceptability of our performances in the interest of fairness tereza said you will rate each other on a monthly basis eli and i will also give you performance evaluations and these will be added to the evaluations generated by the coo who the hell is coo tyler demanded his name is david cutter recently of le coeur and based in new york hell be here tomorrow tereza got to her feet well leave you to read your contracts to discuss to consider she smiled warmly helen coffee rene refused to budge there was one thing shed learned in her modeling career during her brief stint as an actress and in her lifelong social climb the only right direction to move is up shed tolerate the old womans insults the estranged wifes distress and the daughters killing glares as long as it meant winning despising them didnt stop her from tolerating them as long as it was necessary she had the diamond on her finger one shed selected personally and intended the wedding band to follow quickly tony was her entree into the world of the ridiculously rich and she was sincerely fond of him nearly as fond as she was of the idea of the giambelli fortune shed make certain he did whatever was necessary in the next year to solidify his position with giambelli and she intended to do so as his wife tell her now she ordered and picked up her coffee cup rene darling tony moved his shoulders he could already feel the weight of the shackles this is a very awkward time youve had seven years to deal with this tony get it done and get it done now she sent a significant look toward pilar or i will all right all right he patted her hand he preferred awkward to ugly with a pleasant smile on his face he got to his feet and crossed over to where pilar sat trying to calm a mildly distressed and obviously confused francesca pilar could i have a word with you a private word a dozen excuses ran through her head she was in her mothers absence hostess the room was full of guests her aunt needed her attention she should order more coffee but they were only that excuses and would do nothing but postpone what had to be faced of course she murmured soothing words in italian to her aunt then turned toward tony shall we use the library at least pilar thought he wasnt bringing rene with him even as they passed rene shot her one look hard and bright as the stone on her finger a victors look pilar thought how ridiculous thered be no contest to win and nothing to lose im sorry mama chose to make this announcement and have this discussion with so many people in attendance pilar began if shed told me beforehand id have urged her to talk to you privately doesnt matter her personal feelings for me are very clear as his feathers were rarely ruffled those feelings had rolled off him for years professionally well i might have expected better but well smooth it over smoothing things over was what he did second best ignoring them was his strong point he stepped into the room sat in one of the deep leather chairs once hed thought he would live in this house or at least maintain a base there fortunately as things had turned out he preferred the city there was little to do in napa but watch the grapes grow well pilar his smile was easy charming as always how are you how am i tony hysterical laughter wanted to bubble into her throat she suppressed it that was one of her strongest points well enough and you im good busy of course tell me what do you intend to do about la signoras suggestion you take a more active part in the company it wasnt a suggestion and i dont know what i intend to do about it the idea of it was still buzzing through her head like a swarm of hornets i havent had time to think it through im sure youll be fine he leaned forward his face earnest that she thought with a rare flare of bitterness was part of his skill and his deception this pretense of caring this veneer of interest youre a lovely woman and certainly an asset to the company in any capacity itll be good for you to get out and about more to be occupied you may even find you have a talent for it a career might be just what you need she had wanted a family husband children never a career are we here to talk about my needs tony or yours theyre not exclusive of each other not really pilar i think we should look at this new direction tereza has plotted out as an opportunity for both of us to start fresh he took her hand in the easy way he had with women cupping it protectively and provocatively in his perhaps we needed this push i realize that the idea of divorce has been difficult for you do you of course she was going to make it sticky he thought what a bore the fact is pilar weve led separate lives for a number of years now slowly deliberately she pulled her hand from his are you speaking of the lives weve led since you moved to san francisco or the lives we led while we continued to maintain the pretense of a marriage very sticky he thought and sighed pilar our marriage failed its hardly constructive to rehash the whys the blames the reasons after all this time i dont believe we ever actually hashed them tony but maybe the times past where doing so would make any difference the fact is by not ending things legally ive been unfair to you youve been clearly unable to start a new life which hasnt been a problem for you has it she rose walked over to stare into the fire why was she fighting this why did it matter lets at least be honest here you came here today to ask me for a divorce and it had nothing to do with my mothers decisions decisions you knew nothing about when you put that ring on renes finger be that as it may its foolish for either of us to pretend this wasnt long overdue i put off the divorce for your sake pilar saying it he believed it absolutely believed it which made his tone utterly sincere just as im asking for it now for your sake its time you moved on no she murmured she didnt turn yet not yet to look at him somehow when you looked at him into those quietly sincere eyes you ended up believing the lie we cant even be honest here if you want a divorce i wont stop you i doubt i could in any case she wont be as easily handled as i was she added turning back maybe thats good for you maybe shes right for you i certainly wasnt all he heard was that he would get what he wanted without trouble ill handle the details quietly of course after all this time it wont interest the press actually its hardly more than signing a few papers at this point in fact im sure all but our most intimate friends think were already divorced when she said nothing he got to his feet well all be happier once this is behind us youll see meanwhile i think you should speak with sophia its best coming from you woman to woman no doubt that when she sees youre agreeable shell feel more friendly toward rene do you underestimate everyone tony he held up his hands i simply feel that well all be more comfortable if we can keep this friendly rene will be my wife and as such will be part of my professional and social life well all see each other now and then i expect sophia to be polite i expected you to be faithful we all live with our disappointments you got what you came for tony id suggest you take rene and leave before mama finishes her port i think theres been enough unpleasantness in this house for one day agreed he started for the door hesitated i do wish you the best pilar yes i believe you for some reason i wish you the same goodbye tony when he closed the doors behind him she walked carefully to a chair sat slowly as if her bones might shatter at too sharp a move she remembered what it was like to be eighteen and wildly in love full of plans and dreams and brilliance she remembered what it was like to be twentythree and sliced through the heart by the stab of betrayal and the true loss of innocence and thirty fighting to cling to the shreds of a disintegrating marriage to raise a child and hold a husband who was too careless to pretend to love you she remembered what it was like to be forty and resigned to the loss empty of those dreams those plans with the brilliance dulled dark now she thought she knew what it was to be fortyeight alone with no illusions left replaced legally by the new improved model as shed been replaced covertly so often she lifted her hand slid her wedding ring up to the first knuckle shed worn that simple band for thirty years now she was being told to discard it and the promises shed made before god before family before friends tears burned at her eyes as she slipped it from her finger what was it after all she thought but an empty circle the perfect symbol for her marriage she had never been loved pilar let her head fall back how lowering how sad to sit here now and accept admit what she had refused to accept and admit for so long no man not even her husband had ever loved her when the doors opened she closed her fingers around the ring willed the tears to wait pilar helen took one look her lips tightened okay lets forget the coffee section of todays entertainment at home she crossed to a painted cabinet opened it and selected a decanter of brandy she poured two snifters then walked over to sit on the footstool in front of pilars chair drink up honey you look pale saying nothing pilar opened her hand the ring glinted once in the firelight yeah i figured that when the slut kept flashing the rock of ages on her finger they deserve each other he never deserved you stupid stupid to be shaken like this we havent been married for years not in any real sense but thirty years helen she held up the ring and looking through that empty circle saw her life narrow and encapsulated thirty goddamn years she was in diapers when i met tony thats the big ouch so shes younger and got bigger breasts helen shrugged god knows those reasons alone are enough to hate her fucking guts im with you there and sos the crowd but think of this if she sticks with him by the time shes our age shell be feeding him baby food and changing his diapers pilar let out a moaning laugh i hate where i am and i dont know how to get someplace else i didnt even fight back helen so youre not a warrior helen rose to sit on the arm of the chair wrapped an arm around pilars shoulder youre a beautiful intelligent kind woman who got a raw deal and damn honey if this door finally closing isnt the best thing for you god now you sound like tony no need to be insulting besides he didnt mean that and i do maybe maybe i cant see clearly now i cant see through the next hour much less the next year god i didnt even make him pay didnt have the guts to make him pay dont worry she will helen leaned over kissed the top of pilars head no man like tony should slip through life without paying she thought and if you want to scald him a bit ill help you outline a divorce settlement that will leave him with permanent scars and one shriveled testicle pilar smiled a little she could always count on helen as entertaining as that might be itd just drag things out and make it more difficult for sophie helen what the hell am i going to do with the new life thats been dumped in my lap well think of something sophia was doing a lot of thinking herself she was already getting a headache from reading the pages of the contract she got the gist of it even mired in the legalese and the gist was la signora maintained control as she always had over the next year sophia would be expected to prove herself which shed thought she had if she did to her grandmothers satisfaction some of that muchdesired control would be passed to her hands well she wanted it she didnt much care for the way shed have to go about getting it but she could see the reasoning the hardest part was in nearly always being able to see her grandmothers reasoning perhaps because under it all they thought so much alike she had not taken a deep and intimate interest in the making of wine loving the vineyards for their beauty knowing the basics wasnt the same as investing time emotion and effort into them and if she would one day step into her grandmothers place she needed to do so maybe she preferred boardrooms to fermenting tanks but she glanced over at tyler who was scowling down at his own contract this one took the tanks over the boardroom that would make them a good business match or contrast she supposed and he had every bit as much at stake as she did yes la signora had once again been as brilliant as shed been ruthless now that her temper had cleared away to allow for cool common sense she could see not only that it could work but that it would unless ty mucked things up you dont like it she said what the hells to like about it it was a goddamn ambush agreed thats nonnas style troops fall in line more quickly and in a more organized fashion when you order them to right before the battle give them too much time to think they might desert the field are you thinking of deserting the field ty his gaze lifted and she saw the steel in his eyes hard and cold ive run macmillan for eight years im not walking away from it no he wouldnt muck it up okay lets start from there you want what you want i want what i want how do we get it she pushed to her feet paced easier for you why is that i essentially give up my apartment and move back home you get to stay right where you are i have to take a crash course in winemaking and all you have to do is socialize and go to a few meetings now and then you think thats easier socializing involves people i dont like people and while im going to meetings about things i dont give a rats ass about some guy i dont even know is going to be looking over my shoulder mine too she snapped back who the hell is this david cutter a suit ty said in disgust more than that sophia murmured if shed believed that she wouldnt have been concerned she knew how to handle suits well just have to find out how much more that was something she could take care of very shortly and very thoroughly and were going to have to find a way to work with him and each other the last part shouldnt be that hard weve known each other for years she was moving fast where he preferred to pace himself but damned if he wasnt going to keep up no we havent i dont know you or what you do or why you do it she put her palms on the table leaned forward her magnificent face moved close to his sophia tereza maria giambelli i market wine and i do it because im good at it and in one year im going to own twenty percent of one of the biggest most successful and important wine companies in the world he rose slowly mimicked her pose youre going to have to be good at it and a lot more for that youre going to have to get your hands dirty and get mud on your designer boots and ruin your pretty manicure do you think i dont know how to work macmillan i think you know how to sit behind a desk or on a firstclass seat on a plane that superior ass of yours isnt going to find life so cozy for the next year giambelli she saw the red haze at the edges of her vision a sure sign temper was taking over and she was about to do something foolish side bet five thousand dollars says im a better winemaker than you are executive at the end of the season who decides neutral party david cutter done he reached over and gripped her slim hand in his big hard one buy yourself some rough clothes and some boots that were made for work instead of fashion be ready to start your first lesson tomorrow seven am fine she set her teeth well break at noon head down to the city for your first lesson you can take an hour out to buy some decent suits that have been tailored in the last decade youre supposed to move here why do we have to go to the city because i need a number of things in my office and you need to be familiarized with the routine there i also need things from my apartment youve got a strong back and your ass isnt bad either she added smiling thinly you can help me move ive got something to say well goodness let me prepare myself i dont like your mouth never did he jammed his hands in his pockets because when she smirked as she was doing now he really just wanted to pop her one but ive got nothing against you oh ty thats so touching look just shut up he dragged a hand through his hair jammed it back in his pocket you do what you do because youre good at it i do what i do because i love it its all ive ever wanted to do i got nothing against you sophia but if it looks like youre going to cost me my vines ill cut you out intrigued and challenged she studied him from a new angle whod have thought the boy next door could be ruthless all right so warned and same goes ty whatever i have to do i protect whats mine blowing out a breath she looked down at the contracts then lifted her gaze back to his i guess were on the same page here looks that way got a pen no she walked to a server found two in a drawer she offered him one flipped through her contract to the signature page i guess we can witness each others she drew a deep breath held it on three one two three in silence they signed slid contracts across the table witnessed because her stomach was churning sophia topped off their glasses waited for tyler to lift his to the new generation she said to a good season we wont have one without the other with her eyes on his she clinked glasses salute chapter four contents prev next the rain was razorthin and mean with cold a miserable drizzle that sliced through the bones and into the spirit it turned the light blanket of snow into a mire of mud and the dawn light into a gloomy smear on the sky it was the sort of morning when a reasonable person snuggled in bed or at the very least lingered over a second cup of coffee tyler macmillan sophia discovered was not a reasonable person the phone woke her had her sliding a hand reluctantly out of the covers groping for the receiver then dragging it under the warmth with her what youre late huh i am not its still dark its not dark its raining get up get dressed get out and get over here youre on my time now but the drone of the dial tone made her scowl bastard she muttered but she couldnt dram up enough energy to put any punch into it she lay still listening to the hiss of rain on the windows it sounded as if it had ice around the edges and wouldnt that be pleasant yawning she tossed back the covers and got out of bed she might have been on his time now she thought but before long hed be on hers the rain dripped off the bill of tys cap and occasionally snuck under his collar to slide down his back still it wasnt heavy enough to stop the work and a rainy winter was a blessing a cool wet winter was the first crucial step toward a rare vintage he would control what he could control the work the decisions the precautions and the gambles and he would pray that nature got on board with the team the team he thought hooking his thumbs in his pockets and watching sophia trudge through the mud in her fivehundreddollar boots that had increased by one i told you to wear rough clothes she puffed out a breath watched the rain dissolve it these are my rough clothes he studied her sleek leather jacket the tailored trousers the stylish italian boots well they will be before its over i was under the impression rain delayed pruning its not raining oh sophia held out a hand palm up and let the rain patter into it isnt that strange ive always defined this wet substance falling out of the sky as rain its drizzling wheres your hat i didnt wear one jesus annoyed he pulled his own cap off tugged it over her head even its wet battered ugliness couldnt detract from her style he imagined it was bred into her like bones there are two primary reasons for pruning he began ty im aware there are reasons for pruning fine explain them to me to train the vine she said between her teeth and if were going to have an oral lesson why cant we do it inside where wed be warm and dry because the vines are outside and because he thought here he ran the show we prune to train the vines to facilitate their shape for easier cultivation and harvesting and to control disease ty quiet a lot of vineyards use trellising techniques instead of hand pruning here because farmings an unending experiment we use both vertical trellising the geneva tsupport and other types but we still use the traditional handpruning method the second purpose is to distribute the bearing wood over the vine to increase its production while keeping it consistent with the ability to produce topquality fruit when he told her to be quiet he did so like a patient parent might to a small irritable child she imagined he knew it and fluttered her lashes is there going to be a quiz professor you dont prune my vines or learn trellising until you know why youre doing it we prune and trellis to grow grapes we grow grapes to make wine her hands moved as she spoke it was like a ballet hed always thought graceful and full of meaning and she continued i sell the wine through clever innovative promotion and marketing techniques which ill remind you are as essential to this vineyard as your pruning shears fine but were in the vineyard not in your office you dont take an action here without being aware of the cause and the consequence ive always thought it more being aware of the odds its a gamble she said gesturing widely a highstakes game but a game at the core you play games for fun she smiled now and reminded him of her grandmother not the way i play them sweetheart these are older vines here she studied the rows on either side of them the rain was dampening his hair teasing out those reddish highlights the color of a good aged cabernet head pruning here then why she adjusted the bill of the cap because because he continued taking his pruners out of their sheath on his belt we want the bearing spurs distributed evenly on the head of the vine he turned her slapped the tool in her hands he pushed a cane aside exposing another then guided her hands toward it and made the cut with her we want the center the top left open it needs room to get enough sun what about mechanical pruning we do that too you dont he shifted her to the next cane she smelled female he decided an exotic counterpoint to the simple perfume of rain and damp earth why the hell did she have to splash on perfume to work in the fields he nearly asked her realized he wouldnt like or understand her reasons and let it go you work by hand he told her and did his level best not to breathe her in cane by cane plant by plant row by row she scanned the endless stream of them the countless vines being tended by laborers or waiting to be tended the pruning she knew would run through january into february she imagined herself bored senseless with the process before christmas we break at noon she reminded him one you were late not that late she turned her head and her body angled into his he was leaning over her his arms around her so that his hands could cover hers on cane and tool the slight shift was uncalculated and potent their eyes met irritation in his consideration in hers she felt his body tense and the tingle of response inside her own a slightly quickened pulse a kind of instinctive scenting of the air and the resulting stir of juices well well she all but purred it and let her gaze skim down to his mouth then back again whod have thought it cut it out he straightened up took a step back as a man would on finding himself unexpectedly at the edge of a very long drop but she simply continued her turn so that their bodies brushed again and a second step back would have marked him a coward or a fool dont worry macmillan youre not my type big rough elemental usually youre not mine sharp slick dangerous ever if hed known her better hed have realized such a statement wasnt an insult to her but a challenge her mild and purely elemental interest climbed up another level really what is i dont like cocky aggressive women with fancy edges she grinned you will she turned back to the canes well break at twelvethirty once again she looked over her shoulder at him compromise were going to have to do a lot of it to get through this season twelvethirty he pulled off his gloves held them out to her wear these youll get blisters on those citygirl hands thanks theyre too big make do tomorrow you bring your own and you wear a hat no not there he said as she started to clip another cane he moved in behind her again put his hands over hers and angled the tool correctly and didnt see her slow satisfied smile despite the gloves she got the blisters they were more annoying than painful as she did a quick change for the afternoon in the city dressed and polished she grabbed her briefcase and called out a goodbye as she dashed out the door during the short drive to macmillan she ran over her needs and obligations for the rest of the day she was going to have to pack quite a bit into a very short amount of time she zipped up to the front entrance of the sprawling cedarandfieldstone house gave two quick toots of the horn he didnt keep her waiting which pleased her and he had changed she noted so that counted for something though the denim shirt and comfortably faded jeans were a long level down from what she considered casual office wear she decided to tackle his wardrobe later he opened the door of her bmw convertible scowled at her and the ragtop you expect me to fold myself into this little toy its roomier than it looks come on youre on my time now couldnt you have driven one of the fourwheels he complained as he levered himself into the passenger seat he looked she thought like a big cranky jack in a very small spiffy box yes but i didnt besides i like driving my own car she proved it the minute his seat belt was secured by punching the gas and flying down the drive she liked the glimpses of mountain through the rain like shadows behind a silver curtain and the row upon row of naked vines waiting just waiting for sun and warmth to lure them into life again she sped past the macmillan winery its faded brick upholstered with vines its gables proud and stern it was to her a romantic and lovely entrance to the mysteries of the caves it guarded inside as inside the winery at giambelli workers would be lifting twisting the aging bottles of champagne or readying the tasting room if there was a tour or wine club scheduled for the day others might be transferring wine from vat to vat as it cleared and clarified there was work she knew in the buildings in the caves in the plants even as the vines slept and she thought there was work for her in san francisco she was racing out of the valley like a woman breaking out of jail ty wondered if she felt that way why is my seat warm your what oh she glanced over laughing just my little way of warming your ass up darling dont like it she clicked the button turned off the heated seat our top priority she began is the centennial campaign there are a lot of stages some of which like the auction earlier this week are already implemented others are still on the drawing board were looking for something fresh but that also honors tradition something classy and discreet that appeals to our highend and or more mature accounts and something kicky that catches the interest of the younger and or less affluent market yeah right ty this is something you have to understand the causes and consequences of as well selling the wine is every bit as essential as what you do otherwise youre just making it for yourself arent you he shifted tried to find room for his legs sure would be easier that way look you make different levels of wine the superior grade that costs more to produce more to bottle more to store and so on and your middle of the line right down to the jug wine more goes in the process than the wine without the wine nothing else matters be that as it may she said with what she considered heroic patience its part of my job and now yours to help sell those grades to the consumer the individual consumer and the big accounts hotels restaurants to pull in the wine merchants the brokers and make them see they must have giambelli or what will now be giambellimacmillan on their list to do that i have to sell the package as well as whats inside the bottle the packagings fluff he said eyeing her deliberately its whats inside that tips the scales thats a very clever and subtle insult you get a point however packaging marketing promotion are what up the product on the scale to begin with with people and with wine lets stick with wine for the moment shall we his lips twitched her tone had gone frigid and keen a sure sign hed indeed scored a point sure i have to make the idea of the product intriguing exclusive accessible substantial fun sexy so i have to know the product and there were on even ground but i also have to know the account and the market im targeting thats what you have to learn surveys statistics parties polls meetings she reached over and patted his hand youll live through it she paused slowed down slightly do you recognize that van he frowned squinting through the windshield as a dark latemodel minivan turned on the road up ahead into the entrance to villa giambelli no cutter sophia muttered i just bet its cutter we could put off the trip to san francisco and find out it was tempting and the hope in tys voice amused her still she shook her head and kept on driving no that would make him too important besides ill grill my mother when i get home i want in that loop for better or worse ty you and i are in this together ill keep you in my loop you keep me in yours it was a long way from coast to coast it was in some ways another world a world where everyone was a stranger hed ripped out the roots hed managed to sink into new york concrete with the hope he could plant them here in the hills and valleys of northern california if it had been that only that david wouldnt have been worried hed have found it an adventure a thrill the kind of freewheeling gamble hed have jumped at in his youth but when a man was fortythree and had two teenagers depending on him there was a great deal at stake if hed been certain remaining with la coeur in new york was what was best for his kids hed have stayed there hed have stifled there trapped in the glass and steel of his office but hed stopped being sure when his sixteenyearold son had been picked up for shoplifting and his fourteenyearold daughter had started painting her toenails black hed been losing touch with his kids and in losing touch losing control when the offer from giambellimacmillan had fallen in his lap it had seemed like a sign take a chance start fresh god knew it wouldnt be the first time hed done both but this time he did so with his kids happiness tossed into the ante this place is in the middle of nowhere david glanced in the rearview mirror at his son maddy had won the toss in san francisco and sat desperately trying to look bored in the front seat how david asked can nowhere have a middle ive always wondered that he had the pleasure of seeing theo smirk the closest he came to a genuine smile these days he looks like his mother david thought a young male version of sylvia which david knew neither theo nor sylvia would appreciate they had that in common as well both of them bound and determined to be seen as individuals for sylvia that had meant stepping out of marriage and away from motherhood for theo time david supposed would tell why does it have to be raining maddy slumped in her seat and tried not to let her eyes gleam with excitement as she studied the huge stone mansion in front of the car well it has something to do with moisture gathering in the atmosphere then dad she giggled and to david it was music he was going to get his children back here whatever it took lets go meet la signora do we have to call her that maddy rolled her eyes its so medieval lets start out with ms giambelli and work from there and lets try to look normal mad cant geeks never look normal neither do freaks maddy clumped out of the car on her ugly black boots with their twoinch platforms she stood in the rain looking to her father like some sort of eccentric princess with her long pale hair pouty lips and longlashed blue eyes her little body she was still such a little thing was draped and swathed in layers of black there were three silver chains dangling from her right ear a compromise as david had been terrified when shed started campaigning to have her nose or somewhere even more unsanitary pierced theo was a dark contrast tall gangly with his deep brown hair a curling unkempt mass around his pretty face straggling toward his still bony shoulders his eyes were a softer blue and too often for his fathers taste clouded and unhappy he slouched now in jeans that were too baggy shoes nearly as ugly as his sisters and a jacket that sagged past his hips just clothes david reminded himself clothes and hair nothing permanent hadnt his own parents nagged him into rebellion about his personal style when hed been a teenager and hadnt he promised himself he wouldnt do the same with his kids but god he wished theyd at least wear clothes that fit he walked up the wide fan of steps then stood in front of the deeply carved front door of the villa and dragged a hand through his own thick dark blond hair whats the matter dad nervous there was a smirk in his sons voice just enough of one to strain the wire holding davids composure together give me a break okay theo opened his mouth a sarcastic retort on the tip of his tongue but he caught the warning look his sister gave him and saw his fathers strained expression hey you can handle her sure maddy shrugged shes just an old italian woman right with a halflaugh david punched his finger to the buzzer right wait i gotta get my normal face on theo put his hands on his face shoving pulling at the skin drawing his eyes down twisting his mouth i cant find it david hooked an arm around his neck and the other around maddys they were going to be all right he thought and held on they were going to be fine ill get it maria pilar dashed down the foyer a spray of white roses in her arms when she opened the door she saw a tall man holding two children in headlocks all three of them were grinning hello can i help you not an old italian woman david thought as he hastily released his children just a beautiful woman with surprise in her eyes and roses lying in the crook of her arm im here to see ms giambelli pilar smiled scanned the faces of the boy and girl to include them there are so many of us tereza giambelli im david cutter oh mr cutter im sorry she held out a hand for his i didnt realize you were expected today or that you had a family she thought her mother hadnt been forthcoming with details please come in im pilar pilar giambelli she nearly added her married name a force of habit then determinedly let it go la signoras daughter do you call her that maddy asked sometimes when you meet her youll see why madeline my daughter my son theodore theo theo mumbled im delighted to meet you theo and madeline maddy okay maddy come into the parlor theres a nice fire ill arrange for some refreshments if that suits you such a nasty day i hope it wasnt a terrible trip not so bad endless maddy corrected awful but she stared at the room when they entered it was like a palace she thought like a picture in a book where everything was in rich colors and looked old and precious i bet it was let me have your coats theyre wet david began but she simply plucked them out of his hand and draped them over her free arm ill take care of them please sit make yourselves at home ill let my mother know youre here and see about something hot to drink would you like coffee mr cutter i absolutely would ms giambelli so would i no you wouldnt he said to maddy and had her sulking again a latte perhaps thats cool i mean she corrected when her fathers elbow reminded her of her manners yes thank you and theo yes maam thank you itll just take a minute man theo waited until pilar was safely out of the room then plopped into a chair they must be megarich this place looks like a museum or something dont put your boots up on that david ordered its a footstool theo pointed out once you put feet into those boots they cease to be feet chill dad maddy gave him a bracing and distressingly adult pat on the back youre like coo and everything right from executive vice president operations to chief operating officer in one threethousandmile leap bullets bounce off me he murmured then turned toward the doorway when he heard footsteps he started to tell his kids to stand up but he didnt have to bother when tereza giambelli walked into a room people got to their feet hed forgotten she was so petite theyd had two meetings in new york facetoface two long involved meetings and still hed walked away from them with the image of a statuesque amazon rather than the fineboned slim woman who walked toward him now the hand she offered him was small and strong mr cutter welcome to villa giambelli thank you signora you have a beautiful home in a magnificent setting my family and i are grateful for your hospitality pilar stepped into the room in time to hear the smooth speech and see the practiced formality with which it was delivered it was not she thought what shed expected from the man holding two travelrumpled teenagers in playful headlocks not she decided noting the sidelong glances from his children what they were used to from him i hope the trip wasnt tedious tereza continued shifting her attention to the children not at all we enjoyed it signora giambelli id like to introduce you to my children my son theodore and my daughter madeline welcome to california she offered her hand to theo and though he felt foolish he shook it and resisted sticking his own in his pocket thanks maddy accepted the hand its nice to be here you hope it will be tereza said with a hint of a smile thats enough for now please sit be comfortable pilar youll join us of course you must be proud of your father tereza began as she took a seat and all hes accomplished ah sure theo sat remembered not to slouch he didnt know much about his fathers work in his world his dad went to the office then came home he nagged about schoolwork burned dinner sent for takeout or mostly during the last year had called home and said hed be late and theo or maddy should call for takeout theos more interested in music than wine or the business of wine david commented ah and you play this was his fathers deal theo thought how come he had to answer so many questions adults didnt get it anyway guitar and piano you must play for me sometime i enjoy music what sort do you prefer theres just rock i go for techno and alternative theo writes music david put in and surprised a blink out of his son its interesting material id like to hear it once everyones settled and you tereza said to maddy do you play i had piano lessons she shrugged a shoulder im not really into it i want to be a scientist her brothers snort had her temper rising maddys interested in everything david spoke quickly before blood could be shed the high school here from what ive been told should speak to both her and theos specific interests very well arts and science tereza leaned back they take after their father then as wine is both i assume youll want a few days to settle in she continued as a cart was wheeled in a new position a new location new people and of course a new school and routine for your family dad says its an adventure maddy said and earned a stately nod from tereza and well try to make it so im at your disposal signora david said and watched pilar as she rose to serve coffees and cakes i appreciate again the use of your guest house im sure settling in will be a pleasure because he was watching her he caught the quick widening of pilars eyes so he thought that one comes as a surprise to you i wonder why thanks enjoy pilar murmured when the coffee was served they fell into light conversation david followed terezas lead and left business out of it time enough he concluded to get to the meat in precisely twenty minutes tereza got to her feet i regret my husband was unavailable to see you today and meet your charming children would it be convenient for you to meet with us tomorrow at your convenience signora david rose at eleven then pilar will you show the cutters the guest house and see they have all they need certainly ill just get our coats what the hell was this pilar wondered as she retrieved jackets normally she had her finger on the pulse of the household yet her mother had managed to slip an entire family in on her without sending up a single alarm so many changes and practically overnight it was time she paid more attention she decided she didnt care for the order of things to change when she wasnt prepared for it still she conversed easily when she returned and geared herself up to play gracious hostess its a short drive an easy walk really in good weather winter rains good for the grapes david took her jacket helped her into it yes so im reminded whenever i complain about the wet she stepped outside theres a direct line from house to house so youve only to call if you need anything or have a question our housekeepers maria and theres nothing she cant do thank you she added when david opened the side door of the van for her youll have wonderful views she added shifting around to speak to the children when they climbed in the back from whichever bedrooms you choose and theres a pool of course you wont be able to enjoy that just now but youre welcome to use the indoor pool here at the main house whenever you like an indoor pool theos mood brightened cool that doesnt mean you drop in wearing your bathing trunks whenever you feel like it his father warned you dont want to give them the run of the house ms giambelli youll be in therapy in a week hasnt worked for you theo shot back well enjoy having young people around and its pilar please david behind their backs maddy turned to her brother and fluttered her lashes wildly david just take the left fork you can see the house there its a pretty place and the rain gives it a bit of a fairytale aspect is that it suddenly interested theo leaned up its pretty big four bedrooms five baths theres a lovely living room but the kitchen great room is friendlier i think anybody cook dad pretends to maddy said and we pretend to eat it smartass do you david asked pilar cook yes and very well but rarely well perhaps your wife will enjoy the kitchen when she joins you the instant and absolute silence had pilar cringing inside im divorced david pulled up in front of the house its just the three of us lets check it out well get the stuff later im very sorry pilar murmured when the kids bolted from the van i shouldnt have assumed natural assumption a man a couple of kids you expect the full family complement dont worry about it he patted her hand casually then reached across to open her door you know theyre going to have to fight over the bedrooms i hope you dont mind screaming scenes im italian was all she said and stepped out into the rain chapter five contents prev next italian david thought later and gorgeous aloof and gracious at the same time not an easy trick in that area she was her mothers daughter he knew how to read people an invaluable trick of the trade in the climb up the slippery executive ladder in any major corporation his read of pilar giambelli was that she was as accustomed to giving orders as she was to taking them he knew she was married and to whom but since she hadnt been wearing a ring he assumed the marriage to the infamous tony avano was over or in serious trouble hed have to find out which before he let himself consider her on a more personal level there was a daughter anyone in the business had heard of sophia giambelli a firecracker by reputation who had style and ambition in spades hed be meeting her along the way and wondered just how shed taken to his induction as coo might have to play some politics there he mused and reached for the cigarettes in his pocket only to remember they werent there because hed quit three weeks and five days earlier and it was killing him think about something else he ordered himself and tuned in to the music played at a brutal volume in his sons new room thank god it was at the other end of the hall thered been the expected combat over bedrooms still his kids had been fairly restrained all in all he put that down to reluctant manners in front of a stranger in any case the squabble had been out of habit and without real heat as every room in the house was appealing damn near perfect he thought with its gleaming wood and tile silky walls and lush furnishings the perfection the casually elegant style the absolute order of things gave him the willies but he expected the kids would soon put that to rights tidy they werent so however polished the box the contents would soon be jumbled and theyd all feel more at home already weary of unpacking he wandered to one of the windows and stared out over the fields pilar was right the view was stunning this was part of his turf now he intended to leave his mark down the hall maddy wandered out of her room shed tried to act casual about it after arguing with theo over who got what the fact was she was thrilled for the first time in her life she didnt have to share a bathroom with her idiot brother and hers was done in this cool pattern of dark blues and deep reds big splashy flowers so she imagined taking a bath there would be like swimming in some weird garden plus she had a huge fourposter bed shed locked the door so she could roll all over it in privacy then shed remembered that she wouldnt see new york when she looked out the windows or be able to call one of her friends and hang out she wouldnt be able to walk to the movies whenever she felt like it she wouldnt be able to do anything she was used to doing homesickness had settled so hot and heavy in her belly it ached the only person she could talk to was theo it was the poorest of choices in her opinion but the only one left she pushed open his door to a blast of the chemical brothers he was lying on his bed his guitar across his chest as he tried to match the guitar riff blasting on his stereo the room was already in chaos as she imagined it would stay until he moved out to go to college he was such a pig youre supposed to be unpacking youre supposed to mind your own business she flopped stomach down on the foot of his bed theres nothing to do here you just figuring that out maybe dadll hate it and well go home no chance did you see how he slicked up for the old lady because he felt homesick too he set his guitar aside and opted to speak to the bane of his existence whats up with that he sounded like something out of a movie you know how he looks when he puts on one of his suits for a meeting she rolled over on her back he sounded like he looks then nothings going to be the same now he was looking at that woman huh the pilar woman what kind of a name is that i guess its italian or something what do you mean looking at her you know scoping her out get out man guys dont notice anything feeling superior she sat up tossed back her hair he was checking her out so what theo gave a little jerk of the body a horizontal shrug hes checked out women before hey i bet hes even had sex with some of them gee you think while the sarcasm dripped she pushed off the bed to pace to the window rain and vines vines and rain maybe if he has sex with his bosss daughter hell get caught hell get fired and well go back home home where he loses his job weve got no place to go grow up maddy she hunched her shoulders this sucks tell me about it ty was thinking the same thing about life in general as sophia whipped him into a meeting a brainstorming session she called it shed rattled off names at him as shed zipped through the advertising section gesturing calling out orders and greetings snatching up messages as she went he remembered none of the names of course and the faces had all been a blur as hed kept pace with sophia the woman moved like a linebacker with an intercepted ball in her hand fast and slick there were three other people in the room now all what he thought of as urban warriors with their trendy clothes and trendy hair and little wirerim glasses and electronic palm books two were female one was male all were young and handsome he couldnt for the life of him remember who was who as theyd all had androgynous names he had some kind of fancy coffee in his hand he hadnt wanted and everyone was talking at once and munching on biscotti he was getting a killer headache no kris what im looking for is subtle but powerful a strong image with an emotional message trace quick sketch couple young casual late twenties relaxing on a porch sexual but keep it casual since the man with the blond choppy hair picked up the pencil and sketch pad ty assumed he was trace its sunset sophia continued rising from her desk to wander the room end of day this is a working couple no kids upwardly mobile but settled porch swing the perky black woman in a red vest suggested too settled too country wicker love seat maybe sophia said strong color in the cushions candles on the table fat ones not tapers she leaned over traces shoulder made humming noises good good but do it this way have them looking at each other maybe have her leg swung over his knees friendly intimacy roll up his sleeves put her in jeans no in khakis she sat on the edge of her desk lips pursed as she pondered i want them to be having a conversation relaxed having a moment enjoying each others company after a busy day what if one of thems pouring the wine holding the bottle well try that you want to sketch that one out pj with a nod perky pj as ty now thought of her picked up her pad you should have water the second woman a redhead who looked bored and annoyed stifled a yawn i see weve interrupted kriss nap sophia said sweetly and ty caught the quick simmering glare under the redheads lowered lashes suburban scenes bore me at least water adds an element and subliminal sexuality kris wants water sophia nodded pushed to her feet to wander the room while she considered waters good a pond a lake we can get good light from that reflections take a look ty what do you think he did his best to tune back in and look intelligent as trace turned his sketch around i dont know anything about advertising its a nice sketch you look at ads sophia reminded him all the time whether you consciously take in the message or not what does this say to you it says theyre sitting on the porch drinking wine why cant they have kids why should they you got a couple on a porch porch usually means house why cant they have kids because we dont want young kids in an ad for an alcoholic beverage kris said with a hint of a sneer in her voice advertising evidence of kids then you know some toys on the porch then it says these people have a family have been together awhile and are still happy to sit on the porch together and have a glass of wine at the end of the day thats sexy kris started to open her mouth then noted the gleam come into sophias eyes and wisely closed it again thats good thats excellent sophia said even better for this one toss toys on the porch trace keep the wine bottle on the table with the candles heres our cozy yet hip suburban couple celebrate the sunset she murmured its your moment relax with giambelli its your wine more cozy than hip kris muttered we use an urban setting for hip two couples friends getting together for an evening apartment scene keep them young keep them slick show me the city out the window lights and silhouettes coffee table pj put in already sketching a couple of them sitting on the floor the others lounging on the couch everybody talking at once you can almost hear music playing food scattered on the table takeout this is where we pour the wine good perfect celebrate tuesday same tags why tuesday ty wanted to know in spite of himself because you never make big plans for tuesday sophia slid onto the edge of the desk again crossed her legs you make plans for the weekend you fall into plans otherwise tuesday night with friends is spontaneous we want people to pick up a bottle of our wine on the spur just because its tuesday your moment your wine thats the pitch the wines giambellimacmillan she nodded correct we need to identify that as well within the campaign a wedding celebrate our marriage champagne flowers a gorgeous couple honeymoons sexier trace commented as he refined his other sketch same elements but in a snazzy hotel room wedding dress hanging on the door and our couple in a lip lock with champagne on ice if theyre in a lip lock theyre not going to be thinking about drinking ty said good point hold the kiss but the rest is great show me her hands began to move anticipation silk flowers and put the flutes in their hands give me eye lock instead of lip lock go my children and create magic see what you can get me in the next few hours think moments the special and the ordinary she recrossed her legs as her team headed out talking over one another not bad macmillan not bad at all good can we go home now no ive got a lot of stuff to deal with here and more to pack up in order to set up an office at the villa can you draw sure thats a plus she scooted off the desk to cross over and dig a sketch pad from a wall of shelves there were a lot of things on the shelves ty noted not just business junk but the knickknacks people particularly female people in his opinion seemed to collect leading the pack of the dust catchers were frogs little green frogs larger bronze frogs dancing frogs fashionably dressed frogs and what appeared to be mating frogs they didnt seem to jibe with the sleekly dressed woman who bulleted down office corridors on high heels and smelled like a night in the forest looking for a prince hmm she glanced back following his gesture oh no princes are too highmaintenance i just like frogs heres what i see a kind of montage the vineyards the sweep of them in the sunlight vines pregnant with grapes a solitary figure walking through the rows then close up enormous baskets of grapes just harvested we dont use baskets work with me here ty simplicity accessibility tradition gnarled hands holding the basket then on to the casks rows and rows of wooden casks dim light of the caves the mystery the romance a couple of interestinglooking guys in work clothes drawing out the free flow well use red a lovely spill of red wine out of a cask then different workers tasting testing then finally a bottle maybe two glasses and a corkscrew beside it from vine to table a hundred years of excellence no from our vines to your table her brow furrowed as she pictured the ad in her mind we lead with the hundred years of excellence then the montage and below from our vines to your table the giambellimacmillan tradition continues she turned back to him looked over his shoulder then let out a snort hed been sketching while she talked and the result was circles and stick men and a lopsided column she supposed was a bottle of red you said you could draw i didnt say i could draw well okay were in some trouble here sketching isnt my strong suit though compared to you im da vinci i work better when i have some visual aides she blew out a breath paced well make do ill have the team fax me sketches as we go well coordinate schedules so that we can hold a weekly session either here or at my office in the villa she dropped down on the arm of his chair frowned into space she was tuned in to her team and had sensed the undercurrents it was something she needed to deal with right away i need a half hour here why dont you head over to armani and ill meet you there why am i going to armani because you need clothes i have plenty of clothes honey your clothes are like your drawing they meet the basic definition but they arent going to win any prizes i get to outfit you then you can buy me the proper vintner attire she gave his shoulder an idle pat then rose he wanted to argue but didnt want to waste time the sooner they were finished and driving north the happier hed be wheres armani she stared at him the man had lived an hour out of san francisco for years how could he not know see my assistant shell point you in the right direction ill be right behind you one suit ty warned as he walked to the door thats it mmm they would see about that she thought it might be fun to dress him up a bit sort of like molding clay but before the fun started she had work she walked back to her desk and picked up the phone kris can i see you a minute yeah now my times pretty tight with a roll of her shoulders sophia began gathering files and disks shed worked with kris for more than four years and was very aware there had been considerable resentment when the freshoutofcollege sophia had taken over as head of the department theyd come to terms delicately but she had no doubt that kriss nose was now seriously out of joint couldnt be helped sophia thought had to be dealt with there was a brisk knock and kris stepped in sophia ive got a pile of work i know five minutes its going to be rough shuffling things around between here and napa for the next several months im in a pinch kris really you dont look pinched you didnt see me pruning vines at dawn look my grandmother has reasons for what she does and how she does them i dont always understand them and i very often dont like them but its her company i just work here right umhmm sophia stopped packing up laid her palms on her desk and met kriss eyes deadon if you think im going to enjoy juggling my time between the work i love and mucking around the vineyards youre crazy and if you think tyler is gunning for a position here in these offices think again excuse me but he now has a position in these offices and one you believe should be yours im not going to disagree with you but im telling you its temporary i need you here im not going to be able to drive down here every day im not going to be able to take all the meetings or delegate every assignment essentially kris youve just been promoted you dont get a new title but i will do everything i can to see that you get the financial compensation for the extra responsibilities that are about to be dumped on you its not about the money but money never hurts sophia finished tys position here and his title are titular he doesnt know anything about promotion and marketing kris and isnt particularly interested in either interested enough to make comments and suggestions this morning just a minute she could be patient sophia thought but she would not be pushed do you expect him to sit here like a moron hes entitled to express an opinion and it so happens he made very decent suggestions hes been tossed off the cliff without a parachute and hes coping take a lesson kris set her teeth shed been with giambelli nearly ten years and was sick to death of being passed over for their precious bloodline he has a parachute and so do you you were born with it either one of you screw up you bounce that doesnt go for the rest of us i wont go into personal family business with you i will say youre a valued member of the giambelli and now the giambellimacmillan organization im sorry if you feel your skills and talents have been overlooked or undervalued whatever i can do to correct this will be done but these adjustments must be made and over the next several months it would pay all of us to make sure we dont screw up i have to be able to depend on you if i cant i need you to let me know so that i can make other arrangements ill do my job kris turned to the door yanked it open and yours well sophia murmured when the door slammed smartly that was fun on a sigh she picked up her phone again pj i need a minute no we want classic this very subtle chalk stripe to start fine great ill take it lets go tyler sophia pursed her lips and patted his cheek go try it on like a good boy he snagged her wrist mom yes dear cut it out if youd done more than brood for the last thirty minutes on your own wed be practically out the door this one she said handing him the rich brown with narrow stripes and this she selected a classic black threepiece to cut off any complaints she wandered away from him to ponder the shirts shawn she gestured to one of the associates she knew by sight my friend mr macmillan hes going to need guidance ill take good care of him ms giambelli by the way your father and his fiancée were in just this morning really yes shopping for their honeymoon if youre looking for something special for the wedding we have a fabulous new evening jacket that would be smashing on you im a little pressed for time today she managed ill come back and see it first chance i get just let me know ill be happy to send some selections to you for approval ill just check on mr macmillan thanks she picked up a dress shirt blindly stared hard at the creamoncream pattern not wasting a minute she thought shopping for the honeymoon before the divorce is final spreading the word far and wide maybe maybe it was best shed be out of her usual loop in the city for a while she wouldnt be running into people chatting about her fathers wedding every time she turned around why was she letting it hurt her and if it did this much how much worse was it on her mother no point in raging she told herself and started through the shirts like a woman panning for gold in a fast stream no point in sulking no point in thinking she moved from shirts to ties and had a small mountain of choices when ty came out of the dressing room he looked annoyed faintly mortified and absolutely gorgeous take the farmer out of the dell she mused and just look what you got big broad shoulders narrow hips and long legs in a classic italian suit my my she angled her head approving you do clean up well macmillan leave fashion to the italians and you cant go wrong call the tailor shawn and lets get this show on the road she walked over with two shirts the creamoncream and a deep brown held them up to the jacket whats the matter ty asked her nothing both of these will do very well he took her wrist again holding it until she shifted her gaze to his whats wrong sophie nothing she repeated troubled that he could see the worry brewing inside her nothing important you look good she added working up a smile all sturdy and sexy theyre just clothes she pressed a hand to her heart staggered back a step macmillan if you can think that we have a long way to go before we get close to middle ground she plucked up a tie draped it over the shirt yes definitely how do the pants fit she began and reached down to check the waistband do you mind flustered he batted her hand away if i was going to grope id start lower why dont you put on the black suit the tailor can fuss with you he grumbled for form but was relieved to escape to the privacy of the dressing room nobody was going to fuss with him for another minute or two he wasnt attracted to sophia absolutely not but the woman had been studying him touching him he was human wasnt he a male human and hed had a perfectly natural human male reaction which he was not going to share with some tailor or a skinny clerk named shawn what he would do was calm himself back down let them measure whatever needed to be measured hed buy everything sophia pushed on him and get the ordeal over with he wished he knew what had happened between the time hed gone into the dressing area the first time and come out again whatever it was had put unhappiness into those big dark eyes of hers the kind of unhappiness that made him want to give her a shoulder to lean on that was a normal reaction too he assured himself as he stripped off the chalkstriped and put on the black he didnt like to see anything or anyone hurting still under the circumstances he was going to have to stifle any and all normal reactions to her he glanced at himself in the mirror shook his head who the hell were either of them going to fool by dressing him up in some snappy threepiece suit he was a damn farmer and happy to be one then he made the mistake of looking at the tag hed never realized a series of numbers could actually stop the heart he was still in shock and no longer remotely aroused when shawn came chirpily into the dressing room with the tailor in tow consider it an investment sophia advised as she drove out of the city and north and darling you did look fabulous shut up im not talking to you god he was cute she thought who knew didnt i buy everything you told me to buy even that ugly flannel shirt yeah and what did it cost you shirts some trousers a hat and boots under five hundred bucks my bill came to nearly twenty times that i cant believe i got hosed for ten thousand dollars youll look every inch the successful executive you know if i met you when you were wearing that black suit id want you is that so he tried to stretch out his legs in the little car and failed i wasnt wearing it this morning and you wanted me no i had a momentary lust surge entirely different but theres something about a man in a wellcut threepiece suit that does it for me what does it for you naked women im a simple man she laughed and pleased to be on the open road punched the gas no youre not i thought you were but youre not you did well in the office today you held your own words and pictures he shrugged whats the big deal oh now dont spoil it ty i didnt say anything before we went in because i didnt want your impressions to be colored with my opinions or my experience but i think i should give you a basic personality rundown of the people youll work most closely with on my end the guy goes along hes got a good brain for what he does and likes the work probably single so he doesnt have someone pushing him in the ambition department and he likes working around attractive women close enough impressed she glanced over at him and a good thumbnail for someone who claims not to like people not liking them much doesnt mean i cant read them perky pj now he trailed off as she glanced his way and laughed what he said perky pj thats perfect yeah well shes got a lot of energy you intimidate her but she tries not to let it show she wants to be you when she grows up but shes young enough to change her mind about that shes easy to work with shell take whatever you toss at her and make it shine shes good at finding fresh angles and shes learned not to be afraid to squash an idea one of us lobs that doesnt hit the mark with her if you run into snags that im not around to untangle you should go to her because the redhead already hates my guts ty finished and doesnt think much of yours either she doesnt want to be you when she grows up she wants to be you now and she wouldnt mind if you had a sudden bloody accident that took you out so she could step into your shoes and run the show you did get a lot out of your first day in school kris is good really good with concepts with campaigns and when its something she believes in with details shes not a good manager because she rubs people wrong and tends to be highhanded with other members of the staff and youre right at the moment she hates you just because you exist in what she considers her space its not personal yeah it is its always personal it doesnt worry me but if i were you id watch my back shed like to leave her heel marks all over your ass shes tried and shes failed idly sophia tapped her fingernails on the steering wheel im a great deal tougher than people think i am i got that already ty settled back as best he could theyd see how tough she was after a few weeks in the field it was going to be a long chilly winter chapter six contents prev next pilar was nearly asleep finally when the phone rang at two am she shot up in bed snatching at the phone as her heart slammed into her throat an accident death tragedy hello yes you ignorant bitch do you think you can scare me off what her hand trembled as she raked it through her hair im not going to tolerate you or your pitiful attempts at harassment who is this she groped for the light then blinked in the sudden flash you know damn well who it is you got a fucking nerve calling me spouting off your filth shut up tony ill say what i have to say rene recognizing her husbands placating voice in the background pilar struggled to clear her head to think over the wild drumming of her heart what is this whats the matter just cut the goddamn innocent act it might work with tony but it doesnt with me i know what you are youre the whore sweetheart not me youre the fucking liar the fucking hypocrite if you ever call here again i didnt call fighting for calm pilar dragged the covers up to her chin i dont know what youre talking about either you or your bitch of a daughter and its all the same to me get this straight youre out of the picture and you have been for years youre a frigid driedup excuse for a woman fiftyyearold virgin tony and i have already seen the lawyers and were making legal what everyones known for years there isnt a man out there who wants you unless its for your mothers money rene rene stop stop now pilar pilar heard tonys voice through the rush of blood in her head why are you doing this im sorry someone called here said perfectly vile things to rene shes very upset he had to shout over the shrieks of course i told her youd never do such a thing but she shes upset he repeated sounding frazzled i have to go ill call you tomorrow shes upset pilar whispered and began to rock as the dial tone buzzed in her ear of course she has to be soothed what about me what about me she hung up the phone tossed back the covers before she gave in to her first instinct and curled into a defensive ball under them she was trembling as she yanked on a robe as she dug deep into her lingerie drawer for her secret emergency pack of cigarettes stuffing them in a pocket she pushed through the french doors and rushed out into the night she needed air she needed a cigarette she needed pilar thought as she ran across her terrace and down the stone steps peace wasnt it enough that the only man shed loved the only man shed ever given herself to hadnt cherished her hadnt respected her enough to keep his vows did she have to be plagued now by her latest replacement awakened in the middle of the night and screamed at sworn at she strode away from the house through the gardens keeping to the shadows so that if anyone in the house was awake they wouldnt see her through the windows pretenses she thought furious to find her cheeks were wet we must maintain pretenses at all cost wouldnt do to have one of the servants see ms giambelli smoking in the shrubbery in the middle of the night wouldnt do for anyone to see ms giambelli doing her best to stave off a nervous breakdown with tobacco a dozen people might have called rene she thought bitterly and she very likely deserved the abuse tossed out at her by each and every one from the tone of tonys voice pilar knew he had a pretty good idea just whod made the call easier she supposed bitterly to let rene believe it was the discarded wife rather than a more current lover easier to let the longsuffering pilar take the slaps and the insults im not fifty she muttered fighting with her lighter or a goddamn virgin me neither she whirled dropping the lighter with a little crash of metal on stone temper warred with humiliation as david cutter stepped from shadow to moonlight im sorry i startled you he bent down for her lighter but i thought i should let you know i was here before you continued your conversation he flicked the lighter on studying her tearstained cheeks and damp lashes in the flare her hands were shaking so he steadied them i couldnt sleep he continued new place new bed took a little walk want me to keep on walking it was breeding she supposed that prevented her from a fast undignified retreat i dont smoke officially neither do i still he took a deep appreciative sniff of the smokestung air quit its killing me ive never smoked officially so i occasionally sneak outside and sin your secrets safe with me im very discreet sometimes venting to a stranger works wonders when she only shook her head he tucked his thumbs into the pockets of his jeans well its a nice night after the rain want to walk she wanted to run back inside bury herself under the covers until this new mortification passed she had plenty of reason to know embarrassments faded quicker when you stood up and moved on so she walked with him are you and your family settling in she asked as they fell into step together were fine period of adjustment my son got into some trouble in new york kid stuff but there was a pattern to it i wanted to change the canvas i hope theyll be happy here so do i he dug a handkerchief out of his jeans silently passed it to her im looking forward to getting a good look at the vineyards tomorrow theyre spectacular now with a bit of moon and a hint of frost youre good at this she murmured at pretending you didnt come across an hysterical woman in the middle of the night you didnt look hysterical you looked sad and angry and beautiful he thought white robe black night like a stylized photograph i had an upsetting phone call is someone hurt no one but me and thats my own fault she stopped stooped to crush the cigarette and bury it under the mulch on the side of the path then she turned took a long look at him it was a good face she decided a strong chin clear eyes blue eyes she remembered deep blue that looked nearly black in the night the faintest smile on his lips now told her he knew she was examining considering and was patient and confident enough to let her and she remembered the way hed been grinning when hed had his arms around his children a man who loved his children understood them enough to point out their interests to strangers as he had to her mother inspired pilars trust in any case it was difficult to maintain pretenses when you were standing in your robe with that man in the middle of the night make up your mind he asked her i suppose in any case youre all but living with the family so youll hear things my husband and i have been separated for a number of years he informed me recently very recently that we are getting divorced his bridetobe is very young beautiful sharpedged and very young she said again with a halflaugh its ridiculous i suppose how much that part bothers me in any case its an awkward and difficult situation itll be more awkward and difficult for him if he ever takes a good look at what he let go it took her a moment to adjust to the compliment thats very kind of you no its not youre beautiful elegant and interesting and not used to hearing it he realized as she simply stared at him that too was interesting thats a lot for a man to let go divorce is tough he added a kind of death especially if you took it seriously to begin with even when all youve got left of it is the illusion its a hell of a shock to watch it shatter yes she felt comforted yes it is ive just been informed that the lawyers will legalize the end of my marriage very shortly so i suppose id better start picking up the pieces maybe you should just sweep a few of them out of the way he touched her shoulder leaving his fingers there lightly when he felt her tense and shift slightly away its the middle of the night some of the daylight rules dont apply at three in the morning so im going to tell you straight out im very attracted to you she felt a little clutch in her belly whether it was pleasure or anxiety she hadnt a clue thats very flattering its not flattery its fact flatterys what you get from a guy at a cocktail party whos thinking about making a move on you i ought to know he grinned at her now wide and easy the way hed been grinning when shed first seen him the clutch came again harder and deeper this time she realized stupefied that it was pure animal attraction ive scooped out plenty of flattery along the way just as i imagine youve deflected plenty so im telling you straight now the grin faded and his eyes dark in the shadows went quiet serious the minute you opened the door today it was like i was hit by a thunderbolt i havent felt that in a long time david she took another step back then came up short when he reached for her hand im not going to put any of those moves on you but i thought about it he continued to watch her steady intense while her pulse began to sprint which is probably why i couldnt sleep we barely know each other and im a fiftyyearold virgin no she thought she damn well wasnt but close close enough true enough i didnt intend to bring this up quite so soon but it seemed the moment a beautiful woman in a white robe a sprinkle of moonlight in a garden you cant ask a man to resist everything besides it gives you something to think about yes it certainly does i should go will you have dinner with me he brought her hand to his lips it seemed like the moment for that too enjoyed the light tremor of it the subtle scent soon i dont know she tugged her hand from his and felt like a foolish and fumbling young girl i good night she rushed back down the path and was breathless by the time she reached the steps her stomach was fluttering her heart skipping in her chest they were sensations she hadnt experienced in so long it was almost embarrassing but she no longer felt angry and no longer felt sad it was just midnight in new york when jeremy demorney took the call he considered the person on the other end of the phone no more than a tool one to be wielded as necessary im ready ready to move to the next stage well smiling jerry poured himself a snifter of brandy its taken you a considerable amount of time to make up your mind i have a lot to lose and more to gain giambellis using you and theyll toss you out without a flinch if it suits their purposes you know it i know it my position is still secure the reorganization hasnt changed that for the moment youd hardly be calling me if you werent concerned im tired of it thats all im tired of not being appreciated for my efforts i dont care to be watched over and evaluated by strangers naturally sophia giambelli and tyler macmillan are being groomed to step into the traditional shoes whether they earn it or not theyll wear them now theres david cutter a smart individual la coeur is sorry to lose him hell be taking a serious look at all areas of the company a serious look that could very well turn up certain discrepancies ive been careful no ones ever careful enough what do you intend to bring to the table now its going to have to be more than the ante we discussed previously the centennial if theres trouble during the merger bleeding over to the next banner year it will eat at the foundation of the company there are things i can do poisoning an old man for instance that was an accident the panic the hint of whine in the tone made jerry smile it was all so perfect is that what you call it it was your idea you said it would only make him ill oh i have a lot of ideas idly jerry examined his nails la coeur paid him for his ideas his less radical ideas as much as they did because his name was demorney you implemented it friend and bungled it how was i to know he had a weak heart as i said no ones ever careful enough if you were going to kill someone you should have gone for the old woman herself with her gone they couldnt plug the holes in the dike as fast as we could drill them im not a murderer i beg to differ youre exactly that jerry thought and because of it youll do anything everything i want now i wonder if the italian police would be interested enough to exhume baptistas body and run tests if they happened to get an informative and anonymous call youve killed jerry said after a long pause youd better be prepared to do whatevers necessary to back yourself up if you want my help and my financial backing to continue youll start showing me what you can do for me you can begin by getting me copies of everything the legal papers the contracts the plans for the ad campaign every step of it the vintners logs venice and napa itll be risky itll take time youll be paid for the risk and the time he was a patient man a wealthy one and could afford both would invest both to bury the giambellis dont contact me again until you have something useful i need money i cant get what you ask without give me something i can use then ill give you payment cod friend thats how it works theyre grapevines big deal theyre going to be a big deal for us the grapevines david informed his sulking son are whats going to buy your burgers and fries for the foreseeable future are they going to buy my car david glanced in the rearview mirror dont push your luck pal dad you cant live out here in nowheresville without wheels the minute you stop breathing ill check out the nearest usedcar lot three months before hell david thought three weeks before that comment would have resulted in his sons frozen silence or a snide remark the fact that theos response was to clutch his throat bug out his eyes and collapse gasping on the backseat warmed his fathers heart i knew we shouldve taken those cpr classes david said absently as he turned into macmillan wineries its okay he goes its more fries for us maddy didnt mind being out early she didnt mind driving around the hills and valleys what she did mind was having nothing to do her greatest hope at the moment was that her father would break down and buy theo a car then she could nag her brother to drive her somewhere anywhere pretty place david stopped the van got out to look over the fields and the workers steadily pruning vines in the frosty morning and this all this my children he continued sliding an arm around each of them when they joined him will never be yours maybe one of them has a babe for a daughter well get married then youll work for me david shuddered youre scaring me theo lets go check it out ty spotted the trio heading down through the rows and swore under his breath tourists he thought hoping for a tour and a friendly guide he didnt have time to be friendly and he didnt want outsiders in his fields he started to cut over to head them off stopped and studied sophia this he decided was her turf let her deal with people and hed deal with the vines he crossed to her noted grudgingly she was doing the job and doing it well we got some tourists heading down he told her why dont you take a break here and steer them to the winery the tasting room someone should be around to give them the standard tour sophia straightened turned to scope out the newcomers the father and son were pretty much out of ll bean she concluded while the daughter had taken a left turn into gothland sure ill take them and get a nice hot cup of coffee for the trouble but a quick look at the fields and a brief informative explanation of the pruning phase would lead nicely into the winery and make dad more inclined to pop for a couple bottles i dont want civilians tramping through my fields dont be so territorial and cranky she put on a bright smile deliberately grabbed tys hand and dragged him toward the family good morning welcome to macmillan vineyards im sophia and tyler and i would be happy to answer any questions you might have its winter pruning time at the moment an essential even crucial part of the winemaking process are you touring the valley in a manner of speaking she had her grandmothers eyes david thought the shape and the depth of them pilars were softer lighter hinted of gold actually i was hoping to meet both of you im david cutter these are my children theo and maddy oh sophia recovered quickly taking davids offered hand even while her mind leaped forward checking us out she thought well that would work both ways thus far her research had only unearthed that david cutter was a divorced single parent of two whod climbed the corporate ladder at la coeur with a steady competent hand over two decades shed determine more in a facetoface well welcome again all of you would you like to come into the winery or the house id like to take a look at the fields been a while since ive seen a pruning in process gauging the mood caution and resentment david turned to tyler youve got a beautiful vineyard mr macmillan and a superior product from them you got that right ive got work to do youll have to excuse tyler setting her teeth sophia wrapped her arm through his like a rope to hold him in place he has a very narrow focus and right now all he sees are the vines added to that he has no discernible social skills do you macmillan vines dont need chitchat all growing things do better with audio stimulation maddy didnt flinch at tys annoyed expression why do you prune in winter she demanded instead of in the fall or early spring we prune during the dormant season why maddy david began its okay ty took a closer look at her she might dress like an apprentice vampire he thought but she had an intelligent face we wait for the first hard frost that forces the vines into dormancy pruning then prepares for the new growth in the spring pruning over the winter decreases the yield what were after is quality not quantity overbearing vines produce too many inferior grapes he glanced back at david i guess you dont have a lot of vineyards in manhattan thats right and one of the reasons i accepted this offer ive missed the fields twenty years ago i spent a very cold wet january in bordeaux pruning vines for la coeur ive done some fieldwork off and on over the years just to keep a hand in but nothing like that very long winter can you show me how to do it maddy asked tyler well i ill start you off taking pity on tyler sophia radiated cheer why dont you and theo come with me well get a closeup look at how this is done before we go into the winery its a fascinating process really though this phase appears to be very basic it requires precision and considerable practice ill show you she herded the kids out of earshot theos going to trip over his tongue david let out a sigh shes a beautiful woman cant blame him yeah she looks good the warning tone had david struggling with a grin he nodded soberly and im old enough to be her father so youve got no worries in that direction from his viewpoint cutter was just the type sophia usually went for older slicker classier under the rough gear there was class being a farmer didnt mean he couldnt spot it but that was beside the point theres nothing between me and sophia he said very definitely either way lets just clear the air here okay im not here to get in your way or interfere with your routine youre the vintner macmillan and im not but i do intend to do my job and to keep abreast of every step and phase of the vineyards youve got the offices ive got the fields not entirely no i was hired to coordinate to oversee and i was hired because i know the vines im not just a suit and frankly i was tired of trying to be one mind he plucked the pruners out of tylers belt sheath and turned to the near row gloveless he lifted canes studied and made his cut it was quick efficient and correct i know the vines david repeated holding the tool out to tyler but that doesnt make them mine irritated tyler took back the tool shoved it into its sheath like a sword into a scabbard all right lets clear some more air i dont like someone looking over my shoulder and knowing hes going to be giving me grades like i was in high school im here to make wine not friends i dont know how they did things at la coeur and i dont care i run this vineyard you did david said evenly now we run it whether we like it or not we dont like it he said shortly and strode away hardheaded inflexible territorial david mused it was going to be an interesting little battle he glanced over to where sophia entertained his children theos throbbing hormones were all but sending out bolts of sexcrazed red light and that david thought wearily was going to be complicated he strolled over watched with approval as his daughter cut through a cane good job thanks he said to sophia my pleasure i assume youll want to meet with me to be briefed on my promotional campaign plans im setting up an office at the villa would this afternoon work for you maybe two oclock clever girl he thought make the first move establish turf what a family sure that works for me ill just get these two out of your hair i want to see the rest maddy said theres nothing to do at home anyway its boring we havent finished unpacking are you in a hurry for that sophia laid a hand on maddys shoulder if youre not you can leave theo and maddy with me i have to go back to the villa in an hour or so and i can drop them off youre in the guest house right thats right he glanced at his watch he had some time before his meeting if theyre not in the way not at all fine ill see you at two you guys stay out of trouble youd think we look for it maddy muttered under her breath if you dont sophia said as david walked away youre not having enough fun she liked the kids maddys intense questioning was entertaining and kept her on her toes and it was sweet to find herself the object of a teenage boys crushatfirstsight also who knew more about a man how he behaved how he thought how he planned than his children a morning with david cutters teenagers would be interesting and she believed informative lets go drag ty away sophia suggested and make him take us through the winery im not as familiar with macmillans operation as i am with giambellis she tucked her tool away well all learn something pilar paced the chambers of judge helen moore and tried not to fret her life she thought seemed to be tumbling out of her control she wasnt at all sure how to grab it back worse she was no longer sure how much of it she wanted to keep steps had to be taken of that she was sure she was so sick of feeling used and useless most of all she needed a friend shed barely seen her mother or her daughter that morning purposely it was cowardly she supposed to avoid those closest to her but she needed time to shore up the damage to make her decisions to coat over the ridiculous hurt that still scraped inside her gut instinctively she reached down to toy with her wedding ring and felt the quick jolt when it wasnt there shed have to get used to that naked finger no damned if she would she was going to go out today this afternoon and buy some ridiculously expensive knockyoureyesout bauble to go on the third finger of her left hand a symbol she told herself of freedom and new beginnings of failure on a sigh of defeat she dropped into a chair just as helen rushed in sorry we ran a little over its all right you always look so distinguished and terrifying in your robes if i ever lose this extra fifteen pounds im going to start wearing a bikini under them she stripped the robe off hung it up rather than a bikini she wore a quiet brown suit too matronly pilar thought too boxy and very helen i really appreciate your making time for me today i know how busy you are weve got two hours helen flopped into the chair behind her desk pulled off her shoes and curled her toes want to go out for lunch not really helen i know youre not a divorce lawyer but tonys moving to finalize things quickly i dont know what to do i can handle it for you pilar or i can recommend someone i know several sleek sharks whod do the job id feel a lot more comfortable if you handled it and if it was kept as simple as possible and as clean well thats disappointing with a frown helen pushed up her glasses id love to leave tony bleeding from the ears ill need your financial papers she began pulling over a yellow legal pad for notes fortunately i browbeat you into separating your finances from his years ago but were going to keep your ass covered he may very well make demands monetary ones real estate and so on you are not going to agree to anything she tipped down her glasses to stare at pilar over the rims with a look that terrified lawyers i mean that pilar he gets nothing you are the injured party hes petitioning for the divorce he wants to get remarried he walks out with what he walked in with im not going to allow you to let him profit from this you got that its not a matter of money not for you but he lives high and hes going to want to continue living high how much have you funneled to him over the last decade or so pilar shifted uncomfortably helen exactly loans that are never repaid the house in san francisco the house in italy the furnishings in both we sold he sold helen corrected you wouldnt listen to me then but you will now or you find another lawyer you never recouped your fair share of the real estate which your money paid for in the first place and i know damn well he slid plenty of your jewelry and personal property into his pocket too that stops cold she pushed up her glasses sat back the gesture the body language changed her from judge to friend pilar i love you and thats why im going to say this to you youve let him treat you like a doormat hell you all but stitched welcome on your tits and invited him to step all over you and i and others who love you hated watching it maybe i did she wasnt going to cry now just absorb the fresh hurt i loved him and part of me thought that if he needed me enough hed love me back something happened last night and its changed things changed me i suppose tell me rising pilar wandered the office and told helen of the phone call when i listened to him making those careless apologies cutting me off to placate rene after shed attacked me i was disgusted with all of us and later after id calmed down again i realized something i dont love him anymore helen maybe i havent for years that makes me pitiful not anymore it doesnt helen picked up the phone lets order in ill explain what needs to be done then sweetie were going to do it please she held out a hand let me help you really help okay pilar sighed okay will it take more than an hour doesnt have to carl order me two chicken clubs with side salads two cappuccinos and a big bottle of fizzy water thanks she hung up the phone perfect pilar sat again is there a good overpriced jeweler near here as a matter of fact there is why if youve got time before you have to don your robes again you could help me buy something symbolic and gaudy she held up her left hand something thatll make rene crazy when she sees it helen nodded with approval now were talking chapter seven contents prev next sunday slid into the week like a balm on a mild nagging itch she wouldnt be spending her morning hours covered in wool and flannel and pruning vines she wouldnt have ty breathing down her neck just waiting for her to make a mistake she could drive into the city do some power shopping see people she could remember what it was like to have a life with this in mind sophia considered calling one of her friends to set up a few hours of socializing then she decided shed rather spend that frivolous time with her mother next free day she decided shed make plans with friends shed spend a weekend in san francisco have a dinner party at her apartment go to a club now she was going to nag her mother into taking a girl day sophia knocked briskly on her mothers bedroom door then pushed it open without waiting for an answer shed never had to wait for her mother the bed was already made the curtains open to the wavering sunlight as sophia stepped inside maria walked in from the adjoining bath mama oh long up and about i think shes in the greenhouse ill find her sophia stepped back hesitated maria ive barely seen her all week is she all right marias lips tightened as she fussed unnecessarily with the yellow roses on pilars dresser she doesnt sleep well i can tell eats like a bird and then only if you insist i scolded her just yesterday and she says its holiday stress what stress maria threw up her hands your mama she loves christmas its that man who troubles her i wont speak ill of your father but if he makes my baby sick hell answer to me get in line sophia murmured well look after her maria ill hunt her down now see that she eats christmas sophia thought as she jogged downstairs it was the perfect excuse shed ask her mother to give her a hand with some lastminute christmas shopping she scanned the house as she hurried through her mothers poinsettias red and white stars in dozens of silver pots were mixed with miniature hollies in lush arrangements throughout the foyer fresh greenery twined with tiny white lights and glossy red ribbon swagged doorways the three giambelli angels were displayed on the long refectory table in the family parlor tereza pilar and sophia she thought the carved faces reflecting each of them at the age of twelve how alike they looked it was always a little jolt a little tug of amused pleasure to see them the continuity the undeniable blood tie of those three generations shed been thrilled when she was given her angel all those years ago thrilled to see her own features on the graceful winged body and she realized as she trailed a fingertip over the trio she was still one day it would fall to her to commission an angel for a child of her own what an odd thought she mused not unpleasant but certainly odd the next generation when the time came was hers to begin measured by those whod come before she was falling a bit behind on that particular family duty then again it wasnt something she could pencil in on her monthly calendar fall in love get married conceive child nope such things didnt schedule neatly into a life she imagined shed enjoy those things with the right man at the right time but it was so easy too easy to make a mistake and love marriage children couldnt be casually crossed off the slate like an inconvenient dentist appointment unless you were anthony avano she corrected annoying herself with the automatic snap of resentment that accompanied the thought in that area she had no intention of following in her fathers footsteps when she made the choice and the promises that went with it she would keep them so for now three angels would have to be enough she turned to study the room candles in spears and chunks of silver and gold more greenery artfully arranged the grand tree one of four that would traditionally stand in the villa dripping with crystal garland laden with precious ornaments brought over from italy stood regally by the windows presents were already tucked under it and the house smelled of pine and candle wax time had gotten away from her she thought guiltily a great deal of it her mother grandmother and the staff had worked like trojans to dress the house for the holidays while shed buried herself in work she should have taken the time made the time to help didnt put it on your appointment calendar did you sophia she thought with a wince the annual christmas party was nearly on them and shed done nothing to help with the planning or preparations shed amend that immediately she went out the side door instantly regretting she hadnt stopped for a jacket as the wind had a bite as a result she ran down the winding stone path cut left and sprinted to the greenhouse the warm moist heat felt so inviting mama down here sophie wait until you see my paperwhites theyre spectacular i think ill take them and the amaryllis into the parlor very festive pilar stopped looked up wheres your jacket forgot sophia leaned over and kissed her mothers cheek then took a good long look her mothers ancient sweater was pushed up at the elbows and bagged at the hips her hair was tied back at the nape of her neck youre losing weight oh i am not pilar waved that away with hands covered in stained gardening gloves youve been talking to maria if i dont gorge myself three times a day shes convinced im going to waste away as it is i stole two sugar cookies on the way out here and expect them to pop out on my hips any moment that should hold you till lunch which ill buy im so behind on my shopping help sophia with a shake of her head pilar shifted her long trough of narcissi and began to fuss with the tulips she was forcing they would bloom she thought and bring color to the dreary days of winter you started your holiday shopping in june and finished it in october just as you always do to make the rest of us hate you okay caught me sophia boosted herself up on the work counter still im dying to go into the city and play for a few hours its been a brutal week lets run away for the day i was just there a couple of days ago frowning pilar set the tulips aside sophie is this new order of things your grandmothers set up too much for you youre up at dawn every day and then you spend hours in your office here i know youre not seeing any of your friends i thrive on pressure still i could use an assistant and i believe youre supposed to fit that bill cam we both know id be useless to you no i dont know that okay we move to plan b im putting you to work youve done all the decorating in the house and it looks beautiful by the way im sorry i didnt help youve been busy i shouldnt have been too busy but now its office time and thatll segue into partyplanning time you need to bring me up to date on that which is part of an assistants duty now which flowers do you want to take in ill help you with them then we start the clock the girl pilar thought made the head spin sophie really yes really youre the trainee im the boss she scooted off the counter rubbed her hands together i get to make up for all the years you bossed me around especially between the ages of twelve and fifteen no not the hormone years you couldnt be so cruel bet me you asked if this new system was too much for me its not but its damn close thats a fact im not used to doing all my own filing and phone tags and typing since im not about to admit to nonna or to macmillan that im feeling the least bit squeezed you could help me out pilar blew out a breath tugged off her gloves youre doing this to keep me busy just as maria hounds me to eat partially sophia admitted but that doesnt change the fact that i spend time every day doing basic office work if i could pass that over i might actually begin to date again in this decade i miss men all right but dont blame me if you cant find anything in your files pilar pulled the thin band out of her hair scooped her fingers through it i havent done basic office work since i was sixteen and then i was so miserable at it mama fired me she turned started to laugh then noticed sophia was gawking at her hand embarrassed pilar nearly stuck her hand and the fivecarat squarecut ruby on her finger behind her back its a little much isnt it i dont know i think ive been struck blind by the glare sophia took her mothers hand examined the stone and the stunning channelset diamonds around the square wow magnifico i wanted something i should have told you youve been so busy damn it pilar tried to explain ive used your schedule to avoid talking to you im sorry you dont have to apologize to me for buying a ring mama except i believe that one might be considered a small monument i was angry you should never do anything when youre angry to give herself something to do pilar picked up her gardening tools began to replace them baby helen is handling the divorce for me i shouldve good she wont let you get scalped dont look at me like that mama youve been careful all my life youve been careful never to speak against my father but im not blind and im not stupid no overcome by sadness pilar set her little trowel aside no youve never been either and had seen had understood so much more than a child should if you let him hed take your money and anything else that wasnt nailed down he wouldnt be able to help himself i feel better knowing aunt helens looking out for your interests now lets get these flowers into the house sophie pilar laid a hand on her daughters arm as sophia picked up a pot of amaryllis im so sorry this hurts you youve never hurt me he always has i dont suppose he can help that either she picked up a second pot renes going to swallow her tongue when she gets a load of that rock i know that was the idea for over fifty years giambelli california had held lavish christmas parties for family friends employees and associates as the company had grown so had the guest list following the tradition set by the italian branch of the company the parties were held simultaneously on the last saturday before christmas the house was open to family and friends and the winery to employees associates depending on their position on the feeding chain were placed in the proper location invitations to the main house were prized like gold and often used as a symbol of status or success still the giambellis didnt stint on the festivities in the winery food was elegant and plentiful wine flowed freely and both the decorations and the entertainment were topnotch every member of the family was expected to make an appearance at both venues having done so since her fifteenth year sophia was well aware that the winery party was a great deal more entertaining and less full of irritating relations she could hear one of her cousin ginas progeny shrieking at the other end of the hall her hopes that don and his herd would remain in italy had been dashed the evening before when theyd arrived still even their presence wouldnt be as annoying as that of her father and rene her mother had stuck firm on their being invited going head to head with la signora on the issue the consolation was their invitation had been to the winery that she thought as she fastened on her diamond teardrop earrings would stick sharply in renes craw she stepped back studied the results in her cheval glass the shimmering silver gown with its short fitted jacket worked well the scooped neck was a nice frame for the diamond necklace both it and the earrings had been her greatgrandmothers she turned checked the line of her skirt then called out an invitation at the knock on her door look at you helen came in pretty and plump in frosty pink you sparkle all over its great isnt it sophia took another turn for the fun of it i bought it in new york thinking of new years but i had to press it into duty tonight not too much with the diamonds diamonds are never too much honey she shut the door i wanted a minute i hate to bring this up now right before you have to socialize with hundreds of people but pilar told me tony and rene will be here what is it the divorce is final yesterday it was really no more than a formality after all these years since tony was in a hurry and didnt complicate matters with financial negotiations it was really just a matter of filing the papers i see sophia picked up her evening bag opened and closed the catch have you told mama yes just now shes fine or shes holding up i know its important to her you do the same dont worry about me aunt helen she crossed the room took helens hands youre a brick i dont know what shed have done without you she needs to move on i know and so do you she squeezed sophias hands dont let rene have the satisfaction of seeing this hurts you on any level i wont good now ive got to go down and run herd on my husband if i leave james alone down there this early hell sneak canapés and ruin the caterers presentation she opened the door glanced back tony didnt do many admirable things in his life youre one of them thanks alone sophia let out a long breath then she straightened her shoulders marched back to her mirror opening her bag she took out her lipstick and painted her lips bloodymurder red david sipped a fullbodied merlot mingled with the crowd packed into the towering stone walls of the winery tried to tune out the hot licks from the band that was currently thrilling his son and scanned the area for pilar he knew the giambellis would put in an appearance hed been well schooled on the pomp and protocol for the holiday festivities hed be expected to split his time between parties which though it hadnt been put precisely that way was both a privilege and a duty he was learning fast that nearly every assignment in this organization came under the heading of both he could find no complaint with it hed been given a challenge which he needed he was being well compensated financially which he appreciated and he was associated with a company he respected and that he valued everything hed seen in the past weeks had confirmed that giambellimacmillan was a tight familyoriented ship run with efficiency and little sentiment it wasnt cold but it was calculated product was king and queen here money was respected and expected but it was not the goal wine was hed found the opposite true in his later years with la coeur now seeing his son actually enjoying himself watching his daughter interrogate some poor winemaker over some point of procedure he was content the move had been exactly what all of them had needed david good to see you he turned surprise registering briefly as he looked into jeremy demorneys smiling face jerry i didnt know youd be here i try never to miss an annual giambelli bash and always hit the winery before the villa very democratic of la signora to invite reps from the competition shes quite a lady one of a kind how are you taking to working for her its early days yet but the moves gone well im glad to get the kids out of the city how are things back in new york were managing to grope along without you the little sting in the statement wasnt softened by the smirk sorry were still a little sore hated losing you david nothing lasts forever anyone else here from la coeur duberry flew in from france hes known the old lady for a hundred years pearsons representing the local group a few top levels from other labels gives us all a chance to drink her wine and spy on each other got any gossip for me like i said its early days yet he spoke casually but hed become wary jerrys policy of gossip and corporate backstabbing had been one of the reasons it had been so easy to leave la coeur great party though excuse me theres somebody ive been waiting for maybe all my life david thought as he left jerry without a backward glance and worked through the crowd to pilar she wore blue deep blue velvet with a long rope of pearls she looked warm and regal and he would have said utterly confident if he hadnt noticed the quick flicker of panic in her eyes then she shifted her head just a little and focused on him and god help him she blushed or at least more color came into her face the idea that hed put it there drove him crazy ive been watching for you he took her hand before she could do anything about it like a kid at a school dance i know you have to mingle but i want a minute first it was like being swept away by a single warm wave david you cant mingle without wine it wont do he tugged her forward well talk about business about the weather ill only tell you you look beautiful five or six dozen times here he plucked a flute of champagne from a tray i dont see how you can drink anything else looking the way you do that same flutter was back in her stomach i cant keep up with you i cant keep up with myself im making you nervous he touched his glass lightly to hers id say i was sorry for that but id be lying its best to start out a relationship with honesty dont you think no yes stop she tried to laugh he looked like some sort of sophisticated knight in his formal black with his rich blond hair glinting in the shimmer of light a foolish thought she told herself for a middleaged woman to have are your children here yeah they whined about being dragged here and now theyre having the time of their lives youre beautiful i did mention i was going to tell you that didnt i she nearly giggled before she reminded herself she was fortyeight not eighteen and supposed to know better yes i believe you did i dont suppose we could find a dark corner and neck no thats a definite then youll just have to dance with me and give me a chance to change your mind it staggered her that she thought he could change it that she wanted him to inappropriate she told herself firmly ridiculous she was years older than he god what was she supposed to do say feel there are a thousand thoughts going through your head he murmured i wish youd tell me all of them jesus she pressed a hand to her belly where a soft gooey ball slid in among the flutters youre awfully good at this im glad you think so because i start feeling clumsy every time i see you fooled me she drew in a breath steadied herself david youre very attractive you think so he touched her hair couldnt help himself he loved the way it curved against her cheek could you be more specific and very charming she added struggling to keep her voice firm im very flattered but i dont know you and besides she trailed off her smile freezing hello tony rene pilar you look lovely tony leaned over to kiss her cheek thank you david cutter tony avano and rene foxx rene foxx avano rene corrected with a purr she lifted her hand wiggled her fingers to send the diamond circlet wedding ring flashing as of today it wasnt a stab in the heart pilar realized as shed thought it would be but more of a burn a quick shock that annoyed as much as it hurt congratulations im sure youll be very happy together oh we already are rene slid her arm through tonys were flying out to bimini right after christmas itll be lovely to be out of this cold and rain you really should take time for a little vacation yourself pilar youre looking pale strange i was thinking how vital she looks tonight gauging the ground david lifted pilars hand kissed her fingers delicious in fact im glad i had a chance to meet you tony before you left the country smoothly david slid an arm around pilars waist ive had considerable trouble reaching you the last few days he gave rene a glance just a few degrees short of polite now i see why let my office know your travel plans wont you weve business to discuss my people know my plans apparently mine dont youll excuse us wont you we need to make the rounds before heading up to the villa that was unkind pilar whispered so what gone was the flirtatious charm in its place was power of the cold and ruthless sort it wasnt she thought any less appealing on him over and above the fact that i didnt like him on principle im coo and should have been informed if one of the vps was going out of the country hes been dodging me for days avoiding my calls i dont care for it hes just not used to having to report to you to anyone hell have to adjust over her head david spotted tyler so will others why dont you help clear the way a little and introduce me to some of the people who are wondering what the hell im doing here ty was trying to be invisible he hated big parties there were too many people to talk to and too few who had anything to say hed already calculated his plan one hour in the winery one hour in the main house then he could slide away go home catch a little espn and go to bed as far as he was concerned the music was too loud the winery too crowded and the food too rich not that he minded looking at people especially when they were all slicked up and polished and trying to look better than the people they were talking to it was kind of like watching a play and as long as he could stay safely in the audience he could manage for a while hed watched the little drama between pilar and rene tyler was fond enough of pilar that hed have sacrificed his corner and gone to her side if david cutter hadnt already been there cutter irritated him on principle but tyler had to give him points for quick action the little hand kiss had been a good move one that seemed to annoy rene and avano and whatever hed said had wiped that idiot smile off avanos face in a hurry avano was an asshole tyler thought sipping his wine but with rene prodding at him he could be a dangerous one if cutter could keep him in line it was almost worth having him in the mix almost why are you standing over here all by yourself tyler looked down frowned at maddy because i dont want to be here why are you youre an adult you can do what you want you keep thinking that little girl youre doomed to disappointment you just like being irritable no i just am irritable she pursed her lips at him nodded okay can i have a sip of your wine no in europe children are taught to appreciate wine she said it so grandly standing there in her layers of black and deadugly shoes ty wanted to laugh so go to europe around here its called contributing to the delinquency ive been to europe but i dont remember it very well im going to go back maybe ill live in paris for a while i was talking to mr delvecchio the winemaker he said wine was a miracle but its really just a chemical reaction isnt it its both its neither it has to be i was going to do an experiment and i thought you could help me tyler blinked at her a pretty badly dressed girl with an inquiring mind what why dont you talk to your father because youre the vintner i thought i would get some grapes put them in a bowl and see what happens id have another bowl with the same type and weight of grapes and id do stuff to it the kind of things you do i eat grapes in a bowl he said but shed caught his interest see one bowl would be left alone mr delvecchios miracle the other id process using additives and techniques pushing the chemical reaction then i could see which worked best even if you use the same type of grapes youll have variations between your tests why youre talking storebought this time of year they may not have come from the same vineyard even if they do you get variations soil type fertility water penetration when they were picked how they were picked you cant test the grapes on the vine because theyre already off the vine the must in each bowl could be considerably different even if you left them both alone whats must juice bowl wine he thought interesting but if you wanted to try it you should use wooden bowls the woodll give the must some character not much but some a chemical reaction maddy said with a grin see its science not religion baby wines that and a whole lot more without thinking he offered her his glass she sipped delicately her gaze shifting just in case her father was nearby experimentally she let the wine roll around on her tongue before she swallowed its pretty good pretty good with a shake of his head he took the glass back from her thats vintage pinot noir only a barbarian would call it pretty good she smiled charmingly now because she knew she had him will you show me the big wine barrels and the machines sometime yeah sure mr delvecchio said you do the white in stainless steel and the reds in wood i didnt get a chance to ask him why why didnt he look cute sophia thought big grouchy macmillan deep in what seemed to be a serious conversation with the miniature morticia and if things were as they appeared he was enjoying himself he even looked good doing it the fact that he did made her even more pleased shed decided against bringing a date having a date meant her attention would have to be focused being loose gave her much more room to circulate and enjoy whoevers company intrigued her the most at the moment she thought tyler fit the bill it would take her a little while to work her way over to him after all she had social obligations to dispense but she kept him at the corner of her vision as she began to work the crowd sophia stunning as always jerry happy holidays she leaned in kissed both of his cheeks hows business weve had a banner year he slipped an arm around her shoulders steering her through the groups in the tasting room and toward the bar and expect another a little bird tells me youre planning a brilliant promotion campaign those little birds chatter entirely too much dont they she beamed at the bartender champagne please another from the flock was singing about you launching a new label midmarket with an american target someones going to have to shoot those birds i saw the writeup in vino on your cabernet an excellent vintage and the auction went quite well for you shame on you sophia for standing me up when you were in new york you know id looked forward to seeing you couldnt be helped but ill cash in my rain check next trip im counting on it she lifted her wine sipped he was an attractive man smooth almost silkily attractive the faintest sprinkling of silver at the temples to add distinction the slight dip in the chin to add charm neither of them would mention her father or the poorly kept secret of jerrys wifes infidelity instead they would keep it light mildly flirtatious friendly they understood each other sophia thought very well the competition between giambelli and la coeur was high and often exhilarating and jeremy demorney was not above using whatever means came to hand to push his edge she admired that ill even spring for dinner she told him and the wine giambellimacmillan wine wed want the best after all then perhaps some la coeur brandy back in my apartment now you know how i feel about mixing business with business youre a cruel woman sophia youre a dangerous man jerry howre your kids the children are fine their mother has them in saint moritz for the holidays you must miss them of course i thought i might spend a day or two in the valley before heading home why dont you and i mix pleasure with pleasure thats tempting jerry but im swamped i dont think ill come up for air until after the first of the year she caught a movement out of the corner of her eye watched her mother slip off toward the ladies room with rene a few feet behind speaking of swamped i have something i have to deal with right now lovely to see you and you he replied as she worked her way through the crowd it would be even lovelier to see her he thought when she and the rest of her family were ruined helping bring that about would be mixing business with business he thought and pleasure with pleasure rene pushed through the door of the cozy woodwalled ladies lounge one step behind pilar managed to land on your feet didnt you rene leaned against the door to discourage anyone from joining them you got what you wanted rene though her hands wanted to tremble pilar opened her evening bag and pulled out her lipstick shed intended to steal two private minutes before making her last rounds and heading up to the villa i shouldnt be an issue for you anymore exwives are always an issue ill tell you this i wont tolerate you calling me or tony and spewing out your neurotic abuse i didnt call youre a liar and a coward now youre going to hide behind david cutter she grabbed pilars hand jerked it up so the ring fired in the lights what did you have to do to wheedle this out of him i dont need a man to buy me jewelry rene or anything else thats an elemental difference between us no ill tell you the difference between us i go after what i want in the open if you think im going to let tony slink away because youve gone whining to your family youre wrong youre not going to shove him out your david cutter isnt going to shove him out and if you try just think of all the interesting information he could pass along to your competitors threatening the family or the business isnt going to help secure tonys position or yours well see about that im mrs avano now and mr and mrs avano will be joining the family and the other toplevel executives at the villa tonight im sure our invitation was misdirected youll only embarrass yourself pilar told her i dont embarrass easily remember this tony has a piece of giambelli and i have a piece of him im younger than you and a hell of a lot younger than your mother ill still be here when youre gone will you deliberately pilar turned to the mirror slowly carefully painted her lips how long do you think it will take for tony to cheat on you he wouldnt dare secure in her own power rene smiled he knows if he does ill kill him im not the passive patient wife tony told me what a lousy lay you were we laugh about it my advice if you want to keep cutter on the string pass him down to your daughter she strikes me as someone who knows how to entertain a man in bed even as pilar whirled sophia opened the door oh what fun girl talk rene how brave of you to wear that shade of green with your coloring fuck you sophia erudite as always mama youre needed at the villa im sure rene will excuse us shell want plenty of room and privacy to fix her face on the contrary ill just leave the two of you alone so you can hold your mothers hand while she dissolves into helpless tears im not finished pilar rene added as she opened the door but you are that was entertaining sophia studied her mothers face you dont look like youre about to dissolve into tears helpless or otherwise no im done with them pilar dropped her lipstick back in her bag closed it with a snap sophie honey your father married her today well hell on a long sigh sophia stepped over put her arms around her mother laid her head on pilars shoulder merry christmas chapter eight contents prev next sophia bided her time she needed to catch her father alone to say what she had to say and not when rene was draped all over him like poison ivy on a tree trunk she promised herself shed be calm mature and crystal clear losing her temper was not an option she worked the crowd as she waited danced once with theo whod been so entertaining hed nearly cured her sour mood when she spotted rene on the dance floor with jerry she made her move it didnt surprise her to see her father tucked into a corner table flirting with kris it revolted her slightly but didnt surprise her hed turn on the charm for another woman on his wedding day but as she approached she caught the subtle signals a light touch a promising glance that told her it was more than flirtation and that did surprise her her father she was certain was cheating on rene with kris still it was so like him so ridiculously like him it barely put a hitch in her stride she didnt know which of the three of them in that sticky triangle was the biggest fool and at the moment it wasnt her problem kris im sorry to break up this tender moment but i need to speak with my father alone nice to see you too kris got to her feet its been so long since youve bothered to come by the office i nearly forgot what you look like i dont believe i report to you but ill be sure to send in a photo now princess tony began dont push it sophia kept her tone quiet level but the look she sent her father had his color going up and his mouth closing lets just put this entire situation down to christmasparty insanity well have a meeting kris in my office when my schedule permits for tonight lets put business aside for personal matters you can consider yourself lucky i saw you before rene did now i need to speak to my father on family business with you at the wheel your familys not going to have much of a business deliberately kris leaned down skimmed a fingertip over the back of tonys hand later she murmured and strolled away sophie you have the entirely wrong impression kris and i were just having a sociable drink her gaze cut like a blade save it for rene ive known you longer long enough not to have the slightest interest in your bimbos please dont interrupt she said before he could sputter out a protest this wont take long i hear congratulations are in order or if not in order required by elemental manners so fucking congratulations now sophie he stood reached for her hand but she snatched it out of reach i know youre not fond of rene but i dont give a damn about rene and at the moment i dont give much of one about you he looked sincerely surprised sincerely hurt she wondered if he practiced the expression in his shaving mirror you dont mean that im sorry youre upset no youre not youre sorry ive cornered you about it you were married today and you didnt bother to tell me thats one princess it was a small simple ceremony neither rene nor i felt just be quiet his answer had been quick and smooth but she knew the truth he hadnt so much as thought of telling her you came to a family function and under the business cloak this is a family function flaunting yourself and your new wife and a side piece for good measure thats insensitive enough but it goes up a considerable number of levels as you didnt have the decency to tell mama about the marriage first thats two her voice had risen just enough to turn some heads uneasy tony moved in closer he took her arm stroked it tugged gently why dont we go outside and ill explain theres no need to cause a scene in here oh there is every need im desperately trying to resist the temptation to do just that because heres the kicker you son of a bitch you pushed that woman in my mothers face she jabbed a finger into his chest as her temper reared up and took over you let rene corner her let her spew all over her let her make scenes and cause pain while you sit over here and slobber over yet another woman and one young enough to be your daughter if you ever remembered you have one thats three goddamn you thats three and youre out you stay away from her and you stay away from me you keep your distance and see that your wife does the same or ill hurt you i promise you ill make you bleed she whirled away before he recovered caught the amused smirk on kriss face she took a step in that direction then another not entirely certain what she intended to do then her arm was gripped and she was being swept away into the crowd bad idea ty said quietly as he slid his grip from her arm to her waist to keep her close really bad idea to murder staff members at the company christmas bash lets go outside i dont want to go outside you need to its cold youll cool off so far you only entertained a handful of people who were close enough to hear your rip into avano nicely done by the way but with the steam puffing out of your ears youre going to end up putting on a show for the whole party he all but pushed her out the door stop shoving stop dragging i dont like being manhandled she jerked free rounded and nearly very nearly struck him go ahead first shots free after that i hit back she sucked in a breath blew it out sucked in another while she continued to glare at him with every breath her glittery gown threw out sparks in the moonlight she was ty thought outrageous and magnificent and dangerous as a handful of dynamite with the fuse already hissing there you go he said with a nod a few more and you might be able to see past the blood in your eyes the bastard she stalked away from the ivycovered stone walls of the winery its shrubberies draped in festive lights away from the laughter the music that pulsed against the tall narrow windows into the shadows of the old cypress trees where she could rant privately until she was calm again he heard her muttering in italian some of which he understood none of which sounded particularly pleasant i couldnt help it she turned back to where he stood waiting while she worked it off her busy hands dropped to her sides no i dont guess you could always were a brat because it was cold and she was starting to shiver he stripped off his jacket dropped it over her shoulders her temper had fizzled left her feeling raw and empty inside i dont care about him and kris even though it complicates my department i can deal with that with her but he hurt my mother shes handling it sophie shes going to be okay he jammed his hands in his pockets before he gave in to the urge to stroke and pet she looked so damn miserable im sorry he hurt you yeah well what else is new the blast of anger had left her with a dull headache and a raw stomach i guess i should thank you for getting me out of there before i cut loose on bystanders if you mean kris she doesnt strike me as a bystander more an operator but no thanks necessary either way she turned back saw by his face he was beginning to be embarrassed because she found that endearing she rose on her toes lightly kissed his cheek still thanks i wasnt shouting was i i lose track when im in a tantrum not very much and the band was loud thats something then well i believe my work is done here why dont you walk me up to the villa you can make sure i dont throw another tantrum i guess you want your coat thats all right she smiled and pulled his jacket a little closer ive got yours the gardens of the villa sparkled with thousands of fairy lights the heated terraces were decked with flowers and ornamental trees table groupings invited guests to spill out into the starlight enjoy the night and the music that slipped through the doors and windows of the ballroom pilar used it as an excuse to have a moment in the air before returning inside to circulate among the guests and do her duty she considered sneaking in an emergency cigarette hiding out she jumped in her shadowy corner then relaxed when she saw it was her stepfather caught me i was sneaking out myself in an exaggerated move he craned his neck looking side to side then whispered you carrying the laugh felt marvelous just one she whispered back we can share it light it up partner your mothers busy weve got enough time to suck one down she lit the cigarette and they stood in the shadows companionably conspiratorially passing it between them relaxed in his company she leaned back on the wall of the house looked out lights were glowing in the fields highlighting the naked twists and fingers of the vines behind them the glamour of the music swelled its a beautiful party as always with enough regret for both of them eli stubbed out the last of the cigarette you and your mother and sophia have outdone yourselves this year i hope tereza let you know how much we appreciate all the work you put into this event she has in her way then let me thank you in mine he slipped his arms around her guided her into a dance a pretty woman should never be without a dance partner oh eli she laid her head on his shoulder what would i do without you im such a mess not you pilar you were a grown woman with a child of your own when i married your mother ive tried not to interfere in your life i know tereza does enough of that for both of us he said and made her chuckle however he continued im going to speak my mind he was never good enough for you eli never would have been good enough you wasted a lot of years on tony avano but you managed to get a wonderful daughter out of it treasure that and dont waste the rest of your life wondering why it didnt work out he married rene just like that all the better he nodded when she jerked back to stare at him for you for sophia for everyone involved they suit such as they are and their marriage simply takes him one step further out of your life if i had my way hed be out of the business as well completely out and i suspect thats whats going to happen within the next year hes good at his job others will be equally as good and wont give me indigestion your mothers had her reasons for keeping him on but those reasons arent as important as they once were let him go eli said kissing her forehead hell sink or hell swim either way its no longer your problem from the terrace below tony listened and his mouth hardened he was still stinging from what he continually told himself had been a completely uncalledfor and inappropriate attack by his own daughter hed have been able to shrug it off but it had been in public in public at a business event and business he thought wasnt what it had been he didnt believe not really that the giambellis would cut him loose but they were going to make his life difficult they thought he was stupid that he was careless but they were wrong he already had a plan in place to ensure his financial security held god knew he needed money and plenty of it rene was already draining the resources he had of course hed been unwise to become involved with kris he was doing his best to break that off delicately so far that had been a bit more problematic than hed anticipated it was flattering really that a lovely young woman like kris would be so attached so reluctant to part ways and angry he recalled angry enough to call rene in the middle of the night still hed handled that rene had assumed the caller was pilar and he hadnt corrected her why should he have he sipped his wine enjoyed the starlight and as was his way began to put trouble aside before it could take root he was handling kris as well he decided promising to help her move into sophias position with giambelli had stemmed that flood just as a nice little bauble generally stemmed floods from rene it was all he thought knowing your quarrys weakness and knowing it using it maintained the status quo he intended to continue living his life as he believed he deserved it was time to tap his sources a little more here a little more there and look toward the future sophia moved through her circle of friends and did her best to avoid her cousin gina the woman was becoming more than a pest shed moved up the scale to embarrassment not only was she dressed in what appeared to be a christmasred tent with fifty pounds of sequins but she was busily chirping to anyone she could corner about her husbands brilliance don sophia noted was keeping very close to the bar he was easily halfdrunk and trying to make himself invisible your mother all right sophia stopped to smile at helen last time i saw her hello uncle james she turned to give helens husband a hard hug james moore had been one of the constants in her life and often more a father to her than her own hed let himself go pudgy had lost more hair than hed kept but behind his silver wire glasses his eyes twinkled green at her he looked like everyones favorite uncle and was one of the top and most devious criminal defense attorneys in california prettiest girl in the room isnt she helen always you havent been by to see me in weeks ill make up for it she gave his cheek a second kiss la signora has been keeping me busy so i hear we brought you a present i love presents gimme its over there making time with that redhead sophia glanced over and gave a quick yip of pleasure as she spotted lincoln moore i thought linc was still in sacramento hell fill you in james told her go on over talk him into marrying you this time james helen arched a brow were going to find pilar go enjoy yourself lincoln moore was tall dark and handsome he was also the closest thing sophia had to a brother at various stages of their lives her twomonth seniority had been used to advantage by both of them their mothers friendship had been a bond that had ensured theyd grow up together because of it neither of them had ever felt like an only child she walked up behind him slid an arm through the crook of his and asked the redhead is this guy coming on to you sophie with a laugh he picked her off the floor gave her a quick turn my surrogate sister he told the redhead sophia giambelli andrea wainwright my date be nice andrea sophia offered a hand well talk no you wont she lies about me its a hobby its nice to meet you lines told me a lot about you he lies too did you both come in from sacramento no actually im an intern at saint francis the emergencymedicine rotation basketball injury linc held up his right hand showed off the splint on his right finger dislocated it trying to jam

better nice meeting you andrea you too andy glanced up at linc so are you brilliant yeah its a curse grinning he drew her onto the dance floor smile macmillan ty looked down at sophia why because youre going to dance with me why he bit back a sigh as she took his hand sorry been hanging around with maddy cutter too long the kid never stops asking questions the two of you seemed to be hitting it off wed dance better if you actually touched me right he laid a hand at her waist shes an interesting kid and bright have you seen my grandfather not for a bit why i want to see him and la signora then i figure im done with this and can go home youre such a party animal she slid her hand over his shoulder and tugged playfully at his hair there was so much of it she thought all thick and unruly live a little ty its christmas not yet theres still a lot of work to be done before christmas and to be done after hey she tugged his hair again so that he stopped scanning the crowd for his grandfather and looked at her theres no work to be done tonight and i still owe you for coming to my rescue you werent in trouble everyone else was it wasnt gratitude he was looking for but distance a safe distance she was always dangerous but pressed up against a man she was lethal and i have some charts and some grafts i want to go over why is that funny he demanded when she chuckled i was just wondering what youd be like if you ever loosened up i bet youre a wild man macmillan i get loose he muttered tell me something she skimmed her fingers down the nape of his neck enjoyed the way those lakeblue eyes flared with annoyance something that has nothing to do with wine or work what else is there art literature an amusing childhood experience a secret fantasy or desire my current fantasy is to get out of here do better come on the first thing that pops into your head peeling that dress off you and seeing if you taste like you smell he waited a beat good that shut you up only momentarily and only because im assessing my reaction i find myself a great deal more intrigued by the image than expected she tipped her head back to study his face oh yes she liked his eyes especially now when there were sparks of heat in them why do you suppose that is ive answered enough questions for one night he started to step back but she clamped her hand on his shoulder why dont we fulfill our duty here then go to your place is it that easy for you it can be not for me but thanks his tone turned careless and cold as he looked away from her again and around the room but id say youve got plenty of alternates here if youre up for a quick onenight stand im going home he stepped back walked away it took her nearly ten seconds before she had her wind back and another three before the fury spurted up and scored her throat the delay allowed him to get out of the room and down the first flight of stairs before she came after him no you dont she hissed it under her breath then stalked past him in here she strode into the family parlor banged the pocket doors closed cazzo culo you son of a bitch even now her voice was quiet controlled he couldnt know how much that cost her youre right he cut her off before she could spew all the venom that was out of line and im sorry the apology quietly given turned temper to tears but she held them back by sheer raw will im a whore in your opinion because i think of sex the way a man does no jesus he hadnt meant that only to get under her skin the way she got under his then get the hell away from her i dont know what i think it would be all right wouldnt it if i pretended reluctance if i let you seduce me but because im honest im cheap no he gripped her arms now hoping to steady them both you got me worked up you always have i shouldnt have said what i did anything that i did for gods sake dont cry i am not going to cry good okay look youre beautiful outrageous and over my head ive managed to keep my hands off you up till now and im going to keep them off youve got them on me now sorry he dropped his arms to his sides sorry youre saying you insulted me because youre a coward look sophie im going home soak my head well get back to work tomorrow and forget this happened i dont think so i get you worked up do i she gave him a little shove moving in and he stepped back and your answer to that is to take a slap at me it was the wrong answer i said i was sorry not good enough try this she was on him before he could act all that was left was reaction her mouth was hot and soft and very skilled it fed ravenously on his her body was lush and smooth and very female it pressed intimately against his his mind blanked he could admit that later just snapped from on to off like a switch giving him no shield against the panther leap of arousal she tasted like she smelled he learned that much dark and dangerous and female hed jerked her closer before he could stop himself responded to the sharp nip of her teeth even as his system went to fast overload one minute she was wrapped around him like some exotic strangling vine and the next he was cut loose with every ounce of blood drained from his head deal with it she ran a finger lightly over her own bottom lip then turned to shove the doors open again just a damn minute he had her arm spun her around he wasnt sure what he planned to do but he didnt plan for it to be pleasant then he saw the utter shock on her face before he could react she was shoving him aside racing across the room to the refectory table dio madonna who would do such a thing he saw it then the three giambelli angels red ran down the carved faces like blood from slash wounds written across the chest of each in that same violent hue were vicious messages bitch bitch bitch sit down sophie ill get them out before your mother or grandmother sees them take them home clean them up no ill do it i think its nail polish a nasty girl trick she said quietly temper would do no good she thought as she gathered the three figures and she couldnt find her anger under the sadness rene i suppose or kris they both hate the giambelli women at the moment let me take care of it for you he laid his hands on her shoulders whoever did it knew it would hurt you i can get them cleaned up and put back before anyone notices she wanted to push the angels into his big strong hands and herself along with them because she did she stepped away from him i take care of my own and youre in a hurry to go home sophie his tone was so patient so kind she sighed i need to do it myself and i need to be angry with you a little while longer so go away he let her go but once he was outside he turned and climbed the stone steps to the ballroom hed hang around awhile he decided just to be sure the only thing anyone hurt that night were wooden angels in her room sophia carefully cleaned off the figures it was as she suspected smears of bold red nail polish a petty vandalism and an ugly one but not permanent you cant destroy the giambellis so easily she thought were tougher than that tough enough she thought for her to ignore the nastiness of the act and leave the perpetrator of it disappointed she took them back downstairs replaced them and found that single act steadied her again easier she realized than steadying herself against what had passed between her and tyler moron she thought wandering to an antique mirror to add a fresh dusting of powder to her nose the moron could certainly kiss when he put some effort into it but that didnt make him less of a moron she hoped he suffered she hoped he spent a long sweaty uncomfortable night if he looked haggard and miserable the next day she might just might let him off the hook then again she watched herself in the mirror as she traced a finger over her lips dropped her hand quickly to retrieve her lipstick when the doors opened sophia nonna she glanced toward the three angels all was as it should be just doing some repairs ill be right back up tereza closed the doors behind her i saw you go out after tyler mmm keeping it at that sophia carefully painted her lips do you think because im old i dont recognize the look in your eye what look is that nonna hot blood sophia gave a little shrug recapped her lipstick we had an argument an argument didnt require you to replace your lipstick laughing now sophia turned what sharp eyes you have grandma we did have an argument and i solved it my way its both legal and moral for me to kiss ty nonna were not blood kin i love you sophia and i love tyler sophia softened the words came rarely from tereza i know i didnt put the two of you together so you would hurt each other why did you put us together for the good of the family because the day had been long tereza gave in and sat hot blood can cloud the judgment this is a pivotal year and already before it begins we have upheaval youre a beautiful young woman some say i look like my grandmother tereza allowed herself a small smile she too glanced toward the three carved figures and her eyes softened a little perhaps but more you favor your grandfather he was beautiful like a painting i married for duty but it wasnt a hardship and he was kind beauty is a weapon cam take care how you use it for without that kindness it will turn and strike back at you sophia sat am i hard nonna yes tereza reached over touched her hand lightly to sophias thats not a bad thing a soft woman is too easily molded and too easily bruised your mothers been both shes my daughter sophia she added coolly when sophia stiffened i will speak my mind there youre not soft and you go your own way im pleased with you i say only that hard can become brittle without care take care are you pleased with me nonna because in going my own way i go yours perhaps youre giambelli blood tells im also avano tereza inclined her head her voice turned fierce youre proof arent you of which line is stronger your fathers in you hes a sly man and you can be sly hes ambitious and so are you but his weaknesses have never been yours his lack of heart has ruined him as much as his lack of courage you have both heart and courage and so you can be hard and not brittle i know you hate him sophia said softly tonight so do i hate is a strong word you shouldnt use it against your father whatever he is whatever hes done i have no hate for anthony avano tereza got to her feet again i have no feelings toward him now hes made his last choice that concerns me well deal with each other one final time then hell no longer exist for me you mean to cut him loose he made his choice tereza repeated now hell deal with the consequences of it its not for you to worry over she held out a hand come you should be at the party well find your mother and show them three generations of giambelli women it was very late when tony let himself into the apartment he wondered if anyone knew he had the key after all this time hed brought his own bottle of wine a choice from his personal cellar the barolo would keep things civilized business discussions and the word blackmail never entered his mind should always be conducted in a civilized manner he uncorked the bottle in the kitchen left the wine on the counter to breathe and selected two glasses though he was disappointed not to find fresh fruit in the refrigerator he made do with the wheel of brie even at three in the morning presentation mattered it was lucky hed made the appointment so late it had taken quite some doing to wind rene down shed spent over an hour even after the drive back to the city haranguing him about the giambellis their treatment of her his future with the company and money money was the main matter of course he could hardly blame her for it their lifestyle required a great deal of money unlike pilar rene didnt bring unlimited funds to the table and unlike pilar rene went through money like it would shortly become unfashionable to have any in your pocket no matter he thought arranging crackers with the cheese it would be a simple and civilized matter to increase their cash flow the giambellis intended to cut him loose he was certain of that now neither pilar nor sophia would stand up for him hed known that was a possibility but had chosen to ignore it and hope for the best or rather he admitted here in private hed allowed rene to push him into a corner but he had options any number of options the first of which should be coming along any minute this first business deal would be a stopgap buy him time he had other avenues and they could be widened if necessary he had contacts and prospects tereza giambelli would be very sorry shed underestimated him a great many people would be sorry in the end he would land on his feet as he always had he had no doubt of it the knock on the door made him smile he poured two glasses of wine set them and the bottle on a tray with the cheese and crackers he set the tray on the coffee table in the living room he shot his cuffs smoothed his hair then walked to the door prepared to begin negotiations part two the growing not a having and a resting but a growing and a becoming is the character of perfection as culture conceives it matthew arnold chapter nine contents prev next i dont know why we had to come back here because i needed a few more things she could have put it off sophia admitted but no reason to waste a trip into san francisco without stopping by her apartment hadnt she taken pity on ty and driven elis suv instead of her convertible look she continued i explained that at the beginning im going to have to spotcheck the offices kris is going to continue to resist the new feeding chain she needs to see you and me together a team some team im managing she pulled into her parking slot set the brake i think we should call a holiday truce at the moment ty i just dont have the time to fight with you she climbed out slammed her door jammed her keys in her briefcase whats the problem i dont have a problem youre the problem he walked around to her side leaned on the fender shed been edgy for two days he thought long enough for anybody to stew he didnt think it was about their incident at the christmas party shed come out on top of that one a team remember are you still upset about the angels no i took care of them didnt i good as new yeah you deal all right so whats the problem now you want to know the problem fine i hate getting up at the crack of dawn every day tromping around the fields in the cold but im doing it then i go back and do the work im trained to do but im obliged to juggle it from the villa and the offices here where i have a secondincommand whos not only slept with my father but is ready to mutiny fire her oh thats an idea she tapped a finger to her temple while her voice dripped disdain why hasnt that occurred to me could it be because were weeks into a reorganization in the middle of a huge and intense and vital promotional campaign and i have no one qualified to take over her work yes you know i think that might be the reason i havent kicked her bitchy cheating ass out look brat you got sand in your shoe you shake it out i dont have time she snapped and to prove it yanked out her filofax it bulged would you like to take a look in here see my schedule for the next six weeks she jammed it back in her briefcase so youre pressed he gave a little shrug take the mornings off to do what you have to do ill carry you in the vineyard the look she gave him shot like a bullet nobody carries me macmillan but youre damn right im pressed im supposed to be training my mother who has little to no interest in public relations ive had to cancel three dates with three very interesting men because im buried in work my social life is going down the toilet i havent been able to get through goddamn rene for two days to contact my father who hasnt been to his office and its imperative i speak with him about one of our top accounts within the next fortyeight hours as someone who unfortunately wont be me is going to need to fly to san diego for a meeting in approximately fortynine hours what about margaret i thought she was taking over most of the major accounts do you think i didnt try that do i look stupid tired frustrated and fed up she stalked to the garage elevator and stabbed the button she left for italy yesterday afternoon neither she nor her office is fully updated on the twiner account because its always been my fathers baby since i dont want the people at twiner to know weve got a hole in the loop ive been tapdancing with them for days nobody carries you ty pointed out but youre carrying avano no im through carrying him but ill carry giambelli and thats why im covering for him as long as i can i dont like it im pissed off and i have a stupid headache okay he surprised them both by reaching up to rub her stiff shoulders when they stepped onto the elevator take some aspirin then well work it through a step at a time shes got no right to block me from speaking to my own father not on a personal level or a business one no she doesnt that ty assumed was the real headache its a power play she wont get her kicks unless you let her know it steams you work around him if i work around him it makes him look like a damn it he is a fool im so angry with him for putting me into this spot if i dont clean it up by end of day youll clean it up by end of day yeah she let out a breath stepped off the elevator on her floor turned to study him why are you being nice to me it throws you off plus twiner is a big stake i dont spend all my time in the fields he said when she lifted her eyebrows at him if youd told me you were trying to track down your father id have given you a hand with it you havent gone to cutter she pressed her lips together no but i figure he knows somethings up hell pinpoint the target soon enough then well just have to be faster teamwork remember thats only because you dislike him more than you dislike me and your point is it made her laugh as she put the key in the lock as good a reason as any i just need to grab a few things including some old files i want my mother to study and i think i might have some notes on twiner thatll partially plug this hole ill have you back home by dinner she stopped turned unless she said adding a slow smile youd like to order in and try out a different kind of teamwork cut it out you liked kissing me when i was a kid i liked green apples i found out theyre hell on the system im ripe he reached past her to turn the knob youre telling me she gave his arm a friendly squeeze as she turned im starting to like you macmillan what the hell will we do about that she pushed open the door took one step inside froze dad she had a brief impression no more than a blur before ty was shoving her out the door again but that blurred image stayed in her mind was all she could see her father slumped in her chair the side of his face the glinting silver at his temples the front of his shirt all crusted and dark and his eyes his handsome clever eyes filmed over and staring dad hes i have to my father she was pale as a sheet and already beginning to shudder when ty pushed her against the wall outside her apartment listen to me sophia listen use your cell phone call nineoneone do it now an ambulance she fought her way through the fog that wanted to slither over her brain and began to fight tyler he needs an ambulance i have to go to him no he gripped her arms gave her one brisk shake you cant help him he tabled the idea of going back in to check on tony himself sophia couldnt be left alone and hed already seen enough to be certain there was nothing to be done he pulled sophia to the floor opened her briefcase himself and dug out her cell phone i need the police he said sophia lowered her head to her knees as tyler gave the emergency operator the necessary information she couldnt think wouldnt think yet somehow she had to steady herself and get through im all right her voice was quiet almost calm even if her hands couldnt be i know hes dead i have to go in to him no he settled down on the floor beside her and draped an arm over her shoulders as much in restraint as comfort you dont youre not im sorry sophia theres nothing you can do theres always something she lifted her head her eyes were dry burning dry someone killed my father and there has to be something i can do i know what he was her voice broke there and the tears that were scalding her throat poured up and out hes still my father i know it he tightened his grip until she laid her head on his shoulder there was something to do he thought as she wept even if it was only to wait he didnt leave her sophia told herself to remember that whatever happened between them or didnt when things had been at their very worst tyler had stayed with her she sat on the sofa in the apartment across the hall from her own shed been to a couple of parties there she recalled the gay couple who lived there threw delightful parties and frankie a graphic artist who often worked at home had opened the apartment to her and the police and bless him had discreetly closed himself in the bedroom to give them privacy no doubt the story would make its way like an electric fire through the building but for now he was being a pal shed remember that too i dont know what he was doing in my apartment sophia said again she tried to study the face of the man who questioned her like his name detective lamont claremont his features kept slipping out of focus did your father or anyone else have a key the name was claremont alexander claremont no i yes sophia lifted a hand pressed a fingertip against her temple as if to loosen the thought my father i gave him a key not long after i moved in he was having some decorating work done on his place and i was going to be out of the country i offered to let him use my place while i was gone i dont think i ever got the key back i never thought of it again did he often use your place no he didnt use it when i offered but stayed at a hotel or said he had she thought had he used her apartment then and since hadnt there been times shed come back from a trip and felt someone had been there in her absence little things out of place no that was stupid it would have been the cleaning service her father would have had no reason to use her apartment hed had his own with rene he cheated on your mother a voice murmured in her brain he cheated on rene ms giambelli im sorry what did you say you want some water something tyler interrupted to give her a moment to tune back no no thanks im sorry detective i keep losing the thread its all right i asked when was the last time you had contact with your father saturday night there was a party at our vineyard its an annual event my father was there what time did he leave i couldnt say there were a great many people he didnt say goodbye to me did he attend

not to my knowledge when was the last time you were in your apartment over a week ago as i told you im staying primarily in napa for the next several months i came here today after mr macmillan and i left the offices downtown to pick up a few more things what was your relationship with your father she toughened up sitting beside her tyler felt it he was my father detective why dont i save you the trouble of asking me if i killed him no i didnt nor do i know who killed him or why claremonts voice remained steady did your father have any enemies obviously that were known to you he added without skipping a beat no i dont know of anyone who would have killed him claremont looked down at his pad appeared to study some notes how long have your parents been divorced theyve been legally separated over seven years separated yes they havent lived together in any real sense since i was a child would this rene foxx be your fathers second wife thats correct just married a couple days ago so i was informed when were your parents divorced ms giambelli there was a cold ball in her belly now she wouldnt let him see the nerves i believe the decree was final the day before my father married rene it

can you tell me what happens with my father now what arrangements need to be made well continue our investigation my partner is working across the hall with the crimescene unit ill discuss arrangements with next of kin im my fathers only child his wife is his legal next of kin ms giambelli her mouth opened closed when her hand fluttered up tyler simply took it in his and held it i see of course i have to go home ty were going mr macmillan i have some questions for you i gave you my address tyler shot a look over his shoulder as he led sophia to the door you know where to find me yeah claremont tapped his pad as the door closed that i do he had a feeling he and his partner were going to take a ride into the country very soon he walked to the bedroom door sure if he opened it the neighbor would tumble out ear first instead he knocked might as well keep things friendly while he asked more questions alexander claremont liked french wine italian shoes and american blues hed grown up in san francisco the middle son of solidly middleclass parents whod worked hard to ensure a good life and good educations for their three boys his older brother was a pediatrician his younger a professor at berkeley alex claremont had planned to be a lawyer hed been born to be a cop the law was a different entity in the hands of a cop than it was in the hands of a lawyer for a lawyer it was there to be bent twisted manipulated and tailored to fit a clients needs he understood that and on a very basic level respected that to a cop it was the line it was the line claremont worshiped now barely two hours after walking onto the crime scene he was thinking about the line what do you think of the daughter he didnt answer at first but his partner was used to that she was driving because shed gotten to the car first rich he said at length classy tough shell didnt say anything she didnt want to say thought it lots of thinking going on but she watches her words big important family big juicy scandal maureen maguire braked at a light tapped her fingers on the wheel she and claremont were polar opposites which was in her opinion why theyd found their rhythm after the initial bumps three years back and worked well together she was as white as a white woman could be irish and freckled and strawberryblond with soft blue eyes and a dimple in her left cheek at thirtysix she was four years claremonts senior comfortably married where he was radically single cozily suburban where he was uptown urban nobody sees the guy go in no vehicle were running the cab companies to see if they had a dropoff here from the looks of the body hed been dead at least thirtysix hours key to the place was in his pocket along with three hundred and change in cash and plenty of plastic he had a gold rolex gold cuff links with pretty little diamonds in them the apartment had plenty of easily transported items no robbery he shot her a look no kidding just crossing off the list two glasses of wine one full one halffull only one with prints his prints he got plugged where he sat no tussle no signs of struggle from the angle of the shots the killer was sitting on the sofa nice little wineandcheese party and oh excuse me bam bam bam youre dead guy was divorced and remarried within a day romantic interlude gone bad maybe maguire pursed her lips hard to say from the scene three shots twentyfivecaliber id say and close range not much of a pop but its surprising nobody heard anything in a snazzy building like that she parked glanced up at the next snazzy building funny huh how a new husband doesnt come home and the new bride doesnt report him missing lets find out why rene had just gotten in from a threehour session at her salon nothing smoothed her feathers better than a long bout of pampering unless it was shopping but shed taken care of that as well with a quick foray into neimans where shed treated herself lavishly tony she thought as she poured herself a small vermouth was going to pay and pay dearly for this little bout of the sulks hed gone off like this before a couple of days at a time when shed pressured him over some matter the good part was he always came back always with some very attractive trinket in hand and naturally agreed to do whatever shed demanded he do in the first place she didnt mind so much as it gave her a little time to herself besides now it was all legal and tidy she lifted her left hand studied the glitter of her rings she was mrs anthony avano and intended to stay that way or scalp him bald in a divorce when the bell rang she smiled it would be tony come crawling back he knew better than to use his key when hed been gone the last time hed done so shed pulled a gun on him one thing about her tony he learned fast she opened the door prepared to make him beg then frowned at the couple holding up badges mrs avano yes whats this about detective claremont and my partner detective maguire san francisco pd may we come in why please mrs avano may we come in is tony in jail she hissed through her teeth as she stepped back what the hell did he do no maam hes not in jail maguire moved in im sorry mrs avano your husband is dead dead rene let out an annoyed huff of breath thats ridiculous youve made a mistake theres no mistake mrs avano claremont said could we sit down rene felt a little jerk in her stomach stepped back you expect me to believe tonys dead just dead were very sorry maam why dont we sit down maguire started to take her arm but rene yanked away shed lost some of the color in her face but her eyes were alive and angry was there an accident no maam could you tell us the last time you saw your husband or had contact with him rene stared hard at claremont saturday night early sunday morning i guess what happened to tony you werent concerned when you didnt hear from him we had an argument she snapped tony often goes off on little sulks afterward im not his mother no maam maguire nodded his wife you were married recently werent you thats right what happened to him i have a right to know what happened anthony avano was shot and killed her head jerked back but almost immediately the color rushed back into her face i knew it i warned him shed do something crazy but he wouldnt listen she was harassing us wasnt she those quiet types you cant trust them who is that mrs avano his wife she sucked in a breath turned and stalked over to pick up her drink his exwife pilar giambelli the bitch killed him if she didnt his little tramp of a daughter did he didnt know what to do for her she sat in the passenger seat her eyes closed but he knew she wasnt sleeping her composure was a thin and tensile veneer and he wasnt certain what hed find if he managed to crack it so he gave her silence on the long drive north the energy the vitality sophia owned like breath was gone that concerned him most it was like having a doll sitting beside him maybe it was a kind of bubble a void between the shock and the next stage of grief he didnt know about such things hed never lost anyone important to him certainly never lost anyone so brutally and suddenly when he turned into the drive she opened her eyes as if she sensed home in her lap her fingers linked together the bubbles burst ty thought watching her knuckles go white ill come in with you she started to refuse that kneejerk icandoitmyself response it was hard to admit she wasnt sure she could do anything herself just yet and he was family she needed family thanks my mother she had to swallow as he stopped the fourwheel at the base of the steps its going to be very hard for my mother sophia he laid his hand over hers tightening his grip when she would have shifted away sophia he said again until she looked at him people always think they have to be strong they dont giambellis do im numb ty and im afraid of whats going to happen inside me when im not im afraid to start thinking im afraid to start feeling all i can do is the next thing then well do the next thing he got out of the car came around to her side and in a gesture that made her throat burn took her hand the house was warm and fragrant with her mothers flowers sophia looked around the grand foyer like a stranger nothing had changed how could it be that nothing had changed she watched maria come down the hall everything moves like a dream sophia thought even footsteps echo like a dream maria where is my mother upstairs shes working in your office miss sophia and la signora uneasy maria looked toward tyler she is in the fields with mr mac would you send someone for them please send someone out for my grandparents yes right away she went quickly while sophia turned toward the stairs her hand tightened on tylers she could hear music coming from her office something light and frothy when she stepped into the doorway she saw her mother her hair scooped back bent over the keyboard of the computer what do you mean ive committed an illegal function damn it i hate you another time the baffled frustration would have amused sophia now it and everything made her want to weep mama oh thank god sophia ive done something i dont know what ive been practicing for an hour and still im useless on this thing she pushed back from the desk glanced up and froze what is it whats wrong she knew every line every curve every expression of her daughters face her stomach twisted painfully as she rushed across the room whats happened mama everything changes now sophia thought once it was said nothing was ever going to be the same again mama its dad is he hurt is he ill he she couldnt say the words instead she released tys hand and wrapped her arms tight around her mother the twisting in pilars stomach stilled everything inside her stilled oh god oh my god pressing her face to sophias hair she began to rock no oh baby no im sorry im so sorry mama we found him in my apartment someone someone killed him there what wait shaking she drew back no sit down pilar tyler was already leading them both to the curved love seat against the wall no no this cant be right i need to sit tyler repeated and gently pushed both of them down listen to me look at me he waited while pilar groped for sophias hand i know this is hard for both of you avano was in sophias apartment we dont know why it looked like he was meeting someone there pilar blinked her mind seemed to be skipping as if there was a tooth missing on a gear in sophies apartment why do you say that what do you mean there was a bottle of wine on the table two glasses hed memorized the scene quiet elegance stark death its likely whoever it was he met there killed him the police have already questioned sophia sophia her fingers gripped her daughters like a clamp the police and theyre going to have more questions for her for you maybe all of us i know its hard hard to think straight but you have to prepare yourself to deal with them i think you should call a lawyer both of you i dont want a lawyer i dont need a lawyer for gods sake ty tonys been murdered thats right in his daughters apartment only days after divorcing you and marrying someone else only days after sophie went after him in public guilt ugly and fierce bared its teeth inside sophia goddamn it ty if either of us was going to kill him wed have done it years ago tyler shifted his gaze to sophias the energy was back he noted and it was furious that he decided was a plus is that what youre going to say to the cops is that what youre going to say to the reporters when they start calling publicitys your business sophie think her breath was coming too fast she couldnt stop it something inside her wanted to explode to burst out of the fragile skin of control and scream then she felt her mothers hand tremble in hers and reeled it back in all right but not yet not now were entitled to mourn first she drew her mother closer were entitled to be human first she got to her feet walked to the door on legs that felt stiff and brittle would you go down talk to nonna and eli tell them what they need to be told i want to be alone with my mother okay pilar he bent down touched her knee im sorry he met sophias eyes as he walked out the great dark depth of them was all he saw as she closed the door between them chapter ten contents prev next ty was right but sophia would stew about that later it might help to have something petty to brood about the reporters started to call less than ten minutes after shed told her mother and before shed been able to go downstairs and speak with her grandmother she knew the line they would take unity and she was prepared to go headtohead with the police to soften the blow for her mother there would be no comment to the press until she was able to write the appropriate release there would be no interviews she was perfectly aware her fathers murder would generate a media circus but the giambellis would not step into the center ring and perform which meant she had a great many phone calls to make to family members and key employees but the first damn tyler was to helen moore they needed legal advice ive called aunt helen she told tereza good tereza sat in the front parlor her back rulerstraight her face composed your mother she wanted a few minutes alone with a nod tereza lifted her hand took sophias it was a connection and it was enough who do you trust most on your staff to write a statement for the press and filter the calls me i want to do it myself nonna good tereza gave her hand a squeeze released it im sorry for your grief cam tylers told us everything he knows i dont like that you were questioned before you were able to speak with helen or james i have nothing to hide i know nothing my father was shot while he sat in my chair in my apartment how could i not tell them anything that might help them find who killed him if you know nothing you could tell them nothing that would help she dismissed the police with one impatient gesture tyler get sophia some wine when the phone rang again she slapped a hand on the arm of her chair ill take care of it tyler began no we dont want a family member talking to the press today sophia rubbed her forehead ordered herself to think you should get david ask him to come if you could explain things to him ill get started on a statement for now its simply the family is in seclusion and has no comment ill get him here tyler crossed to her lifted her face with a hand on her chin you dont need wine you need an aspirin i dont need either she stepped back give me a half hour she said to her grandmother sophie eli left terezas side to put his arms around sophia take a breath cant all right do whats best for you ill start making the calls i can do that you can but i will and take the aspirin all right for you it helped the aspirin and the work within an hour she was steadier had the official statement drafted and had briefed david ill take care of the press sophia you take care of yourself and your mother well get through you need to be aware that some enterprising reporter is bound to try to get close to the villa and to macmillans you have children and that connection to the family will also be made ill talk to my kids theyre not going to sell a story to the tabloids sophia im sorry i dont mean to imply that but theyre still children they could be harassed and they could be caught off guard ill talk to them he repeated i know this is rough for you i cant imagine how rough for you and your mother he got to his feet anything i can do just tell me what it is i appreciate that she hesitated measuring him as she did so petty resentments company policies had to be put aside my grandparents trust you or you wouldnt be here so im going to trust you im going to set you up here in the house so you can handle the phones id give you my space but i may need it she started for the door then just stopped in the middle of the room she looked he thought blank as if some internal mechanism had shut down why dont you rest a little i cant as long as i keep moving i can handle it i know what people thought of him i know whatll be said about him in whispers over cocktails in gleeful articles in the press what thought of him what said to him oh god dont think of it now it cant hurt him but it can and will hurt my mother so i cant stop she hurried out i think the library would be best she began youll have privacy there and its convenient if you need anything we havent thought of she was halfway down the steps when maria opened the front door to the police claremont looked over the housekeepers head and saw sophia ms giambelli detective its all right maria ill take care of this do you have any more information for me she asked him as she continued down the steps not at this time wed like to speak to you again and to your mother my mother is resting david this is detective claremont he finished and my partner detective maguire david cutter detectives claremont and maguire mr cutter is chief operating officer of giambellimacmillan ill show you into the parlor and be with you in just a moment is your mother at home ms giambelli i said my mother is resting shes not up to speaking with you at this time sophia pilar came down the steps one hand holding the banister with helen just behind her its all right i want to do what i can mrs avano helen began careful to use pilars married name is willing to answer your questions im sure youll take her emotional state into consideration judge moore she added with a cool nod im an old family friend claremont knew of her and had been under ruthless crossexamination by her husband lawyers at the ready he mused are you representing ms avano judge moore im here to offer my friend my support and my advice should that be necessary why dont we go sit down pilar said sophia would you ask maria to arrange for some coffee of course slick and civilized claremont thought he saw where the daughter got her class but classy women killed just like all the other kinds especially when theyd been tossed over for a younger model still she answered questions directly hadnt seen or spoken with the deceased since the famous party hadnt been to her daughters apartment in more than a month didnt have a key didnt own a gun though she admitted before the judge could cut her off that there were guns in the house you were upset when your husband finalized your divorce to marry rene foxx yes pilar agreed even as helen opened her mouth its foolish to deny it helen naturally i was upset i dont find the end of a marriage a reason to celebrate even when the marriage had become no more than a legality he was my daughters father you argued no her lips curved and put claremont in mind of an elegantly sorrowful madonna it was difficult to argue with tony he slipped around most arguments i gave him what he wanted there was really nothing else to do was there i handled the divorce for mrs avano helen put in it was amicable on both sides legally as simple as such matters can be but you were upset nonetheless maguire stated upset enough to phone your exhusbands residence last week in the middle of the night and make certain threats and accusations i did no such thing for the first time a battle light came into her eyes i never called tonys apartment never spoke to rene at all she assumed i did mrs avano we can easily check phone records then please do so her spine stiffened and so did her voice however displeased i was with the choices tony made they were his choices im not in the habit of calling anyone in the middle of the night to make threats or accusations the current mrs avano claims otherwise then shes mistaken or shes lying she called me in the middle of the night and accused me of this was abusive and upsetting youll find that call on your phone records detective but you wont find one on mine why would she lie i dont know on a sigh pilar rubbed her temple perhaps she wasnt im sure someone did call her and she assumed it was me she was angry she disliked me on principle do you know what time mr avano left the premises here the night of the party no frankly i avoided both him and rene as much as possible that evening it was awkward and it was uncomfortable for me do you know why he went to your daughters apartment at the cab company had come through claremont looked at his pad as if refreshing his memory three oclock that morning no where were you at that time in bed most of the guests were gone by one i went to my room sometime before two alone she added anticipating the question i said good night to sophia then i went straight to bed because i was tired it had been a long day could we have a moment helen asked and gestured to indicate the detectives should step out of the room you can get from here to san francisco in an hour maguire speculated in the hallway shes got no alibi for the time in question shes got a decent motive why meet the ex in your daughters apartment all in the family maybe claremont responded and stepped back in when the judge called detectives mrs avano is reluctant to bring up certain information anthony avano was her husband for a number of years and they share a daughter shes distressed to say anything that damages his reputation however as ive advised her its more constructive to pass on this information as it may be useful to your investigation and moreover moreover pilar she said quietly theyre going to get the picture soon enough from other sources all right she got to her feet roamed the room all right you asked if i had any idea why he might have gone to sophias i cant be sure but tony had a weakness for women some people drink some gamble some have affairs tony had affairs he may have arranged to meet someone there to break off an affair or to do you know who he might have been involved with no i stopped looking a long time ago but there was someone he knew whod called rene that night im sure of it and he seemed edgy at the party that was unusual for tony he was rarely ruffled he was a bit rude to david cutter and not as sociable as was his habit i think looking back he was in some sort of trouble i dont know i didnt want to know so i didnt do anything about it if i had i cant know if it would have made a difference thats painful claremont rose we appreciate your cooperation mrs avano wed like to speak with the other members of the family now mr cutter and any members of the staff who were here during the party he specifically wanted to question sophia again he took her alone while his partner took david cutter you didnt mention that you and your father had a heated argument on the night he was killed no i didnt because you didnt ask now that you do id have to qualify an argument is between two people over a point of disagreement there was no argument then how would you qualify it hard words hard words that were a long time coming its difficult for me detective to know theyre the last words ill ever say to him even though they were true even though i meant them its difficult i was angry hed been married hours after the divorce from my mother was final he hadnt bothered to tell me of his plans hadnt bothered to give my mother the courtesy of informing her and he came to a family event with his new wife on his arm it was careless and insensitive and just like him i told him so my information is you threatened him did i i might have i was furious hurt embarrassed rene had cornered my mother and attacked her verbally there was no call for it she had what she wanted he let it happen my father was brilliant at letting things happen and remaining somehow oblivious to the damage done word spread across the country and across the atlantic donato sat in the office on the first floor of his home drank brandy and considered the house was finally quiet though he expected the baby would be up squalling for its breast before long gina was sleeping and if it wasnt for that habitual middleofthenight circus he could have slipped out and spent a relaxing hour with his mistress best not to risk it tony avano was dead the meeting scheduled with margaret bowers the next morning would and should be postponed that would buy him time hed preferred keeping his business dealings with tony hed known just where he stood with tony avano now tony was dead and there would be a great upheaval there would be talk gossip delays snags he could use that to his advantage he must go back to california of course he would have to offer his support and his sympathies to pilar and sophia and assure la signora that he would do whatever she required him to do in order to maintain giambellis production since it was only two days before christmas he would convince gina that she must remain at home and not upset the children yes that was good and he could take his pretty lady along for company no one would know the difference yes this would give him time to figure out what had to be done and how to do it poor tony he thought and lifted his brandy rest in peace jeremy demorney turned down the volume on the evening news and removed his dinner jacket he was glad hed made it an early night it was better to be home alone when the news hit than out in public tony avano the worthless bastard was dead almost a pity in a way the current climate had made avano ripe for picking and jerry had waited a good long time for it leaving behind a sorrowful exwife he imagined a merry widow and a grieving daughter all more than hed deserved as he undressed jerry considered flying back out to california to attend whatever memorial service the giambellis planned then dismissed the idea it was a bit too well known that the late unlamented avano had slept with jeremys wife oh theyd handled it like civilized people of course not counting the split lip jerry had given his adulterous wife as a parting gift divorce financial settlement and a pretense of manners in public well jerry thought theyd all excelled at pretenses hed send a personal message to the family expressing his sympathy and regrets best all around he decided to keep his distance from the family for the time being hed make his move there when he was ready for the moment hed have a little wake of his own damned if he wasnt going to open a bottle of champagne and celebrate murder sophia spent nearly a week handling her fathers murder like a business assignment with emotions on hold she made calls made arrangements asked questions answered them and watched her mother like a hawk when she ran into a wall and she ran into plenty she did what she could to scale over or tunnel under the police gave her nothing but the same repetitive line the investigation was ongoing all leads were being actively pursued they treated her resentfully she thought no differently than they did a reporter or a suspect rene refused to take her calls and she grew weary of leaving dozens of messages on the machine sympathetic messages concerned messages polite ones angry ones bitter ones her father would have a memorial service with or without his widows input or cooperation she made excuses to her mother citing a few problems at her san francisco office that needed her attention and prepared to drive to the city tyler was pulling up in the drive as she stepped out of the house wherere you going i have business where she tried to move by him toward the garage only to have him step into her path look im in a hurry go prune a vine where nerves wanted to snap and that couldnt be allowed i need to run into the city i have some work fine well take my car i dont need you today teamwork remember he knew a woman who was teetering on a thin wire and he wasnt letting her drive i can handle this macmillan why the hell hadnt she said she was going shopping yeah you can handle anything he put one hand on her arm opened the car door with the other get in did it ever occur to you id rather be alone did it ever occur to you i dont care to solve the problem he simply picked her up and plopped her on the seat strap in he ordered and slammed the door she considered kicking the door open then kicking him but she was afraid shed never stop there was such a rage inside her such a burning raging grief and she reminded herself as shed promised she would that he had been there for her at the worst moment he slid behind the wheel maybe it was because hed known her more than half his life maybe it was because hed paid more attention to her over the past few weeks than he had over the last twenty years either way ty thought he knew that face almost too well and the composure on it was no real mask at least not at the moment so he turned the car on glanced toward her where are you really going to see the police i cant get any answers on the phone okay he shifted into first and headed down the drive i dont need a guard dog ty or a big broad shoulder or an emotional pillow okay he just kept driving for the record id just as soon you didnt need a punching bag either as an answer she folded her arms stared straight ahead the mountains were shrouded with mist laced with snow like a softfocused photograph the staggering view did nothing to cheer her in her mind all she could see was the tornout sheet from an industry magazine that had come in her mail the day before the photograph of her her grandmother her mother that had been published months before had been defiled as the giambelli angels had been red pen had been used this time slashing bloody ink over their faces branding them murdering bitches this time was it the answer to her repeated calls to rene sophia wondered did the woman think such a childish trick would frighten her she wouldnt let it frighten her and as shed burned it in the flames of the fireplace sophia had felt disgust anger but not fear yet still a day later she couldnt get it out of her mind did eli ask you to babysit me she demanded of tyler no my grandmother no then who heres the deal sophia i take orders in business when i have to i dont take them in my personal life this is personal clear no she looked away from the mountains now studied his equally compelling profile you didnt even like my father and youre not that crazy about me i didnt like your father he said it simply without apology and without pleasure and for that reason alone it didnt sting jurys still out on you but i do like your mother and i really dont like rene or the fact that she tried to sic the cops on pilar and maybe on you over this then youll be thrilled to know my second stop today is rene i need to go a round or two with her about a memorial service boy wont that be fun do you think therell be hair pulling and biting involved you men really get off on that kind of thing dont you its just sick yeah he sighed heavy and wistful and made her laugh the first easy genuine laugh in days it occurred to sophia that shed never been in an actual police station her idea of one had been fictionally generated so that shed expected dark dank corridors with worn linoleum noisy cramped offices surlyeyed snarling characters and the stench of bad coffee served in paper cups secretly shed been looking forward to the experience instead she found an office atmosphere with clean floors and wide hallways that smelled faintly of lysol she wouldnt have said it was quiet as a tomb but when she walked toward the detectives division with ty she could hear her heels click on the floor the detectives area was scattered with desks utilitarian but not scarred and dented as had been her hope there was the scent of coffee but it smelled fresh and rich she did see guns so that was something strapped to belts or harnessed over shoulders it seemed odd to see them in the welllit room where the major sound was the clicking of computer keys as she scanned she connected with claremont he glanced toward a door on the side of the room then rose and walked toward them ms giambelli i need to talk to you about my father about arrangements and your investigation when i spoke to you on the phone i know what you told me on the phone detective basically nothing i think im entitled to more information and im certainly entitled to know when my fathers body will be released im going to tell you my next step will go over your head ill start using every connection i have and believe me my family has many connections im aware of that why dont we use the lieutenants office he gestured then cursed under his breath when the side door opened and his partner walked out with rene she was magnificent in black pale of cheek with her hair shining like the sun and coiled at the nape she was the perfect picture of the society widow sophia imagined shed studied the results carefully before stepping out and she hadnt been able to resist relieving the black with a delicate diamond starburst brooch sophia stared at the pin for a long moment then snapped her attention to rene whats she doing here rene demanded i told you shes been harassing me calling me constantly threatening me she clenched a handkerchief in her hand i want to file a restraining order on her on all of them they murdered my poor tony have you been practicing that act long rene sophia asked icily it still needs a little work i want police protection they had tony killed because of me theyre italian they have connections to the mafia sophia started to laugh a little bubble of sound at first that built and built until she couldnt stop she staggered back and sat on the low bench along the wall oh thats it thats right theres a hotbed of organized crime in my grandmothers house it just took an exmodel a socialclimbing bimbo gold digger to ferret it out she wasnt aware her laughter had turned to weeping that tears were streaming down her cheeks i want to bury my father rene let me do that let me have some part in doing that then well never have to see or speak to each other again rene tucked her handkerchief back in her purse she crossed the room a room that had gone very quiet and waited until sophia got to her feet again he belongs to me and youll have part of nothing rene sophia reached out sucked in a breath when her hand was slapped sharply away mrs avano claremonts tone was a warning even as he took her arm i wont have her touch me if you or anyone in your family calls me again youll deal with my lawyers rene threw her chin up and strolled out of the room for spite sophia murmured just for spite ms giambelli maguire touched her arm why dont you come sit down let me get you some coffee i dont want any coffee will you tell me if theres any progress in your investigation we have nothing new to tell you im sorry when will my fathers body be released your fathers remains are being released this morning to his next of kin i see ive wasted my time and yours excuse me she walked out and was already yanking her phone from her purse she tried helen moore first only to be told the judge was on the bench and unavailable you think she can stop rene i dont know i have to try she called james moores office next frustrated to be told he was in a meeting as a last ditch she asked for linc linc its sophia i need help pilar sat on a stone bench in the garden it was cold but god she needed the air she felt trapped in the house in a way she never had before trapped by the walls and the windows guarded by the people who loved her best watched she thought as carefully as an invalid who might pass at any moment they thought she was grieving and she let them think it was that the bigger of her sins she wondered to allow everyone to believe she was devastated by grief when she felt nothing could feel nothing unless it was horribly the slightest twinge of relief there had been shock and sorrow and grief but it had all passed so quickly and her lack of feeling shamed her so much so shed avoided her family as much as possible so much so shed spent nearly the whole of christmas in her rooms unable to comfort her child for fear the child would see her mothers falseness how could a woman go from loving to not loving to callousness so quickly pilar wondered had the lack of passion and compassion been in her all along and had that lack been what had sent tony away from her or had what hed done so carelessly throughout their marriage killed whatever capacity shed had to feel it hardly mattered he was dead and she was empty she got to her feet turned toward the house then stopped when she saw david on the path i didnt want to disturb you thats all right ive been trying to keep out of your way that wasnt necessary i thought it was you look tired pilar and lonely he thought i suppose we all are i know youve pulled a lot of extra duty these past few days i hope you know how much its appreciated she nearly stepped back when he walked toward her but made herself hold still how was your christmas it was busy lets just say ill be glad when january rolls around and the kids start school is there anything i can do for you no nothing really she intended to excuse herself escape to her rooms again but there was something about him and looking at him she heard words pouring out of her mouth im so useless here david i cant help sophia i know shes trying to take her mind off everything with work and spending so much time trying to train me in the office here i just bungle everything thats a foolish thing to say its not i do i never really worked in an office and the short time i did was over twentyfive years ago everythings changed i cant make the damn computer work and i dont know the language even the purpose half the time instead of rapping my knuckles over my mistakes as she should shes patting my head because she doesnt want to upset me and shes the one whos upset and i cant help her she pressed her fingers to her temple so i run away im so goddamn good at running away im out here right now so that i dont have to face her shes making herself sick over tony trying to stop rene from claiming his body she cant grieve wont let herself theres no closure and wont be any until the police but she needs this rite this ritual and rene wont have it she needs to deal with it in her own way you know that just as you need to deal with it in yours i dont know what mine is i should go in i have to find the right words unwilling to leave her alone david walked with her toward the house pilar do you think sophia doesnt know what she means to you she knows just as she knows what she didnt mean to her father its difficult for a child to live with that i know it but they do she stopped on the side terrace turned to him are you ever afraid youre not enough for them every day she let out a halflaugh its terrible of me but its a relief to hear you say that she opened the side door to see sophia on the sofa her face stark white with linc moore beside her gripping her hand what is it pilar rushed across the room crouched in front of her daughter oh baby what is it we were too late linc tried he even got a temporary restraining order but it was too late shes had him cremated mama shed already arranged for it before im sorry still holding sophias hand linc reached out to pilar she had him taken straight to the crematorium it was already begun before we had the temporary restraining order hes gone mama chapter eleven contents prev next over the long winter the vines slept the fields stretched acre upon acre drinking the rains hardening under frosts softening again with the quick and teasing warm snaps for a farmer for a crop the year was a circle to be repeated over and over with the variations and surprises the pleasures and the tragedies absorbed into the whole life was a continuing spiral running round toward february heavy rains delayed the pruning cycle and brought both frustration and that wet winter promise of a good harvest the fields and mountains smoked with mists february was for waiting for some it seemed the waiting had already lasted forever on the third floor of villa giambelli tereza kept her office she preferred the third floor away from the hive of the house and she loved her lofty view from the windows of all that was hers every day she climbed the steps a good discipline for the body and worked there for three hours never less and rarely these days more the room was comfortable she believed comfortable surroundings increased productivity she also believed in indulging herself where it mattered to her the desk had been her fathers it was old the oak dark and the drawers deep that was tradition on it sat a twoline phone and a highpowered computer that was progress beneath it old sally snored quietly that was home she believed absolutely in all three because she did her office was now occupied by her husband and his grandson her daughter and granddaughter and david cutter and paulo borelli the old and the new she thought she waited while coffee was served and the rain beat like soft fists on the roof and windows thank you maria that signaled the end of the social interlude and the beginning of business tereza folded her hands as the housekeeper slipped out shutting the door im sorry she began weve been unable to meet in total before this the loss of sophias father and the circumstances of his death postponed certain areas of business and elis recent illness prevented holding this meeting she glanced toward him now he still looked a bit frail to her the cold had turned so quickly into fever and chills shed been frightened im fine he said more to reassure her than the rest a little shaky on my pins yet but coming round a man doesnt have any choice but to come around when hes got so many nurses pecking at him she smiled because he wanted her to but she heard the faint wheeze in his chest while eli was recuperating ive kept him as current as possible on the movements of business sophia i have your report and your projections regarding the centennial campaign while well also discuss this individually id like you to bring everyone up to date of course sophia got to her feet opened a portfolio that contained mockups of the ads along with full target reports on message consumer statistics and the venues selected phase one of the campaign will begin in june with advertising placed as indicated in your packets she began as she passed the packets around weve created a threepronged campaign targeting our highend consumer our middle line and the most elusive the young casual wine drinker on a limited budget while she spoke tyler tuned her out hed heard the pitch before had god help him been in on various stages of its development the exposure had taught him the value of what she did but he couldnt drum up any real interest in it longrange weather reports forecasted a warming trend too much too soon would tease some of the grape varieties out of dormancy he needed to keep a keen eye out for that for the telltale signs of that slight movement in the buds for the soft bleeding at the pruning cuts an early break meant the danger of frost damage he was prepared to deal with that when the time came but i see were keeping tyler awake sophia said sweetly and snapped him back no youre not but since you interrupted my nap the second phase deals with public participation wine tastings vineyard tours social events auctions galas both here and in italy which generate publicity he rose to get more coffee from the cart sophia knows what shes doing i dont think anyone heres going to argue that and in the fields tereza asked does sophia know what shes doing he took his time sipped his coffee shes all right for an apprentice field hand please ty youll embarrass me with all those fulsome compliments very well tereza murmured david comments on the campaign clever classy thorough my only concern as a father of teenagers is that the ads targeting the twentyone to thirty market make wine look like a hell of a good time which it is sophia pointed out and which we want to project it to be he agreed but im wary about making the ads so slick and appealing to a young audience that those still too young will be influenced thats the father talking he admitted but i was also a boy who if and when i wanted to drink myself sick did so without any marketing influence whatsoever pilar made a little sound then subsided but as david sat beside her had made certain he sat beside her he heard it pilar thoughts no i was just well actually i think the campaigns wonderful and i know how hard sophies worked on it and ty of course and her team but i think david has a valid point about this well third prong its difficult to market something that appeals to the young market group without luring the inappropriate ages in if we could do some sort of disclaimer disclaimers are boring and dilute the message sophia began but she pursed her lips as she sat again unless we make it fun witty responsible and something that blends with the message let me think about it good now paulie now it was sophia who tuned out while the foreman spoke of the vines of various vintages being tested in the casks and tanks age she thought age vintage ripeness perfection she needed the hook patience good wine takes patience to make rewards age rewards patience shed find it her fingers itched to get out her pen and scribble she worked better if she set words down saw them on paper she got up for more coffee and with her back to the room scrawled quickly on a napkin paulie was excused and david called up instead of the marketing projections the cost analyses the forecasts and numbers sophia had expected her grandmother set his written report aside well deal with this later at the moment id like your evaluation of our key people here you have my written reports on that as well la signora i do she agreed and simply lifted her eyebrows all right tyler doesnt need me in the vineyards and he knows it the fact that its my job to oversee them and im another competent pair of hands hasnt yet taken the edge off his resistance a resistance i cant blame him for but that does get in the way of efficiency other than that the macmillan vineyards are as well run as any ive ever been associated with as are giambellis adjustments are still being made but his work on merging the operations coordinating crews is excellent sophia does well enough in the vineyard though its not her strength just as the marketing and promotion isnt tylers the fact that she carries the weight there as he does in the field results in a reasonably good and surprisingly interesting blend however there are some difficulties in the offices in san francisco im aware of the difficulties sophia said im handling them her david corrected sophia you have a difficult angry uncooperative employee whos been trying for several weeks to undermine your authority i have a meeting set up with her tomorrow afternoon i know my people david i know how to deal with this are you interested in how i know just how difficult angry and uncooperative kristin drakes been he waited a beat shes been talking to other companies her résumés landed on half a dozen desks in the last two weeks one of my sources at la coeur tells me shes making a number of claims and accusations with you her favorite target when she thinks she has the right ear sophia absorbed the betrayal the disappointment and nodded ill deal with her see that you do tereza advised if an employee cant be loyal at least she must be dignified we wont tolerate a staff member using gossip or innuendo as a bargaining chip for a position with another company and pilar shes learning david said business isnt her strong suit i think you misuse her la signora i beg your pardon in my opinion your daughter would be more suited as a spokesperson a liaison for the company where her charm and her elegance wouldnt be wasted as they are working at a keyboard i wonder that you dont ask pilar to help with the tours and the tastings where visitors could be treated to her company and have the extra benefit of personal contact with a member of the family shes an excellent hostess la signora she is not an excellent clerk youre saying ive made a mistake expecting my daughter to learn the business of the company yes david said easily and made eli fall into a fit of coughing sorry sorry he waved a hand as tyler leaped up to pour him a glass of water tried to suck down that laugh shouldnt christ tereza hes right and you know it he took the glass from tyler sipped carefully until the pressure in his chest eased hates to be wrong and hardly ever is sophia hows your mama working out as your assistant here shes hardly had time to shes terrible sophia admitted and burst out laughing oh mama im so sorry but youre just the worst office assistant ever created i couldnt send you into the city to work with my team in a million years you have ideas she added concerned when her mother said nothing just like today about the disclaimer but you wont mention them unless youre pinned and even then you dont know how to implement more than all of that you hate every minute youre stuck in my office im trying and obviously failing she said as she got to her feet mama no thats all right id rather you be honest than patronize me let me make this easier on everyone involved i quit now if youll excuse me ill go find something to do that im good at like sit somewhere looking elegant and charming ill go talk to her sophia began you wont tereza lifted a hand shes a grown woman not a child to be placated sit well finish the meeting it was tereza thought as she lifted her coffee encouraging to see her daughter show a snap of temper and a hint of spine finally he didnt have time to smooth ruffled feathers but since he felt hed had some part in the ruffling david sought pilar out over the past weeks maria had become one of his conduits of news and family dynamics with her help he tracked pilar down in the greenhouse he found her there wearing gardening gloves and an apron repotting seedlings shed started from cuttings got a minute i have all the time in the world she said without sparing him a glance or an ounce of warmth i dont do anything you dont do anything in an office that satisfies you or accomplishes a goal thats different im sorry my evaluation hurt your feelings but but its business she looked at him now dead on yeah its business you want to type and file pilar to sit in on meetings about publicity campaigns and marketing strategies i want to feel useful she tossed down her little spade did they think she was like the flowers she tended here she wondered did she something that required a controlled climate and careful handling to do nothing but look attractive in a nice setting im tired sick and tired of being made to feel as if i have nothing to offer no skills no talents no brains then you werent listening oh i heard you she yanked off her gloves tossed them down as well im to be charming and elegant like some welltailored doll that can be plunked down at the right time and the right place and tucked away in the closet the rest of the time well no thanks ive been tucked away quite long enough she started to push by him yanked her arm when he closed his hand over it then stared in shock as he simply took her other arm and held her in place no one handled her it simply wasnt done just hold on take your hands off me in a minute first charm is a talent elegance is a skill and it takes brains to know the right thing to say at the right time and to make people feel welcome youre good at those things so why not use them second if you think handling tourists and accounts at tastings and tours is fluff work youll find out different if you work up the guts to try it i dont need you to tell me apparently you do she nearly gaped when he cut her off it was something else rarely done and she remembered just how hed dealt with tony the night of the party he was using that same cold clean slice with her now ill remind you i dont work for you ill remind you he countered essentially you do unless youre going to stalk off like a spoiled child youll continue to work for me va al diavolo i dont have time for a trip to hell just now he said equably im suggesting you put your talents in the proper arena you need to know the business to handle the winery tours have the patience to answer questions youll hear over and over again to push the product without appearing to push it to be gracious informative and entertaining and before you start you have to take a good hard look at yourself and stop seeing the discarded wife of a man who didnt value anything as much as himself her mouth fell open and her lips trembled before she could form words what a hideous thing to say maybe but its time somebody said it waste bothers me youve let yourself be wasted and its starting to piss me off you have no right to say these things to me your position with giambelli doesnt give you a license to be cruel my position with the company doesnt give me the right to speak the truth as i see it it doesnt give me the right for this either he added and jerked her against him but this time its personal she was too shocked to stop him to manage even the slightest protest and when his mouth was on hers hard and angry she could do nothing but feel a mans mouth hot firm a mans hands demanding and strong the jolt of having her body pressed up to his to feel that heat those lines the sexual threat the blood rushed into her head one long tidal wave of power and her body her heart starved leaped into the flood of pleasure on a low moan she threw her arms around him they bumped her worktable sent pots tumbling clay cracked against clay with a sound like swords clashing nerves needs so long deadened snapped into life to sizzle through her system everything seemed to waken at once threatening overload as her knees went weak and her mouth went wild under his what she was breathless managed only a gasp as he lifted her off her feet and plunked her down on the bench what are we doing well think about it later he had to touch her had to feel her flesh under his hands already he was tugging at her sweater fueled by a sexual rush that made him feel like a teenager in the back of a chevy rain slapped against the glass walls and the air was warm and moist fragrant with flowers with soil with the scent of her she was quaking against him quick hard trembles delicious little sounds were humming in her throat he wanted to gulp her down swallow her whole and worry about the fine points later he couldnt remember when hed last had this ferocious urge to mate plunging inside of him pilar let me he fought with the button of her slacks if he hadnt said her name she would have forgotten it forgotten everything and simply surrendered to the demands of her own body but the sound of it jolted her back and brought the first flutter of panic wait this is we cant she pushed against him even as her head fell back and her system shivered at the scrape of his teeth on her throat david no wait stop pilar he couldnt catch his breath find his balance i want you how many years had it been since shed heard those words how many years had it been since shed seen them in a mans eyes so many pilar thought that she couldnt trust herself to think or act rationally when she did david im not ready for this he still had his hands on her cupped at her waist just under her sweater where her skin was warm and still quivering couldve fooled me i wasnt expecting he had such strong hands she thought strong and hard at the palm so unlike please could you step back he stayed exactly where he was i wanted you the first minute i saw you the minute you opened the front door pleasure sprinted into her chased by panic and puzzlement im dont he spoke curtly dont say youre flattered of course i am youre very attractive and and she couldnt think straight when he was touching her please would you step back all right but it cost him you know what happened here doesnt happen every time with everyone i think we took each other by surprise she began and cautiously slid down from the bench pilar were not children no were not it flustered her to have to straighten her sweater to remember how it had felt to have his hands under it on her which is one of the points im fortyeight years old david and youre well youre not he hadnt thought anything in the situation would make him laugh but that did youre not going to use a handful of years as an excuse its not an excuse its a fact another is that weve only known each other for a short time eight weeks and two days and thats how long ive imagined getting my hands on you he trailed his fingers over her hair while she stared at him i didnt plan on jumping you in your greenhouse and tearing off your clothes in the middle of your peat pots but it worked for me at the time you want something more conventional ill pick you up at seven for dinner david my husbands been dead only a few weeks exhusband he said icily dont put him between us pilar i wont tolerate that nearly thirty years cant be dismissed overnight no matter what the circumstances he took her by the shoulders lifted her up to her toes before she realized just how angry he was tony avano stopped being your safety zone pilar deal with it and deal with me he kissed her again hard and long then let her go seven oclock he said and stalked out into the rain worthless son of a bitch was not going to complicate his life or pilars from the grave david determined his strides were long his shoulders hunched and the fury bubbled just under his skin he wasnt going to allow it there was going to be some straight talk with all the secrets and shadows shoved into the light very soon because he was scowling at his feet and sophia was looking down as she jogged through the rain they ran hard into each other on the path oops she managed and slapped a hand on the hat shed tossed on to protect her from the worst of the wet i thought youd gone home i had something to do first i just tried to seduce your mother in the greenhouse do you have a problem with that sophias hand fell to her side excuse me you heard me im attracted to your mother and i just acted on it i fully intend to act on it again as soon as possible is that a problem for you ah no quick spin no clever comeback even through the daze of shock she could recognize a furious and frustrated male no sorry processing well when youve finished send me a goddamn memo as he stormed off sophia could almost see steam rising off him torn between shock and concern she slapped a hand to the hat again and sprinted to the greenhouse when she burst in pilar was standing staring at her workbench pots were scattered tipped over and several seedlings were crushed beyond redemption it gave sophia a very good idea just what had gone on and where mama pilar jumped then quickly grabbed her gardening gloves yes slowly now sophia walked forward her mothers cheeks were flushed her hair mussed the way a womans hair was when a mans hands had run through it i just saw david pilar dropped the gloves from fingers that had gone numb hastily bent to retrieve them oh he said he tried to seduce you he what it wasnt panic now but fullblown horror that snapped into pilars throat and from the look of you he got a good start on it it was just a unnerved pilar snatched up her apron but couldnt quite remember how to put it on we had a disagreement and he was annoyed its really not worth talking about mama gently sophia took the gloves then the apron set them down do you have feelings for david really sophia what a question one youre not answering she thought lets try this are you attracted to him hes an attractive man agreed were not that is im not at wits end pilar braced her hands on the bench im too old for this dont be ridiculous youre a beautiful woman in the prime of her life why shouldnt you have a romance im not looking for romance sex then sophie mama sophia said in the same horrified tone then threw her arms around her mother i started out here afraid id hurt your feelings and that youd be upset instead i find you flushed and rumpled after what i assume was a delightful bit of manhandling by our new and very sexy coo its wonderful its not wonderful and its not going to happen again sophia i was married for nearly three decades i can hardly just pick myself up and jump into another mans arms at this point in my life dads gone mama sophia kept her arms tight around pilar but her voice softened its hard for me to accept that to live with how it happened and to adjust to being denied even the chance to say goodbye its hard even knowing he really didnt love me oh sophie he did no she drew back now not the way i wanted or needed or looked for you did always he wasnt there for me and he wasnt there for you it wasnt in him to be now you have a chance to enjoy someone wholl pay attention to you oh baby pilar reached out to stroke her daughters cheek i want that for you and id be so sad so angry if i thought youd push that chance away because of something that never really existed i love you i want you happy i know pilar kissed both of sophias cheeks i know it takes time to adjust and oh cara its not just your father and what happened to us what happened to him thats an issue its me i dont know how to be with someone else or if i want to be with anyone how will you know if you dont try sophia started to boost herself onto the bench than thought better of it under the circumstances you like him dont you well of course i do like she thought a woman didnt nearly roll naked in potting soil with a man she liked hes a very nice man she managed a good father and youre attracted to him hes got a terrific ass sophia if you tell me you havent noticed im going to have to break a commandment and call my mother a liar then theres that smile that fast grin he has kind eyes pilar murmured forgetting herself and making her daughter sigh yes he does are you going out with him pilar got busy tidying pots i dont know go explore a little see what it feels like and take one of the condoms in my nightstand oh for heavens sake on second thought dont take one sophia wrapped an arm around pilars waist and giggled take two chapter twelve contents prev next maddy eyed her father shrewdly as he knotted his tie it was his first date tie the gray with the navy blue stripes she knew hed said he and ms giambelli were just going out to dinner so she and theo would think it was a business kind of thing but the tie was a dead giveaway she had to think about how she felt about it but at the moment she was entertaining herself by pushing his parent buttons its a symbol of selfexpression its unsanitary its an ancient tradition its not a cutter family ancient tradition youre not getting your nose pierced madeline thats it she sighed and put on a good sulk actually she had no desire to get her nose pierced but she did want a third piercing in her left earlobe working down to it or over to it from the nose was good strategy the kind she thought her father would appreciate if he knew about it its my body not until youre eighteen its not until that happy day its mine go nag your brother i cant im not speaking to him she rolled onto her back on her fathers bed lifted her legs to the ceiling they were clad in her usual black but she was starting to get sort of tired of it can i get a tattoo instead oh sure well all go get one this weekend he turned how do i look maddy cocked her head considered better than average youre such a comfort to me maddy if i get an a on my science report can i get my nose pierced if theo gets an a on anything i might consider letting him get his nose pierced since both ends of the statement were equally farfetched she laughed come on dad gotta go he scooped her off the bed carting her from the room with his arm around her waist and her feet dangling off the floor the habit as old as she could remember never failed to bring a bubble of happiness to her chest if i cant do the nose could i just do another in my left ear for a little stud if youre bound and determined to put more holes in yourself ill think about it he paused by theos door knocked with his free hand get lost creep david looked down at maddy i assume he means you he pushed open the door to see his son stretched out on the bed the phone at his ear rather than sitting at his desk with his homework david felt twin pulls annoyance that the assignments were certainly not done and pleased relief that theo had already made new friends at school to interfere with his studies call you back theo muttered and hung up i was just taking a break yeah for the entire month maddy commented theres plenty of stuff you can nuke for dinner i left the number of the restaurant on the pad by the phone and youve got my cell number dont call unless you have to no fighting no naked strangers in the house no touching the alcoholic beverages finish your homework no phone or tv until its done and dont set fire to the house did i leave anything out no blood on the carpet maddy put in right if you have to bleed bleed on the tiles he kissed the top of maddys head then dropped her to her feet i should be home by midnight dad i need a car uhhuh and i need a villa in the south of france go figure lights out at eleven he added as he turned away ive got to have wheels theo called after him and swore under his breath as he heard his father walk down the stairs you might as well be dead out here without wheels he flopped back on the bed to brood up at the ceiling maddy just shook her head youre such a moron theo youre so ugly maddy youre never going to get a car if you nag him if i help you get a car you have to drive me to the mall twelve times without being mean about it how are you going to help me get a car you little geek but he was already considering she almost always got what she wanted she sauntered into the room made herself at home first the deal then we discuss tereza was not of the opinion that a parent stepped back at a certain point in a childs life and watched the proceedings in silence after all would a mother stand on shore and watch a child whatever her age bob helplessly in the sea without diving in motherhood didnt end when a child reached her majority in terezas opinion it never ended whether the child liked it or not the fact that pilar was a grown woman with a grown daughter of her own didnt stop tereza from going to her room and it certainly didnt stop her from speaking her mind as she watched pilar dress for her evening out her evening out with david cutter people will talk pilar fumbled with her earrings every stage of the basic act of dressing had taken on enormous proportions its only dinner with a man an attractive man whod made it perfectly clear he wanted to sleep with her dio people find fuel for gossip in a thought theyll run their engines for some time over you and david socializing together pilar picked up her pearls were pearls too formal too oldfashioned does that trouble you mama does it trouble you why should it i havent done anything to interest anyone with fingers that seemed to have grown outsized and clumsy she fought with the clasp youre giambelli tereza crossed the room took the strand from pilars hand and hooked the clasp that alone is enough do you think because you chose to make a home and raise a daughter youve done nothing of interest you made a home raised a daughter and ran an empire comparatively i fall very short that was made clear today youre being foolish am i mama she turned just over two months ago you tossed me into the business and its taken me no time at all to prove i have no talent for it i shouldnt have waited so long to do so if i hadnt tossed you in youd have proven nothing years ago i came here with specific goals in mind i would run giambelli and see it was the best in the world i would marry and raise children watch them grow happy and healthy automatically she began to rearrange the bottles and pots on pilars vanity one day i would pass what id helped build into their hands the many children i dreamed of werent to be im sorry for that but not that youre my child you may be sorry that your goals of marriage and children didnt come to be but are you sorry pilar that sophia is yours of course not you think im disappointed in you her eyes met pilars in the mirror and were level clear and i was i was disappointed that you allowed a man to rule your life that you allowed him to make you feel less than you were and because you did nothing to change it i loved him for a long time that may have been my mistake but you cant dictate to your own heart you think not tereza asked in any case nothing i said to you could sway you and in looking back my mistake was in making it too easy for you to stay adrift the way you did thats over now and youre too young not to make new goals i want you to take part in your heritage to be part of what was passed to me i insist on it even you cant make me a businesswoman then make yourself something else tereza said impatiently as she turned to face pilar directly stop thinking of yourself as a reflection of what a man saw in you and be i asked you if it bothered you that people will talk i wish youd said the hell with people let them talk its time you gave them something to talk about surprised pilar shook her head you sound like sophie then listen if you want david cutter even for the moment take a woman who sits and waits to be given usually ends up emptyhanded its only dinner pilar began then broke off as maria came to the door mr cutter is downstairs thank you maria tell him miss pilar will be right down tereza turned back to her daughter recognized even approved of the slight panic she saw in pilars eyes you had that same look on your face when you were sixteen and a young man waited for you in the parlor its good to see it again she leaned forward brushed her lips over pilars cheek enjoy your evening alone pilar took a moment to settle she wasnt sixteen and it was only dinner she reminded herself as she started out it would be simple it would be civilized and it would most probably be quite pleasant that was all nervous she opened her bag at the top of the stairs to make certain shed remembered everything she blinked in shock as she dipped her fingers in and closed them over two packs of trojans sophia she thought as she hastily shut the bag again for gods sake the laugh that tickled her throat was young and foolish when she let it come she felt ridiculously relieved she went downstairs to see what happened next it was a date there was no other word for it pilar admitted nothing else brought this rosy glow to an evening or put this giddiness in the belly it might have been decades since shed had a date but it was coming back to her loud and clear she might have forgotten what it was like to sit across a candlelit table from a man and talk just talk more to have that man listen to have attention paid to watch his lips curve at something she said but remembering it experiencing it again was like being offered a cool sip of water before youd realized how desperately thirsty youd become not that she intended to let anything come of it but well friendship every time she let herself think of what her own daughter had slipped into her purse pilars palms went damp but a friendship with an attractive interesting man would be lovely pilar how wonderful to see you pilar recognized the cloud of scent and the cheerful bite of the voice before she looked up susan she was already fixing on her social smile dont you look wonderful susan manley david cutter no dont get up dont get up susan glowingly blond and just out of recovery from her latest facelift fluttered a hand at david i was just on my way back to my table from powdering my nose and saw you here charlie and i are here with some outoftown clients of his dead bores too she said with a wink i was just saying to laura the other day how we should get together its been so long im glad to see you out and looking so well honey i know what a horrible time this has been for you such a shock to everyone yes pilar felt the quick sting of the prick and the slow deflate of the pleasure of the evening i appreciated your note i only wish i could have done more well we dont want to talk about sad things do we she gave pilars arm a little squeeze even as she sized up her dinner companion i hope your mothers well very thank you i have to get along cant leave poor charlie floundering with those two so nice to meet you mr cutter pilar im going to call you next week well have lunch ill count on it pilar replied then picked up her wine as susan glided off im sorry the valleys not much more than a small town in some ways its hard to go anywhere without running into people you know then why apologize for it its awkward she set down her wine again left her fingers on the stem to run up and down and as my mother predicted people will talk really he took her hand from the glass then lets give them something to talk about he brought her hand to his lips nibbled lightly on the knuckles i like susan david said as pilar stared at him she gave me the opening to do this what he wondered aloud do you suppose shell say to laura tomorrow when she calls her i can only imagine david there were thrills rocketing up her arm even when she slid her hand from his they shivered along the skin im not looking for anything thats funny neither was i until i saw you he leaned forward intimately lets do something sinful the blood rushed to her head what lets his voice dropped into a seductive whisper order dessert the breath that had clogged in her lungs came out in a laughing whoosh perfect and it was perfect the drive home in the night under chilly stars and a cold white moon music playing softly on the radio as they debated with some heat a book theyd both recently read later shed think how odd it was to have felt so relaxed and so stimulated all at once she nearly sighed as she saw the lights of the villa nearly home she thought shed started out the evening almost swallowed by her own nerves and was ending it with regret that it couldnt have lasted longer kids are still up david commented noting the guest house was lit up like a vegas casino ill have to kill them yes ive noticed what a terrifying and brutal father you are and how your children fear you he slanted her a look i wouldnt mind seeing the occasional tremble out of them i think its way too late for that youve gone and raised two happy welladjusted kids still working on it he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel theo got into some trouble back in new york shoplifting sneaking out of the apartment his grades never stellar plummeted im sorry david the teenage years can be hard on everyone harder still when youre a single parent i could tell you some hairraising stories about sophia at that age your son is a nice young man i imagine that sort of behavior was just normal acting out gave me the jolt i suppose i needed i was letting him run just a little too free because it was easier not enough hours in the day not enough energy left at the end of it it was harder on maddy than theo when their mother left so i compensated more with her than him second guesses she said i know all about them i was into third guesses with theo and maddy anyway thats one of the reasons i opted to buy the van and drive crosscountry instead of dumping us all in a plane it gave us some time nothing like a threethousandmile drive in an enclosed vehicle to cement a family unit if you live through it it was very brave of you you want to talk courage he drove easily up the lane to the villa ive been chief tastetester on this wine experiment maddys conducting its brutal she chuckled be sure to let us know if weve got a competitor in the making she started to reach for the door handle but his hand came to her shoulder stopped her ill come around lets finish the evening off right nerves rolled back just exactly what did he mean by that she wondered as he walked around the van was she supposed to ask him in so they could neck in the parlor surely not it was out of the question hed just walk her to the door they could say good night perhaps exchange a casual very casual kiss between friends she reminded herself and geared back up as he opened her door thanks it was a lovely dinner a lovely evening for me too he took her hand not surprised to find it chilled hed seen the wariness come back into her eyes when hed opened the door and didnt mind it not a bit he wasnt above getting an ego boost from knowing he unnerved a woman i want to see you again pilar oh well of course were not in company he said turning her toward him when they stood on the veranda not for business alone he drew her closer and for very personal reasons david but his mouth was on hers again gently this time persuasively not with that abrupt and shocking flash of heat that had rudely slapped all those sleeping urges awake but with a slow and simmering warmth that patiently unknotted every snag of tension inside her loosened her until her bones felt like wax melting when he drew back his hands were on her face fingers skimming over her cheekbones then down trailing lightly over her throat ill call you she nodded reached blindly behind her for the door good night david she stepped inside closed the door no matter how foolish she told herself she was she knew she floated all the way upstairs the caves always made sophia think of a smugglers paradise all those big echoing spaces filled with huge casks of aging wine shed always enjoyed spending time there and even when she was a child one of the winemakers would let her sit at a little table and sample a small glass from one of the casks shed learned very young to tell the difference through sight through scent through palate between a premium vintage and an ordinary one to understand the subtleties that lifted one wine over another if it had spoiled her for the ordinary what was the harm in that she looked for recognized and demanded quality because shed been taught to tolerate nothing less it wasnt wine she was thinking of now though the wines had been drawn from the aging vats and glasses were set out for sampling it was men she had on her mind shed made a study of them as well she liked to think she knew an inferior blend recognized one who was likely to leave a bitter aftertaste and one who would prove himself over time that was why she believed shed had no longterm no serious relationship with a man herself none of the ones shed sampled had the right flavor the proper bouquet as it were to convince her shed be content with only one variety though she was perfectly confident in her ability to make the right choices for herself and to be able to enjoy without consequences the tasting flights she wasnt so confident about her mothers skill in the same area its their third date in two weeks mmm ty held a glass of claret to an open fire to check its color he like his grandfather like la signora stuck firm with the old and traditional methods he rated it a two for both color and clarity and noted down the superior marks on his chart my mother and david to get his attention sophia punched him lightly on the arm what about them theyre going out again tonight third time in two weeks and thats my business because she heaved out a breath shes vulnerable i cant say i dont like him because i do and i didnt particularly want to i even encouraged her initially when he showed some interest in her but i thought it was just a little fling coming around sophia it may surprise you but im working here and i really dont want to talk about your mothers personal business he swirled the wine gently stuck his nose in the glass and inhaled his concentration was completely focused they havent had sex he winced visibly and lost the wines bouquet damn it sophie if theyd had sex by now i wouldnt have to worry that would mean it was just a nice little physical attraction instead of a thing i think its becoming a thing and how much do we know about david really other than from a professional standpoint hes divorced and we dont know why he might be a womanizer or an opportunist when you think about it he started after my mother right after my father tyler nosed the wine again noted down his numbers which sounds like youre saying your mother wouldnt appeal to him on her own i certainly am not insulted sophia snatched up a glass of merlot scowled through it into the light shes beautiful intelligent charming and everything a man could want in a woman but not what her father had wanted she remembered in disgust for herself she marked the sample down for cloudiness i wouldnt worry about it if shed talk to me but all shell say is she and david enjoy each others company gee you think oh shut up she nosed her wine noted down her opinion then sipping letting the wine rest inside her lower gum touched it with the tip of her tongue to register the sweetness first before moving it to the sides to the rear of her mouth to judge its acidity and tannic content she swished it around allowing the various taste elements to blend then spat it out its immature yet tyler tested it himself and found he agreed with her well let it age a bit a lot of things become what theyre meant to if you leave them alone awhile is that philosophy i hear you want an opinion or just somebody to agree with you i guess wanting both was expecting too much there you go he picked up the next glass held it to the light but he was looking at sophia it was hard not to he admitted not to look not to wonder here they were in a cool damp cave a fire snapping the smells of smoke and wood and earth surrounding them shadows dipping dancing some people would have said it was romantic he was doing his best not to be one of them just as hed been doing his best for some time not to think of her as a person much less as a woman she was he reminded himself a partner at best and one he could have done without and right now his partner was worried maybe he thought she was borrowing trouble or sticking her pretty nose where it didnt belong but if he knew absolutely one thing about sophia it was that she loved her mother unreservedly his exwife dumped him and the kids sophias gaze lifted from the wine she held met his dumped yeah decided there was a big old world out there and she was entitled to it couldnt explore it or herself with a couple of kids and a husband hanging on so she left how do you know this maddy talks to me and he felt guilty for repeating things hed been told the kid didnt say much about her home life but enough to give him a clear view she doesnt blab about it or anything just lets stuff drop now and again from what i gather the mother doesnt contact them often and cutters been running the show since she took off theo got in a little trouble and cutter took the position out here to get him out of the city so hes a good father she knew all too well what it was to be dumped by a parent that doesnt mean hes good for my mother thats for her to decide isnt it you look for flaws in every man you see and youre going to find them thats not what i do its exactly what you do i dont have to look very deep with you she offered in a sugary voice theyre all so obvious lucky for both of us which is a step up from your pattern you barely look at all easier to keep yourself wrapped up in the vines than risk getting wrapped up in a human being are we talking about my sex life i mustve missed a step you dont have one not compared to yours he set down the glass to make his notes then again who does you go through men like a knife through cheese a long slow slice a nibble discard youre making a mistake thinking you can set those standards for pilar i see hurt rippled through her hed made her sound cheap again like her father needing to punish him for it she moved closer i havent gone through you yet have i ty havent even managed the first cut is it because youre afraid to try on a woman whos able to think about sex the way a man does i dont want to try on a woman who thinks about anything the way a man does im narrowminded that way why dont you expand your horizons she tipped her face up invited dare you she teased im not interested still testing she wound her arms around his neck tightening them when he lifted his arms to pull them away which one of us is bluffing her eyes were dark fiery the scent of her slid around him into him she brushed her lips over his one seductive stroke why dont you sample me she asked softly it was a mistake but it wouldnt be his first he gripped her hips and ran his hands up her sides the scent of her was both ripe and elusive a deliberate and effective torment for a man look at me he ordered and took the mouth she offered took what and how he wanted long slow deep and he let the taste of her slide over his tongue as he would with a fine wine then slip almost lazily certainly pleasurably into his system his lips rubbed over hers turning her inside out somehow hed flipped it all around on her and the tempted had become the tempter knowing it she couldnt resist there was so much more here than shed imagined more than shed ever been offered or had accepted he watched her intensely even as he toyed with her mouth sent her head spinning and her body churning he watched her with all the patience of a cat that alone was a fresh and shocking thrill he ran his hands down her sides again those wide hands just brushing her breasts and drew her away you push my buttons sophia i dont like it he turned away to take a pull from the bottle of water used to cleanse the palate a vintners also a scientist the air felt thick as she drew in a breath youve heard of chemical reactions he turned held the bottle out to her yeah and a good vintner always takes his time because some chemical reactions leave nothing but a mess the little stab disappointed as much as it stung cant you just say you want me yeah i can say it i want you enough that it sometimes hurts to breathe when youre too close like now he thought when the taste of her was alive inside him but when i get you into bed youre going to look at me the way you looked at me just now its not going to be just another time just another man its going to be me and youre going to know it there was a ripple along her skin she had to force herself not to rub her hands over her arms to chase it away again why do you make that sound like a threat because it is moving away from her he picked up the next glass of wine and went back to work chapter thirteen contents prev next claremont studied the avano file he spent a great deal of what he could eke out as spare time studying the data the evidence the crime scene and medical examiner reports he could nearly recite the statements and interviews by rote after nearly eight weeks it was considered by most to be a dead end no viable suspects no tangible leads no easy answers it stuck in his craw he didnt believe in perfect crimes but in missed opportunities what was he missing alex maguire stopped by his desk sat on the corner she already wore her coat against the misery that was february in san francisco her youngest had a history project due the next day her husband was fighting off a cold and they were having leftover meat loaf for dinner nobody was going to be happy at her house but she needed to be there go home she told him theres always a loose end he complained yeah but youre not always able to tie it off avano stays open and it looks like its going to stay that way unless we get lucky and something falls in our laps i dont like luck yeah well i live for it he uses the daughters apartment for a meet claremont began and ignored his partners longsuffering sigh nobody sees him go in nobody hears the gunshots nobody sees anyone else go in or out because it was in the neighborhood of three in the morning the neighbors were asleep and used to city noises didnt hear the pop of a twentyfivecaliber pissant gun womans gun excuse me she patted her own policeissue ninemillimeter civilian womans gun he corrected with what was nearly a smile wine and cheese latenight meet in an empty apartment sneaking out on the wife apparently victims a guy who liked to cheat on the wife smells like a woman and maybe thats the angle maybe it was set to smell like a woman we looked at men too maybe we need to look again the exmrs avano as opposed to the widow avano has been seen socializing in the company of one david cutter that tells me her taste in men has improved she stays legally married to a philandering son of a bitch for nearly thirty years why look my husband doesnt run around and i love him like crazy but sometimes i wonder why i stay legally married to him shes catholic maguire finished with another sigh knowing she wasnt getting home anytime soon italian catholic and practicing divorce wouldnt come easy she gave him one when he asked she didnt stand in his way different thing yeah and as a divorced catholic she wouldnt be able to remarry would she or snuggle up with another man with the approval of the church so she kills him to clear the way reaching alex on the catholic sinometer murder edges out divorce or somebody does it for her cutters brought in to the company over avano got to cause some friction cutter likes the look of avanos estranged and soontobedivorced wife we ran cutter up down and sideways hes squeaky maybe or maybe he didnt have a good reason to get his hands dirty before look we found out avano was in financial trouble unless the widows an oscarcaliber actress id say that came as a big unpleasant surprise to her so going with the theory that avano was keeping his money problems to himself and wasnt the type to do without his beluga for long where would he go for a fix not one of his society friends claremont continued wouldnt be able to show his face at the next charity ball he goes to giambelli where hes been bailed out periodically for years to the exwife maybe and following your line if she agreed cutter got steamed over it if she didnt and avano got nasty cutter got steamed over it its a long way from steamed to putting three bullets in a man still she considered it was something to chew on and thered been precious little so far i guess were chatting with david cutter tomorrow david juggled the hours of his workday between the san francisco offices his home office the vineyards and the winery with two teenagers to raise and a demanding job he often put in fourteenhour days hed never been happier in his life with la coeur hed spent most of his time behind a desk had occasionally traveled to sit on the other side of someone elses desk hed worked in an area that interested him and had earned him respect and a good salary and hed been bored brainless the handson approach he was not only allowed but expected to use with giambellimacmillan made each day a little adventure he was dipping his fingers into areas of the wine business that had been only theory or paperwork before distribution bottling shipping marketing and above all the grape itself from vine to table and what vines to be able to see them stretching stretching wrapped in the fogs and mists of the valley the linear and the insubstantial that mingled light and shadow and when the frost shimmered on them at dawn or the cold moonlight drizzled down at midnight there was magic there when he walked through the rows breathing in the mystery of that damp air and the wispy arms of the vines surrounded him it was like living in a painting one he could and would mark with his own brush strokes there was a romance in that romance hed forgotten locked behind steel and glass in new york his home life still had bumps theo pushed and shoved against the rules on a daily basis it seemed to david the boy was grounded as often as not like father like son he often thought but it wasnt much of a comfort when he was in the middle of the combat zone he began to wonder why his own father faced with such a surly hardheaded argumentative offspring hadnt simply locked him in the attic until hed turned twentyone maddy wasnt any easier she appeared to have given up on the nose ring now she was campaigning to have her hair streaked it baffled him constantly how a sensible girl could forever be pining to do weird things to her body he had no idea how to get inside the mind of a fourteenyearold girl and wasnt entirely sure he wanted to but they were settling in they were making friends they were finding a rhythm he found it odd neither of them had commented on his relationship with pilar normally they teased him mercilessly about his dates he thought perhaps they assumed it was business which was just as well he caught himself daydreaming as he often did when his mind drifted to pilar he shook his head shifted in his chair this wasnt the time to indulge himself he had a meeting with department heads in twenty minutes and needed to review his notes because time was short he wasnt pleased to be interrupted by the police detectives what can i do for you a few minutes of your time claremont told him while maguire scanned the office and got the lay of the land a few minutes is exactly what i can spare have a seat big cushy leather seats maguire noted in a big cushy corner office with a kickass view of san francisco through the wide windows a thoroughbred of offices for a desk jockey and totally masculine with its biscuitandburgundy color scheme and glossy mahogany desk she wondered if the office was tailored to suit the man or vice versa i assume this has to do with anthony avano david began is there any progress in the investigation the case is still open mr cutter how would you describe your relationship with mr avano we didnt have one detective claremont david replied matteroffactly you were both executives for the same company both worked primarily out of this building very briefly id been with giambelli less than two weeks before avano was killed in a couple of weeks youd have formed an impression maguire put in had meetings discussed business youd think wouldnt you but id yet to have a meeting with him and we had only one discussion which took place at the party the evening before his murder it was the only time i met him facetoface and there really wasnt time to talk much business didnt mention his impression claremont noted but theyd get to that why hadnt you met with him scheduling conflicts the tone was bland yours or his david sat back he didnt care for the direction of the questioning or the implication his apparently several attempts to reach him proved unsuccessful in the time between my arrival and his death avano didnt come to the office at least not when i was here nor did he return my calls mustve annoyed you it did david nodded at maguire which i dealt with during our brief conversation at the winery i made it clear that i expected him to make time to meet with me during business hours obviously that never happened did you meet with him outside of business hours no detectives i didnt know the man had no real reason to like or dislike him or think about him particularly david kept his voice even edging toward dismissive as he would when winding up a tedious business meeting while i understand you have to explore every avenue in your investigation id think youre scraping bottom if youre looking at me as a murder suspect youre dating his exwife david felt the jolt in the belly but his face stayed passive as he leaned forward again slowly thats right his exwife who was already his ex when he was murdered already his ex when we began seeing each other socially i dont believe that crosses any legal or moral line our information is that the exmrs avano wasnt in the habit of seeing men socially until very recently that david said to maguire might be because she hadnt met a man she cared to see socially until very recently i find that flattering but not a reason to murder being dumped for a younger woman often is maguire said easily and watched cool eyes flare not just seeing her socially she concluded seriously hung up which is it david demanded pilar killed him because he wanted another woman or shes heartless because shes interested in another man so soon after her exhusband is murdered how do you bend that premise both ways furious maguire thought but controlled just the sort of makeup that could calmly sip wine and put bullets in a man were not accusing anyone she continued were just trying to get a clear picture let me help you out avano lived his own life his own way for twenty years pilar giambelli lived hers a great deal more admirably whatever business avano might have had that night was his own and nothing to do with her my socializing with ms giambelli at this point is completely our business you assume avano had business that night why i assume nothing david inclined his head toward claremont as he got to his feet i leave that to you i have a meeting claremont stayed where he was were you aware mr avano was having financial difficulties avanos finances werent my problem or my concern they would have been if they connected to giambelli werent you curious as to why mr avano was dodging you id been brought in from the outside some resentment was expected he resented you he may have we never got around to discussing it now whos dodging claremont got to his feet do you own a handgun mr cutter no i dont i have two teenage children there are no guns of any kind in my house and never have been on the night avano was murdered i was at home with my children they can verify that davids hands curled into fists theyd know if id left the house he wasnt having his kids interrogated by the police not over a worthless excuse of humanity like avano thats all were going to discuss until i consult an attorney thats your right maguire rose and played what she banked was her trump card thanks for your time mr cutter well question ms giambelli about her exhusbands finances id think his widow would know more maguire continued pilar giambelli was married to him a lot longer and part of the business for which he worked david slipped his hands into his pockets she knows less about the business than either of you and thinking of her david made his choice avano had been for the last three years systematically embezzling money from giambelli padded expense accounts inflated sales figures travel vouchers for trips not taken or taken but for personal reasons never a great deal at a time and he picked various pockets so that it went unnoticed in his position professionally and personally no one would have and no one did question his figures claremont nodded but you did i did i caught some of it the day of the party and in doublechecking it began to see the pattern it was clear to me hed been dipping for some time under his name under pilars and under his daughters he didnt trouble to forge their signatures on the vouchers just signed them to a total of just over six hundred thousand in the last three years and when you confronted him maguire prompted i never did i intended to and believe i made that intention clear during our conversation at the party my impression was he understood i knew something it was business detective and would have been handled through the business i reported the problem to tereza giambelli and eli macmillan the day after the party the conclusion was that i would handle it do what could be done to arrange for avano to pay the money back he would resign from the company if he refused any of the stipulations outlined the giambellis would take legal action why was this information withheld it was the wish of the senior ms giambelli that her granddaughter not be humiliated by her fathers behavior becoming public i was asked to say nothing unless directly asked by the police at this point la signora eli macmillan and myself are the only people who know avanos dead and it seemed unnecessary to add to the scandal by painting him as a thief as well as a philanderer mr cutter claremont said when its murder nothings unnecessary david had barely closed the door at the cops back and taken a breath to steady himself when it opened again sophia didnt knock didnt think to what did they want he had to adjust quickly and folded his concern and anger together tucked them away were both running late for the meeting he scooped up his notes slid them with the reports the graphs the memos into his briefcase david sophia simply stayed with her back to the door i couldve gone after the cops and tried to get answers i havent been able to get from them i hoped that youd be more understanding they had questions sophia followups i suppose you call them why you and not me or several other people in this building you barely knew my father had never worked with him or as far as im aware spent any time with him what could you tell the police about him or his murder that they havent already been told little to nothing im sorry sophia but well need to table this at least for now people are waiting david give me some credit they came directly to your office and stayed in here long enough for there to have been something word travels she finished i have a right to know he said nothing for a moment but studied her face yes she had a right to know he decided and he had no right to take that away from her he picked up his phone ms giambelli and i will be a few minutes late for the meeting he told his assistant he nodded to a chair as he hung up sit down ill stand you may have noticed im not delicate ive noticed you handle yourself the police had some questions that sprang at least in part from the fact that im seeing your mother i see do they have some theory that you and mama have been engaged in some long secret affair that could have been put to rest easily enough by the fact that until a couple of months ago you lived a country apart added to the fact that my father had been living openly with another woman for several years a few dinner dates is very small potatoes im sure theyre covering all angles do they suspect you or mama id say they suspect everyone its part of their job description youve been careful not to comment to me in any case on how you feel about my relationship with your mother i havent decided how i feel about it precisely when i do ill let you know fair enough he said equably i know how i feel about it so ill tell you i care very much about pilar i dont intend to cause her trouble or upset id be sorry to cause you any either first because she loves you and second because i like you but i was just in the position of choosing between causing you both some upset or having my kids interrogated and doing nothing to stop the investigation from wandering down a dead end she wanted to sit down now something told her shed need to because of it pride kept her on her feet what did you tell the police thats going to upset me truth he thought like medicine was better given in one fast dose your father had been embezzling from the company for several years the amounts were spread out and relatively moderate which is one reason they went undetected as long as they did the color drained out of her face but she didnt flinch didnt flinch even as the fist of betrayal slammed hard into her heart theres no mistake she began then waved him off before he could answer no of course there isnt you wouldnt make one there was a light lick of bitterness in the statement she couldnt stop it how long have you known i confirmed it the day of the party i intended to meet with your father within the next couple of days to discuss to fire him she corrected to ask for his resignation as per your grandparents instructions i reported the embezzlement to them the day after the party he would have been given the opportunity to pay back the funds and resign they did that for you for your mother too for the company but mostly for you im sorry she nodded turning away as she rubbed her hands over her arms yes of course i appreciate your being honest with me now sophia please dont she closed in as he stepped forward dont apologize again im not going to fall apart i already knew he was a thief i saw one of my mothers heirloom brooches on renes lapel it was to come to me so i know my mother didnt give it to him i knew when i saw her wearing it on her widows black that hed stolen it not that hed have thought of it that way any more than hed have thought of the money he siphoned from the company as stealing pilar hed think has so many trinkets she wouldnt mind the company hed tell himself can afford to lend me a bit more capital yes he was a champ at rationalizing his pathetic behavior if youd rather go home than attend the meeting i can make your excuses i have no intention of missing the meeting she turned back isnt it odd i knew what he did to mama all those years i saw it for myself but i managed to forgive him or to tell myself it was just what he was and make it if not all right somehow marginally acceptable now hes stolen money and jewelry so much less important than stealing a persons dignity and selfrespect as he did with my mother but it took this for me to face fully that he was worthless as a human being it took this for me to stop bleeding for him i wonder why that is well ill see you at the meeting take a few minutes no hes already had more of my time than he was entitled to yes he thought as she walked out of his office very much like her grandmother since it was sophias turn to drive tyler rode back from the city in silence unless he thought you counted the blast of the radio hed turned it down twice only to have her snap the volume back up again departmental meetings gave him a headache and so did the opera currently screaming out of the speakers but he decided to let it go it certainly prevented any pretext of conversation she didnt look to be in the mood for conversation he wasnt sure just what she looked in the mood for but it sure as hell wasnt talk she drove too fast but hed gotten used to that and even with whatever storm was brewing inside her she wasnt careless as she swung around the curves and slopes of the road still he nearly sighed when he spotted the rooftops of home he was about to get there in one piece where he could shrug out of his city clothes and fall into blessed silence and solitude even with her mouth so firmly shut he thought the woman just wore him out but when she stopped at the end of the drive she turned off the engine and was out of the car before he was whatre you doing coming in she called over her shoulder adding a brief glittering look to her words why because i dont feel like going home he jangled his keys in his hand its been a long day hasnt it just ive got things to do thats handy im looking for things to do be a pal macmillan buy me a drink resigned he jabbed his key in the lock buy your own drink you know where everything is gracious to the last thats what i like about you she strolled in and headed straight to the great room and the wine rack with you ty there are no pretenses no games you are what you are surly rude predictable she chose a bottle at random variety and vintage didnt matter at the moment while she uncorked it she looked around the room stone and wood hard materials expertly and cleanly worked into a dignified setting for big simple furnishings and plain colors no flowers she thought no soft edges no polish take this place for example no frills no fuss a manly man lives here it says who doesnt have time for appearances dont give a flying fuck about appearances do you ty not particularly thats so damn stalwart of you youre a stalwart individual she poured out two glasses some people live and die by appearances you know theyre what matter most me im more of a happymedium type you cant trust someone who has appearances as his religion and the ones who dont give that flying fuck you end up trusting too much if youre going to drink my wine and take up my space you might as well tell me whats put you in this mood and get it over with oh i have many moods she drank the wine too quickly for pleasure and poured a second glass for herself im a multifaceted woman tyler you havent seen the half of me she crossed to him slowly a kind of sexual gunfighters swagger would you like to see more no oh now dont disappoint me and lie no games no pretenses remember she trailed a fingertip up his shirt you really want to get your hands on me and conveniently i really want to be handled you want to get drunk and get laid sorry doesnt suit my plans for the evening he plucked the glass out of her hand whats the matter want me to buy you dinner first he set the glass down i think more of myself than that and surprise more of you fine ill just find someone who isnt so picky she took three strides toward the door when he grabbed her arm let go you had your chance im taking you home im not going home youre going where i take you i said let go she whirled she was prepared to scratch and claw and slap could already feel the release of it gush through her and was more surprised than he when she grabbed on hard and collapsed into tears shit okay he did the only thing that came to mind he picked her up carried her to a chair and sat with her on his lap get it all out and well both feel better while she wept the phone rang from somewhere under the sofa cushion where hed lost it the last time and the old mantel clock began to bong the hour she wasnt ashamed of tears they were after all just another form of passion but she preferred other methods of release when shed cried herself dry she stayed where she was curled warm against him and comforted more than shed imagined he didnt pat and stroke didnt rock or murmur all those foolish and reassuring words people tended to use to sop up tears he simply let her hold on and purge herself as a result she was more grateful than shed imagined as well sorry yeah that makes two of us the response made her relax she drew a long breath breathing in the scent of him holding it in as she held on to him then letting go if youd taken me up on the jungle sex i wouldnt have blubbered all over you well if id known my choices at the time she laughed and let her head rest on his shoulder just a moment before she climbed out of his lap were probably better off this way my father stole from the company before he could decide how to respond she took a step toward him you knew no but youre not surprised he got to his feet sincerely hoping this wasnt the start of another battle no im not surprised i see she looked away from him stared hard into the hearth where last nights fire had burned to ashes apt she thought she felt just like that cold and empty all right well she stiffened her spine wiped away the last traces of tears i pay my debts ill fix you dinner he started to protest then weighed the options of solitude against a hot meal the woman could cook he recalled you know where the kitchen is yes i do she stepped closer rose on her toes and kissed his cheek down payment she told him and shrugged out of her jacket as she left the room chapter fourteen contents prev next you didnt call me back margaret tracked tyler down in the macmillan winery shed had several satisfying and successful meetings since her return from venice her career was advancing well she was certain she looked her best after two carefully outlined shopping forays before her return to california she was developing the polish shed always believed international travel sheened on a woman there was one last goal she intended to achieve while she was stateside bagging tyler macmillan sorry ive been swamped february was a slow month in winemaking but that didnt mean there wasnt work sophia had scheduled a winetasting party that evening on his turf while he wasnt particularly pleased about it he understood the value and knew the importance of making certain everything was in place i can imagine i looked over the plans for the centennial campaign youve done a terrific job sophia has margaret wandered with him as he moved into the tasting room you dont give yourself enough credit ty when are you coming over to take a look at the operation in italy i think youd be impressed and pleased therere noises about it i dont have time now when you do ill show you the area buy you some pasta at this terrific little trattoria i found theyre serving our wine there now and im negotiating with some of the top hotels to spotlight our label this summer sounds like youve been busy too i love it theres still a little resistance with some of the accounts that were used to tony avano and his style of business but im bringing them around do the police have any more on what happened to him not that ive heard how soon tyler wondered would word of the embezzlement leak its terrible he was a very popular guy with the accounts and they loved him in italy theyre not as open to sitting around drinking grappa and smoking cigars with me he stopped smiled at her thats a picture i know how to play with the boys i have to head back end of the week make several stops here in the states on my way i was hoping we could get together ill fix you dinner what was with women offering to cook for him did he look hungry thats he broke off as he saw maddy come in the kid always lifted his spirits hey its the mad scientist secretly delighted maddy sneered at him ive got my secret formula she held up two peanut butter jars filled with dark liquid looks pretty scary ty took it tipped the one she held out to him side to side and watched it swish maybe you could try it at your tasting tonight see what people say hmmm he could only imagine the comments of the wine snobs after a sip of maddys kitchen wine and because he could he began to grin its a thought arent you going to introduce me to your friend it wasnt that margaret didnt like children mostly at a safe distance but she was trying to make some time here oh sorry margaret bowers maddy cutter oh you must be davids little girl your father and i had some meetings today no kidding resentment at being called a little girl simmered me too can i stay for some of the tasting she turned to ty ignoring margaret im going to do this whole report on the wine so i want to like observe and stuff sure he opened the jar nosed it amusement gleamed in his eyes id like to observe this one myself ty how about tomorrow night tomorrow dinner margaret kept her voice casual theres a lot regarding the italian operation id like to discuss with you im hoping you can educate me a bit pump up my weak areas there are some aspects im cloudy on and i think talking to an expert vintner who has english as his primary language would really help sure he was much more interested in maddys wine at the moment and moved behind the bar to get a glass seven ive got a lovely merlot i brought back with me great the liquid ty poured into the glass would never be a lovely anything see you then nice to have met you maddy okay she gave a quick snort when margaret went out youre such a dork excuse me she was hitting on you and youre like oblivious she wasnt hitting on me and youre not supposed to talk that way was too maddy slid onto a stool at the bar women know these things maybe but you dont qualify as a woman ive had my period hed started to drink had to set the glass back down as he winced please its a biological function and when a female is physically able to conceive she is physically a woman fine great it wasnt a debate he wanted to enter into shut up he let the wine such as it was lie on his tongue it was unsophisticated to say the least highly acidic and oversweet thanks to the sugar she must have added still shed succeeded in making wine in a kitchen bowl bad wine but that wasnt the point did you drink any of this maybe she set the second jar on the counter heres the miracle wine no additives i read about how sometimes they add ox blood for color and body i didnt know where to get any besides it sounds disgusting we dont approve of that kind of practice a little calcium carbonate would deacidify it some but well just let it stand on its own altogether its not a complete failure as a jug wine you pulled it off kid nice going a brave man he poured a swallow of the miracle wine examined nosed sipped interesting cloudy immature and biting but its wine will you read my report and check my charts when im done sure good she fluttered her lashes ill fix you dinner god she tickled him smartass at last david said as he came in someone who agrees with me he walked over hooked an arm around his daughters neck five minutes remember we got distracted ty said i could come to the tasting maddy please hes going to put my wine in david glanced over youre a brave man macmillan you never spent an evening chugging any run walk and fall down with a grin david covered maddys ears once or twice and fortunately i lived to regret it your wine club might object to the addition yeah the thought of that tickled ty too itll broaden their outlook or poison them please dad its for science thats what you said about the rotten eggs you kept in your bedroom we didnt really leave new york for professional reasons he said to ty the new tenants are probably still fumigating okay but you turn into a pumpkin at ten lets go theos in the van hes driving us back well all die maddy said solemnly scram ill be right out he plucked her off the stool gave her a light whack on the butt to send her along i just wanted to say i appreciate your letting her hang around she doesnt get in the way sure she does tyler set the glasses in the sink under the bar okay she does but i dont mind if i thought you did idve herded her off i also realize youre more comfortable with her than you are with me i get in your way and you do mind i dont need a supervisor no you dont but the company needed and needs fresh blood an outsider someone who can look at the big picture from all angles and suggest a different way when its viable you got suggestions for me cutter the first might be taking the chip from your shoulder and the stick from your ass then we can build a campfire with them and have a couple of beers tyler said nothing for a moment as he tried to judge if he was amused or annoyed add yours and we could have a hell of a blaze theres an idea ill bring maddy back around later ill come back at ten to pick her up i can drop her home save you a trip appreciate it david headed toward the door paused listen would you let me know if she gets if she starts to get a crush on you its probably normal but id like to head it off if it veers that way its not like that i think im more big brother maybe uncle material but your boys got a champion crush on sophie david stared blinked then rubbed his hands over his face missed that one i thought it came and went the first week hell she can handle it nothing she does better than handle the male of the species she wont bruise him he manages to bruise himself he thought of pilar and winced hard to fault his taste huh under the circumstances david shot back a bland look another smartass he muttered and walked out pilar chose a simple cocktail suit thinking the sage green with satin lapels was midway between professional and celebratory perfect she hoped for hosting the wine tasting shed taken on the role to prove herself to her family to david and even to herself shed spent a week assisting with tours being trained delicately she thought now staff members treated family members with kid gloves it had jarred her to realize just how little she knew about the winery about the vineyards about the process and about the public areas and retail venue it would take more than a week and some subtle education to learn how to handle any of those areas on her own but by god she could handle a group at a wine tasting and was determined to prove it she was going to learn how to handle a great many things including her own life part of that life included sex so good for her and on that thought she lowered to the edge of her bed the idea of moving toward an intimate relationship with david terrified her the fact that it did irritated her and terrified and irritated she had made herself she admitted a nervous wreck the knock on her door had her springing to her feet again grabbing her brush and fixing what she hoped was a confident and casual expression on her face yes come in she sighed hugely and gave up the pretense when she saw helen thank god its you im so tired of pretending to be a twentyfirstcentury woman you look like one fabulous dress under it im quaking im glad you and james are here for the tasting we dragged linc along his current honey is working tonight still the intern yeah helen sat on the curvy velvet chaise made herself at home im starting to think hes getting serious about her and i dont know shes a nice girl raised well focused which he could use and independent which i appreciate but hes your baby but hes my baby helen agreed i miss the little boy sometimes with the scabbed knees and loose shoelaces still see him in that tall gorgeous lawyer in the threepiece suit that strolls in and out of my life now and jesus she said with a sigh im old hows your baby holding up pilar set down her brush you already know about what tony did your mother thought it best that i know so that i can cover any legalities that might come up im sorry pilar so am i it was so unnecessary she turned and so like him thats what youre thinking it doesnt matter what i think unless i see you start blaming yourself no not this time and i hope never again but its rough very rough on sophia shell get through it our babies turned into strong capable adults while we werent looking pilar i know when did we blink and still we cant help worrying about them can we the job never ends sophia was just heading over to macmillans as we came in drafted linc to go with her in case there was any heavy lifting involved in the setup hell keep her mind occupied its always good to see them together almost like brother and sister mmm now sit down helen patted the chaise catch your breath and tell me all about your romance with david cutter with nearly thirty years of marriage under my belt i have to live vicariously its not really were enjoying each others company no sex yet huh helen giving up pilar dropped onto the chaise how can i have sex with him if youve forgotten how it works there are a number of very good books on the subject videos internet sites behind her lenses her eyes danced ill give you a list im serious me too some very hot stuff in there stop it but she laughed davids been very patient but im not stupid he wants sex and hes not going to keep settling for necking on the porch or necking come on pilar details all the details lets just say he has a very creative mouth and when he uses it i remember what its like to be twenty oh helen fanned a hand in front of her face yes but im not twenty and my body sure as hell isnt twenty how can i possibly let him see me naked helen my breasts are heading to mexico honey mine landed in argentina three years ago james doesnt seem to mind but thats the point youve been together for nearly thirty years youve gone through the changes together worse davids younger than i am worse i can think of a lot worse than that try to be on my side here hes a fortythreeyearold man im a fortyeightyearold woman theres a huge difference there a man his age most usually dates younger women often much younger women with tight bodies that dont sag often paired with empty heads that dont think helen finished pilar the fact is hes dating you and if youre so selfconscious about your body though that irritates me when i think of whats become of mine in comparison make sure its dark the first time you jump him youre a big help yes i am because if hes put off by breasts that arent twentytwo years old and perky then hes not worm your time better to find out than to speculate and project do you want to sleep with him just yes or no helen added before pilar could respond gut instinct primal urge no qualifiers yes then buy yourself some incredible underwear and go for it pilar bit her lip i already bought the underwear hot damn lets see nearly twentyfour hours after the tasting and tyler could still form a picture in his mind that made him laugh two dozen snooty slickfaced club members had gotten the shock of their narrow lives with a sample of what he was calling vin de madeline unsophisticated he said cracking himself up again but nubile jesus where do they get that stuff nubile try to contain your hilarity sophia sat behind the desk in her office in the villa and continued to study the models kris had chosen for the ads and id appreciate it if youd warn me the next time you decide to add a mystery vintage to the selection lastminute candidate and it was in the name of science the tastings are in the name of tradition reputation and promotion she glanced up briefly gave up when he just grinned at her okay it was funny and well be able to turn it into an interesting lighthearted article for the newsletter maybe even get a little humaninterest and anecdotal press out of it does your blood run on publicity you betcha which is fortunate for all involved as some members wouldve been very offended if i hadnt been there to spin it some members are pompous tightassed idiots yes and those pompous tightassed idiots buy a great deal of our wine and talk it up at social events as the winemaker is as unsophisticated and nubile as her wine we can play it to our advantage she made another note weighed it down with the silly green glass frog ty had given her for christmas next time you want to experiment give me some warning he stretched out his legs loosen up giambelli that from the king of the party animals she picked up an eightbyten glossy held it out to him what do you think of her he took the picture studied the sloeeyed blonde does this come with her phone number thats what i thought shes too sexy i told kris i wanted wholesome sophia scowled into middle distance i have to fire her shes not even trying to adjust to the changes worse shes ignoring direct orders giving the rest of the team grief she sighed my spies tell me she had a meeting with jerry demorney from la coeur just the other day if shes causing trouble why are you worried about axing her dont give me the line about not being able to replace her during the campaign or the reorganization all right i hesitate because shes good and i hate to lose her and she has intimate knowledge of the campaign of my longrange plans and could very well lure some other members of the staff away with her i hesitate on a personal level because i think she was involved with my father and firing her might push her to make that public whatever i do its going to cause trouble but it cant be put off any longer ill take care of it tomorrow i could do it sophia closed the file folder thats actually very nice of you but it should come from me i should warn you that cutting her loose is going to mean more work for the rest of us especially since my mother isnt going to be doing or trying to do any of the grunt work that sure cheers me up i was thinking about asking theo if he wanted a parttime job we could use a gofer a couple afternoons a week great then he can hang around here mooning over you on a regular basis the more hes around me the quicker hell get over it daily contactll take the edge off his hormones you think ty murmured why tyler was that a twisted sort of compliment or just your cranky way of saying i make you edgy neither he studied the glossy again i go for sleepyeyed blondes with full pouty lips peroxide and collagen so god i love men she got up from the desk walked to him cupped his face in her hands and gave him a smacking kiss on the mouth youre just so cute one hard tug on her hand had her tumbling into his lap an instant later her quick laugh was cut off and her heart pounding he hadnt kissed her this way before with impatience and heat and hunger all mixed together in a near brutal assault he hadnt kissed her as if he couldnt get enough would never get enough her body quivered once in surprise in defense in response then her fingers raked through his hair fisted there more she thought she wanted more of this edge this recklessness even the reluctant need when he would have drawn away she went with him sliding up against the hard lines of him even as he broke the kiss she scraped her bottom lip with her teeth slowly deliberately and watched his gaze lower to follow the movement what was that for i felt like it good enough do it again he hadnt meant to do it the first time but now his appetite for her was stirred and not quite sated why the hell not her lips curved as he took them not quite as desperate now not quite as rough he could imagine too well what it would be like to slide into her into all that soft heat but he wasnt sure how a man could get free again or walk away whole even as he thought it he was flipping open the buttons of her shirt even as he thought it she was pulling him to the floor hurry breathless she arched when his hands closed over her fast he could imagine it fast and hard and furious a mindless coupling all heat and no light it was what she wanted what they both wanted he dragged her up clamped his mouth over hers again his belly tightened desire and anticipation as she tugged at his belt the office door swung open ty i need to eli stopped in midstride as he stared at his grandson at the girl he thought of as his granddaughter tangled together on the floor color flooded his cheeks as he stumbled back excuse me when the door slammed tyler was already rocking back on his heels mind swimming body churning he rubbed his hands over his face oh perfect just perfect oops at sophias response tyler spread his fingers and stared at her through them oops my brains a little impaired its the best i can do oh god she sat up pulled her shirt together not your typical family moment giving up she dropped her head to her knees jesus how do we handle this i dont know i guess i have to talk to him she lifted her head slightly i could do it you fire unsatisfactory staff members i talk to shocked grandfathers fair enough she lowered her knees stared down as she buttoned her shirt again ty im really sorry id never do anything to upset eli or to cause trouble between the two of you i know he pushed to his feet and after a brief hesitation held out his hand to help her up i want to make love with you his already jangled system suffered i think what we both wants pretty clear i just dont know what were going to do about it i have to go after him yes when he hurried out she walked to the windows crossed her arms and very much wished she had something equally vital and specific to do all that was left for her was to think tyler found his grandfather walking toward the vineyards sally faithfully at his heels he didnt speak hadnt worked out what he would say once he did he merely fell into step beside eli and began to walk through the rows going to have to keep a frost watch eli commented warm snaps teased the vines yeah im on it ah its nearly disking time hope the rain doesnt slow that down like his grandson eli studied the canes and racked his brain for the right words i shouldve knocked no i shouldnt have stalling ty leaned down ruffled sallys fur it just happened well eli cleared his throat he didnt have to talk to tyler about the ways and means of sex thank christ hed done that deed years before his grandson was a grown man who knew about the birds and bees and about responsibility but holy hell ty you and sophie it just happened he said again i guess it shouldnt have and i guess i should tell you it wont happen again not my business its just the two of you hell ty you were almost raised together i know youve got no blood tie and theres nothing stopping either of you from such a thing just a shock is all all around tyler agreed eli walked a little farther do you love her inside his gut tyler felt the slippery knots of guilt tighten grandpa its not always about love now eli stopped turned and faced tyler my equipment may be older than yours boy but it works the same way i know its not always about love i was just asking weve got this heat going on thats all if its all the same to you id rather not go into that end of things oh its all the same to me youre both adults and you got two working brains between you both of you were raised right so what you do is your own business next time though lock the damn door first it was nearly six when tyler got home he was worn out worked up and irritated with himself he thought a cold beer and a hot shower might help smooth him back out reaching for the refrigerator handle he saw the note hed stuck there the night before as a reminder dinner at ms shit he lowered his forehead to the appliance he could just make it he supposed if he busted his ass but he just didnt have it in him he wasnt in any mood to discuss business even if it included a decent meal and good company hed never make good company himself that night he reached for the phone only to find hed misplaced it again swearing he yanked open the fridge intending to pop the top on the beer before starting to search and there was the phone tucked between a bottle of corona and a carton of milk hed make it up to margaret he thought as he looked up her phone number take her out to dinner or lunch whatever before she left the city she didnt hear the phone ring her head was under the shower and she was singing shed looked forward to the evening all day shuffling meetings writing reports making calls and finally stopping on the way home for a mansized steak and a couple of enormous idaho potatoes shed bought an apple pie at the bakery and fully intended to pass it off as her own a man didnt have to know everything it was she knew just the sort of meal ty would appreciate shed already set the table arranged candles chosen music had the outfit shed selected lying on her bed and the bed itself was plumped with pillows and made with fresh sheets theyd had two or three dates before not that she fooled herself into believing ty had thought of them as dates but she hoped to change that after tonight she stepped out of the shower and began to prepare herself it was always exciting to groom yourself for a man part of the anticipation margarets feminist beliefs didnt deny her the pleasure of that sort of ritual but helped her celebrate the female rite of it she creamed scented slid into silk and imagined seducing tyler macmillan over apple pie shed always had a yen for him she supposed as she checked the apartment to see that everything was in place the promotion the travel the excitement of her new responsibilities had in a very real way she decided given her the confidence to make him fully aware of that yen she took out the wine shed earmarked for the evening and noticed the message light blinking on her kitchen machine margaret its ty listen im going to have to take a rain check on dinner i should have called sooner but something came up at the office sorry ill call you tomorrow if you dont have plans ill take you out and we can go over business really sorry i didnt get back to you sooner she stared at the machine imagined herself ripping it out of the wall and heaving it of course that wouldnt change anything and she was too practical a woman to indulge in useless tantrums too practical she thought struggling against tears of disappointment to let food and wine go to waste because some idiot inconsiderate man stood her up the hell with him there were plenty more where he came from plenty she reminded herself as she yanked her broiler open and prepared to cook the steak shed had a number of interesting offers in italy when she got back she might just take one of them and see where it led but for now she was opening the goddamn wine and getting good and drunk chapter fifteen contents prev next pilar approached the guest house by the back door it was a friendly habit she felt she had become friends with theo he was an interesting and interested young man once you chipped through the surface a boy she thought who needed the softening influence of a mother she was touched that he seemed to enjoy rather than resent her company when he came by the villa to use the pool shed managed to lure him up to the music room and have him play or at least play around with the piano it had been an easy step from there to open up a dialogue and a debate over music she hoped he was as entertained by them as she was maddy was a different matter the girl was polite but consistently cool and watched pilar thought everything and everyone it wasnt resentment so much as a measuring a measuring pilar knew that was directly connected to her relationship with maddys father that aspect appeared to have gone straight over theos head but pilar recognized the femaletofemale judgment in maddys eyes so far she hadnt come up to snuff pilar wondered if david was as unaware as his son that maddy was guarding her territory she hitched her shoulder bag as she started up the back walk the contents werent bribes she assured herself just tokens and she wouldnt stay any longer than was comfortable for all of them though part of her hoped theyd want her to stay awhile fix them lunch listen to their chatter she so missed having someone to mother if fate had dealt her another hand shed have had a houseful of children a big messy dog ripped seams to sew spats to referee instead shed produced one bright and beautiful daughter whod needed so little tending and at fortyeight was reduced to nurturing flowers instead of the children shed longed for and selfpity pilar reminded herself was unattractive she knocked briskly on the kitchen door and had her smile ready it wobbled a bit when david answered he wore a work shirt and jeans and held a cup of coffee now this is handy he took her hand to draw her inside i was just thinking about you i didnt expect you to be home working out of here today because he wanted to and because he knew it would fluster her he kept her hand firm in his as he leaned down to kiss her oh well when i didnt see the van theo and maddy ganged up on me professional day no school every parents nightmare we solved it by letting them nag me into giving theo the keys and driving off to the mall and the movies for the day which is why your visits perfectly timed really she tugged her hand free fiddled with the strap of her bag it is keeps me from sitting here imagining all the trouble they could get into want some coffee no i really should i just stopped by to drop off a couple of things for the kids it flustered her to be in the house alone with him in all the time hed been there shed managed to avoid that single event maddys so interested in the whole winemaking process i thought shed like to read about the history of giambelli california pilar tugged the book shed picked up at the winery gift shop out of the bag right up her alley shell appreciate it and pound ty and me with brandnew questions she has an active mind tell me about it i brought this sheet music along for theo hes so into the technorock business but i thought he might get a kick out of trying some of the classics sergeant pepper david studied the sheet whered you dig this up i used to play it and drive my mother crazy it was my job did you wear love beads and bellbottoms he teased naturally i made a terrific pair out of paisley when i was maddys age made so many hidden talents he maneuvered her it was simply a matter of shifting closer until her back was to the kitchen counter you didnt bring me a present i didnt know youd be here and now that i am he edged closer laying his palms on the counter on either side of her got anything in your bag for me sorry she tried to laugh to keep it light but it was hard when she was strangling next time i really should get back to the winery im helping with a tour this afternoon what time fourthirty mmm he glanced at the kitchen clock an hour and a half i wonder what we could do with ninety minutes i could fix you lunch ive got a better idea and with his hands at her waist he circled her slowly toward the inside door david nobody home but you and me he said nibbling at her jaw her throat her mouth as he guided her out of the kitchen you know what i was thinking the other day no how could she she didnt know what she was thinking right now that its a complex business my girlfriend lives with her mother she did laugh now at the idea of being called anyones girlfriend and i live with my kids no place to go to do all the things ive imagined doing with you do you know the things ive imagined doing with you im getting the picture david its the middle of the day the middle of the day he paused at the base of the steps and an opportunity i hate wasted opportunities dont you she was walking up the steps with him which seemed a miraculous feat to her since her knees were knocking and her heart laboring as if shed already scaled a mountain i wasnt expecting her words kept becoming muffled against his mouth im not prepared sweetheart ill take care of that take care of it how could he arrange for her to be wearing sexy underwear or turn the merciless daylight into the soft flattering shadows of night how could he then it struck her that he meant protection and made her feel giddy and foolish no i didnt mean david im not young neither am i he eased back slightly at his bedroom door sweeping her inside wasnt the right way she needed words and maybe he realized so did he pilar i have a lot of complicated feelings for you one that isnt complicated for me is that its you i want all there is of you nerves were swimming now in a stream of heat david you need to know tony was my first and he was my last its been a very long time and im god im so out of practice knowing there hasnt been anyone else flatters me pilar he brushed his lips over hers it humbles me and again it excites me his mouth came back to hers a third time in a kiss that trembled on the edge between seduction and demand come to my bed he guided her toward it fascinated by the way their hearts hammered together let me touch you touch me i cant get my breath she struggled to gulp in air as he slipped her jacket off i know im tense im sorry i cant seem to relax i dont want you relaxed he kept his eyes on hers as he unbuttoned her blouse while his fingers whispered along exposed flesh not this time put your hands on my shoulders pilar step out of your shoes she was trembling and so was he like the first time he thought for her for him and just as terrifying and tremendous the late winter sun was a white wash of light through the windows in the silence of the house he could hear every catch of her breath when he skimmed his fingers lightly over her she was all soft skin and quivers smooth warm beautiful he was making her believe his words and if her fingers shook as she unbuttoned his shirt he didnt seem to mind if she jerked stupidly when his knuckles brushed her midriff when he unhooked her trousers he didnt sneer impatiently and best of all he didnt stop his hands stroked her slow and firm it made her want to weep to be touched again to feel again that gathering of heat in the belly the long liquid pulls that followed it it seemed natural to lie back on the bed to have his body the hard weight of it press down on hers it seemed natural and glorious to finally give herself again she forgot about the sunlight and all the flaws it would reveal and she reveled in the sensation of taking a mate he didnt want to rush but her hesitation had become eagerness she moved under him hips arching hands touching with quick little bites and scrapes of her nails that aroused him beyond belief he forgot about patience and all the doubts he wanted to assuage and feasted their fingers linked as they rolled over the bed then broke apart to find new secrets to explore his mouth closed over her breast thrilling both of them as the wave of pleasure swamped her she crooned out his name then moaned when his teeth tugged at her the whip of power slashed through her locked her on that glorious edge between excitement and release where the blood rages and the body yearns she shuddered there helplessly and let the glory of every ache every burn batter her when his hand stroked down to find her she was already hot already wet she exploded under him too stunned to be embarrassed by the quicktrigger response too shocked to resist the wild plunging of her own body her world went bright blindingly and she surrendered herself to the sudden urgency of his hands and mouth mine the soft damp skin that smelled of spring the subtle curves the eager and open response he wanted to take all that was his now to give all that he had she moved with him as if theyd come together just this way a thousand times reached for him as if her arms had always held him warm and close there was more so much more he wanted to show her to take from her in this first exploration but the need pumped madly through both of them and pounded at control she watched him as he ranged himself over her again once more her arms lifted opened and holding she took him in arched to him in welcome closed around him in acceptance they moved together in the sunlight a pace that quickened a need that pulsed then plunged she cried out muffling the sound against the side of his throat tasted him there as her heart took the final leap the sun was shining in san francisco too but it only added dimension to sophias headache she faced kris across her desk the worst of it was in sophias opinion the woman hadnt seen the termination coming how she could have missed it with all the warnings and directives only added fuel to the fire that had brought them to this point you dont want to be here kris youve made that clear ive done better work in this office than anyone else in the company you know it i know it and you dont like it on the contrary ive always respected your work thats bullshit sophia took a steadying breath ordered herself to remain calm to stay professional you have a great deal of talent which i admire what i dont admire and what can no longer be tolerated or overlooked is your deliberate rejection of company policy and your attitude toward authority you mean my attitude toward you heres a bulletin for you i am authority because your names giambelli whether or not thats the case isnt the issue or any of your concern if tony was still alive you wouldnt be sitting behind that desk i would sophia swallowed the bitterness that rose in her throat is that how he got you into bed she said with a twist of amusement in her tone promising you my job that was clever of him foolish of you my father didnt run this company and had no weight here you saw to that all three giambelli women no he saw to it but thats beside the point the fact is im head of this department and you no longer work for me youll be given the standard termination package including the full two weeks salary i want your office cleared of your personal property by the end of business today they both got to their feet sophia had the impression that without the desk between them kris would have taken more than a verbal shot it only showed how far their relationship had deteriorated that sophia was sorry they couldnt go a couple of rounds thats fine i have other offers everyone in the business knows whos the real power here the creative power i hope you get just what you deserve at la coeur sophia replied and watched kriss jaw drop in surprise there are no secrets but ill warn you to remember the confidentiality clause you signed when you joined this firm if you pass information about giambelli to a competitor you open yourself up for a lawsuit i dont need to pass anything on your upcoming campaigns illconceived and trite its an embarrassment isnt it lucky then that you wont have to be associated with it anymore sophia came around the desk now passing close to kris almost hoping shed strike out when sophia reached the door she opened it i think weve said all we have to say to each other this departments going to sink because when i go others will go with me lets see how far you and the farmer go on your own kris sauntered toward the door paused for one smirk tony and i had a good laugh over the two of you im shocked you took the time for humor or conversation he respected me kris shot back he knew who really ran this department we had some interesting conversations about you bitch number three sophias hand clamped down on kriss arm so it was you petty vandalism anonymous letters youre lucky i dont have you arrested as well as fired call a cop then try to prove it thatll give me one last laugh she yanked her arm free strolled away leaving her door open sophia went straight back to her desk and called security she wanted kris escorted from the building now that the first slap of temper had passed she wasnt surprised that it had been kris whod defaced the heirlooms and sent the photograph but it disgusted nothing she could do about it just as she couldnt do anything about files kris might have already copied and taken out but she could make certain there wasnt a lastminute foray far from satisfied she sent for both pj and trace while she waited she paced while she paced tyler walked in i saw kris steam down the hall he commented and dropped comfortably into a chair she called me a braindead pussywhipped farmer i assume youre the pussy with the whip shows what she knows your brains alive and well and so far youve been pretty damn resistant to the whip god im so pissed i figured it didnt go so well when i saw the tongues of fire shooting out of her ears i kept hoping shed take a punch at me so i could flatten her id feel a lot better right now if she had she called me bitch number three id like to show her what a genuine italian bitch can do when pushed smearing nail polish on our angels sending me anonymous mail whoa back up what mail nothing she waved a hand in the air kept pacing he snagged her hand tugged it down what mail just a photo from a few months back my mother grandmother and me she used a red pen this time but the sentiment was the same as on the giambelli angels why didnt you tell me because the envelope was addressed to me because it pissed me off and because i wasnt giving the person who sent it the satisfaction of discussing it you get another i want to know about it clear fine great youre first in line too angry to stay put she pulled away she said my father was going to help her land my job i imagine he promised her that had no qualms about promising her what was mine any more than he had qualms about taking my mothers jewelry for rene and it stung he thought watching her face even now avano managed to prick through the shell of defense and nick her heart im sorry youre thinking they deserved each other so am i gotta calm down gotta calm down she repeated like a mantra its over and done and stewing over it wont help we have to go forward i have to talk to pj and trace to start and i have to be calm i have to be composed you want me to take off no this would be better as a team she dragged her top drawer open rooted out her aspirin i should have fired her weeks ago you were right about that i was wrong i need to write this down can i borrow a pencil shut up grateful that his easy calm steadied her she heaved a breath then twisted open a bottle of water tell me straight out ty what you think of the centennial campaign how many times do i have to tell you this isnt my area as a consumer damn it she tossed three extrastrength tylenol back and took a long pull from the water bottle you have a goddamn opinion on everything else in the world dont you thats calm and composed he commented i think its smart what else do you want thats enough drained she sat on the corner of her desk she got to me i hate knowing that she glanced at her watch i need to get this dealt with then we have a meeting with margaret the little tug of guilt had him shifting in his chair i was supposed to meet with her myself last night had to postpone i havent been able to get in touch with her today she should be up on six oh well hell mind if i use your phone sophia gestured and stepped out to ask her assistant to get some coffee shes not there ty said when sophia came back in missed two morning meetings thats not like margaret lets try her at home again she began then switched gears as pj and trace came to her door come on in sit she gestured then quietly closed the door i need you to know she said as she crossed back to her desk that ive had to let kris go pj and trace exchanged quick sidelong looks which i see comes as no surprise to either of you when there was no response sophia decided to lay her cards on the table im going to say i hope both of you know how much i value you hope you know how important you are to this department and to the company and to me personally i understand there may be some continued dissatisfaction over the changes made late last year and if either of you has specific problems or comments im open to discussion how about a question trace said questions then whos taking over for kris no one you dont intend to bring in someone to fill her position id prefer if the two of you share her work her title and her authority dibs on her office pj announced damn it trace hissed out a breath okay lets backtrack sophia moved to the door opening it at her assistants knock so the coffee could be passed around not only not surprised by the recent turn of events but unless i miss my mark not particularly upset or disappointed its rude to speak of the recently terminated pj studied her coffee then gazed at sophia but youre not in the office every day never have been because thats not how you work you do a lot of the travel the outside meetings and since december you work at home at least three days a week were here and what peej is trying to say without risking a trip to hell for bitchiness is that kris is hard to work with harder to work for trace added which is how she saw things when you werent around she figured she was in charge and we along with everybody else in the department were her minions i was getting pretty sick of being a minion ive been looking around for another job you could have talked to me damn it trace i was going to before i made any decision now well problem solved except i think pj and i should flip for kriss office i called dibs snooze lose sophia shes been trying to work people up around here kind of a corporate mutiny or whatever she might have gotten some supporters you may lose some good people when she goes all right ill set up a full staff meeting this afternoon do damage control im sorry i havent been on top of this when it all shakes down id like recommendations people you think should be considered for promotion or reassignment as of now youre comanagers ill put through the paperwork cool pj leaped up im going to go draw up how ill rearrange my new office she turned to ty id just like to say that being the strong silent type doesnt make you pussywhipped it makes you interesting kris was really steamed that you didnt try to muscle your way in and end up falling on your ass instead you dont say anything unless youve got something to say and when you do it makes sense suck up trace said under his breath i dont have to suck up ive got the big office with a flutter of her lashes she walked out i like working here i like working with you idve been bummed if things had worked out differently with that said he walked out whistling feel better tyler asked considerably a little angry with myself for letting things go this far and this long but otherwise considerably better good why dont you go set up that staff meeting deal and ill try to track down margaret you up for a dinner meeting thing if she wants to sure but thats not going to make her happy she has the hots for you get out buy a clue sophia said lightly and stepped out again to arrange for the meeting with her assistant women tyler thought as he hunted up margarets home number in sophias rolodex and they said men always had sex on the brain just because he and margaret got along had gone out once or twice didnt mean he shifted his thoughts when a man answered on the third ring im trying to reach margaret bowers whos calling tyler macmillan mr macmillan there was the briefest pause this is detective claremont claremont sorry i mustve dialed the wrong number no you didnt im in ms bowerss apartment shes dead part three the blooming flowers are lovely love is flowerlike friendship is a sheltering tree samuel taylor coleridge chapter sixteen contents prev next march roared across the valley on a raw and galloping wind it hardened the ground and rattled the naked fingers of the vines the dawn mists had a bite that chewed through the bones there would be worries about damage and loss until the true warmth of spring arrived there would be worries about many things sophia stopped at the vineyards first and was disappointed that tyler wasnt stalking down the rows examining the canes for early growth she knew the disking phase was about to begin weather permitting men with disk harrows would pulverize and aerate the soil breaking up the crusted earth turning the mustard plants and their nitrogen into the ground for the vintner the quiet of february blew into the busy and critical month of march winter a fickle white witch held the valley and gave those who lived there too much time to think hed be brooding of course sitting up in his office she imagined as she changed directions for the house going over his charts and logs and records making some notes in his vintners journal but brooding all the same time to put a stop to it she started to knock on the door no she decided when you knocked it was too easy to be told to go away instead she opened the door pulling off her jacket as she stepped inside ty she tossed the jacket over the newel post and following instinct headed for his office ive got work to do here he didnt bother to look up until moments before hed been at the window hed seen her walking through the rows changing her angle to aim for the house hed even thought about going down and locking the door but it had seemed both petty and useless hed known her too long to believe a lock would keep her out she sat across from his desk leaned back and waited until the silence irked him enough to speak what you look like hell thanks no word from the police yet youre just as likely to hear as i am true enough she mused and the wait was making her edgy it had been nearly a week since margarets body had been found on the floor by a table set for two with an untouched steak on the platter candles guttered out and an empty bottle of merlot it was that she knew that continued to prey on tylers mind the other place had been set for him i spoke with her parents today theyre going to take her back to columbus for the funeral its hard for them for you if i hadnt canceled you dont know if it would have made any difference or not she got up to go to him standing behind him she began to rub his shoulders if she had a heart condition no one knew about she could have become ill anytime if id been there if maybe feeling for him she brushed a kiss on the top of his head take it from me those two words will make you crazy she was too young for a goddamn heart attack and dont give me the line of statistics the cops are looking into it and not passing on information that means something all it means right now is that it was an unattended death and that she was connected through giambelli to my father its just routine ty until we know differently its just routine you said she had feelings for me if she could go back sophia decided shed bite off her tongue before uttering that single careless remark i was just razzing you no you werent giving up he closed his vintners log you know what they say about hindsight i didnt see it she didnt interest me that way so i didnt want to see it thats not your fault and picking at that isnt helping anything im sorry this happened i liked her without thinking she hooked her arms around his shoulders rested her cheek on his head so did i come downstairs ill fix soup why because itll give us both something to do besides think and wait she swiveled his chair around until he faced her besides i have gossip and no one to share it with i dont like gossip too bad she pulled at his hand pleased when he let her tug him to his feet my mother slept with david ah damn it sophie why do you tell me things like that she smiled a little hooking her arm through his because you cant spread gossip like that outside of the family and i dont think its an appropriate subject for nonna and i to discuss over breakfast but its appropriate to discuss with me over soup he just couldnt understand the female mind how do you know anyway really ty she exclaimed as they started downstairs in the first place i know mama and one look at her was enough in the second i saw the two of them together yesterday and it showed he didnt ask how it showed she was too likely to tell him and he wouldnt understand anyway how do you feel about it i dont know part of me is delighted good for you mama another is standing back with her jaw on the ground thinking my mother isnt supposed to have sex thats the immature part im working on it he stopped at the base of the steps turned her youre a good daughter with a casual tap of his finger he tipped up her chin and not a halfbad person as people go oh i can be bad if he hurts her davids going to find out just how bad i can be ill hold him down you skin him thats a deal her eyes changed as he continued to look into them and her blood began to move ty she lifted a hand to his face as he leaned toward her and the knock on the door had her cursing for gods sake what is wrong with our timing i want you to remember where we were i really want you to remember it i think ive got it bookmarked no less irritated by the interruption than she he stalked to the door yanked it open and felt a clench in his gut mr macmillan claremont stood beside maguire in the chilly air can we come in they moved into the living room where the atmosphere was masculine and messy he hadnt thought to light a fire that morning so the hearth was cold a newspaper several days old was still piled on the coffee table a paperback book peeked up from under it maguire couldnt quite make out the title he didnt bother to pick up as a lot of people did she noted and he didnt look as if he particularly wanted to sit down but when he dropped into a chair sophia edged onto the arm of it beside him and made them a unit claremont took out his notepad and set the rhythm you said you and margaret bowers dated no i didnt i said we went out a couple of times thats generally interpreted as dating i didnt interpret it that way i interpreted it as we went out a couple of times you were supposed to have dinner with her on the night she died yeah thered be no expression and no condemnation in claremonts voice but it still stung as i told you before i got hung up here called her somewhere around six i got her machine and left a message that i couldnt make it didnt give her much notice maguire put in no i didnt just what hung you up work at the villa thats what i said the last time you asked it still goes basically i lost track of time and forgot about dinner until i got home you called her at six so you still had an hour you couldve made it maguire tilted her head or called and told her youd be a bit late i couldve i didnt i didnt feel like driving into the city is that a problem ms bowers died with the table still set for two thats a problem detective claremont sophia interrupted her tone pleasant ty isnt being specific because i imagine he feels it might embarrass me we had a moment in the office in the villa that evening sophia ty she said equably i believe the detectives will understand that you might not have been in the mood to drive down to san francisco and have dinner with one woman when youd very shortly before been rolling around on the office floor with another we had a moment she continued unplanned and impromptu and very likely inappropriate and were interrupted when tylers grandfather stepped into the room to emphasize her point she ran her fingers through tys hair mr macmillan senior can verify that if you feel it necessary to ask him if we were indeed groping each other during working hours under those circumstances i think its understandable that ty might have been a bit frazzled and not in the mood to drive to the city for a business dinner with margaret but the main point is unless im just stupid that he didnt go in the first place and so is unconnected to what happened to her claremont listened patiently nodded then looked back at tyler it was he supposed a step to have his impression of the two of them verified and another to note that macmillan looked uncomfortable and the giambelli woman amused have you ever had dinner in ms bowerss apartment before no ive been there picked her up once for a business deal at the four seasons we went together that was about a year ago why dont you just ask if hes ever slept with her sophia suggested ty did you and margaret ever no torn between irritation and embarrassment he shot her a fulminating look jesus sophie before he could gather his composure she patted his shoulder and took over she was attracted to him and he was oblivious men often are and tys a bit more dense about that sort of thing than most ive been trying to get him in bed for will you stop it he had to struggle not to simply lower his head into his hands listen im sorry about what happened to margaret she was a nice woman i liked her and maybe if i hadnt canceled i couldve called nineoneone when she had the heart attack but i dont see what these questions have to do with anything did you ever give ms bowers a bottle of wine tyler dragged his hand through his hair i dont know probably i give a lot of people and business associates bottles of wine kind of goes with the territory wine carrying the giambelli label the italian label no i use my own why ms bowers consumed nearly an entire bottle of castello di giambelli merlot on the evening you were to dine with her the bottle contained digitalis i dont get it even as tyler reared up in his seat sophia was clamping a hand on his shoulder she was murdered sophia demanded poisoned margaret was if youd been there if youd had the wine its possible that if more than one person had shared the bottle the dosage wouldnt have been lethal claremont stated but ms bowers consumed nearly the entire bottle in what was certainly one sitting do you have any idea how digitalis found its way into a bottle of italian merlot and into ms bowerss apartment i have to call my grandmother sophia sprang to her feet if theres been product tampering we have to deal with it quickly i need all the information on that bottle the vintage i have to have a copy of the label to run it down your grandmothers been informed maguire told her as have the proper italian authorities product tampering is a possibility but at this point we have no idea when ms bowers obtained the bottle or if it was given to her we cant confirm she didnt add the dose to the wine herself kill herself thats ridiculous ty got to his feet she wasnt suicidal she was doing great when i talked to her happy with her job excited about the new responsibilities the travel do you have any enemies mr macmillan someone who might have known your plans with ms bowers that evening no and im not a target in the first place if the wine was tampered with id have known it id have nosed it or tasted it its what i do exactly maguire concurred sophia felt her hackles rise ty youve answered enough questions were going to call a lawyer i dont need a goddamn lawyer were calling uncle james now thats your right claremont got to his feet a question for you ms giambelli do you know anything about the relationship between ms bowers and your father her blood iced over as far as i know they didnt have one outside of business i see well thank you for your time my father and margaret its just as likely he was pulling your chain but sophia worried on the nugget chewing it measuring its texture if there was something between them and their deaths are connected dont rush it sophie he put a hand over hers briefly then downshifted to turn into the villa he knew how shaken she was she hadnt voiced the slightest objection when hed gotten behind the wheel of her car to drive them if theres been tampering if theres a chance the slightest chance there are other bottles dont rush it he said again he stopped the car shifted to her he took her hand now held it well have to check it out every step every detail we cant panic because if there has been tampering sophie thats just what whoever did it wants panic chaos scandal i know the scandals my job i can handle it ill think of something to turn the publicity but my father and margaret ty if there was something there she tightened her grip on his hand when he started to shake his head i have to think of it if there was did he know about the tampering how many times a year did he travel to italy eight ten twelve dont go there sophia why you have you think i cant see it you have others will so i have to get there first i dont want to believe this of him i have to accept all the rest but i dont want to believe this youre making too big a leap too fast slow down facts soph lets start with facts the facts are two people are dead because her hand wanted to tremble she drew it from his and pushed out of the car margaret took over most of my fathers accounts and responsibilities whether or not there was a personal relationship between them thats a connection okay he wanted to offer her something but it seemed all she wanted was cold logic well look at that connection and see where it takes us first we deal with the wine he said as they started up the stairs then with the fallout the family was in the front parlor with david standing by the window talking on the phone tereza sat soldierstraight sipping coffee she nodded when ty and sophia came in and merely gestured to chairs james is on his way eli paced back and forth in front of the fire the strain seemed to have weight and caused his face to sag davids talking to italy now getting damage control started let me get you some coffee pilar began mama sit i need to do something mama sophia rose and walked to the coffee cart to stand beside pilar dad and margaret i dont know her hands were steady on the pot even as her insides shivered i just dont i wouldve thought it was my impression rene kept him on a short leash not short enough sophia kept her voice quiet he was involved with a woman at my office oh it was a kind of sigh i wish i could tell you sophie but i just dont know im sorry understand this sophia turned at her grandmothers voice waited if there was something between tony avano and margaret bowers the police will speculate that any of us any of us who are connected to them might have had a part in their deaths were family here well stand by each other and for each other until this is done she glanced toward david when he lowered the phone so were tracking it he began well recall all bottles of merlot of that vintage we should very shortly be able to determine which cask the bottle was drawn from ill leave in the morning no eli and i will leave in the morning tereza lifted a hand closed her fingers around elis when he gripped it this is for me i leave it to you to see that the california operation is secure that theres no breach you and tyler must make certain of it paulie and i can start with the wineries tyler suggested david can look at the bottling david nodded well go over the personnel files one by one you know the crews better than i do its most likely the problems contained in italy but well make certain californias secure sophia already had her memo pad in her lap ill have press releases both english and italian ready in an hour ill need all the details on the recall well want a story on how exacting the winemaking process is for giambellimacmillan how safe how secure well certainly take some hits in italy but we may be able to keep it below crisis point here well need to allow camera crews in the vineyards and the wineries both here and overseas nonna with you and eli going over well be able to show that giambelli is familyrun and that la signora continues to take a personal interest it is familyrun tereza said flatly and i take a very personal interest i know that sophia lowered her book its important to make sure the press and the consumer know it believe it are impressed by it well need to use mama here mama ty me well show the roots the family involvement and concern a hundred years of tradition excellence and responsibility i know how to do this shes right no one was more surprised than sophia when tyler spoke mostly i dont give a damn about publicity or perception which he added is why the two of you dumped me into it and id as soon have a plague of locusts in my winery as reporters i still mostly dont give a damn but i know a little more about it enough to be sure sophia will find a way to spin this around to damp down the worst of the damage and probably find one to turn it around to benefit the company shell find the way because she cares more than anybody agreed so we each do what we do best tereza looked at eli and something passed between them in that beat of silence but we do nothing else until we meet with james moore its not only the reputation of the company that must be protected but the company itself sophia draft your release david will help you with the details then well let the lawyers look at it and everything else it was a blow to the pride that tereza thought as she stood at her office window was the hardest to accept what was hers had been violated threatened the work of a lifetime besmirched by one tainted bottle of wine now in so many ways she had to trust others to save her legacy well handle this tereza yes she lifted a hand to cover the one eli laid on her shoulder i was remembering when i was a young girl and my grandfather walked with me down the rows back home he said to me that it wasnt enough to plant that what was planted must be tended protected cherished and disciplined the vines were his children they became mine youve raised them well and paid the price i was less of a wife to the man i married here so long ago than i might have been less of a mother to the daughter i birthed i had the responsibility passed to me and the ambition eli such ambition it lived in her still and she didnt regret it would there have been more children if i hadnt wished so desperately for my vines to be fertile would my child have made the choices she made if i had been more her mother things happen as theyre meant to happen thats the practical scot we italians we tend to believe more in chance and retribution whats happened isnt retribution tereza its either a terrible accident or a criminal act youre not responsible either way i took responsibility the day i took giambelli her eyes scanned the vines the sleeping promise of them arent i responsible for pushing sophia and tyler together thinking of the company never imagining what might happen between them on another level tereza he turned her to face him realigning so that they work together doesnt trickle down and make you the trigger for shooting those two very healthy young people onto the office floor she sighed no but it proves i didnt take their health into account were passing our heritage into their hands i expected them to fight we both did but sex can make enemies of people and that i didnt anticipate god that makes me feel old tereza he pressed his lips to her forehead we are old he said it to make her laugh and she obliged him well we didnt become enemies we can hope each of them took something from us i love you tereza i know i didnt marry you for love eli i know my dear for business she said stepping back from him a merger a wise business move i respected you i liked you a great deal and enjoyed your company instead of being punished for such calculation i was rewarded i love you very much i hope you know that too i do well weather this tereza i dont need you by my side but i want you there very much want you there that i think says more means more he took the hand she held out to him well go down james should be here soon james looked over sophias proposed release nodded good he slipped off his reading glasses clear calm with a personal touch i wouldnt change a thing from a legal standpoint then ill go up finalize it alert the troops and get it out take linc with you james winked at her hes a good general dogsbody he waited until theyd left the room tereza eli ill be consulting with your lawyers in italy at this point youre handling the problem quickly and decisively this should cut down on any potential legal actions against the company you may be looking at some suits here you need to be prepared for that ill get what i can from the police unless its substantiated that the chemical was in the wine prior to it being opened youve nothing to worry about other than damaging publicity if giambelli is found liable through negligence well deal with it negligence isnt my concern james if the wine was tainted before it was opened it wasnt negligence but murder right now thats speculation from the questions the police asked you and you tyler theyre speculating as well they dont know when the digitalis was added to the wine from a legal standpoint this keeps giambelli one very vital step back from the problem the problem tyler said is a womans dead thats a problem for the police and while you may not like it im going to advise you not to answer any more questions from them without counsel present its their job to build a case its not yours to help them i knew her thats right and she had prepared a cozy and romantic dinner for two on the night she died a dinner you didnt attend right now the police wonder just how well you knew her let them wonder and while theyre wondering well look into margaret bowers who she was who she knew what she wanted hell of a mess huh sophia glanced up at linc i have a feeling were going to be sweeping it up for a long time plenty of brooms youve got dad so youve got the best and no way momll stay out of it then youve got me she managed a smile a triple threat damn right moore moore and moore who could ask for anything stop ill have to hit you she finished proofing the release on her screen then faxed it to pj better if this comes out of the san francisco office than here i want it personal but i dont want it to look like a family coverup ive started these followups and story pitches why dont you take a look put your legal mind to them and see if ive covered my ass sure always liked your ass ha ha she got up to let him take her place at the desk hows the doctor cruising right along you ought to snag a date and meet us some night we could hit some hot spots have a few laughs you look like you could use a few laughs more than a few my social life doesnt exist these days and that looks to be the pattern for the foreseeable future this from the party queen the party queens lost her crown since he was using her computer she grabbed the phone to check in with pj you ask me you could use a little break sophie youre edgy were edgy he added when she shot him a look before this last flurry of crap hit all work and no play and yaddayadda i dont have time to play she snapped i dont have time to think past the next move or take a breath without worrying whats going to jump in my face next ive been putting in twelvehour days minimum for nearly three months i have calluses on my damn hands had to fire a top staff member and i havent had sex for six goddamn months whoa ouch and i didnt mean the calluses id offer to help you out there but the doctors liable to object she blew out a breath i think im going to take up yoga she dragged open her desk drawer pulled out her aspirin as pj came on the line fax come through she listened nodded as she worked off the top of the bottle get it out on the wire asap then what christ when all right all right get the release out get me the information word for word ill work up a response dont give any comments just use the release see that all department heads all key personnel have a copy of it thats the company line until further notice keep me updated she hung up stared over at linc its out its already leaked chapter seventeen contents prev next giambellimacmillan the giant of the wine industry has suffered another crisis it has been confirmed that a tainted bottle of wine was responsible for the death of margaret bowers an executive with the company police are investigating the possibility of product tampering is being considered and giambellimacmillan is recalling bottles of castello di giambelli merlot since the merger of the giambellimacmillan wineries last december perfect jerry thought as he watched the evening newscast absolutely perfect theyd scramble of course already were scrambling but what would the public hear giambelli death wine bottles would be poured down the sink more would sit unsold on the shelf it would sting quite a bit and for quite some time it would cut into profits short and longterm profits la coeur would reap that alone was a great satisfaction professionally and personally very personally it was true a couple of people had died but that wasnt his fault he had nothing to do with it directly and when the police caught the one who did the damage to giambelli would only be compounded hed wait awhile bide his time watch the show then if it seemed advantageous there could be another anonymous call not to the media this time but to the police digitalis comes from foxglove maddy knew shed looked it up what distracted david looked over briefly he had a mountain of paperwork on his desk in italian he was much better at speaking it than reading it would they have grown foxglove near the vines maddy demanded like they grow mustard plants between the rows here for nitrogen i dont think they would because theyd know foxglove had digitalis but maybe they made a mistake could it infect the grapes if the plants were grown there and turned into the soil i dont know maddy this isnt for you to worry about why youre worried its my job to worry i could help honey if you want to help you could give me a little space here do your homework her lips began to pout a sure sign of personal insult but david was too distracted to notice ive done my homework well help theo with his or something but if the digitalis maddy at his wits end he snapped at her this isnt a story or a project its a very real problem and i have to deal with it go find something to do fine she shut the door of his office and let the resentment burn as she stomped away he never wanted her to help when it was something important do your homework talk to theo clean up your room he always fell back on those crappy deals when she wanted to do something that mattered she bet he wouldnt have told pilar giambelli to find something to do and she didnt know squat about science music and art and looking pretty thats all she knew girl things not important things she stalked to theos room he was sprawled on the bed his music blaring his guitar lying on his belly and the phone at his ear from the dopey look on his face it was a girl on the other end men were so lame dad wants you to do your homework beat it he crossed his ankles nah its nothing just my idiot sister the phone knocked hard against his jaw when maddy launched herself at him in seconds theo was dealing with the shock of pain the squeals in his ear and the pummels and kicks of a furious maddy ow wait damn it maddy call you back he managed to drop the phone and in the nick of time protect his privates from a knee jab what the hell after a long sweaty minute he managed to flip her she didnt fight like a girl but he still outweighed her and pin her down cut it out you crazy little bitch whats your problem im not nothing she spat it at him and made a valiant attempt with her knee again no youre just nutszoid he licked the corner of his mouth cursed at the unmistakable taste im bleeding when i tell dad you cant tell him anything he doesnt listen to anybody except her her who you know who get off me you big fat jerk youre just as bad as he is making gooey noises to some girl and not listening to anybody i was having a conversation he said with great dignity to counter the gooey snipe and if you hit me again im hitting you back even if dad grounds me for it now whats your problem i dont have a problem its the men in this house making asses of themselves over the women in the villa thats the problem its disgusting its embarrassing watching her theo wiped the blood from his mouth he had a very creative fantasy life going where sophia was concerned and his baby sister wasnt going to spoil it for him he shook back his mop of curly hair yawned youre just jealous i am not sure you are cause youre skinny and flatchested id rather have brains than breasts good thing i dont know why youre having a snitfit because dads hanging with pilar hes hung with women before youre so stupid every dreg of disgust gathered in her voice hes not hanging out with her putzface hes in love with her get out what do you know but his stomach did a funny little jump as he dragged a bag of chips off his dresser man its going to change everything thats the way it works there was a terrible pressure in her chest but she got to her feet nothings ever going to be the same again and that sucks out loud nothings been the same not since mom took off it got better the tears wanted to escape but rather than let them fall in front of him she stormed out of the room yeah theo muttered but it didnt stay the same sophia hoped air cold and clear would blow some of the clouds from her mind she had to think and think precisely she was spinning as quickly as she could but the newscast had caused some damage too often the first impression was all people ever remembered now her job was to shift that impression to show the public that while giambelli had been violated the company had done nothing to violate the public that took more than words she knew more even than placement and delivery it took tangible action if her grandparents werent even now packed for italy she would have urged them to do so to be visible at the source of the problem not to fall back on the safety of no comment but to comment often and to comment specifically use the company name again and again she thought making mental notes make it personal make the company breathe but they had to tread carefully around margaret bowers sympathy of course but not so much it implied responsibility to do that to help them do that sophia had to stop thinking of margaret as a person if that was cold she would be cold and deal with her conscience later she stood at the edge of the vineyard it was guarded she thought against pests disease the vagaries of weather whatever threatened to invade or damage it was fought against this was no different shed fight the war and on her terms she wouldnt regret any act that won it she caught a shadow of movement whos there her mind leaped toward trespasser saboteur murderer without hesitation she charged and found her arms full of struggling young girl let go i can be here im allowed sorry im sorry sophia stepped back you scared me she hadnt looked scared maddy thought but she had looked scary im not doing anything wrong i didnt say you were i said you scared me i guess were all a little jumpy right now look she caught the glimmer of tears on the girls cheeks as she didnt like having her own crying jags brought into issue she gave maddy the same consideration i just came out to clear my head too much going on in there right now sophia glanced back at the house my fathers working there was just enough defense in the statement to have sophia speculating theres a lot of pressure on him right now on everybody my grandparents are leaving for italy first thing in the morning i worry about them theyre not young anymore after her fathers rebuff sophias casual confidence soothed still cautious maddy fell into step beside her they dont act old not like decrepit or anything no they dont do they but still i wish i could go instead but they need me here right now maddys lips trembled as she looked toward the lights of the guest house nobody it seemed needed her anywhere at least youve got something to do yeah now if i could just figure out what to do next so much going on she slanted maddy a look the kid was wound up and sulking about something sophia remembered very well what it was like to be fourteen wound up and sulking life was full of immediacy and intense moments at fourteen she thought that made professional crises seem like paper cuts i guess on some level were in the same boat my mother she said when maddy remained silent your father its a little weird maddy shrugged then hunched her shoulders i gotta go all right but id like to tell you something woman to woman daughter to daughter whatever my mothers gone a long time without someone without a good man to care about her i dont know what its been like for you or your brother or your father but for me after the general strangeness of it its nice to see her have a good man who makes her happy i hope youll give her a chance it doesnt matter what i do or think or say defiant misery sophia mused yes she remembered that too yes it matters when someone loves us what we think and what we do matters she looked over at the sound of running feet from the looks of it somebody loves you maddy breathless david plucked his daughter off her feet he managed to embrace and shake her at the same time what are you doing you cant go wandering off like that after dark i just took a walk and cost me a year of my life you want to fight with your brother be my guest but youre not to leave the house again without permission clear yes sir though secretly pleased she grimaced i didnt think youd notice think again he hooked his arm around her neck a casual habit of affection sophia had noticed and envied her father had never touched her like that partly my fault sophia told him i kept her longer than i should have shes a terrific sounding board my mind was going off in too many directions you should give it a rest youre going to need all circuits up and working tomorrow is your mother free he didnt notice the way maddy stiffened but sophia did i imagine why im slogging through reports and memos in italian itd go faster with someone who reads it better than i do ill tell her sophia looked at maddy now shell want to help appreciate it now ill just drag this baggage home and pound it awhile see you at the briefing eight oclock ill be ready night maddy she watched them walk through the fields toward the guest house their shadows close enough to merge into one form in the moonlight hard to blame the kid for wanting to keep it that way hard to make room for changes for people when your life seemed just fine as it was but changes happened it was smarter to be a part of them better yet she decided to initiate them tyler kept the radio and the tv off he ignored the phone one thing he could control was his own reaction to the press and the best way to control it was to ignore the press altogether at least for a few hours he was working his way through his own files his logs every record he had available he could and would ascertain that the macmillan area of the company was secure what he couldnt seem to control were his own questions about margaret an accident suicide or murder none of the options was appealing he eliminated suicide she hadnt been the type and he sure as hell didnt have the towering ego that suggested shed killed herself in despair because hed broken a dinner date maybe she had been interested in him and maybe hed ignored the signals because he hadnt felt the same way and hadnt wanted the complications life was complicated enough without tangling up business and personal relationships plus she just hadnt been his type he didnt go for the fasttrack career woman with attitude and an agenda that kind of woman just took too much energy take sophia christ he was beginning to think hed explode if he didnt take sophia and wasnt that the point he reminded himself as he roamed restlessly downstairs again thinking about her that way muddled up the mind strained the body and complicated an already complex business association now more than ever it was essential he keep his mind on his job the current crisis was going to pull his time and energy away from the vineyards when he could least afford it longrange forecasts warned him that frost vigils would be necessary several casks of wine were on the point of being ready for bottling disking had already started he didnt have time to worry about police investigations potential lawsuits or a woman and of all of them he was finding the woman the hardest to shove out of his mind because shed invaded his system he thought and shed be stuck there irritating him until he got her out again so why didnt he just march over to the villa storm up her terrace steps and deal with it finish it he knew exactly how pathetic and selfserving that was as rationalization and decided he didnt give a damn he grabbed a jacket strode to the front door and yanked it open and there she was stalking up his steps i dont like irritable macho men she told him as she slammed the door at her back i dont like bossy aggressive women they dove at each other even as their mouths began a mutual assault she boosted herself up wrapped her legs around his hips i want a bed this time her breath already tattered she tugged at his shirt well try out the floor later i want you naked he nipped his teeth into her throat and began to stagger up the steps i dont care where god you have this incredible taste she raced her lips over his face his neck its so basic her breath caught when he rapped her back against the wall at the top of the steps her fingers fisted in his hair this is just sex right yeah right whatever his mouth crushed down on hers using the wall to brace her he began dragging her sweater over her head god youre so built he tossed her sweater aside took his mouth over the soft swell of breast that rose above her bra were not going to make the bed her heart hammered as he used his teeth on her okay next time her feet hit the floor at least she thought they did it was hard to know where she was who she was with as the geyser of greed erupted inside her hands were pulling at clothes something ripped mouths ran hot over flesh everything blurred over the wild beat of blood she could hear her own whimpers pleas demands a kind of mad chant that merged with his she was already wet already aching when his fingers found her the violent glory of the orgasm ripped through her molten gold release so strong so welcome she might have melted bonelessly to the floor uhuh no you dont he pressed her back against the wall and riding on her thrill continued to drive her i want you screaming go up again she couldnt have stopped herself welcoming the burn craving it she let him take empty her out until her mind was filled with the dark and the feral and filled she tore at him whipped him past reason she watched his eyes go opaque and knew it was she who blinded him heard his breath heave and tear and thrilled that she could weaken him now once more she anchored her hands in his hair and shuddered shuddered as she poised on the next thin edge now now now when he plunged into her she came again brutally her nails dug into the sweatslicked slope of his shoulders as her hips pistoned lightningfast with his mouth fused to hers he swallowed the small greedy sounds she made fed on them as he hitched her up to give more take more pleasure careened through him left him shattered stupefied he managed to hold on to her as both of them slid to the floor sprawled over him her heart still racing sophia began to laugh dio grazie a dio decanted at last no real finesse but a fine body and excellent staying power well work on finesse when im not ready to howl at the moon wasnt complaining to prove it she brushed her lips lightly over his chest i feel fabulous at least i think i do i can verify that you feel incredible he blew out a breath im winded that makes two of us she lifted her head studied his face are you finished not hardly oh good because neither am i she shifted straddled him ty mmmm his hands were already stroking up her torso she was so smooth he thought smooth dusky exotic we probably need to set guidelines yeah she had a pretty little mole on the curve of her left hip a kind of sexual punctuation you want to get into that now no good me either she braced her hands on either side of his head leaned down she brushed her lips at the corners of his mouth teasing little sips bed she whispered he reared up wrapped his arms around her next time sometime around midnight she found herself facedown on his bed the sheets were tangled and hot and her bones were limp as water even after so long a sexual drought it was hard for her to believe the human body could recharge as often and at such intense power water she croaked afraid now that shed satisfied one craving thirst would kill her i need water ill give you anything wild sexual favors if youll just give me a bottle of water youve already paid out the wild sexual favors oh right she groped over patted his shoulder blindly be a pal macmillan okay but where are we on the bed she sighed gustily we finally made it right be right back he staggered up and since hed been crossways on the bed misjudged direction and rapped smartly into a chair listening to his muttered curses sophia smiled into the sheet god he was cute funny smarter than shed given him credit for and incredible in bed on the floor against the wall she couldnt remember any man appealing to her on so many levels especially when you considered he was the type who had to be held at gunpoint to put on a suit and tie which was she supposed why he always looked so sexy in them the caveman temporarily civilized lost for the moment in that thought she yelped when ty held the iced water to her bare shoulder ha ha she muttered but was grateful enough to roll over sit up and gulp down half the glass hey i figured youd share i didnt say anything about sharing then i want more sexual favors you couldnt possibly she chuckled you know how much i like proving you wrong she sighed as his hand snuck up her thigh thats true still she handed him the rest of the water i might have a few sexual favors left in me but then i really have to go home early briefing tomorrow he drained the glass set it aside were not thinking about that now he hooked an arm around her waist then rolled until she was under him let me tell you just what i have in mind it had been sophia mused a very long time since shed snuck into the house at two in the morning still it was one of those skills like riding a bike or well sex that came back to you she dimmed her headlights before they flashed against the windows of the villa and eased the car gently slowly around the bend and into the garage she crept out into the chilly night and stood just a moment under the brilliant wheel of stars she felt outrageously tired wonderfully used and alive tyler macmillan she decided was a man just full of surprises of secret pockets and marvelous marvelous energy shed learned a great deal about him in the past few months aspects and angles she hadnt bothered to explore and she was looking forward to continuing that exploration but for now shed better get in the house and get some sleep or shed be useless the next day odd she thought as she walked quietly around the back shed wanted to stay with him sleep with him all curled up against that long warm body safe cozy secure shed trained herself over the years to click off emotionally after sex a mans way she liked to think sleeping and waking in the same bed after the fun and games were over could be awkward it could be intimate avoiding that making certain she didnt need that kept things from getting messy but shed had to order herself to leave tylers bed because she was tired she assured herself because it had been a difficult day he wasnt really any different from anyone else shed been with perhaps she liked him more she considered as she navigated through the shrubbery and was more attracted to him than shed expected to be that didnt make him different just new after a while the polish would wear off the shiny excitement and that would be that that she thought was always that if you looked for love and lifetimes you were doomed to disappoint or be disappointed better much better to seize the moment wring it dry then move on because thinking was dulling her mood she blocked out the questions and rounding the last bend in the gardens came facetoface with her mother they stared at each other the surprised breath each puffed out frosting into little clouds um nice night sophia commented yes very i was just ah david stumped pilar gestured vaguely toward the guest house he needed help with some translating i see a wild giggle tried to claw its way out of sophias throat is that what your generation calls it a small choking sound escaped if were going to sneak the rest of the way in lets do it we could freeze out here trying to come up with reasonable excuses i was translating pilar hurried to the door fumbled with the knob there was a lot of oh mama the laughter won sophia clutched her belly and stumbled inside stop bragging i was merely floundering pilar pushed at her hair she had a very good idea how she looked tumbled and flushed like a woman whod just slid out of bed or in this case off the living room sofa taking the offensive seemed to be the safest course youre out late yeah i was translating with ty with oh oh im starving how about you enjoying herself sophia pulled open the refrigerator i never got around to dinner she spoke casually with her head in the fridge do you have a problem with me and ty no yes no pilar stuttered i dont know i absolutely dont know how im supposed to handle this lets have pie pie sophia pulled out what was left of a deepdish apple you look wonderful mama pilar brushed at her hair again i couldnt possibly wonderful sophia set the dish on the counter and reached up for plates i had a few emotional bumps about you and david i wasnt used to seeing you as to seeing you i suppose but when i run into you sneaking into the house in the middle of the night looking wonderful i cant help but see you i dont have to sneak into my own house oh wielding a pie cutter sophia asked then why were you i was just lets have pie good call sophia cut two huge hunks then smiled when pilar stroked her hair she leaned in and for a moment the two of them stood in the bright kitchen light in silence it was a long lousy day its nice to end it well yes though you gave me a hell of a shock outside me imagine my surprise reliving my teenage years then running into my mother reliving really sophia carried the plates to the kitchen table while pilar got forks oh well why dwell on the past grinning wickedly sophia licked pie from her thumb davids very hot sophie very hot great shoulders that charmingly boyish face that intelligent brain quite a package youve bagged there mama hes not a trophy and i certainly hope you dont think of ty as one hes got a terrific butt i know i meant ty i know pilar repeated what am i blind with an unladylike snort she plopped into a chair this is ridiculous its rude and its fun sophia finished and sat down to scoop up some pie we share an interest in fashion and more recently in the business why shouldnt we share an interest in nonna well of course we share an interest in pilar dropped her fork with a clatter as she followed the direction of sophias blank stare mama what are you doing up you think i dont know when people come and go in my house somehow elegant in a thick chenille robe and slippers tereza swept into the room what no wine we were just hungry sophia managed ha no wonder sex is a laborious business if done properly im hungry myself sophia slapped a hand to her mouth but it was too late the burst of laughter erupted go eli tereza merely took the last piece of pie as her daughter stared down at her plate shoulders shaking well have wine i believe the occasion calls for it i think this is surely the first time all three generations of giambelli women have sat together in the kitchen after making love you neednt look so stunned pilar sex is a natural function after all and since youve chosen a worthy partner this time well have wine she chose a bottle of sauvignon blanc from the kitchen rack and uncorked it these are trying times there have been others and there will be more she poured three glasses its essential that we live while we move through them i approve of david cutter if my approval matters thank you it does of course sophia was biting her lip to hide a grin when tereza turned toward her if you hurt tyler ill be both angry and disappointed in you i love him very much well i like that deflated sophia set her fork down why would i remember what i said tomorrow well fight for what we are what we have tonight she lifted her glass tonight we celebrate it salute chapter eighteen contents prev next it was a war waged on several fronts sophia fought her battles on the airwaves in print and on the telephone she spent hours updating press releases giving interviews reassuring accounts and every day she started over beating back rumor innuendo and speculation until the crisis passed her time in the vineyards was over that was tylers battlefield she found herself resenting not being able to soldier there as well to take part in the disking the frost vigils in the careful guarding of the emerging buds she worried about her grandparents forging their front on the italian line every day the reports came in the recall was being implemented and soon bottle by bottle the wine would be tested she couldnt think about the cost short or longterm that she left in davids hands when she needed to step back from the hype and spin she stood at her office window and watched men with harrows work the earth it would be a year of rare vintage she promised herself they only had to survive it she jumped at the next ring of her phone and buried the very real need to ignore it sophia giambelli ten minutes later she hung up then released pentup rage with a vicious stream of italian curses does that help pilar asked as she stood by the doorway not enough sophia pressed her fingers to her temples and wondered how best to handle this next stage of combat im glad youre here can you come in sit down a minute fifteen actually ive just finished up another tour pilar settled into a chair theyre coming in droves curiosity seekers for the most part now some reporters though thats down to a trickle since your press conference its likely to build again i just got off the phone with a producer of the larry mann show larry mann pilar wrinkled her nose trash television at its worst you arent going to give them anything theyve already got something theyve got rene unable to sit still sophia shoved away from her desk shes going to tape a show tomorrow revealing family secrets supposedly telling the true story of dads death were invited to participate they want either you or me or both of us on the show to give our side of it it wont do sophie as satisfying as it might be to slap her back in public it isnt the way and that isnt the forum why do you think i was cursing she snatched up her frog paperweight passed it restlessly from hand to hand well take the high road and ignore her but god how id love to wrestle in the mud with that bitch shes been giving interviews right and left and shes good enough at them to do considerable damage ive talked to both aunt helen and uncle james about legal action dont she cant be allowed to use the family to slander sophia scowled down at the frog his cheerfully silly face usually lightened her mood i cant get down and dirty with her which is a crying shame but i can slap her back legally listen to me first pilar said leaning forward im not being soft im not being manipulated taking legal action at least right now when weve so many other battles to fight only gives some credence to her and what shes saying i know your instincts are to fight and mine are generally to retreat but maybe this time we do neither we just stand in place ive thought of that ive thought of it from both angles but when it comes down to it you fight fire with fire not always honey sometimes you just drown it well just drown her out with good giambelli wine sophia inhaled exhaled slowly as she sat back she set the paperweight down again turning it around and around while she considered behind her the fax beeped and whined but she ignored it while she figured the angles thats good nodding she looked at her mother again thats very good drown the flames with one good flood were going to have a party spring ball black tie how much time do you need to put it together to her credit pilar only blinked three weeks good work up the guest list once weve got invitations out ill plant some items with reporters rene opts for trash well opt for elegance a party tyler raised his voice over the rumble of disking ever hear of nero and his fiddle romes not burning thats my point impatient sophia dragged him farther from the work giambelli takes their responsibilities seriously are cooperating with the authorities here and in italy merda she swore as her cell phone rang wait she pulled the phone from her pocket sophia giambelli si va bene with an absent signal to ty she paced a few feet away he stood watched her move issue what were undoubtedly orders in italian around them the disking progressed the noisy systematic turning of earth and cover crop warmth teased the vines to bud even as the breeze that shivered down from the mountains promised a night of chills in the middle of it all in the center of the ageless cycle was sophia the dynamo with the future at her fingertips the center of it he thought again maybe shed been there always she strode down the row up again then down her voice rising a kind of fascinating foreign music he didnt bother to curse didnt even bother to question when he felt that last lock snick open inside him hed been expecting that he was crazy about her he admitted gone over the line and sooner or later hed have to figure out what to do about it she jammed the phone back in her pocket blew at her bangs italian publicity branch she said to ty a few snags that needed picking loose sorry for the interruption now where she trailed off staring up at him what are you grinning at she demanded am i maybe its because youre not so hard to look at even in fastforward fastforwards the only speed that works right now anyway the party we need to make a statement and continue with the plans for the centennial the first galas midsummer we do this more intimate gathering to show unity responsibility and confidence she began ticking points off with her fingers the recall was initiated voluntarily and at considerable expense before it was a legal issue la signora and mr macmillan have traveled to italy personally to offer any assistance in the investigation however she continued and we need to get to the however soon giambelli is confident the problem is under control the family and thats what we have to emphasize remains gracious hospitable and involved with the community we show our polish while rene digs in the muck polish he studied the vines he reminded himself to check the overhead sprinklers again should they be needed for frost protection overnight if were going to be polished how come i have to fool around with a tv crew and walk around in the mud to illustrate the dedication and hard work that goes into every bottle of wine produced dont be cranky macmillan the last few days have been vicious id be less cranky if outsiders would stay out of the way does that include me he shifted his attention from the vines looked at her beautiful face doesnt seem to then why havent you come sneaking through my terrace doors in the night his lips quirked thought about it think harder when she leaned into him and he stepped back she asked what got a headache no an audience id as soon not advertise im sleeping with my cooperator sleeping with me has nothing to do with business her voice chilled several degrees just the kind of cold snap that wrought damage but if youre ashamed of it she shrugged turned and walked away he had to deal with the sting first then the innate reluctance for public scenes he caught up with her in five strides grabbed her arm im not ashamed of anything just because i like keeping my personal life private her sulky jerk back irritated him enough to tighten his grip and curl his fingers around her other arm theres enough gossip around here without adding to it if i cant keep my mind on my work i cant expect my men to ah the hell with it he lifted her to her toes pressed his mouth hard to hers there was a thrill in that she thought in that quick whip of strength and temper okay he demanded and dropped her flat on her feet again almost she ran her hands up his chest felt him tremble a thrill she thought in knowing you were physically outmatched but still had power she laid her lips on his teasing until his hand took a fistful of the back of her sweater until her hands were locked possessively around his neck and her own stomach muscles went loose that she murmured was just fine leave your terrace doors unlocked they have been i have to get back to work me too but they stayed as they were mouths a breath apart something was happening inside her a quivering but not that lustful shiver in the belly this was around her heart and more ache than pleasure fascinated she started to give in to it and the phone in her pocket began to ring again well she said a little unsteadily as she eased away round two ill see you later she dragged her phone out as she hurried away shed think about ty later think about a lot of things later sophia giambelli nonna im glad you caught me i tried to reach you earlier but she trailed off alerted by her grandmothers tone she stopped walking stood at the edge of the vineyard despite the wash of sunlight her skin chilled she was already running back as she broke the connection ty alarmed he whirled back caught her on the fly what is it what happened they found more two more bottles that were tainted damn it well we were expecting it we knew there had to be tampering theres more it could be worse nonna she and eli she had to stop organize her thoughts there was an old man he worked for nonnas grandfather started in the vineyard when he was just a boy he retired technically over a year ago and late last year he died he had a bad heart he was already following her already feeling the dread go on his granddaughter the one who found him says hed been drinking our merlot she came to my grandmother after the news of the recall broke theyre having his body exhumed his name was bernardo baptista sophia had all the details in neatly typed notes but she didnt need them she had every word in her head he was seventythree he died in december from an apparent heart attack while sitting in front of his own fire after a simple meal and several glasses of castello di giambelli merlot as margaret bowers had david thought grimly you said baptista had a weak heart hed had some minor heart problems and was suffering from a lingering head cold at the time of his death the cold adds another layer baptista was known for his nose hed worked wine for over sixty years but as he was ill it was unlikely hed have detected any problem with the wine his granddaughter swears he hadnt opened it before that night shed seen it that afternoon when shed visited him he kept it and a few other gifts from the company on display he was very proud of his association with giambelli the wine had been a gift according to his granddaughter yes from she doesnt know he was given a retirement party and as is customary giambelli presents an employee with parting gifts ive checked and that particular wine was not on the gift list hed have been presented with a cabernet a white and a sparkling first label however its not uncommon for an employee to be allowed to choose another selection or to be given wine by other members of the company how soon will they know if the wine caused his death pilar moved to the desk where sophia sat rubbed a hand over her daughters shoulder a matter of days we do what we can to track the wine david decided meanwhile we continue as we have been im going to suggest to la signora and eli that we hire an outside investigator ill work on a statement its best if we announce the new finds and giambellis part in implementing the recall and the testing i dont want to have to chase the release again let me know what i can do to help pilar told her get that guest list together honey you cant possibly want to hold a party now on the contrary the worry the sadness over an old man she remembered with affection hardened into determination well just twist the angle we hold a gala here for charity weve done it before and a great deal more for good causes i want people to remember that a thousand a plate all food wine and entertainment donated by giambellimacmillan with proceeds going to the homeless she scribbled notes as she spoke already drafting invitations releases responses in her head our family wants to help yours be safe and secure there are a lot of people who owe la signora more than a grand for a fancy meal if they need to be reminded of that ill see to it she cocked her head waiting for davids reaction youre the expert there he said after a moment its a shaky line to walk but in my opinion you have superior balance thanks meanwhile we have to pretend a cool disinterest in the press rene is generating therell be fallout from that and itll be personal whats personal to giambelli will naturally touch on business pilar slid into a discreet chair at a quiet table in the bar at the four seasons she was sure if shed mentioned her intentions to anyone shed have been told she was making a mistake she probably was but this was something she had to do something she should have done long ago she ordered a mineral water and prepared to wait she had no doubt rene would be late just as shed had no doubt rene would meet her she wouldnt have been able to resist making an entrance or having a confrontation with an enemy she perceived as weaker pilar nursed her drink and sat patiently she had a lot of experience with waiting rene didnt disappoint she swept in she was pilar supposed the kind of woman who liked to sweep into a room trailing furs though the weather was too warm for them she looked well fit rested glowing too often in the past pilar admitted shed studied this stunning and younger woman and felt inadequate in comparison a natural response she imagined but that didnt stop it from being foolish and useless it was easy to see why tony had been attracted easier to understand why hed been caught rene was no emptyheaded barbie but a toughminded female who would have known just how to get what she wanted and to keep it pilar rene thanks for meeting me oh how could i resist rene dumped her fur and slid into her chair youre looking a little strained champagne cocktail she told the waitress without glancing up pilars stomach didnt clench as it once would have youre not you had a few weeks in europe early this year it must have agreed with you tony and i had planned on an extended vacation he wouldnt have wanted me to sit home and brood rene angled herself crossed long silky legs that was always your job rene i was never the other woman and neither were you i was out of the picture long before you and tony met you were never out of the picture you and your family kept your hooks in tony and you made sure he never got what he deserved from giambelli now hes dead and youll pay me what you should have paid him she picked up her drink the minute it was served did you think id let you drag his name and mine by association through the dirt odd i was going to ask you the same thing pilar folded her hands on the table a small tidy move that gave her a moment to gather herself whatever else rene he was my daughters father i never wanted to see his name sullied i want more than i can tell you to know who killed him and why you did one way or the other by cutting him out of the company he wasnt meeting another woman that night he wouldnt have dared and i was enough for him the way you never were pilar thought about mentioning kris but knew it wasnt worth the effort no i was never enough for him i dont know who he was meeting that night or why but ill tell you what i think rene interrupted he had something on you your family and you had him killed maybe you even used that little twit margaret to do it and thats why shes dead now weariness replaced pity thats ridiculous even for you if this is the kind of thing youre saying to reporters that you intend to say on television youre opening yourself up to serious legal action please rene sipped again do you think i havent consulted an attorney to see what i can say and how i can say it you saw to it that tony was about to be cut off and that i came away with next to nothing i intend to get whats coming to me really and since were so coldblooded arent you afraid of retribution rene glanced toward a nearby table two men sat sipping water bodyguards round the clock dont even bother threatening me youve created quite a fantasy world and appear to be enjoying it im sorry about you and tony sincerely as you were perfect for each other i came here to ask you to be reasonable to show some decency toward my family and to think of tonys child before you speak to the press but thats a waste of time for both of us i thought you might have loved him but that was foolish of me so well try this she leaned in surprising rene with the sudden and very cold gleam in her eye do what you want say what you want in the end youll only look ridiculous and though its small of me ill enjoy that more i think than you will saying it or doing it keep being the strident trophy wife rene it suits you pilar said as she reached in her purse for money just as those rather gaudy earrings suit you a great deal more than they did me when tony gave them to me for our fifth wedding anniversary she tossed a twenty on the table between them id consider them and anything else of mine he helped himself to over the years full payment youll never get anything else out of me or giambelli she didnt sweep out shed leave the drama for rene instead she sauntered and felt good about it just as she felt good about dropping another bill on the table where renes bodyguards sat watch this rounds on me she told them and walked out laughing i put on a pretty good show steaming now pilar paced back and forth over the aubusson in helen moores living room and by god i think i came out on top but i was so angry this woman is gunning for my family and shes wearing my damn earrings while shes taking aim youve got documentation on the jewelry insurance records and so on we could take issue i hated those stupid earrings pilar gave a badnatured shrug tony gave them to me as a peace offering after one of his affairs i got the bill too of course damn it its hard swallowing how often i was a fool then spit it out sure you dont want a drink no im driving and should be heading back already pilar hissed out a breath sucked in another i had to blow off steam first or i might have given in to road rage and ended up in jail good thing you have a friend on the bench listen to me i think you did exactly right by facing off with her a lot of people would disagree but they dont know you like i do helen poured herself a couple of fingers of vodka over ice you had things to say and youve waited too long to say them it wont change anything with her maybe maybe not helen sat stretched out but the point is it changed something for you you took charge and personally id have paid good money to see you tell her off shell go on her little rant on her trashy talk show and very likely end up getting hammered by various audience members who take offense at her designer suit and ten pounds of jewelry wives she continued whove been cheated on left holding the bag for women like her god pilar theyll rip her to tattered shreds before its done and you can bet larry mann and his producers are counting on just that pilar stopped pacing i never thought of that honey rene foxx is just one of gods many custard pies she hit you in the face sure but so what time to wipe her off youre right i worry about the family about sophie even though its tabloid press its press and its going to embarrass her i wish i knew how to shut her up you could get a temporary restraining order im a judge i know these things helen said dryly you could file suit libel defamation and you might win probably would but as your lawyer and your friend my advice is to let her have her rope shell hang herself with it sooner or later the sooner the better were in an awful mess helen i know im sorry if she says things that hint we may have arranged for tony to be killed that margaret was involved the police have already questioned us about a relationship between margaret and tony it worries me margaret was the unlucky victim of some maniacs lunacy product tampering doesnt even have a target thats why its lunacy tony was deliberate one has nothing to do with the other and you shouldnt start linking them in your mind the press is linking them the press would link a monkey with an elephant if it upped the ratings and sold papers youre right there too ill tell you something helen over the anger under the worry i felt when i talked to rene i realized something i confronted her on this point because it mattered because it was important because i needed to take a stand sipping her drink helen nodded and and it made me realize that i never not once confronted her or any of the others the countless other women in and out of tonys life because it stopped he stopped being important i had no stand to take thats very sad she said quietly and not all his fault no it wasnt she went on before helen could do more than spit out an oath it takes two to make a marriage and i never pushed him to be one of those two in ours he started chipping at your selfesteem right from the beginning thats true pilar held out a hand took helens glass for a small and absent sip but a great deal that happened and didnt happen between us was as much my doing as his im not looking back with regret im looking back helen because im never never going to make those mistakes again okay fine helen took the vodka back toasted with it to the new giambelli woman since youre forging a new path come sit down and tell me all about your sex life now that you have one on a low sound of pleasure pilar stretched her arms to the ceiling since you ask im having an incredible exciting illicit affair with a younger man i hate you youre going to loathe me when i tell you he has this wonderful hard tireless body bitch laughing she dropped onto the arm of the sofa i had no idea really how a woman could get through life without having a clue what its like to be pressed down under a body like that tony was slim and rather delicate not much of a yardstick youre telling me she winced oh thats terrible thats sick no thats great james has a comfortable body sweet old bear helen said fondly but you wont mind if i enjoy a few thrills through your sexual adventure of course not what are friends for sophia was ready for a little sexual adventure of her own god knew she needed one shed worked herself to near exhaustion then worried herself over the line a swim after shed shut down for the day had helped then a turn in the whirlpool to loosen muscles tensed from that work and worry shed added one more phase to the water therapy with a long sumptuous bath full of oil and scent shed lit candles throughout the room fragrant with lemongrass and vanilla and jasmine in their shifting light she chose a nightgown of black silk with a low lacy bodice and thin straps why be subtle shed selected the wine from the private cellar a young frisky chardonnay she set it on ice to keep it cool curled into a chair to wait for ty and fell dead asleep it felt odd sneaking into a house where hed always been welcome odd and exciting hed had moments off and on during his life where hed imagined slipping into sophias bedroom in the dark hell what man wouldnt but actually doing it knowing shed be waiting for him was a lot better than any midnight fantasy he knew when he opened those doors theyd fall on each other like animals he could already taste her he could see the candlelight beating against the glass exotic sensual the turn of the knob in his hand barely made a click and rang like a trumpet in his head he braced for her closing the door at his back then he saw her curled in a ball of fatigue in the chair ah hell sophie look at you he crossed the room quietly crouched down and did what he rarely had the opportunity to do he studied her without her knowing it soft skin that hinted of rose and gold thick inky lashes and a full lush mouth perfectly shaped to meet a mans youre one gorgeous piece of work he murmured and you wore yourself out didnt you he glanced around the room noting the wine the candles the bed already turned down and heaped with pillows the thoughts just going to have to count for tonight come on baby he whispered as he slid his arms under her lets put you to bed she stirred shifted snuggled he decided there had to be a medal for a man who would tuck in a woman who looked smelled felt like this one and not crawl in eagerly after her hmmm ty good guess here you go he said laying her down go back to sleep her eyes fluttered open as he pulled the duvet up what where are you going for a long lonely walk in the cold dark night amused at both of them now he leaned down to brush a chaste kiss on her forehead followed by the requisite cold shower why she took his hand tucked it under her cheek its nice and warm in here baby youre beat ill take a rain check dont go please i dont want you to go ill be back he leaned down again intending to kiss her good night but her lips were soft and tasted of lazy invitation he sank into them and into her as she reached for him dont go she said again make love with me itll be like a dream it was dreamlike scents and shadows and sighs slow and tender where neither had expected it where neither would have asked he slid into bed with her floated with her on the easy stroke of her hands the gentle rise of her body and the sweetness of it drifted through him like starlight he found her mouth again and everything hed ever wanted her breathing thickened as sensations began to layer his hands were rough from work and smoothed over her like velvet his body was hard and covered hers like silk his mouth was firm and took from her with endless and devastating patience no wildness here no greed no brilliant flashes of urgency tonight was to savor and soothe to offer and welcome the first crest was like being lifted onto clouds she moaned under him one long low sound as her body bowed fluidly to his satisfaction and surrender she skimmed her fingers in his hair saw the shades of it shift in the light and shadow he did that she thought as she lost herself in him shifted and changed there were so many facets to him and here gently he was showing her yet another her fingers curled drawing him down until mouth met mouth and she could answer in the dark he could see the glint of the candlelight in her eyes gold dust splashed over rich pools the air was scented sweet she watched him and he watched her as he slipped inside her this is different he told her and touched his mouth to hers as she shook her head this is different yesterday i wanted you tonight i need you her vision blurred with tears her lips trembled with words she didnt know how to say and then she was so full of him she could only sob out his name and give chapter nineteen contents prev next what did a seventythreeyearold winemaker from italy have in common with a thirtysixyearold sales executive from california giambelli david thought it was the only link he could find between them except the manner of their deaths tests on the exhumed body of bernardo baptista had confirmed hed ingested a dangerous dosage of digitalis along with his merlot it couldnt be construed as a coincidence police on both sides of the atlantic were calling it homicide and the giambelli wine the murder weapon but why what motive linked margaret bowers and baptista he left his children tucked in their beds and after checking on the giambelli vineyards drove toward macmillan as the temperature had dropped he and paulie had turned on the sprinklers had walked the rows as water coated the vines and the thin skin of ice formed a protective shield against the threatening hard frost he knew paulie would stand watch through the night making certain there was a constant and steady flow of water predawn temperatures were forecast to hover near the critical twentyninedegree mark in an instant vines could be murdered as efficiently and as ruthlessly as people this at least he could control he could understand the brutality of nature and fight it how could a rational person understand coldblooded and seemingly random murder he could see the fine mist of water swirling over the macmillan vines the tiny drops going to glimmer in the cold light of the moon he pulled on his gloves grabbed his thermos of coffee and left the car to walk in the freezing damp he found tyler sitting on an overturned crate sipping from his own thermos thought you might be by in invitation ty banged the toe of his boot on another crate pull up a chair wheres your foreman sent him home just a bit ago no point in both of us losing a nights sleep the truth was ty liked sitting alone in the vineyard thinking his thoughts while the sprinklers hissed were doing all we can do ty shrugged scanning the rows that turned to a fairyland of sparkle under the lights systems running smooth david settled down uncapped his thermos like ty he wore a ski cap pulled over his head and a thick jacket that repelled both cold and damp paulie took the watch at giambelli frost alarms went off just after midnight we were already prepped for it this ones usual for the end of march its the ones that sneak in on you at the end of april into may i got it covered here if you want to get some sleep nobodys getting much of that lately did you know baptista not really my grandfather did la signoras taking it hard not that shell let it show he said not outside the family and not much inside for that matter but shes knocked back by it they all are the giambelli women product tampering its not just that thats the business end this is personal they went over for the funeral when he died i guess sophia thought of him as a kind of mascot said he used to sneak her candy poor old bastard david hunched forward holding the thermos cup of coffee between his knees ive been thinking on it trying to find the real connection probably a waste of time since im a corporate suit not a detective tyler studied him over his coffee from what ive seen so far youre not much of a timewaster and youre not so bad for a suit with a halflaugh david lifted his own coffee steam from it rose and merged with the mist coming from you thats a hell of a kudo damn right well from what i can tell margaret never even met baptista he was dead before she took over avanos accounts and started the travel to italy doesnt matter if they were random victims david shook his head it matters if theyre not yeah ive been thinking that too tyler got up to stretch his legs and they began to walk the rows together somewhere along the way he realized hed lost his resentment of david just as well he thought it took so much damn energy to hold a grudge and it was a waste of that energy and valuable time when both of them were on the same page in any case they both worked for giambelli both knew the family ty paused both knew avano he was dead before margaret uncorked the bottle still we dont know how long she had it hed have had plenty of reason to want her out of the way avano was an asshole tyler said flatly he was a prick on top of it but i cant see him as a killer too much thought too much effort and not enough guts did anybody like him sophie tyler shrugged and wished he could keep her out of his mind for more than ten minutes at a time at least she tried to and yeah actually plenty did and not just women it was the first time david had been offered a straight and uncensored picture of anthony avano because he had a good line put on a good show slick idve said grease through a goose slick but he got away with it as his own father did ty mused some people they just slither through life knocking over bystanders with you know impunity he was one of them la signora kept him on for pilar for sophia thats the family end on the business front well he knew how to keep the accounts happy yeah his expense account shows just how much he put into that effort so with margaret leapfrogging over him he was losing his opportunities to wine and dine on giambellis tab had to piss him off at the company at the family at her his style wouldve been to try to fuck her not kill her tyler stopped his breath streaming out as he looked over the rows scanned them line after line it was colder now his internal farmers gauge told him it was edging down toward thirty degrees im not a corporate suit but ive got to figure all this trouble is costing the company plenty in profit and in appearances which can translate to the same thing if somebody wanted to cause the family trouble they found an inventive and nasty way to do it between the recall immediate public panic and longterm consumer distrust in the label its going to cost millions its going to affect profit across the board and that includes whats yours yeah hed already faced the grim reality of that i figure sophias smart enough to take the edge off that longterm distrust shes going to have to be more than smart shell have to be brilliant she is thats what makes her a pain in the ass stuck on her are you david waved the comment away sorry too personal i was wondering if you were asking as a corporate suit an associate or as the guy whos dating her mother i was aiming toward friend tyler thought about it a moment then nodded okay that works for me i guess you could say ive been stuck on her on and off since i was twenty sophie at sixteen he remembered christ she was like a lightning bolt and she knew it irritated the hell out of me for a moment while the misting water sizzled and froze david was silent there was a girl when i was in college he was pleasantly surprised when tyler tugged a flask from his pocket and offered it marcella roux french legs up to her ears and this sexy little overbite an overbite ty settled into the image thats a good one oh yeah david drank letting the brandy punch into his system god marcella roux she scared the hell out of me a woman who looks like that who is like that just wears you out tyler took the flask drank me i figured if you had to be stuck on a woman which is an annoyance itself you might as well get stuck on one whos easy to be around and doesnt make you jumpy half the time i put considerable effort into that theory the last ten years didnt do me a damn bit of good i can beat that david said after a moment yeah i can beat it i had a wife and we had a couple kids good kids and i figured we were chasing the american dream well that went into the toilet but i had the kids maybe i screwed up there a few times but thats part of the job and my focus was on the goal give them a decent life be a good father women well being a good father doesnt mean being a monk but you keep that area down on the list of priorities no serious relationships not again no sir who needs it then pilar opens the door and shes holding flowers there are all kinds of lightning bolts maybe they still fry your brain they walked the rows in the coldest hour before dawn while the sprinklers hissed and the vines glittered iced silver and safe two hundred and fifty guests a sevencourse dinner each with appropriate wines followed by a concert in the ballroom and ending with dancing it had been a feat to pull off and sophia gave her mother full marks for helping to perfect each detail she added a pat on the back for herself for carefully salting the guests with recognizable names and faces from all over the globe the un she thought as she sat with every appearance of serenity through the aria by the italian soprano had nothing on the giambellis the quarter million raised for charity would not only do good work it was damn good pr particularly good since all members of the family were in attendance including her greatuncle the priest whod agreed to make the trip after a personal and insistent call from his sister unity solidarity responsibility and tradition those were the key words she was pounding into the media and with words went images the gracious villa opening its doors for the sake of charity the family four generations bound together by blood and wine and one mans vision oh yes she was using cezare giambelli the simple farmer whod built an empire on sweat and dreams it was irresistible and while she didnt expect it to turn the tide of adversity it had stemmed it the only irritant in the evening was kris drake missed a step there sophia decided shed issued an invitation to jeremy demorney quite purposefully inviting a handful of important competitors illustrated giambellis openness and again a sense of community it hadnt occurred to her jerry would bring a former giambelli employee as his date should have she reminded herself it was clever sneaky and slyly amusing on his part and just like him on top of that she had to give kris credit for sheer balls brass ones scored off me this round she admitted but felt shed got back her own by being flawlessly gracious to both of them youre not paying attention tyler gave her a quick elbow jab if i have to you have to she leaned toward him slightly i hear every note and i can write mental copy at the same time two different parts of the brain your brain has too many parts how long does this last the pure rich notes throbbed on the air shes magnificent and nearly finished shes singing of tragedy of heartbreak i thought it was supposed to be about love same thing he glanced toward her saw the sheen of tears the single drop that spilled from those dark deep eyes and clung perfectly to her lashes are those real or for the crowd youre such a peasant quiet she linked her fingers with his allowed herself to think of nothing to feel nothing but the music for the final moments when the last note shimmered into silence she rose along with the others into thunderous applause can we get out of here for five minutes now ty whispered in her ear worse than a peasant a barbarian brava she called out you go ahead she added under her breath i need to play hostess you should grab uncle james who looks as miserable as you do go out and have a drink and a cigar and be men if you dont think it took a man to sit here and stay awake during nearly an hour of opera baby you better think again she watched him escape then moved forward hands extended to the diva signora bellissima pilar did her duty as well but her mind wasnt full of music or publicity copy it was reeling with details and timing the chairs had to be removed quickly and smoothly to clear the ballroom for dancing the terrace doors would be flung open at precisely the right minute and the orchestra set up there would begin to play but not before the diva had been allowed her moment of adulation she waited while tereza and eli presented the singer with roses then signaled david helen and a few handchosen friends to add their congratulations and praise as others followed suit she nodded at the waiting staff then frowned when she saw her aunt francesca still sitting and obviously sound asleep sedated herself again pilar thought winding her way through guests don she squeezed her cousins arm smiling an apology to the couple hed been speaking with your mother isnt well she said quietly could you help me take her to her room sure im sorry pilar he continued as they moved aside i shouldve kept a closer eye on her he scanned the crowd looking for his wife i thought gina was with her its all right zia francesca pilar leaned down spoke quietly soothingly in italian as she and don helped the woman to her feet ma che vuoi she seemed dazed as she slapped at pilars hand lasciame in pace were just going to take you to bed mama don took a firmer grip youre tired si si she stopped struggling vorrei del vino youve already had enough wine don told her but pilar shook her head at him ill bring you some once youre in your room youre a good girl pilar docile as a lamb francesca shuffled out of the ballroom so much sweeter of nature than gina don should have married you were cousins zia francesca pilar reminded her you are oh of course my mind is muddled traveling is very stressful i know youll feel better when youre in your nightgown and in bed mindful of the time pilar rang for a maid as soon as theyd carted francesca to her room though she was sorry for it she dumped the matter on don and rushed back to take her place in the ballroom problem sophia asked her aunt francesca ah thats always fun well having a priest in the family should help cancel out the odd drunk are we ready we are pilar dimmed the lights at the signal the terrace doors were opened and music poured in as tereza and eli led the first dance sophia slid an arm around her mothers waist perfect wonderful job god bless us everyone she blew out a breath i could use a drink myself when this is over well kill a bottle of champagne apiece right now she gave pilar a little nudge dance it looked like socializing but it was work putting on the confident front answering questions some subtle some not on the situation from interested guests and the invited press expressing sorrow and outrage both sincerely felt while getting the intended message across giambellimacmillan was alive and well and making wine sophia lovely lovely event thank you mrs elliot im so glad you could attend wouldnt have missed it you know blake and i are very active on behalf of the homeless our restaurant contributes generously to the shelters and your restaurant sophia thought as she made appropriate noises canceled its standing order on all giambelli and macmillan labels at the first sign of trouble perhaps at some point your business and ours could work together on a fundraiser food and wine after all the perfect marriage mmm well youve known my family since before i was born to establish intimacy pilar took the womans arm walked with her away from the music i hope you know how much we value that association and that friendship blake and i have nothing but the greatest respect for your grandmother and for eli we couldnt be more sorry about your recent troubles when friends have troubles they look to other friends for support on a personal level you have it but business is business sophia we have to protect our clientele as do we giambelli stands by its product any of us at any time can be the victim of tampering and sabotage if we and those who do business with us allow the perpetrators of that to win it only opens others up to the same risk be that as it may sophia until were assured the giambelli label is clean we cant and wont serve it im sorry for it and im impressed with the way youre handling your difficulties blake and i wouldnt be here tonight if we didnt support you and your family on a personal level our patrons expect fine food well served when they come to us not to gamble on a glass of wine that may be tainted four bottles out of how many thousands sophia began one is too many im sorry dear but thats the reality excuse me sophia marched directly to a waiter took a glass of red and after turning a slow circle in case anyone was watching drank deeply you look a little stressed kris sidled up beside her chose a glass of champagne must come from actually having to work for a living youre mistaken her voice might have frosted the air between them i dont work for a living but for love spoken like a princess pleased with herself kris sipped her wine as far as she was concerned she had one function to fulfill that evening to dig under sophias skin isnt that what tony used to call you his princess yes sophia braced for the rush of grief but it never came that itself was a sorrow he never understood me apparently neither do you oh i understand you and your family youre in trouble with tony gone and you and farm boy in charge your companys lost the edge now youre flaunting yourself in your evening gowns and your heirloom pearls to try to drum up business and cover up mistakes really youre no different from the guy on the corner panhandling at least hes honest about it carefully deliberately sophia set her wine aside and edged forward before she could speak jerry strode over laid a hand on kriss arm kris there was warning in his tone this is inappropriate sophia im sorry i dont need anyone to apologize for me kris tossed back her hair im not on company time here but my own im not interested in apologies from either of you youre a guest in my home and as long as you behave as such youll be treated as a guest if you insult me here or any of my family ill have you removed just as i had you removed from my offices dont delude yourself into thinking ill hesitate to cause a scene kris pursed her lips in a kind of kiss wouldnt that play nicely in the press dare me sophia spat back then well see which one of us spins it best tomorrow either way kris youll be out on your ass and your new boss might not care for that right jerry sophia how lovely you look helen hugged an arm around sophias shoulders squeezing hard excuse us wont you she said it brightly while she pulled sophia away you want to turn down the kill lights in your eyes honey youre scaring the guests id like to fry kris with them and jerry with her not worth it sweetie i know it i know it she wouldnt have gotten to me if i hadnt already been steaming over anne elliot lets just take a little walk to the powder room while you calm down remind yourself youve put on a terrific show here youve made an impression too little for too much sophie youre trembling im just angry just angry she held it in as they walked down to the family level and scared she admitted when she slipped into a powder room with helen aunt helen i poured money into this event money given the situation i should have been more careful with the elliots arent going to budge then kris drops down like a crow smelling fresh kill shes just one more of tonys castoffs and not worth your energy or your time she knows the way i think there wasnt room to pace off the heat so sophia simply stood and simmered in it the way i work i shouldve found a way to keep her in the company a way to control her stop it you cant take on the blame for her anyone can see shes viciously jealous of you i know things are shaky now but i talked with a number of people tonight whore solidly behind you who are appalled by what happened yes and some of them may even be swayed to put their money where their sentiments are but there are more too many more who wont i had reports from the wait staff that a number of guests are avoiding the wine or watching others drink it and live first its horrible and such a strain on nonna im starting to see it and that worries me sophie when a companys been in business a hundred years it has crises this is just one of them weve never had anything like this were losing accounts aunt helen you know it there are jokes youve heard them having trouble with your wife dont see a lawyer give her a bottle of giambelli honey im a lawyer weve been jokes for centuries but she stroked sophias hair she hadnt realized how much the child worried hadnt realized it went so deep youre taking too much of this on yourself its my job to maintain the image not only as the next generation but as an executive if i cant swing this i know i put a lot of eggs in tonights basket and i hate seeing some of them broken some helen reminded her far from all but im not getting the message out were the victims here why cant people see that we were attacked were still being attacked financially emotionally legally the police for gods sake there are rumors drifting around that margaret and my father were in some sort of conspiracy together and mama knew just renes blathering yes but if the police start taking it seriously start questioning her as a suspect i dont know what well do thats not going to happen oh aunt helen it could with rene streaming around from talk show to tabloid fanning the flames and no sign of those responsible being caught mamas top of the list right along with me shed thought of it hadnt been able to help it but hearing it said so bluntly brought a chill to helens skin now you listen no one is going to accuse you or your mother of anything the police may look but only to eliminate if they step closer than that theyll have to go through james through me even linc she drew sophia into a hug dont you worry about that she patted sophias back and stared at her own face in the mirror the encouraging smile was gone and concern had taken its place she was grateful attorneyclient privilege with tereza prevented her from adding to the girls fears only that morning all financial records of the company had been subpoenaed sophia freshened her lipstick powdered her nose and squared her shoulders no one would have seen the fear or despair now she glittered and glowed her laugh warm and careless as she joined the guests she flirted she danced and continued to campaign her spirits lifted considerably when she charmed and cajoled another major account into lifting its ban on the giambelli label pleased with herself she took a short break to harass linc are you still hanging around this loser she asked andrea well he cries every time i try to dump him i do not i just look really forlorn i was about to come looking for you he told sophia were going to take off so early the string quartet isnt really my scene im just here because mom bribed me with pound cake but i wanted to see you before we headed out to ask how youre holding up oh fine he tapped her nose its okay andrea knows the score its rough she admitted nonnas having a hard time accepting what happened to signore baptista he meant a lot to her i guess were all feeling squeezed between the various investigations in fact i whined all over your mom a little bit ago shes used to it you know you can call me and whine anytime i know she kissed lincs cheek youre not really so bad and you have good taste in doctors go escape she stepped aside come back she added to andrea and began another circuit of the room there you are tyler caught her pulled her toward a corner i cant take much more of this im deserting the field now buck up she measured the crowd beginning to thin she judged but not by much that was a good sign hold out another hour and ill make it worth your while my whiles worth quite a bit ill bear that in mind go charm betina renaldi shes old influential and very susceptible to rugged young men with tight butts boy are you going to owe me just ask her to dance and tell her how much we value her patronage if she pinches my tight butt im taking it out on you mmm i look forward to it she circled just in time to spot an argument brewing between don and gina quickly she cut across the ballroom lets not do this here in what would be taken as an affectionate gesture she stepped between them and linked arms we dont need to add to the gossip mill you think you can tell me how to behave gina would have wrenched her arm free if sophia hadnt borne down you whose father was a gigolo whose family has no honor careful gina careful that family keeps you in diapers lets go outside you go to hell she rammed sophia hard against don you and all of you her voice spiked causing several heads to turn sophia managed to drag her to the doorway of the ballroom before she broke free if you cause a scene here sophia said itll cost you as much as the rest of us your children are giambelli remember it ginas lip quivered but she lowered her voice you remember it you both remember it and that what i do i do for them don damn it go after her calm her down i cant she wont listen he moved behind the doors took out a handkerchief to wipe his sweaty brow shes pregnant again oh torn between relief and annoyance sophia patted his arm congratulations i didnt want another child she knew we fought about it then she tells me tonight as were dressing and the children are screaming and my heads bursting she expects me to be thrilled and when im not she rips at me he shoved the cloth back in his pocket im sorry really very sorry but impressions tonight are vital whether or not youre happy about this you have to fix it shes pregnant vulnerable and her hormones are raging added to that she didnt get in that condition by herself you need to go to her i cant he said again she wont speak to me now i was upset all during the evening she sulked or reminded me it was gods will a blessing i needed to get away from her five precious minutes away from that nagging so i slipped out to make a phone call i called theres another woman oh perfect she didnt bother to curse isnt that just perfect i didnt know gina followed me didnt know shed overheard she waited until i was back inside to confront me to accuse to claw no she wont speak to me now well you both picked your moment please i know what i have to do and i will promise me you wont tell zia tereza of this do you think id go running to nonna like a tattletale sophie i didnt mean it that way relieved at her angry claim not to be a gossip he took her hands ill fix it i will if you could just go after gina now convince her to behave to be patient not to do anything rash already with the investigation im under such pressure this isnt about you donato she pulled her hands away youre just one more man who couldnt keep his dick in his pants but it is about giambelli so ill do what i can with gina for once she actually has my sympathy and you will fix it youll break it off with the other woman and deal with your marriage and your children i love her sophie you understand what it is to be in love i understand you have three children and another on the way youll be responsible to your family donato youll be a man or ill personally see you pay for it capisce you said you wouldnt go to la signora i trusted you la signora isnt the only giambelli woman who knows how to deal with cheats and liars or cowards cacasotto he went white youre too hard try me and youll see just how hard now be smart go back in and smile announce to your aunt that youre about to bring another giambelli into the world and stay away from me until i can stand the sight of you again she left him there quivering with rage hard she thought maybe and maybe part of her rage had been directed at her father another cheat another liar another father who ignored his responsibilities marriage she thought meant nothing to some no more than a game whose rules were broken for the thrill of it she hurried through the family wing but found no sign of gina idiot woman she decided and was unsure who she disliked more at the moment gina or donato she called out quietly peeked into the nursery where the children and the young woman hired to tend them for the evening slept thinking gina might have taken her rage outside she stepped out on the terrace music from the quartet drifted out into the night she wished she could drift herself just leave it all to work itself out enraged wives straying husbands cops and lawyers and faceless enemies she was tired of it all of it she wanted ty she wanted to dance with him with her head on his shoulder and all her worries in someone elses brain for a few hours instead she ordered herself to go back and do what needed to be done she heard a faint sound from the room behind her and started to turn gina a vicious shove sent her flying back her heels skidded lost purchase on the terrace floor she caught a blur of movement as she fell and when her head hit the stone of the rail she saw nothing but an explosion of light chapter twenty contents prev next tyler decided to finish off his evening by dancing with tereza she felt small but reassuringly sturdy in her beaded gown her hand was dry and cool in his why arent you exhausted he asked her i will be when the last guest leaves over her head he scanned the room too many people still left he thought and it was already after midnight we could start booting them out unfailingly gracious i like that about you when he grinned down at her she studied him carefully none of this means anything to you of course it does the vineyards not the vineyards tyler she gestured toward the terrace doors the lights the music this the fancy clothes the inane chatter the wash of gilt not a damn thing but you come for your grandfather for my grandfather and for you la signora for the family if it didnt matter id have taken a hike last year when you reorganized my life you havent quite forgiven me for that she chuckled not quite but he shifted her hand and in a rare gallant gesture kissed her knuckles if youd walked away id have found a way to bring you back id have made you sorry but id have brought you back youre needed here im going to tell you something because your grandfather wont is he sick tyler missed a step as he turned his head to seek out eli in the crowd look at me at me she said with quiet intensity id rather he didnt know what were speaking of has he seen a doctor whats wrong with him he is sick but in his heart your father called him what does he want money no he knows hell get no more money she would have kept it to herself she detested passing burdens but the boy shed decided after much thought had a right to know a right to defend his own even against his own hes outraged the recent problems the scandals are interfering with his social calendar and causing him he claims considerable embarrassment apparently the police have asked questions about him in the course of their investigation he blames eli he wont call again ill take care of it i know you will youre a good boy tyler he looked down at her again forced a smile am i yes good enough i wouldnt shift this burden to you but eli has a soft heart this has bruised it i dont have the soft heart soft enough she lifted her hand from his shoulder to his cheek i depend on you when his face registered surprise she continued does hearing that surprise you or frighten you maybe both adjust it was an order smoothly given as she stepped back from him now youre dismissed go find sophia and lure her away shes not easily lured i imagine you can handle her there arent many who can i havent seen her for some time now go find her take her mind off work for a few hours and that tyler mused was akin to a blessing he wasnt sure that he wanted it didnt know what he planned to do with it for the moment he was going to tuck it away and follow the spirit of terezas order find sophia and escape she wasnt in the ballroom or on the terrace he avoided asking people if theyd seen her as that smacked too close to an eager idiot trying to find his date which he supposed was pretty much the case regardless he prowled the wing poking into a reception room where some of the guests had gathered to sit and chat he found the moores there with james puffing on a cigar and helen sipping tea while he discoursed on some ancient landmark case linc and his date who he thought had left an hour before were either held hostage or enthralled on the sofa ty come on in have a cigar no thanks im just la signora asked me to find sophia havent seen her for a while wow look at the time linc surged to his feet dragging andrea to hers weve really got to go she mightve gone downstairs ty helen offered to freshen up or catch her breath yeah right ill check he started down and ran into pilar on the steps your mothers wondering where sophia is isnt she upstairs distracted pilar shook back her hair she wanted nothing more than ten minutes of fresh air and a tall glass of water i havent seen her for oh half an hour at least i was just down trying to talk to gina through the door of her room shes locked herself in fighting with don apparently shes throwing things around weeping hysterically and of course shes woken the children theyre shrieking thanks for the tip ill make sure to avoid that part of the house why dont you check her room i got enough out of gina to know sophia tried to referee she might be in there cooling off is david in the ballroom didnt see him ty said as he walked by hes probably around somewhere he turned toward sophias room if he found her he thought it might be a fine idea to lock the doors and take her mind off work as ordered hed been wondering all night just what she had on under that red dress he knocked lightly eased the door open the room was dark and cold with a shake of his head he started across to close the terrace doors youre going to freeze your excellent ass off in here sophie he muttered and heard a quiet moan puzzled he stepped out and saw her in the sprinkle of light that dripped down from the ballroom she was sprawled on the terrace braced on one elbow as she tried to shift he leaped forward dropped down on his knees beside her easy baby whatd you do take a spill i dont know i ty yeah jesus youre freezing come on lets get you inside im okay just a little jumbled let me get my head clear inside you took a knock soph youre bleeding im she touched her fingers to the pump of pain on her forehead then stared dully at the red smear she took away bleeding she managed as her lids closed again oh no no you dont he shifted his grip no passing out his heart staggered in his chest as he lifted her her face was sheetwhite her eyes glazed and the scrape on her forehead was oozing blood thats what you get for wearing those skinny heels i dont know how women walk on them without breaking their ankles he kept talking to calm them both as he laid her on the bed and turned back to shut the terrace doors lets warm you up some and well take a look at the damage ty she gripped his hand as he pulled a throw over her despite the pain her mind was clearing now i didnt fall somebody pushed me pushed you im going to turn on this light so i can see where youre hurt she turned her head away from the glare i think im hurt everywhere quiet now just lie still his hands were gentle even as his temper raged the head wound was nasty a vicious scrape already swelling and full of grit her arm was scraped as well just below the shoulder im going to get you out of this dress sorry handsome i have a headache appreciating her attempt at humor he eased her forward searching for a zipper buttons hooks something honey how the hell does this thing work under the left arm every inch of her was beginning to ache little zipper then you sort of peel it off the rest of the way ive been wondering what you had on under here he babbled as he undressed her he imagined there was a name for the strapless deal that cinched at her waist and curved up high at the nips hed have just called it stupendous stockings came up to her thighs and were hooked by little garters shaped like roses while he appreciated the architecture of the underwear he was more relieved that there wasnt extensive damage to the woman in it her right knee was a little scraped up and the sheer silky stocking was a ruin someone he promised himself was going to pay and pay dearly for putting marks on her but that would have to wait not so bad see his voice was easy as he helped her sit up a little to see for herself looks like you fell on your right side a little bruise coming up on your hip there scraped knee and shoulder your head took the worst of it so thats lucky considering thats a really amusing way to tell me i have a hard head ty i didnt fall i was pushed i know well get to that after i clean you up some when he rose she just lay back get me a bottle of aspirin while youre in there i dont think you should take anything before you get to the hospital im not going to the hospital for a couple of scrapes and bumps she heard water hitting the sink in the adjoining bath if you try to make me ill cry and go very female and make you feel horrible believe me im ready to make someone feel horrible and youre in the line of fire dont use my good washcloths therere some everyday ones in the linen closet and antiseptic and aspirin shut up sophie she tugged the blanket higher its cold in here he came back in carrying her murano glass bowl one of her best guest towels already wet slopping inside and a glass of water what did you do with the potpourri that was in that dish dont worry about it come on lets play doctor aspirin im begging you he pulled a bottle out of his pocket opened it and shook out two please lets not be stingy i want four he let her take them and began cleaning the head wound it took effort to keep his hands steady to draw breath smoothly who pushed you i dont know id come down looking for gina she and don had a fight yeah i heard about it i couldnt find her came in here i wanted a minute to myself and some air so i went out on the terrace i heard something behind me started to turn around the next thing i know im skidding couldnt catch my balance then lights out how bads my face nothing bad about your face thats part of your problem youre going to have a knot up here right along the hairline cuts not deep just a goodsized shallow scrape you have any impression who pushed you man woman no it was fast and it was dark i guess it might have been gina or don for that matter they were both furious with me thats what happens when you get in the middle if it was either of them theyre going to look a whole lot worse than you before im finished the quick little leap of her heart made her feel foolish and went a long way to cooling her own bubbling temper my hero but i dont know if it was either of them could just as easily have been someone whod come in to poke around in my room then gave me a shove so i wouldnt catch them well take a look around see if anythings missing or messed with hold your breath what hold your breath he repeated then watched her face contort in pain as he used the peroxide hed had in his other pocket festa di cazzo coglioni mostro a minute ago i was a hero sympathetically he blew on the sting better in a minute lets deal with the rest va via would you mind cursing at me in english i said go away dont touch me come on be a big brave girl ill give you a lollipop after he yanked the blanket aside dealt quickly ruthlessly with the other scrapes im going to put this gunk on them he pulled out a tube of antiseptic cream bandage them up hows your vision her breath was puffing from the exertion of trying to fight him off and he wasnt even winded it killed her i can see you well enough you sadist youre enjoying this it does have certain side benefits name the first five presidents of the united states sneezy dopey moe larry and curly christ was it any wonder hed fallen for her close enough probably dont have a concussion there you go baby he kissed her sulking lips gently all done i want my lollipop you bet but he just leaned down held on scared me he murmured against her cheek scared hell out of me sophie hearing that knowing that had her heart making that same little leap its okay now youre not really a bastard still hurting no how do you say liar in italian never mind it feels better when youre holding me thanks no charge where do you keep your glittery things jewelry costume is in the jewelry armoire the real things are in my safe you think i surprised a thief easy enough to find out he sat up then rose to turn on the rest of the lights they saw it at the same time despite the lingering pain sophia shot straight out of bed there was as much anger as terror in her belly as she read the message scrawled in red on her mirror bitch kris damn it thats her style if she thinks im going to let her get away with she trailed off as terror overwhelmed every other feeling number three mama nonna put something on tyler ordered and lock the doors ill check it out no you wont she was already marching to her closet well check it out nobody pushes me around she said as she dragged on a sweater and pants nobody they found similar messages on the bureau mirrors in pilars and terezas rooms but they didnt find kris drake there must be something else we can do sophia wiped furiously at the letters smearing her mirror the local police had responded taken statements examined the vandalism and had told her nothing she hadnt concluded for herself someone had entered each bedroom left an ugly little message written in red lipstick on the glass and had knocked her down theres nothing else we can do tonight tyler took her wrist drew her hand down ill take care of that it was addressed to me but she threw the rag down in disgust the cops are going to question her sophie and im sure shell tell them she waltzed in here scrawled this love note and knocked me down she let out a sound of frustration then clamped her teeth down on it doesnt matter the police may not be able to prove she did this but i know she did and sooner or later ill make her pay for it and ill hold your coat in the meantime go to bed i cant sleep now he took her hand led her to the bed she was still in her clothes and he wore his shirt and tuxedo pants he eased onto the bed with her pulled up the blanket try she lay still a moment amazed when he made no move to touch her to seduce to take he reached over turned out the light ty hmmm it doesnt hurt as much when you hold me good go to sleep and settling her head on his shoulder she was able to do as he asked claremont stretched back in his chair as maguire read the incident report so what do you think the youngest ms giambelli gets knocked down banged up a little all three of them receive an unpleasant message that smudges up their mirrors on the surface she said tossing the paperwork back on his desk looks like a prank a female one and under the surface sophia g wasnt hurt badly but if it had been her grandmother who walked in at the wrong time it could have been a lot more serious old bones break easier and from the timeline the locals were able to put together she was lying out there in the night chill for at least fifteen twenty minutes very unpleasant mightve been longer if our young hunk hadnt gone hunting for her so we have a mean prank and somebody whos doing whatevers handy to needle them and from the youngest giambellis statement kristin drake fits the bill shes denied it vehemently maguire countered but they both knew she was playing devils advocate nobody can place her in that part of the house during the evening no handy fingerprints to tie her in sophia gs lying about it mistaken i dont think so maguire pursed her lips no point in lying about it and she doesnt strike me as a woman who does anything without a point careful too she wouldnt accuse unless she was sure the drake woman took a slap at her it may be as simple as that or it may be a lot more it bothers me if we have somebody whos gone to the time trouble the risk to taint wine somebody who was willing to kill why would that person bother with something as petty as a message on a mirror we dont know its the same person links clicking onto links thats the way he saw it hypothetically using a vendetta against the giambellis to connect to kick at them then gonna throw a big party are you want to pretend everythings getting back to normal take this maybe drakes a connection she worked for the company she had an affair with avano if shes pissed enough tove caused the trouble at the party she mightve been pissed enough to put a couple bullets in a lover exlover according to her statement she frowned frankly partner she was a dead end before and i dont see this little sneak attack pinning her to the avano homicide different styles its interesting though isnt it the giambellis go for years decades without any substantial trouble in the past few months theyve had nothing but its interesting tyler paced outside with the phone the house seemed too small when he was talking to his father california seemed too small when he was talking to his father not that he was doing any talking at the moment just listening to the usual gripes and complaints he let them run through his head the country club was rife with gossip and black humor involving him his current wife ty had actually lost track of how many mrs macmillans thered been by this time had been humiliated at the spa expected invitations for various social functions had not been forthcoming something had to be done about it and quickly it was elis responsibility to keep the family name above reproach which he had obviously ignored by marrying the italian woman in the first place but be that as it may it was essential it was imperative that the macmillan name label and company be severed from giambelli he expected tyler to use all his influence before it was too late eli was old and obviously long past the time for retirement finished tyler didnt wait for his fathers assent or objection because heres how its going to be you have any complaints or comments you direct them to me if you call and harass granddad again ill do whatever i can legally to revoke that trust fund youve been living off of for the last thirty years you have no right to no you have no right you never worked a day for this company any more than you and my mother worked a day to be parents until hes ready to step aside eli macmillan runs this show and when hes ready to step aside ill run it believe me i wont be as patient as hes been you cause him one more moments grief and well have more than a phone conversation about it are you threatening me do you plan to send someone after me like tony avano no i know how to hit you where it hurts ill see to it all your major credit cards are canceled remember youre not dealing with an old man now dont fuck with me he jabbed the off button considered heaving the phone then spotted sophia standing at the edge of the patio im sorry i didnt mean to eavesdrop if hed looked angry she could have brushed it off but he looked miserable she knew how well she knew what it was like so she went to him cupped his face in her hands sorry she said again no big deal just a conversation with dear old dad disgusted he tossed the phone onto the patio table what do you need i heard the weather report so i know theres a frost warning tonight i wondered if you wanted any company out there no thanks i can handle it he lifted her bangs studied the healing wound very attractive those things always look worse a few days later but i dont feel stiff when i wake up in the morning anymore ty tell me whats wrong nothing i handled it yes yes you can handle anything me too were so annoying she gave his shoulders a squeeze i told you where it hurt now you tell me he started to shrug her off then realized he didnt want to my father hes sniping at my grandfather about all the bad press all the police business interfering with his tennis lessons or something i told him to lay off will he if he doesnt im going to talk to helen about putting some leaks in his trust fund thatll shut him up quick enough the son of a bitch the son of a bitch never did a days work in his life worse never stirred himself up to show an ounce of gratitude for what he was given just takes and takes then whines if he runs into a bump no wonder he and your father got along so well he caught himself cursed goddamn it sophie sorry no dont be youre right there was a bond here she thought that neither of them had acknowledged before perhaps this was the time ty have you ever considered how lucky we are you and i that certain genes skipped a generation dont close off she said before he could draw away youre so like eli she combed her fingers through his hair shed come to love the way she could tease out the reds tough guy she said as she touched her lips to his cheek solid as a rock dont let the weak space between you and eli cut at you as his temper deflated he laid his forehead lightly on hers i never needed him my father not he thought the way you needed yours never wanted him and i needed wanted too much from mine for too long thats part of what made us what we are i like who we are i guess youre not halfbad considering he gave her arms a casual caress thanks he leaned down kissed the top of her head i wouldnt mind a little company on frost watch tonight ill bring the coffee chapter twentyone contents prev next tiny flowering buds bursting open as the lengthening days bathed them in sunlight covered the vines the earth was turned opened to hold the promise of new plantings trees held their spring leaves in tight fists of stingy green but here and there sprouts brave and young speared out of the ground in the woods nests were heavy with eggs and mother ducks guarded their newly hatched babies while they swam in the stream april tereza thought meant rebirth and work and hope that winter was over at last the canada geese are about to hatch eli told her as they took their morning walk in the cool and quiet mist she nodded her father had used that same natural barometer to judge the timing of the years harvest she had learned to watch the sky the birds the ground as much as she watched the vines itll be a good year we had plenty of winter rain still a couple weeks yet to worry about frosts but i think weve timed the new plantings well she looked over the rise of land to where the ground was well plowed shed given fifty acres for the new plantings vines of european origin grafted to rootstock native to america theyd chosen prime varieties cabernet sauvignon merlot chenin blanc and consulting with tyler had done much the same on macmillan ground in five years perhaps four well see them bear fruit she had learned too to look from the moment to the future in one sweeping glance cycle would always spin into cycle well have been together a quarter of a century eli when what we plant now comes home to us tereza he took her shoulders turned her to face him and she felt a shiver of alarm this is my last harvest eli im not going to die to reassure he ran his hands down her arms i want to retire ive been thinking of it seriously thinking of it since you and i traveled to italy weve let ourselves become too rooted here and there he said gesturing toward macmillan land and at the castello lets do this last planting you and i and let our children harvest its time we talked of this five years or so we said before we stepped aside a gradual process i know but these last months have reminded me how quickly a life even a way of life can end there are places i want to see before my times up i want to see them with you im tired tereza of living my life to the demands of each season my life the whole of it has been giambelli tereza stepped away from him touched a delicate white blossom how can i turn from it now when its wounded eli how can we pass something to our children thats blighted because we trust them because we believe in them because tereza theyve earned the chance i dont know what to say to this think about it theres plenty of time before the harvest ive thought i dont want to give ty what hes earned what he deserves in my will i want to give it to him while im alive theres been enough death this year he looked over the buds toward the new plantings its time to let things grow so she turned from the vines toward him a tall man weathered by time by sun by wind with an old and faithful dog at his side i dont know if i can give you what youre asking me but ill promise to think about it effervescence is the essential ingredient in a sparkling wine pilar led a winery tour through a favorite phase the creation of champagne but the first stage is to make the still wine these she pointed at the racked bottles in the cellars are aged for several months then blended we call the blend cuvee from the french where its believed the process has its origin were grateful to that very fortunate monk dom perignon for making the discovery and being the first to as he called it drink stars if its just wine what makes it bubble the second fermentation which dom perignon discovered in the seventeenth century her answer was smooth and practiced questions tossed out by groups no longer spooked her or made her scramble for answers dressed in a trim suit and low heels she stepped to the side as she spoke so her group could take a closer look at the racked wine it was initially thought to be a problem she continued wine bottled in fall popping their corks or what was in those days cotton wadding in the spring very troublesome and in particular in the champagne district of france the benedictine the cellar master at the abbey in hautvillers applied himself to this problem he ordered thicker stoppers but this caused the bottles themselves to break determined he ordered stronger bottles both the stoppers and the bottles held and the monk was able to sample the refermented wine it was the first champagne toast she paused to give the group an opportunity to shuffle around the racks voices echoed in the cellars so she waited until they subsided today a little flutter of anxiety rippled through her when david joined her group today we create champagne quite purposely though for the best we follow the traditional methods developed centuries ago in that french abbey using methode champenoise the winemaker bottles the young blended wines a small quantity of yeast and sugar is added to each bottle then the bottle is capped as you see here she took the sample bottle to pass among the tour the additive triggers the second fermentation which we call again in the french prise de mousse the bubbles result from the conversion of sugar into alcohol capped the bubbles cant escape into the air these bottles are then aged from two to four years theres gunk in here someone commented the sample bottle demonstrates sedimentation and particle separation this is a natural process during this second aging and fermentation the bottles are stored neck down on these inclined racks and are lifted out and twisted every day for months by hand pilar smiled at the woman who frowned at the wall of bottles yes as youve seen through the tour giambellimacmillan believes every bottle of wine offered to the consumer requires the art the science and the labor necessary to earn the label this turning process is called riddling or in french remuage and accelerates the particle separation so that in a matter of months the wine is clear when it is the bottles are racked upside down to keep the particles in the neck if they drink that stuff its no wonder it kills them it was said in a whisper but it carried pilar tensed felt her rhythm break but kept going its the winemakers task to determine when the wines reached its peak at this point the bottle is frozen at the neck in a solution of brine in that way the cap can be removed no wine is lost and the frozen sediment slides out degorgement or disgorging the bottle is topped off with more wine or a bit of la dosage brandy or sugar to sweeten it or a little digitalis her rhythm faltered again and a number of people shifted uneasily still she shook her head as david took a step forward throughout the process as with any wine bearing our label there are safety checks and security measures when the sparkling wine is judged ready its corked and shipped to market so that you can bring it to your table for your own celebration there are cheaper and less cumbersome ways to create champagne but giambellimacmillan believes tradition quality and attention to detail are essential to our wines she smiled as she took back the sample bottle at the end of the tour youll be able to judge for yourself in our tasting room pilar let the guests mingle in the tasting room enjoy their complimentary samples and answered individual questions it was shed discovered very much like entertaining that shed always had the knack for better it made her feel not just part of the family but part of the team nice job david stepped up beside her thanks despite the heckler he isnt my first i think ive gotten the hang of it at least my palms dont sweat anymore im still studying there are times i feel like im back in school cramming for exams but its satisfying i still have to she broke off as a man at the end of the bar began to gag he clutched his throat staggered back even as pilar rushed forward he began to laugh uproariously the same joker david realized whod made the sarcastic cracks in the cellar before he could deal with the situation pilar was taking over im sorry her voice was a coo of polite concern isnt the wine to your taste he gave another snort of laughter even as his wife jabbed her elbow viciously into his side cut it out barry aw come on its funny humors often subjective isnt it pilar said pleasantly of course we at giambellimacmillan have difficulty finding amusement in the tragic deaths of two of our own but we appreciate your trying to lighten the mood perhaps you should try it again with our merlot she signaled to the bartender its more appropriate no thanks he patted his belly im more of a beer man really id never have guessed youre such a jerk barry his wife snatched her purse off the bar and steamed out the door it was a joke jeez hitching up his belt he hurried after her cant anybody take a joke well now pilar turned to her group people were either goggling or pretending to look elsewhere now that weve had our comic relief i hope youve enjoyed your tour im here to answer any questions you may have please feel free to visit our retail shop where our wines including those youve sampled are available we at villa giambelli hope youll visit us again and stop by our sister facility at the macmillan winery only minutes away here in napa we wish you buon viaggio wherever your travels take you david waited until people began to wander off before he took pilars arm and led her outside i was premature on the nice job i shouldve said fabulous fabulous job though idve been more inclined to crack that idiot over the head with the bottle of merlot than offer him one oh i do mentally she drew a deep breath stepped away from the vinecovered stone of the old winery we get someone like barry once or twice a week responding in an obnoxiously pleasant manner seems to work best it helps that im family i havent come in before during your tours didnt want you to think i was checking up on you he lifted her pearls let them run through his fingers you ms giambelli are a natural you know what youre right she agreed delighted with herself just as you were right to push me into this it gives me something tangible to do i didnt push you the fact that no one does is one of your secrets you figured out a long time ago how to live your life the way that made sense to you at the time times changed i opened a door but youre the one who walked through it thats very interesting amused at both of them she cocked her head im not sure my family would agree with you im not sure i do it took spine to stay in a marriage that wasnt a marriage because you took your vows seriously it would have been easier to walk away i know all about that you give me too much credit i dont think so but if you want to be grateful i gave you a nudge into this job ill take it especially he added sliding his hands up her arms if you think of a way to pay me back i could think of something she let her fingers link with his flirting she thought got easier with practice shed certainly been enjoying her lessons we could start with dinner ive been scoping out this little inn thats very nice but dinner at the inn was a date and formal however much they enjoyed each others company she was she realized looking for something less and something more but i meant cooking you dinner you and your children cooking for all of us im a very good cook she informed him and its a rare thing for me to have a kitchen to myself you have a nice kitchen but if you think itd be awkward or your kids would be uncomfortable with the idea the inn would be fine cooking he said again like at the stove with pots he lifted her off her feet for a kiss when do we eat were getting a homecooked meal tonight pilars cooking i dont know whats on the menu but you will like it be home by six until then try to pretend youre human children and not the mutants i won in a poker game love dad maddy read the note stuck on the refrigerator grimaced why did they have to have company how come she didnt have a say in who got to come over did he really think she and theo were so braindamaged theyd believe a woman came over and fiddled around in a guys kitchen just to cook please okay she amended maybe theo was braindamaged enough but shed fix that taking the note she jogged upstairs theo was already in his room already on the phone already ruining his eardrums with the music up to scream he didnt need to hit the kitchen for fuel after school she thought with a sniff he in direct violation of house rules kept enough junk food stockpiled in his room to feed a small country she had that information tucked into her getbackattheo file ms giambellis fixing dinner what go away im on the phone youre not supposed to be on the phone until after you do your homework ms giambellis coming over so youd better get off she might tell dad youre screwing off again sophia no jerkweed listen call you back my sisters being a pest so i have to kill her yeah later he hung up stuffed taco chips in his mouth whos coming over for what the woman dads sleeping with is coming over to fix dinner yeah theos voice brightened like on the stove dont you get it disgusted she waved the note its a tactic shes trying to squeeze in hey anybody wants to squeeze into the kitchen who can actually cook is fine with me whats she making it doesnt matter what shes making how can you be so slow shes pushing it to the next level cooking for him for us showing him what a big happy family we can be i dont care what shes doing as long as i get to eat get off it maddy i mean get off it dads entitled to have a girlfriend moron i dont care if hes got ten girlfriends what are we going to do if he decides he wants a wife theo considered it crunched on more chips i dunno i dunno she mocked shell start changing the rules start taking over thats what happens shes not going to care about us were just addons ms giambellis cool sure now shes sweet and nice when she gets what she wants she wont have to be sweet and nice and cool she can start telling us what to do and what not to do itll all have to be her way she turned her head as she heard the kitchen door open see shes just walking right in this is our house maddy stomped to her room slammed the door she intended to stay there until her father got home she made it an hour she could hear the music from downstairs the laughter it was infuriating to hear her brothers horsey laugh the traitor it was more infuriating that no one came up for her or tried to talk her out of her sulks so shed show them she didnt care either way she wandered down nose in the air something smelled really good and that was just another strike against pilar in maddys mind she was just showing off that was all making some big fancy dinner when she walked into the kitchen she had to grit her teeth theo was at the kitchen table banging on his electric keyboard while pilar stood stirring something at the stove you need to add lyrics pilar said he liked playing his music for her she listened when he played her something that sucked she said so well in a nice way theo thought that kind of thing told him she was paying attention real attention their mother never had to much of anything im not good with the word part i just like doing the melody then you need a partner she turned set down her spoon hi maddy hows the essay going what essay she caught theos warning hiss and shrugged not sure whether she was furious or grateful that hed covered for her oh its okay she opened the refrigerator took her time selecting a soft drink whats this gunk in here depends theres cheese gunk for the manicotti the others a marinade for the antipasto your father tells me you like italian food so i figured i was safe im not eating carbs today she knew it was mean and didnt need theos glare to tell her so but when she made a face at him behind pilars back he didnt respond in kind as he usually did instead he just looked away like he was embarrassed or something and that stung anyway i made plans to go to a friends house for dinner oh thats too bad casually pilar got out a bowl to begin mixing the filling for tiramisu your father didnt mention it he doesnt have to tell you everything it was the first directly rude comment the girl had made to her pilar calculated the barriers were down he certainly doesnt and as youre nearly fifteen youre old enough to know what you like to eat and where you like to eat it theo would you excuse maddy and me for a minute sure he grabbed his keyboard sent maddy a disgusted look whos the moron he muttered as he walked by her why dont we sit down maddys insides felt sticky her throat hot i didnt come down to sit and talk i just came to get a drink i have to finish my essay there isnt any essay sit down maddy she sat sprawled with a look of deliberate unconcern and boredom on her face pilar had no right lecturing her and maddy intended to make that very clear after the woman had blown off steam pilar poured herself a demitasse of the espresso shed brewed for the tiramisu she sat across from maddy at the table sipped i should warn you i have an advantage here as i not only was a fourteenyearold girl but was once the mother of one youre not my mother no im not and its hard isnt it to have a woman come into your home this way im trying to think how id feel about it probably very much the way you do annoyed nervous resentful its easier for theo hes a boy and doesnt know the things we know maddy opened her mouth then shut it again when she realized she didnt know how to respond youve been in charge a long time your men wouldnt agree would likely be insulted by that statement she added and was pleased to see the faint smirk curve maddys lips but the female force a smart female force usually pushes the buttons youve done a good job keeping these guys in line and im not here to take your control away youre already changing things actions have reactions its scientific im not stupid no youre smart scared little girl pilar thought with a grownup brain i always wanted to be smart and never felt smart enough i compensated i think by being good being quiet keeping peace those actions had reactions too if you keep quiet nobody listens youre absolutely right your father he makes me feel smart enough and strong enough to say what im thinking what im feeling thats a powerful thing you already know that maddy frowned down at the table i guess i admire him maddy the man he is the father he is thats powerful too i dont expect you to throw out the welcome mat for me but im hoping you wont lock the door in my face why do you care what i do couple of reasons i like you sorry but its true i like your independence and your mind and your sense of family loyalty i imagine if i wasnt involved with your father wed get along very well but i am involved with him and im taking some of his time and attention away from you id say i was sorry about that but wed both know it wasnt true i want some of his time and attention too because maddy another reason i care what you do is im in love with your father pilar pushed her cup away and pressing a hand to her stomach rose i havent said that out loud before that habit of keeping quiet i suppose boy feels strange maddy shifted in her chair she was sitting up now ramrod straight and her own stomach was jumping my mother loved him too enough to marry him im sure she did she no youre going to make all the excuses all the reasons why and theyre all bullshit all of them when it wasnt just exactly the way she wanted she left us thats the truth we didnt matter her first instinct always was to comfort console there were a dozen things she could say to soothe but this little girl with wet defiant eyes wouldnt hear them why should she pilar decided no youre right you didnt matter enough pilar sat again she wanted to reach out to draw this young girl close but it wasnt the way or the time i know what its like not to matter enough i do maddy she said firmly laying a hand over the girls before she could jerk away how sad and angry it makes you feel how the questions and doubts and wishes run through your head in the middle of the night adults can come and go whenever they want kids cant thats right your father didnt leave you mattered to him you and theo matter most to him you know that nothing i could say or do or be will change that other things could change and when one thing does others do its cause and effect well i cant promise you that things wont change things do people do but right now your father makes me happy and i make him happy i dont want to hurt you because of that maddy i can promise to try very hard not to hurt you or theo to respect what you think and what you feel i can promise that he was my father first maddy said in a fierce whisper and hell be your fattier last always if i wanted to change that if i wanted for some reason to ruin that i couldnt dont you know how much he loves you you could make him choose look at me maddy look at me she said quietly and waited for the girls gaze to lift if its what you want so much you could make him choose between you and me i wouldnt have a chance im asking you to give me one if you cant just cant ill make an excuse clean this stuff up and be out of here before he gets home maddy wiped a tear off her cheek as she stared across the table why because i dont want to hurt him either maddy sniffled frowned down at the table can i taste that pilar lifted a brow at her cup of espresso then silently slid it toward maddy the girl sniffed it first wrinkled her nose but lifted the cup and tasted its horrible how can anybody drink that an acquired taste i guess youd like it better in the tiramisu maybe maddy pushed the cup back across the table i guess ill give it a chance one thing pilar was sure of no one had a problem with her cooking it had been a long time since shed personally prepared a family dinner long enough for her to be outrageously pleased at the requests for second helpings and the cheerful compliments between bites shed used the dining room for the meal hoping that thin layer of formality would be less threatening to maddy but the formality had broken down the minute theo had the first bite of her manicotti and announced it awesome grub theo did most of the talking with his sister watching digesting then occasionally skewering through with a pointed question it made her laugh then it warmed her heart when david used a sports metaphor to illustrate an opinion and maddy and she shared female amusement over the male mind dad played baseball in college maddy told her really another hidden talent were you good i was great first base yeah and he was so worried about his batting average he never got past first base with the girls theo snickered and easily ducked davids swing a lot you know i was a home run he trailed off any way i play that im in trouble so instead ill just say that was an amazing meal on behalf of myself and my two gluttons i thank you youre welcome but on behalf of your two gluttons id like to point out you outate the table i have a fast metabolism he claimed as pilar got to her feet thats what they all say oh no he laid a hand over hers before she could stack the dishes house rule he who cooks cleans not i see well thats a rule i can get behind she lifted her plate offered it to him enjoy another house rule he said over theos whoop of laughter dad gets to delegate theo and maddy will be delighted to do the dishes figures maddy heaved a sigh what do you get to do i get to work off some of this excellent meal by taking the chef for a walk testing the waters with his kids he leaned in and kissed pilar warmly that work for you hard to complain she went with him pleased to be out in the spring night thats a lot of mess to leave two teenagers to handle builds character besides itll give them time to talk about how i lured you outside for a makeout session oh have i been lured sure hope so he turned her into his arms drawing her closer when she lifted her mouth to his a long slow thrill rippled through him at the way she sighed against him the way she fit havent had much time to be together lately its hard so much going on content for now she rested her head on his shoulder i know ive been hovering around sophie i cant help it thinking of her being attacked right in our own home knowing someone walked in and out of her room and mine and my mothers ive caught myself lying in bed at night listening for sounds the way i never have before i look out my window some nights across the fields and see your light i want to tell you not to worry but until this is settled you will we all will if it helps i feel better when i look out my window and see the light in yours it helps knowing youre so close pilar he drew her away then lowered his forehead to hers what is it therere some problems in the italian offices some discrepancies in the figures that have turned up during the audit i might have to go over for a few days i dont like leaving now his gaze shifted past her back to the house with the kitchen lights bright in the window the kids can stay at the villa while youre gone well take care of them david you dont have to worry about that no tereza had already decreed that his children would be guests of the villa during his travel still he would worry about them about everyone i dont like leaving you either come with me oh david there was a rush of excitement at the thought the italian spring the balmy nights a lover how wonderful that her life had taken this turn that such things were possible id love that but it wont do i wouldnt feel right about leaving my mother just now and youd do what you have to do faster and easier if you knew i was here with your children do you have to be practical i dont want to be she said softly id love to say yes to just run away feeling young foolish ridiculously happy she turned in a circle to make love with you in one of those huge old beds in the castello to sneak away for an evening to venice and dance in the piazza steal kisses in the shadows of the bridges ask me again she spun back to him when all this is over ask me again ill go something was different something more free about her he realized that made her only more alluring why dont i ask you now go with me to venice when this is over yes she threw out her hands gripped his i love you david he went very still what did you say im in love with you im sorry its too much too fast but i cant stop it i dont want to stop it i didnt ask for qualifications just for you to repeat yourself this is handy very handy he jerked her forward and when she started to spill into his arms he lifted her spun her in a circle i had it figured wrong by my astute calculations it was going to take at least another two months before i could make you fall in love with me his lips raced over her face it was tough on me he continued because i was already in love with you i shouldve known you wouldnt let me suffer for long she pressed her cheek to his she could love her heart glowed with the joy of it and be loved what did you say let me paraphrase he eased her back again i love you pilar one look at you one look and i started to believe in second chances he brought her close again and this time his lips were tender youre mine chapter twentytwo contents prev next venice was a woman la bella donna elegant in her age sensual in her watery curves mysterious in her shadows the first sight of her rising over the grand canal with her colors tattered and faded like old ballgowns called to the blood the light a white washing sun would sweep over her and lose itself like a wanderer in her sinuous veins her secret turns here was a city whose heart was sly and female and whose pulse beat in deep dark rivers venice wasnt a city to be wasted on meetings with lawyers and accountants it wasnt a city where a man could be content shut up in an office hour by hour while the sweet seductress of spring sang outside the stone and glass of his prison reminding himself venice had been built on commerce didnt help davids mood knowing the curvy streets and bridges were even now jammed with tourists burning up their visa cards in the endless shops where tacky was often mistaken for art didnt stop him from wanting to be among them it didnt stop him from wishing he could stroll those ancient streets with pilar and buy her some ridiculous trinket they would laugh over for years hed have enjoyed that enjoyed watching theo inhale a gelato like water listening to maddy interrogate some hapless gondolier over the history and architecture of the canals he missed his family he missed his lover and he hadnt been gone fully sixtyeight hours the accountant was droning on in italian and in a whispery voice difficult enough to understand when full attention was paid david reminded himself he hadnt been sent to venice to daydream but to do a job scusi he held up a hand flipped over another page of a report fully an inch thick i wonder if we might go over this area again he spoke slowly deliberately stumbling a bit over the italian i want to make sure i understand clearly as hed hoped his tactic hit its target with the italians manners the new section of figures was explained patiently the numbers the italian said switching out of compassion to english do not match yes i see they dont match in a number of departmental expenditures across the board this perplexes me signore but im more perplexed by the activities attributed to the cardianili account orders shipments breakage salaries expenses all very clearly recorded si in that area there is no what is it discrepancy the figures are correct apparently they are however there is no cardianili account no giambelli client or customer by that name theres no cardianili warehouse in rome at the address recorded in the files if theres no customer no client no warehouse where do you suppose these orders over the last three years have been sent the accountant blinked behind the lenses of wireframed glasses i could not say there is a mistake of course of course theres a mistake and david believed he knew whod made it he swiveled in his chair and addressed the lawyer signore have you had the opportunity to study the documents i gave you yesterday i have and the name of the account executive in charge of this account listed as anthony avano and the invoices the expense chits the correspondence relating to the account were signed by anthony avano they were until december of last year his signature appears on much of the paperwork after that time margaret bowerss signature appears in the file well need to have those signatures verified as genuine i understand and the signature who approved and ordered the shipments the expenditures and signed off on the payments from the account donato giambelli signore cutter i will have the signatures verified will look into this matter from a legal point of view and advise you of your position and your recourse i will do that he added when i have the permission to do so from signora giambelli herself this is a delicate matter i realize that which is why donato giambelli was not informed of this meeting i trust your discretion signori the giambellis wont wish more public scandal as a company or as a family if you would give me a moment please to contact la signora in california and relate to her what weve just discussed it was always tricky for an outsider to question the integrity the honesty of one of the core david was neither italian nor a giambelli two strikes he decided the fact that hed been brought into the organization barely four months before was the third he was going up against donato giambelli with one out already on his slate there were two ways in his opinion to handle the situation he could be aggressive and swing away or he could wait with the bat on his shoulder for the perfect pitch back to sports metaphors he thought as he stood at the window of his office hands in his pockets and watched the water traffic stream by apt enough what was business but another game skill strategy luck were required donato would assume he had homefield advantage but the minute he walked into the office he would be on davids turf that david intended to make clear his interoffice phone buzzed signore giambelli is here to see you signore cutter thank you tell him ill be right with him let him sweat just a little david decided if the grapevine here climbed as quickly as it did in most companies don already knew a meeting had been held accountants lawyers questions files and he would wonder he would worry he would if he was smart have some reasonable explanation in hand answers lined up fall guy in place smartest move would be fury outrage and he would be counting heavily on family loyalty on the stream of blood to carry him through the crisis david walked to the door himself opened it and watched donato pace the outer office don thanks for coming in sorry to keep you waiting you made it sound important so i made time he stepped into the office scanned the room quickly relaxed a little when he found it empty if id been informed before you made your travel arrangements i would have cleared my calendar so that i could have shown you venice the arrangements were made quickly but ive seen venice before im looking forward to seeing the castello though and the vineyards have a seat if you let me know when you plan to go ill arrange to escort you i go there myself regularly to make certain all is as it should be he sat folded his hands now what can i do for you swing away david decided and took his place behind his desk you could explain the cardianili account dons face went blank as his eyes darted from side to side he worked up a puzzled smile i dont understand neither do i david said pleasantly thats why im asking you to explain it ah well david you give my memory too much credit i cant remember every account or details of it if youll give me time to pull files and information oh i already have them david tapped a finger on the file on his desk not so smart he decided surprised and not prepared your signature appears on a number of expense chits correspondence and other paperwork pertaining to this account my signature appears on many such account papers don was beginning to sweat lightly visibly i can hardly remember all of them this one should stick out as it doesnt exist there is no cardianili account donato theres considerable paperwork generated for it a great deal of money involved invoices and expenses but no account no man by the name of he paused flipped open the file and drew out a sheet of giambelli letterhead giorgio cardianili with whom you appear to have corresponded several times over the last few years he doesnt exist nor does the warehouse with an address in rome to which several shipments of wine are listed to have been shipped this warehouse where you on company expense traveled to on business twice in the last eight months isnt there how would you explain that i dont understand donato sprang to his feet but he didnt look outraged he looked terrified what are you accusing me of at the moment nothing im asking you to explain this file i have no explanation i dont know of this file this account then how is it your signature appears in it how is it your expense account was charged more than ten million lire in connection to this account a mistake donato moistened his lips he snatched the letterhead from the file a forgery someone uses me to steal money from la signora from my family mia famiglia he said and his hand shook as he thumped it against his heart ill look into this immediately no not smart at all david decided not nearly smart enough you have fortyeight hours you would dare you would dare give me such an ultimatum when someone steals from my family the ultimatum as you call it comes from la signora she requires your explanation within two days in the meantime all activity on this account is frozen two days from now all paperwork generated from this matter is to be turned over to the police the police don went white his composure in tatters his hands began to tremble and his voice to hitch this is ridiculous its obviously an internal problem of some kind we dont want an outside investigation the publicity la signora wants results whatever the cost now he paused struggled to think to find a rope swinging over the pit hed so suddenly found himself standing over with tony avano as account executive its easy to see the source of the problem indeed but i didnt identify avano as the account exec naturally i assumed don wiped the back of his hand over his mouth a major account i didnt qualify cardianili as major take your two days david said quietly and take my advice think of your wife and children la signora will be more likely to show compassion if you stand up for whats been done and stand up for your family dont tell me what to do about my family about my position ive been with giambelli all my life i am giambelli and will be long after youre gone i want that file youre welcome to it david ignored the imperious and outstretched hand and closed the folder in fortyeight hours it puzzled david that donato giambelli was so unprepared so clueless not innocent he thought as he crossed st marks square donato had his hand in the muck up to his elbow but he hadnt put the scam together he hadnt run the show avano possibly quite possibly though the amount skimmed under his name was petty cash next to what donato had raked in and avano had been dead four months the detectives in charge of his homicide investigation would likely be interested in this new information and how much of that dingy light would land on pilar swearing under his breath he moved toward one of the tables spilling out on the walkway he sat and for a time simply watched the flood of tourists pour across the stones in and out of the cathedral and in and out of the shops that lined the square avano had been milking the company he thought that was a given and already known but what david now carried in his briefcase took things to another level donato stepped it all up to fraud and margaret there was nothing to indicate shed had knowledge of or participation in any skimming prior to her promotion had she turned so quickly or had she learned of the false account and that knowledge had led to her death whatever the explanation it didnt answer the thorniest of questions who was in charge now who was it donato was surely calling in panic for instructions for help would whoever that was believe as easily as donato had believed that la signora intended to take the matter to the police or would they be coolheaded and call the bluff in any case within two days donato giambelli was going to be out on his ass which added one more layer to davids headache don would have to be replaced and quickly the internal investigation would have to continue until all leaks were plugged his own time in italy would likely be extended and at a point in his life where he wanted and needed to be home he ordered a glass of wine checked the time then took out his cell phone maria this is david cutter is pilar available one moment mr cutter he tried to imagine where she was in the house what she was doing the last night theyd been together theyd made love in his van on the edge of the vineyard like a couple of giddy teenagers he remembered so eager for each other so desperate to touch and remembering brought on a painful longing it was easier he found to imagine her sitting across from him while the light dimming toward dusk struck the dome of the cathedral like an arrow and the air filled with the flurry of pigeons on the wing when all this is over he promised himself he would have that moment with her david the fact that she was a little breathless made him smile shed hurried i was just sitting here in st marks square he picked up the glass of wine the waiter brought him sipped drinking an interesting little chianti and thinking of you is there music a small orchestra across the plaza playing american show tunes sort of spoils the moment not at all not for me how are the kids theyre fine actually i think maddy and i are cautiously approaching friendship she came out to the greenhouse yesterday after school i got a lesson on photosynthesis most of which was over my head theo broke up with the girl hes been seeing julie julie was last winter david keep up carrie he and carrie broke up and he moped for about ten minutes hes sworn off girls and intends to dedicate his life to his music been there that should last maybe a day ill let you know hows everything there better now for talking to you will you tell the kids ill call them tonight ill make it about six your time all right i guess you dont know when you might be coming home not yet there are some complications i miss you pilar i miss you too do me a favor youve got it just sit there awhile drink your wine listen to the music watch the light change ill think of you there ill think of you here too bye when he hung up he lingered over the wine it had been an experience to talk to a woman to her about his children that way to someone who understood them appreciated them it connected them in a way that made them almost like family and that he realized was what he wanted he wanted a family again all the links that made the circle on an unsteady breath he set down his wine he wanted a wife he wanted pilar to be his wife too fast he wondered too much no no it wasnt any way he looked at it it was exactly right they were grownups with half their lives behind them why should they waste the rest of it inching along in stages he got to his feet tossed some lire on the table why should he waste another minute what better place to buy a ring for the woman he loved than venice when he turned and the first window to catch his eye was a jewelers david considered it a sign it wasnt as easy as he assumed it would be he didnt want a diamond it occurred to him that avano had probably given her one and he discovered in himself a deepseated aversion to giving pilar anything avano had he wanted something that spoke to the two of them something that showed her he understood her as no one else had or could competitive he supposed as he wandered into yet another shop and so what he climbed the stairs on the jammed rialto bridge where the stores were shoved cheek by jowl on that rise above the water eager shoppers elbowed and shoved their way through as if terrified the last souvenir would be snatched away before they could buy it he bumped his way past the stalls offering leather goods tshirts and trinkets and tried to focus on the shop windows each one ran like rivers with gold gems a dazzle that confused the eye discouraged annoyed tired from the long hike he nearly called it a night he could wait ask his venice assistant for a recommendation then he turned looked into one more window and saw it the ring was set with five stones all in delicate heart shapes that made a quiet stream of color like her flowers he thought five stones he thought stepping closer one for each of them and each of their children he imagined the blue was sapphire the red ruby the green emerald the purple and the gold stones he wasnt as sure of what did it matter it was perfect thirty minutes later he walked out he had the description of the ring amethyst and citrine for the last two stones he reminded himself in his pocket the ring was tucked in his pocket as well hed had it engraved with the date hed bought it he wanted her to know always that hed found it on the evening hed sat in campo san marco while the light went soft talking to her his steps were lighter than they had been as he left the bridge he wandered the narrow streets now giving himself the treat of an aimless walk the crowds were thinning as night fell and turned the canals a glossy black now and then he could hear the echo of his own footsteps or the lap of water against a bridge he decided not to go back to his apartment but ducked under the awning of a sidewalk trattoria if he went back hed work and spoil the pleasure the anticipation of the evening he ordered the turbot a half carafe of the house white he idled his way through the meal smiling sentimentally at a couple obviously honeymooning enjoying the little boy who escaped from his parents to charm the waiters it was he supposed a typical reaction of a man in love that hed find everyone and everything a simple delight he lingered over coffee and thought of what he would say how he would say it when he offered the ring to pilar most of the squares were empty as he headed back across the city the shops were shut down and the sidewalk grifters had long since packed up their wares now and then he saw the little beam of light from a gondola carrying tourists down a side canal or heard a voice rise and carry over the water but for the most part he was at last alone in the city enjoying himself he took his time walked off the meal and let the stress of the day drain while he absorbed venice after dark he crossed another bridge walked through the shadows of another twisting street he glanced up when light poured out of a window above him and smiled as a young woman began to draw in the wash that fluttered faintly in the breeze her hair was dark and tumbled around her shoulders her arms were long and slim with a flash of gold at her wrist she was singing and the cheerful bell of her voice rang into the empty street the moment etched itself on his brain the darkhaired woman who was late bringing in the days wash but singing nonetheless the scent of her supper that wafted down she caught his eye laughed a sound full of fun and flirtation david stopped turned intending to call a greeting up to her and doing so likely saved his own life he felt the pain a sudden horrendous fire in the shoulder heard dimly a kind of muffled explosion even as the womans face blurred then he was falling falling slowly and forever to the sounds of screams and running feet until he lay bleeding and unconscious on the cool cobbles of the venetian street he wasnt out for long there was a moment when his world seemed washed with red and through that dull mist voices rose and fell the italian slipped incomprehensibly through his numb brain he felt heat more than pain as if someone held him over the licking flames of a fire and he thought quite clearly ive been shot someone tugged at him stirred his body so that pain woke and cut through the fire like a silver sword he tried to speak to protest to defend himself but managed little more than a moan as his vision grayed when it cleared again he found himself staring up into the face of the young woman hed watched pulling in her wash you mustve worked late tonight the words came clear in his head slurred through his lips signore per piacere sta zitto riposta laiuto sta venendo he listened solemnly translating the italian as slowly as painstakingly as a firstyear student she wanted him to be quiet to rest that was nice of her he thought dimly help was coming help for what oh thats right hed been shot he told her so first in english then in italian i need to call my children i need to tell them im all right do you have a phone and with his head cradled in her lap he went back under youre a very lucky man mr cutter david tried to focus on the mans face whatever drugs the doctors had pumped into him were hightest he wasnt feeling any pain but he was hardpressed to feel anything its hard to agree with you at the moment im sorry ive forgotten your name demarco im lieutenant demarco your doctor says you need rest of course but i have just a few questions perhaps if you tell me what you remember he remembered a pretty woman drawing in the wash and the way the lights glimmered on the water on the stones i was walking he began then struggled to sit up pilars ring id just bought a ring i have it calm yourself i have the ring your wallet your watch theyll be safe the police david remembered people called the police when someone got shot on the street this one looked like a cop not as slick as the detective back in san francisco demarco was a little dumpy a little bald he made up for both with a luxurious black moustache that flowed over his upper lip his english was precise and correct i was walking back to my apartment wandering a little id done some shopping the ring after work had some dinner it was a nice evening and id been shut up in an office all day i saw a woman in a window she was pulling in her wash she made a picture she was singing i stopped to look up then i hit the street i felt gingerly he lifted an arm to his shoulder i knew id been shot youve been shot before no david grimaced it felt just like you think it would i mustve passed out the woman was there with me when i came to she ran down i guess when she saw what happened and did you see who shot you i didnt see anything but the cobbles rushing up at me why do you think mr cutter that someone would shoot you i dont know robbery i guess yet your valuables were not taken what is your business in venice im chief operating officer for giambellimacmillan i had meetings ah you work for la signora i do there is some trouble yes for la signora in america there has been but i dont see what it has to do with my getting mugged in venice i need to call my children yes yes this will be arranged do you know anyone in venice who might wish you harm mr cutter no as soon as he denied it he thought of donato no he repeated i dont know anyone whod shoot me down on the street you said you had my valuables lieutenant the ring i bought my wallet my watch my briefcase no briefcase was found demarco sat back the woman whod witnessed the shooting had claimed the victim was carrying a briefcase she had described him very well what were the contents of this briefcase papers from the office david said just paperwork it was difficult tereza thought to stand up under so many blows under such constant assault the spirit began to wilt she kept her spine straight as she walked with eli into the family parlor she knew the children were there waiting for the call from their father innocence she mused as she looked in to see maddy sprawled on the sofa with her nose in a book theo banging away on the piano why did innocence have to be stolen this way and so quickly she gave elis arm a squeeze to reassure him to brace herself then stepped inside pilar glanced up from her needlework one look at her mother and her heart froze the embroidery hoop slid out of her hands as she got slowly to her feet mama please sit theo she gestured to quiet him maddy first i must tell you your father is all right what happened maddy rolled off the couch something happened to him thats why he hasnt called hes never late calling he was hurt but hes all right hes in the hospital an accident pilar stepped up laid a hand on maddys shoulder when previously the girl would have shrugged her off she merely clung tighter no not an accident he was shot shot theo shoved away from the piano terror coated his throat like bile thats wrong thats a mistake dad doesnt go around getting shot he was taken right away to the hospital tereza continued ive spoken with the doctor who treated him your fathers doing very well hes already listed in good condition listen to me eli moved forward took maddys hand then theos we wouldnt tell you hes all right if he wasnt i know youre scared and youre worried and so are we but the doctor was very clear your fathers healthy and strong hes going to make a full recovery i want him to come home maddys lip trembled i want him to come home now hell come home as soon as they release him from the hospital tereza told her im going to make the arrangements does your father love you madeline sure he does do you know how worried he is about you right now about you and your brother and how this worry makes it harder for him to rest to heal he needs you to be strong for him when the phone rang maddy whirled away leaped on it hello hello daddy tears gushed out of her eyes shook her body down to the toes still she slapped at theo when he tried to grab the phone its okay her voice broke and she turned to tereza its okay she repeated swiping a hand under her nose breathing deep so hey do you get to keep the bullet she listened to her fathers voice and watched la signora nod at her yeah theos right here shoving at me can i hit him too late she responded i already did yeah here he is she passed the phone to her brother youre a strong young woman tereza told her your father should be very proud make him come home okay just make him come home she walked into pilars arms and felt better for crying there chapter twentythree contents prev next her bead throbbed like an open wound but it was nothing compared to the ache in her heart she ignored both and took her place behind her desk over elis and pilars objections tereza allowed the children to attend this emergency meeting she was still head of the giambelli family and they had a right to know why she believed their father had been hurt they had a right to know it fell to her blood ive spoken with david she began and smiled at his children before his doctor came in and forced him to rest its a good sign sophia ranged herself beside theo he looked so young so defenseless guys are such babies when theyre hurt they just cant stop talking about it get out were like stoic theo was trying to be but his stomach kept pitching on him be that as it may tereza continued with his doctors approval hell fly home in just a few days meanwhile the police are investigating the incident ive also talked to the man in charge of the investigation and had in short and ruthless order researched his record demarco would do tereza folded her hands on the lieutenants file there were a number of witnesses they have a description though not a particularly good one of the assailant i dont know that theyll find him or that he particularly matters how can you say that maddy jerked up in her chair he shot my father approving the reaction tereza spoke to her as she would to an equal because i believe he was hired to do so as one buys and uses any tool to take away papers in your fathers possession a misguided and despicable act of selfprotection there have been discrepancies in a number of accounts the details of that can wait it became clear earlier today through davids work that my nephew has been funneling money from the company into a dummy account donato sophia felt a sharp pinch in the heart stealing from you from us that tereza had already accepted and absorbed he met with david on my orders this afternoon in venice and would have realized his actions would soon be uncovered this was his response my familys caused your pain she said to theo and maddy im head of the family and responsible for that pain dad works for you he was doing his job as his stomach continued to shudder theo clenched his teeth its that bastards fault not yours is he in jail no theyve yet to find him it appears hes run disdain edged her voice left his wife his children and has run i promise you he will be found he will be punished ill see to it hell need money resources ty put in youll need someone in venice to clear this up sophia rose ill leave tonight i wont put another of mine in danger nonna if donato was using an account to skim funds he had help my father its my blood she continued in italian as much as yours my honor as much as yours you cant deny me my right to make amends she took another breath switched to english ill leave tonight hell tyler scowled well leave tonight i dont need a babysitter yeah right he lifted his gaze now met hers with chilled steel weve got an equal stake in this giambelli you go i go ill check out the vineyards the winery he said to tereza if anythings off there ill spot it ill leave the paper trail to the paper pusher so tereza thought as she looked at eli across the room the next step in the cycle we pass the burdens to the young agreed tereza ignored sophias hissing breath your mother will worry less if youre not alone no ill just spread the worry out over two people mama gina and her children theyll be provided for i dont believe in the sins of the father tereza shifted her gaze to sophias held it i believe in the child the first thing david did when he was released from the hospital or more accurately when he released himself from the hospital was buy flowers when the first bouquet seemed inadequate he bought another then a third it wasnt easy carrying a huge load of flowers one arm in a sling through the crowded streets of venice but he managed it just as he managed to find the spot where hed been shot hed prepared himself for the jolt but hadnt realized thered be fury along with it someone had thought him dispensable had pierced his flesh with steel spilled his blood and had come very close to making his children orphans someone david promised himself as he stood on the stains of his own blood with his good arm full of flowers was going to pay for thinking it whatever and however long it took he glanced up though there was no wash hanging out today the window was open he shifted his flowers turned away from the street and entered the building it amazed him how exhausted he was after the climb limbs weak skin slicked with sweat it pissed him off to find himself gasping for air and leaning limply on the wall outside the apartment door how the hell was he supposed to get back to the giambelli apartment pack book a flight when he could barely make it up these stairs the fact that the doctor had said essentially that before david had signed himself out only annoyed him so much so that still puffing he straightened and knocked he didnt expect her to be home intended to leave the flowers on her doorstep or hunt up a cooperative neighbor whod take them for her but the door opened and there she was signorina si she stared at him blankly then her pretty face lit up signore come sta oh oh che bellezza she gathered the flowers and gestured him in i called the hospital this morning she continued in rapid italian they said you were resting ive been so frightened i couldnt believe such a thing could happen right outside oh she tapped her head with her hand youre american she said in careful english scusami sorry i dont have good english i speak italian i wanted to thank you me i did nothing please come in sit you look so pale you were there he glanced around her apartment small simple with pretty little touches if you hadnt been and if i hadnt looked up because you were late bringing in your wash and made such a lovely picture doing it i might not be standing here now signorina he took her hand lifted it to his lips mille grazie prego she angled her head a romantic story come ill make you coffee you dont need to trouble please if ive saved your life i have to tend to it she carried the flowers to the kitchen ah one of the reasons i was walking by so late was that id done some shopping before dinner id just bought a ring an engagement ring for the woman i love oh she sighed laid the flowers on the counter she took another long look at him pity for me lucky for her ill still make you coffee i could use some signorina i dont know your name elana elana i hope youll take this as intended i think youre the second most beautiful woman in the world she laughed and began to fill a vase with his flowers yes very lucky for her david was fed up with pain fatigue doctors and the pedestrian jumble that was venice by the time he made it back to his rooms hed already come to the conclusion that he wouldnt be heading back home that evening hed be lucky to undress himself and get into bed much less stay on his feet long enough to pack his shoulder was screaming his legs unsteady and he cursed as he fought to work the key into the lock lefthanded still that left hand came up fisted to fight when the door jerked open there you are sophia jammed her hands on her hips are you out of your mind checking yourself out of the hospital wandering around venice by yourself look at you pale as a sheet men are such morons thanks thanks a lot mind if i come in i think this is still my room tys out hunting for you right now she took his good arm as she spoke and helped him inside weve been worried to death since we went by the hospital and found out youd left over doctors orders even in italy they cant seem to make hospital food palatable giving in he sank into a chair a man could starve to death in there besides i wasnt expecting anyone this soon what did you do beam yourselves here we left last night ive been traveling a very long time on very little sleep and have spent entirely too long pacing these rooms worried about you so dont mess with me she uncapped a bottle handed him a pill what is this pain medication you left the hospital without your prescription drugs you brought me drugs will you marry me morons she repeated and stalked to the minifridge for a bottle of water david where have you been taking a beautiful woman flowers he sat back reaching for the bottle then sighing when sophia jerked it out of reach come on dont tease a man about his pharmaceuticals youve been with a woman having coffee he said with the woman who saved my life i took her some flowers to thank her considering sophia cocked her head he looked exhausted a little sweaty and very romantic with his arm in a sling and the shadows under those deep blue eyes i suppose thats all right is she pretty i told her she was the second most beautiful woman in the world but ill happily bump her down to third place if you give me that damn water dont make me chew this pill im begging you she handed over the bottle then crouched in front of him david im so sorry about this yeah me too the kids are okay right theyre fine worried about you but reassured enough that theos starting to think its pretty cool that you got shot not everybodys father honey dont do that to yourself i wont im not she drew a deep breath anyway maddy was kidding about the bullet last night she said something to you about keeping it but shes into it now according to my mother wants to study it thats my girl theyre great kids david probably comes from having a father whod think of buying flowers for a woman when he felt like something recently scraped off the sidewalk come on lets get you into bed thats what they all say the slow goofy grin he gave her told sophia the medication was doing the job your mother cant keep her hands off me good drugs huh really good maybe if i could lie down for a minute sure why dont you try it on a large flat surface she levered him up sophie pilars not all twisted up about this is she of course she is but shell get untwisted when you get home where she can fuss over you im okay just a little fuzzy in the head now he chuckled leaning heavily on her as she led him to the bedroom and wouldve sworn he was floating better living through chemistry you bet almost there i wanna go home howm i gonna pack onehanded dont you worry ill pack for you you will really he turned his head to give her a kiss on the cheek and missed by three inches thanks no problem here we go all the way down easy i dont want to hurt oh im sorry she said when he yelped no its not the arm its in my pocket the box rolled on it he groped for it swore and felt only mildly embarrassed when she reached in to retrieve it herself buying baubles are we she flipped the box open blinked oh my i guess i should tell you i bought it for your mother gonna ask her to marry me he pulled himself up a bit on the pillow and slid straight down again got a problem with that i might seeing as you proposed to me five minutes ago you fickle bastard a little tearyeyed she sat on the side of the bed its beautiful david shell love it she loves you shes everything ive ever wanted beautiful beautiful pilar inside and out second chances all around ill be careful with her i know you will i know it the years not half over she said quietly everythings moving so fast but some things she added some things are moving in the right direction she leaned over kissed his cheek close your eyes for a while papa when tyler got back she was making minestrone it always knocked him back a step to see her working in the kitchen hes here she said without looking around sleeping i told you he could take care of himself yes he did a wonderful job of that by getting shot didnt he stay away from that soup she added as he leaned over the pot its for david theres enough here for everybody its not done yet you should drive up to the vineyard you can stay at the castello tonight im having files messengered over i can work on the computer here well you worked all that out didnt you were not here to sightsee she walked out of the kitchen he took a moment to make sure his temper was on a leash then followed her into the small office why dont we just have this out nothing to have out ty ive got a lot on my mind i know why you didnt want me to come really she booted up the computer could it be that i have a great deal of work to do in a short amount of time it could be that youre pissed off betrayed hurt those things slice at you and when youre hurt youre vulnerable defenses go down youre afraid ill get too close dont want me too close do you sophia he took her chin so that she had no choice but to look at him you never did id say weve been as close as it gets and it was my idea sex is easy stand up im busy ty and just not in the mood for a quick office fuck he hauled her up fast enough violently enough to upend her chair dont try to boil everything down to that moving too fast she thought again too many things with too much speed if she wasnt at the wheel how could she maintain the right direction i dont want any more than that anything else is too much trouble i said ive got a lot on my mind and youre hurting me ive never hurt you he eased his grip maybe thats part of the problem you ever ask yourself why you end up with the kind of guy you usually end up with no she tossed her chin up older guys slick guys the kind who slide right out the door when you give them the boot im not slick sophie and i wont slide then youll just end up with rug burn on your ass like hell his smile was lethal as he lifted her onto her toes i dont slide sophie i stick you better take some time and think about that he let her go strode to the door ill be back frowning after him she rubbed her arms big son of a bitch had probably left bruises she thought dont rush on my account she started to drop back down in the chair changed her mind and kicked the desk the petty gesture made her feel marginally better why didnt the man ever do what she expected him to do she figured hed make a show at the public relations deal then slither away bored brainless but hed stuck and that thought made her kick the desk again theyd acted on some pure healthy animal lust she thought and picked up the chair had some stupendous sex shed expected him to cool off in that area too but no and what if it was true that she was a little worried because she didnt show any signs of cooling off either she was used to certain patterns in her life who wasnt shed never had any intention of developing serious feelings for tyler macmillan god it was infuriating to know she had worse hed been exactly and perfectly right in his rundown of her she was pissed off she did feel betrayed she was feeling hurt and vulnerable and she wished tyler was six thousand miles away in california because she wanted so desperately for him to be right here within easy leaning distance she wasnt going to lean her family was a mess the company shed been raised to run was in trouble and the man who would very likely become her stepfather was lying in the next room with a bullet hole in his shoulder wasnt that enough to worry about without thinking about her fear of commitment not that she had a fear of commitment exactly and if she did sophia decided and sat down again shed just have to think about it later he slept for two hours and woke feeling like a man whod been shot david supposed but one whod lived through it now that he was sitting up and being fed minestrone he decided he could start thinking again youve got your color back sophia told him most of my brain too enough to realize she was playing with her soup rather than eating it feel like filling me in i can tell you whats been done or what i know i dont imagine i can fill in all the gaps theyre looking for donato not only the police but a private investigator hired by my grandparents theyve interviewed gina im told shes hysterical and claims not to know anything i believe her if she did know something and don dumped her and the kids in the middle of this mess shed scramble to make trouble for him they havent been able to identify the woman hes been seeing if hes in love with her as he told me i imagine don took her along for company so to speak rough on gina yeah she pushed away from the table tired of pretending to eat yeah i was mildly fond of don could barely tolerate gina and felt even less warmly toward her progeny now shes deserted by her cheating stealing possibly murderous husband and damn it i cant feel for her i just cant its not impossible she pushed don financially so he started to dip even if she did hes responsible for his own choices his own actions anyway its not that i just cant stand her just cant im a horrible person but enough about me she waved that away picked up a small hunk of bread to nibble and tear at while she paced its assumed that don had funds stashed funds he bled from the company enough to run on for a while i suppose but to be frank with you hes just not smart enough to stay underground i agree with you he had help in all of this my father to a point david said watching her and after he died maybe margaret their take in this if they had one was minimal not enough to convince me that either of them had a starring role she paused you think they were used rather than users i think your father might have simply looked the other way as for margaret she was just finding her rhythm then she was killed sophia said quietly my father was killed it could all circle back to this somehow possibly still don isnt coolheaded enough isnt longthinking enough to have set up the kind of scam that slipped by the giambelli accountants for several years he was the inside man with the connections but somebody drew the blueprint maybe the mistress he added with a shrug maybe theyll find him either sunning himself by the surf on some tropical beach or floating facedown in it while they look we put the pieces back together she came back sat donato could have tampered with or hired someone to tamper with the wine i know im having trouble with the reason revenge why damage the reputation and thereby the fiscal security of the company that feeds you and kill to do it she paused studied his bandaged arm well i guess hes shown he has no real problem with that area he could have done it all she pressed her fingers to her temples killed my father renes a highmaintenance woman and dad needed plenty of money he knew he was being phased out of giambelli hed burned his bridges with mama and id let him know hed set the ones between us smoldering he was responsible for his own choices sophia david used her words his own actions im resigned to that or very nearly and i can imagine what those choices might have been he could have pressured don for more a bigger cut whatever it wouldnt have been out of character for him to have threatened blackmail in a civilized way of course he might have known about the tampering about poor signore baptista then margaret because she wanted more or because he was afraid shed find out about the embezzlement you because he realized there was no way out why steal the paperwork i dont know david he couldnt have been thinking rationally i suppose he thought youd be dead hed have the files and that would be that but you werent dead and it must have gotten through his head the files werent going to hang him hed already hanged himself meanwhile we have another public relations nightmare to get through ever think about ditching us and running back to la coeur nope sophia why dont you try eating that bread instead of shredding it yes daddy she winced at the petulant sound in her own voice sorry jet lag and general nastiness why dont i go deal with that packing for you since you insist on leaving rather than staying in my sparkling company youve got a very early flight tomorrow he was sweating like a pig the terrace doors were wide open and the cool air rising off lake como swept into the room it didnt stop the sweat only turned it to ice hed waited until his lover was asleep before hed crept out of bed and into the adjoining parlor he hadnt been able to perform but shed pretended it hadnt mattered how could a man maintain an erection at such a time perhaps it didnt matter really shed been thrilled with the trip with his sweeping her away to the elegant resort on the lake something hed promised dozens of times in the past and had never fulfilled hed made a game of it given her a ridiculous amount of cash so she could charge the room to her card he wasnt known there he told her he wanted it to stay that way what would he do if someone mentioned seeing him there with a woman other than his wife he thought that had been clever very clever he had almost believed it a game himself until hed seen the news report seen his own face he could only be grateful his mistress had been in the salon he could easily keep her away from newspapers from the television but they couldnt stay someone would see him recognize him he needed help and knew only one source his hands shook horribly as he dialed new york its donato i expected it would be jerry glanced at his watch calculated giambelli had the three am sweats he thought youve been a very busy boy don they think i shot david cutter yes i know what were you thinking i wasnt i didnt his english was failing him dio you told me to get out of venice right away when i told you what cutter said i did i never even went home to my family i can prove it he whispered desperately i can prove i wasnt in venice when he was shot can you i dont know what good thats going to do you don the story i get is you hired a trigger hired a what is this they say i hired someone to shoot him for what reason the damage was done you said so yourself heres how i look at it oh it was getting better jerry thought better sweeter than hed ever imagined you killed two people probably three with avano david cutter he continued amused by donatos panicked sputter whats one more youre royally fucked pal i need help i have to get out of the country i have money but not enough i need a a a passport a new name a change of my face that all sounds very reasonable don but why tell me you can get these things you overestimate my reach and my interest in you lets consider this conversation a severing of our business association you cant do this if they take me they take you oh i dont think so theres no way to connect me to you ive made sure of that in fact when i hang up the phone i intend to call the police and tell them you contacted me that i tried to convince you to turn yourself in it shouldnt take them too long to trace this call back to you thats fair warning given our previous relationship id hit the road and hit it fast none of this wouldve happened it was your idea im just full of ideas serenely jerry examined his manicure but youll note i never killed anyone be smart don if you can manage it keep running he hung up poured himself a glass of wine lit a cigar for good measure then he picked up the phone and called the police chapter twentyfour contents prev next with a mixture of regret and relief david watched venice recede theres no reason for you to haul yourself out of bed and tag along to the airport this way he told tyler as the water taxi plowed its way through earlymorning traffic i dont need a babysitter yeah im getting a lot of that lately tyler sipped his coffee and hunched his shoulders against the cool damp air its starting to piss me off i know how to get on a plane heres the deal i put you on at this end they pick you up on the other end live with it david took a closer look tylers face was unshaven his expression foul for some reason it perked david up rough night ive had better you going to be able to get back okay your italians pretty limited isnt it kiss ass david laughed gently shifted his shoulder there i feel better now sophia giving you a hard time shes been giving me a hard time for twenty years its stopped spoiling my day if i offer you some advice are you going to pitch me overboard remember im wounded i dont need any advice where sophias concerned despite himself tyler frowned over at david what is it keep pushing i dont think anyones ever kept pushing her not the male of the species anyway if she doesnt kill you for it shes yours thanks but maybe i dont want her david settled back to enjoy the ride oh yeah he chuckled you do yeah tyler admitted he did which was why he was risking her considerable wrath she didnt like anyone touching her things didnt like being told what to do even no he corrected as he packed up her little portable office especially when it was what was best what the hell are you doing he glanced up and there she was still damp from the shower and sending off sparks of temper packing your saddlebags partner were riding out get your hands off my stuff she rushed in snatched back her laptop pressing it against her like a beloved child im not going anywhere i just got here im going back to the castello where i go you go any reason you cant work there yes several and they are she hugged the computer tighter ill think of them while youre thinking pack the rest of your gear i just unpacked then you should remember where everything goes with this indisputable logic he strolled out it irritated her hed caught her off guard and when her brain was still mushy from a sleepless night it annoyed because shed been planning on making the drive north and spending at least a day or two working out of the castello it irked as she recognized how petty it was for her to sulk in silence on the drive and it added one more layer of temper that he seemed so sublimely unconcerned were taking separate bedrooms she announced its time we put the brakes on that area of our relationship okay shed already opened her mouth to skewer him and his carelessly agreeable response had it hanging slack okay she managed fine okay fine you know were weeks ahead in the growing season back home looks like theyre just finishing up the new plantings talked to the operator yesterday he tells me the weathers been good no frosts for weeks and theyre seeing the beginnings of new bloom keeps up warm through the bloom well get a normal set oh thats the conversion of flower to grape i know what a normal set is she said between her teeth just making conversation he turned off the highway and started the drive through the gentle hills its pretty country i guess its been a few years since i made the trip over never seen it this early in the spring she had but had nearly forgotten the quiet green of the hills the pretty contrast of colorful houses the long sleek rows riding the slopes fields of sunflowers waiting for summer and the shadow of faroff mountains that were a faint smudge against a blue sky the crowds of venice the urbanity of milan were more than highway miles from here this was a little heart of italy that pumped steadily fed by the earth and rain the vineyards here were the root of her destiny had ordained it when cezare giambelli planted his first row a simple dream she thought to grand plan a humble enterprise to international empire now that it was threatened was it any wonder shed use whatever came to hand to defend it she saw the winery the original stone structure and its various additions her greatgreatgrandfather had placed the first stones then his son had added more then his sons daughter one day she thought she might place her own on the rise with the fields spreading out like skirts the castello ruled gracious and grand with its colonnaded facade its sweep of balconies its high arching windows it stood as a testament to one mans vision he would have fought she thought not just for the ledgers not only for the profit for the land for the name it struck her here more deeply than in the fields at home more than within the walls of her offices and meeting rooms here where one man changed his life and by doing so forged hers tyler stopped so the car faced the house its entrance gardens in young bud great place he said simply and climbed out of the car she got out more slowly breathing in the sight of it as much as she breathed in the lightly scented air vines spilled over decorative mosaic walls an old pear tree bloomed wildly already shedding some of its petals like snow she remembered suddenly the taste of the fruit sweet and simple and how when shed been a child the juice trickled down her throat as she walked down the rows with her mother you wanted me to feel this she stated and with the hood of the car between them turned to him did you think i didnt she pressed a closed fist to her heart did you think i didnt feel it before sophie he leaned on the hood a friendly companionable stance i think you feel all sorts of things but i know some of them can get lost in the worry and the well the now focus too hard on the now you lose sight of the big picture so you badgered me out of the penthouse in venice so id see the big picture thats part of it its blooming time sophie whatever else is going on its blooming time you dont want to miss it he walked back to the trunk popped it is that a metaphor she asked as she joined him reaching by to grab her laptop herself me im just a farmer what do i know from metaphors just a farmer my ass she hitched the strap of the laptop on her shoulder plucked out her briefcase excuse me but im no longer supposed to think about your ass he pulled his suitcase out then studied hers in disgust why is your suitcase twice as big as mine and three times as heavy im bigger than you because she fluttered her lashes im a girl i suppose i should apologize for being snotty to you why he hauled her case out you wouldnt mean it id sort of mean it here let me give you a hand she reached in picked up the little tote that held her cosmetics then slowly strolled away pilar opened the door to the police at least this time she thought shed been expecting them detective claremont detective maguire thanks for coming she stepped back in welcome gestured to the parlor its a beautiful day for a drive she continued but i know youre both very busy so i appreciate the time and trouble shed already arranged for coffee and biscotti and moved to serve the moment the cops were seated claremont and maguire exchanged looks behind her back then maguire shrugged what can we do for you ms giambelli reassure me i hope which i know isnt your job she passed out the coffee impressing maguire by remembering how each of them took it what reassurances are you looking for claremont asked her i realize you your department is in contact with the italian authorities pilar took her seat but didnt touch her coffee she was jumpy enough as you may already know my mother has some influence over there lieutenant demarco has been as forthcoming as possible with information im aware that my cousin contacted jeremy demorney yesterday and that jerry informed the new york police of the phone call jerry was concerned enough to call my stepfather to tell him directly if youre that well informed i dont know what we can tell you detective claremont this is my family pilar let that statement hang i know that the authorities were eventually able to trace dons call to the lake como area i also know he was gone when they arrived to take him into custody im asking you whether in your opinion my cousin killed my killed anthony avano ms giambelli maguire set her coffee aside it isnt our function to speculate we gather evidence weve been connected you and i for months youve looked into my life into the personal details of it while i understand that the nature of your business requires a certain professional distance im asking for a little compassion its possible donato is still in italy my daughters in italy detective maguire a man i care for very much was nearly killed a man i was married to for half my life is dead my only child is six thousand miles away please dont leave me helpless ms giambelli alex maguire began before he could finish im sorry pilar i cant tell you what you want to hear i just dont have the answer you know your cousin better than i do tell me ive thought of it of little else for days pilar began i wish i could say we were close that i understood his heart and his mind but i dont a week ago i would have said oh donato he can be foolish but he has a good nature now theres no doubt he was a thief that he and the man i was married to were in league together stealing from the woman who allowed them to make a living she picked up her coffee cup to fill her hands stealing from me from my daughter but even then even knowing this when i try to picture him sitting in my daughters living room facing a man hed known all those years and killing him i cant do it i cant put the gun in dons hand i dont know if thats because it doesnt belong there or because i cant bear to believe it youre worried hell go after your daughter theres no reason for him to do that if hes done all these things isnt the fact that she exists reason enough in her office behind closed doors kris drake raged the giambellis headed by that little bitch sophia were still trying to ruin her sicced the cops on her she thought as she pounded a fist into her palm it wouldnt do them a damn bit of good they thought they could weasel it all around pin her with tonys murder even tie her to the product tampering to bigshot cutters little accident in venice shaking with fury she thumbed open a pill bottle dryswallowed a tranquilizer they couldnt prove shed been the one to give sophia that helpful shove on the terrace they couldnt prove anything so what if shed slept with tony it wasnt a crime hed been good to her appreciated her understood her and what she wanted to accomplish hed made her promises promises the giambelli bitches had seen to he couldnt keep the lousy cheat she thought with affection theyd have made a good team if hed just listened to her if he hadnt let that whore talk him into marriage but it all lay down on the giambellis she reminded herself theyd made certain that slut rene foxx knew about her too now her name was being tossed around in the press and she was getting smirking looks from coworkers just as she had at giambelli shed come too far worked too hard to let those italian divas ruin her career without jerrys support she might already be out on her ear thank god he was standing up for her that he understood she was a victim a target she owed him the inside information she was passing on let giambelli try to sue her over it la coeur would fight for her jerry had made that clear from the beginning she was valued here la coeur was going to give her everything shed always wanted prestige power status money by the time she was forty shed be listed as one of the top one hundred women in business shed be the fucking female executive of the year and not because someone had handed it to her in the cradle because shed earned it but it wasnt enough not enough payback for the interrogations by the police for the smears in the press for the slights given her when shed been at giambelli giambelli was going down she thought but there were ways to make the family tremble as it fell it was a long flight across an ocean across a continent he slept through most of it and when hed revived himself with coffee called in for an update though he reached eli and got filled in on what happened in italy since hed left he was disappointed to have missed his kids and pilar he wanted home and by the time he landed at the napa airfield he resented even the short drive that separated him from it then he crossed the tarmac to where hed been told his driver would be waiting and found it dad theo and maddy sprang from opposite doors of the limo the rush of emotion had him dropping his briefcase as he lunged toward them he grabbed maddy with his good arm then had a line of pain spurting through his shoulder as he tried to hug theo sorry bad wing when theo kissed him surprise and pleasure flustered him he couldnt remember the last time this boy this young man had done so god im glad to see you he pressed his lips to his daughters hair leaned into his son so glad to see you dont ever do that again maddy kept her face pressed against his chest she could smell him feel his heart beat not ever again thats a deal dont cry baby everythings okay now afraid he was going to blubber as well theo pulled himself back cleared his throat so did you bring us something youve heard of ferraris holy shit dad i mean wow theo looked toward the plane as if he expected to see a sleek italian sports car unloaded just wondering if youd heard of them but i did manage to pick up a couple things that actually fit in my suitcases which are right over there david jerked his head man and if you haul them for me like a good slave well go car shopping this weekend theos jaw dropped no joke no ferrari but no joke cool hey whyd you wait so long to get shot smartass its good to be home lets get out of here and he trailed off as he looked back toward the car pilar stood beside it her hair blowing in the wind as their eyes met she began walking toward him then she was running maddy watched her and took her first shaky step toward adulthood by moving aside whats she crying for now theo wanted to know as pilar clung to his father and sobbed women wait until its over before they cry especially when its important maddy studied the way her father turned his face into pilars hair this is important an hour later he was on the living room sofa being plied with tea maddy sat at his feet her head resting on his knee while she toyed with the necklace hed brought her from venice not a littlegirls trinket she had a good eye for such things but a real piece of jewelry theo was still wearing the designer sunglasses and occasionally checked himself out in the mirror to admire his european cool well now that youre settled ive got to get going pilar leaned over the back of the sofa brushed her lips over davids hair welcome home he might have been handicapped but his good arm was quick enough he reached back grabbed her hand whats your hurry youve had a long day were going to miss you guys over at the main house she said to theo and maddy i hope youll keep coming around maddy rubbed her cheek on davids knee but her eyes were on pilars face dad didnt you bring ms giambelli a present from venice as a matter of fact well thats a relief pilar gave his uninjured shoulder a squeeze you can give it to me tomorrow you need to rest now i rested for six thousand miles i cant handle any more tea would you mind taking that into the kitchen give me a minute here with the kids sure ill give you a call tomorrow see how youre feeling dont run off he said as she began to clear the tray just wait he shifted on the couch tried to put the words he wanted to use together in his mind as she took the tray out listen theo you want to sit down a minute obligingly visions of sports cars dancing in his head theo plopped down on the couch can we look at convertibles itd be so cool to tool around with the top down chicks really dig on that jeez theo maddy turned herself around until she was kneeling her hands resting on davids knees you dont score a convertible by telling him youre going to use it to pick up girls anyway shut up so dad can tell us how he wants to ask ms giambelli to marry him davids grin at the first half of her statement faded how the hell do you do that he demanded its spooky its just following logic thats what you wanted to tell us right i wanted to talk to you about it any point in doing that now dad theo gave him a manly pat its cool thank you theo maddy when you have a family youre supposed to stay with them sometimes people dont maddy uhuh she shook her head shell stay because she wants to maybe sometimes thats better a few minutes later he was walking pilar home across the edge of the vineyard the moon was beginning its slow rise really david i know the way home and you shouldnt be out in the evening air i need the air and the exercise and a little time with you maddy and theo are going to need a lot of reassurance and how about you she laced her fingers with his im feeling considerably steadier i didnt mean to fall apart at the airport i swore i wouldnt you want the truth i liked it its good for the ego for a man to have a woman cry over him he brought their joined hands to his lips kissed her knuckles as they stepped onto the garden path remember that first night i ran into you out here christ you were gorgeous and furious talking to yourself sneaking a temper cigarette she remembered and very embarrassed to have been caught at it by the new coo the new fatally attractive coo oh yes that too he stopped pulled her gently into an embrace i wanted to touch you that night now i can he skimmed his fingers down her cheek i love you pilar david i love you too i called you from st marks talked to you while the music played and the light faded remember that of course i do it was the night you were ssh he laid a finger over her lips i hung up and sat there thinking of you and i knew he took the box out of his pocket she stepped back pressure dropped onto her chest leaden weights of panic oh david wait dont put me off dont be rational dont be reasonable just marry me he struggled a moment then let out a frustrated laugh cant open the damn box give me a hand will you starlight glittered on his hair bright silver on deep gold his eyes were dark direct and full of love and amusement as her breath jerked she could smell a hint of night jasmine and early roses all so perfect she thought so perfect it terrified her david weve both been here before both know it doesnt always work you have young children whove already been hurt we havent been here together and we both know it takes two people who want to make it work you wont hurt my kids because as my odd and wonderful daughter just told me you wont stay because youre supposed to but because you want to and thats better some of the weight lifted she said that yes theo being a man of few words just told me it was cool her eyes wanted to blur but she blinked tears away it was a time for clear sight youre going to buy him a car hed tell you anything you want to hear see why i love you youve got him nailed david im nearly fifty he only smiled and and i suddenly it felt foolish i suppose i just had to say it one more time okay youre old got it not that much older than she broke off this time blowing out a breath when he laughed i cant think straight good pilar let me put it this way whatever your birth certificate says whatever youve done or havent done up to this moment i love you i want to spend the rest of my life with you to share my family with you and to share yours so help me open this damn box ill do it she expected her fingers to tremble but they didnt the pressure in her chest was gone and a lightness took its place its beautiful she counted the stones understood the symbol its perfect he took it out of the box slid it onto her finger thats what i thought when pilar went into the house eli was brewing tea in the kitchen hows david doing well i think better than id imagined she ran her thumb over the ring that felt so new and so right on her finger he just needs to rest dont we all he sighed your mother went up to her office im worried about her pilar shes barely eaten today ill go up take her some tea she rubbed a hand over his back well all get through this eli i know it i believe it but im starting to wonder at the cost shes a proud woman this is damaging that part of her elis worry wormed its way into pilar as she carried the tray to her mothers office it occurred to her that it was the second time in one evening shed brought tea to someone who probably didnt want it still it was a gesture meant to soothe and she would do her best the door was open and tereza was at her desk a logbook was open on it mama pilar sailed in i wish you wouldnt work so hard you put the rest of us to shame im not in the mood for tea pilar or company well i am she set the tray on the table and began to pour davids looking remarkably well youll see for yourself tomorrow it shames me one of my own would do such a thing and of course youre responsible as always who else the man who shot him i used to think used to let myself think that i was responsible for the shameful things tony did you werent blood no i chose him and thats worse but i wasnt responsible for what he did he was if there was responsibility on my part it was for allowing him to do what he did to me and to sophia she brought the tea to the desk set the cup down giambelli is more than wine hah you think i need to be told that i think you need to be told it now i think you need to be reminded of all its done all the good the millions of dollars to charity the family has dispersed over the years the countless families whove made their livings through the company field workers winemakers bottlers distributors factory workers clerks every one of them depends on us and what do we do mama she sat on the side of the desk saw with satisfaction that she had her mothers full attention we work worry and we gamble every season on the weather we do our best and we hold faith that hasnt changed it never will was i unfair to him pilar to donato youd question yourself now i see why elis worried if i tell you the truth will you believe me tired tereza got up from the desk walked to the window she couldnt see the vineyards in the dark but she saw them in her mind you dont lie why wouldnt i believe you you can be hard its frightening sometimes when i was little id see you striding out along the rows and id think you were like a general out of one of my history books straight and stem then you might stop study the vine speak with one of the workers you always knew their names a good general knows her troops no mama most dont theyre faceless nameless pawns have to be for the general to so ruthlessly send them to battle you always knew their names because it always mattered to you who they were sophia knows too that was your gift to her god you comfort me i hope i do youve never been unfair not to donato not to anyone and you arent responsible for the acts of greed or cruelty or selfishness of those who only see faceless pawns pilar tereza laid her forehead on the window glass such a rare gesture of fatigue that pilar rose quickly to go to her signore baptista he haunts me mama hed never blame you hed never blame la signora and i think hed be disappointed in you if you blamed yourself i hope youre right maybe i will have tea she turned touched pilars cheek you have a good strong heart i always knew that but you have clearer vision than i once gave you credit for broader i think it took me a long time to work up the courage to take the blinders off its changed my life for the good ill think about what you said she started to sit then saw the flash of stones on pilars finger terezas hand whipped out snakefast and grabbed so what is this its a ring i see its a ring tereza said dryly but not i think another youve bought to replace what you once wore there no i didnt buy it and its not a replacement your teas getting cold you werent wearing such a ring when you left to pick up david to take him home nothing wrong with your eyesight even when youre brooding all right i just wanted to call sophia first to mama david asked me to marry him i said yes i see thats it thats all you have to say im not finished tereza tugged pilars hand under the desk light examined the ring the stones she too recognized symbols and valued such things he gave you a family to wear on your hand yes his and mine ours difficult for a woman with your heart to refuse such a gesture her fingers curled tight into pilars you told me what you thought about something in my heart now ill tell you once a man asked you to marry him you said yes ah she lifted a finger before pilar could speak you were a girl then youre a woman now and youve chosen a better man cara tereza framed pilars face kissed both her cheeks im happy for you now i have a question all right why did you send him home then bring me tea why didnt you bring him in to ask my blessing and elis and drink champagne as is proper never mind she waved it away call him now tell them all to come mama hes tired not well not so tired and well enough to have mussed your hair and kissed the lipstick off your mouth call she ordered in a tone that cut off any argument this needs to be done properly with family well go down open our best vintage and call sophia at the castello i approve of his children she added turning to the desk to close her logbook and return it to its place the girl will have my mothers seed pearls and the boy my fathers silver cuff links thank you mama youve given me all of us something to celebrate tell them to hurry up she ordered and strode out straight and slim calling for maria to bring the wine part four the fruit who buys a minutes mirth to wail a week or sells eternity to get a toy for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy william shakespeare chapter twentyfive contents prev next tyler was filthy his back carried a nagging ache dead center and he had a nasty scrape poorly bandaged across the knuckles of his left hand he was in heaven the mountains here werent so different from the jagged outcroppings of his own vacas where his soil was gravelly this was rocky but still high in the ph that would produce a soft wine he could understand why cezare giambelli had put the roots of his dream here had fought his plow through this rocky soil there was a rough beauty in the shadow of these hills that called to certain men that challenged them it wasnt a matter of taming it ty reflected but of accepting it for what it was and all it could be if he had to spend time away from his own vineyards this was the place to do it the weather was perfect the days long and sweet and the castello operator more than willing to use the time and skill of another vintner and the muscle of one tyler thought as he strolled back through the rows toward the great house hed spent a good part of his days helping the crew install new pipelines from the reservoir to the young plantings it was a good system well planned and the hours hed spent with the crew had given him a chance to have a hand in this arm of the company and to casually question the men about donato the language barrier wasnt as much of a problem as hed anticipated those who didnt speak english were still willing to talk with hand signals facial expressions and the generous assistance of various interpreters tyler got a clear enough picture there wasnt a man in the fields who considered donato giambelli more than a joke now with the shadows lengthening toward evening tyler considered that opinion he moved from field to garden where hydrangeas bloomed big as basketballs and rivers of pale pink impatiens wound a trail up a slope toward a grotto water spewed there in a fountain guarded by poseidon the italians he thought were big on their gods and their fountains and flowers cezare giambelli had certainly used them all here in this pretty palace tucked in the hills a very rich little palace tyler mused setting his hands on his hips as he turned a slow circle the kind of place an ambitious man with a demanding wife would covet personally he thought it was a nice place to visit but how could anyone live there with all those rooms all those servants the grounds alone with the gardens the lawns the trees the pools and statuary would require a small army to maintain then again some men liked to have little armies at their disposal he passed between the mosaic walls with their basrelief figures of wellendowed nymphs walked down the steps circling yet another pool swimming with lily pads from there he couldnt see the fields the heart of the realm more accurately he decided those who worked the fields couldnt see whoever lingered here he supposed cezare had wanted some privacy in certain corners of his empire what could be seen beyond the flowers the sprawl of terraces was the swimming pool and rising out of it like venus was sophia she wore a simple black suit that sleeked over her body like the water that streamed from it her hair was slicked back and he could see the glint of something probably diamonds fire at her ears who but sophia would swim wearing diamonds watching her he felt an uncomfortable combination of lust and longing she was perfect elegant lusty and clever he wondered as his belly tightened at the sight of her if there was anything more unsettling to a man than perfection in a woman one thing he decided as he started toward her loving that woman to the point of stupidity water must be cold she went still the towel shed picked up concealing her face for another instant it was i wanted it cold casually she laid the towel aside and took her time slipping into a terrycloth robe she knew he looked at her studied her in that thorough and patient way of his she wanted him to every time shed passed a window that day she looked toward the fields picked him out among the men shed studied him youre filthy yeah and pleased to be so she decided filthy she thought sweaty and gorgeous in a primitive way that shouldnt be so damned appealing what did you do to your hand scraped several layers of skin off thats all he turned it over glancing at it i could use a drink honey you could use a shower both why dont i clean up ill meet you in the center courtyard in an hour why well open a bottle of wine and tell each other all about our day couple things i want to run by you all right that suits me i have a few things of my own some of us can dig without ending up covered with dirt wear something pretty he called after her and grinned when she glanced back over her shoulder just because im not touching doesnt mean i dont like to look he picked up the damp towel when she went into the house breathed in the scent of her beauty he thought was rough on a man no he didnt want to tame her any more than he wanted to tame the land but by god it was time for acceptance on both sides she was going to give him plenty to look at plenty to wish for she was after all an expert at packaging she wore blue the color of a lightning strike the bodice dipped low to frame the rising swell of her breasts the skirt rose high to showcase the long slim length of her thighs she added a thin chain of diamonds with a single sapphire drop that lay cozily at her cleavage she slipped into icepick heels dabbed scent in all the right places and considered herself ready and looked at herself in the mirror why was she so unhappy the turmoil around her was upsetting it was challenging but it wasnt the cause of this gutdeep unhappiness she was all right when she was working when she was focused on what had to be done and how best to do it but the minute she stopped the minute her mind drifted from the immediate task at hand there it was this dragging sadness the flattening of spirit and with it she admitted an anger she couldnt identify she didnt even know whom she was angry with anymore don her father herself ty what did it matter she would do what needed to be done and worry about the rest later for now shed have some wine and conversation fill tyler in on what shed learned that day and have the side benefit of putting him in a sexual spin all in all a fine way to spend the evening god i hate myself she said aloud and i dont know why she kept him waiting but hed expected that the fact was it gave him time to put everything in place the tiled courtyard was shadowy with evening candlelight speared up from the table from torcheres lanced in the circling garden from luminaries tucked among the flowerpots hed chosen the wine a soft young white and had begged some canapés from the kitchen staff the staff hed noted who were devoted to sophia and appreciated the flavor of romance a good thing he decided as theyd been the ones to scurry around setting up the candles adding little bottles of spring flowers hed never have thought of even putting music on low through the outdoor speakers he could only hope he lived up to their expectations he heard the sound of her heels on the tiles but didnt get up sophia he thought was too used to men springing to attention in her presence or falling at her feet whats all this the staff got into it he gestured to the chair beside him ask for a little wine and cheese around here you get the royal treatment he looked at her while he took the wine from the bucket look what happens when i ask you to wear something pretty comes from being in a castle not your style but you seem to be coping digging a few ditches today put me in a good mood he handed her a glass tapped his to it salute as i said i did some digging of my own the domestic staffs been very informative ive learned don made regular visits here unreported visits while he never stayed here alone he rarely came with gina ah the love nest apparently the mistresss name is signorina chezzo shes young blonde silly and likes breakfast in bed shes been a frequent guest for the last few years don insulted the staff by bribing them to keep her visits secret but since noone here has any love for gina they took his money and complied theyd have been discreet without the money of course of course they tell you about his other visitors yes my father but wed already deduced that and the woman my father came with once who wasnt rene kris tyler frowned into his wine i didnt get that from the vineyard easier for me to nudge it out of the domestic staff anyway its hardly fresh news its fairly obvious hed used my apartment for assignations when it suited him why not the castello you dont want me to say im sorry but i am no i dont mind you saying it im sorry too it makes it that much more lovely that mamas found someone wholl make her happy someone she can trust someone we can all trust i say that knowing he once worked for jerry demorney at la coeur and that jerrys also been a guest here this time tyler nodded i thought so the crew could only give me a description and that wasnt clear they tend to pay more attention to women than men in suits ties it together doesnt it does it restless she rose sipping her wine as she paced jerry hated my father a civilized sort of loathing id always assumed why you really stay out of the loop dont you she replied a few years back my father had a blistering affair with jerrys wife they kept it quiet but it was still fairly common knowledge in the inner circle she left jerry or he kicked her out that piece of the pie gets served up differently depending on whos cutting it jerry and my father had been reasonably friendly before that and after things chilled but there was some heat under the chill which i discovered two years ago when jerry hit on me he came on to you clear and strong i wasnt interested he was annoyed and had a number of uncomplimentary things to say about my father me my family damn it sophie why didnt you mention this before because he made a point of coming to see me the very next day full of apologies he said hed been more upset about the divorce than hed realized felt terrible and ashamed at taking it out on me and that hed come to terms with the fact that his marriage had been over before all of that happened and so on and so forth it was reasonable understandable he said all the right things and i didnt think of it again what do you think of it now i see a crafty little triangle my father kris jerry who was using whom i cant say but i think jerrys involved or at least knows about the embezzlement maybe even the tampering it would be profitable for la coeur has been for giambelli to be fighting consumer unease public scandal internal discord add kris in and you have my plans my campaign my work tossed in their lap before i have a chance to implement them corporate sabotage spies thats common enough in business murder isnt no thats what makes it personal he couldve killed my father i can more easily see him with a gun in his hand than i can donato i dont know if thats wishful thinking its a long way from corporate espionage to coldblooded murder but but hindsight she said with a shrug thinking back on the things he said to me when he lost control and more how he said them he was a man on the edge and one ready to dive off within twelve hours hes apologetic sheepish controlled and bringing me dozens of roses and still in a mildly civilized way hitting on me i shouldve seen the first incident was truth and the rest facade but i didnt because im used to men hitting on me the unhappiness the dissatisfaction struggled toward the surface again before she tamped it down and i use it when it suits me to get what i want why shouldnt you youre smart enough to use the tools at hand if a guy lets you its his problem not yours well she laughed a little sipped her wine thats unexpected coming from a man ive used them on didnt hurt me any he stretched out his legs crossed his ankles and knew she was trying to puzzle him out fine and good ty thought let her do the wondering for a change anyway the guy fitting demorneys description spent time in the winery tyler told her had access to the bottling plant with donato ah how sad she thought so the triangle reforms into a foursided box jerry links to don don links to my father both jerry and dad link to kris tidy what do you want to do about it tell the police here and at home and i want to talk to david hell know more about jerrys work at la coeur she plucked a strawberry from a dish bit into it slowly tomorrow im going into venice ive agreed to give some interviews during which ill hang don up by the balls disgrace to the family a betrayal to the loyal employees and customers of giambelli our shock sorrow and regret and our unhesitating cooperation with the authorities in the hopes that he will be brought to justice quickly and spare his innocent and pregnant wife his young children his grieving mother any more pain she reached for the bottle to fill her glass again you think thats cold and hard and just a little nasty no i think its hard on you hard to be the one saying those things keeping your head up when you do youve got your grandmothers spine sophie again unexpected but grazie im going to have to deal with gina and my aunt as well if they want family support emotional and the allimportant financial theyll cooperate with the line were taking publicly what time are we leaving i dont need you for this dont be stupid it doesnt suit you macmillan is just as involved just as vulnerable itll play better in the press if we do this as a team family company partnership solidarity we leave at seven sharp she sat again ill type up a statement some responses for you you can go over them on the way in so theyll be fresh in your mind should you be questioned fine but lets try to keep that the only area where you put words in my mouth its hard to resist with you taciturn types but ill try he spread some pate on a cracker handed it to her so lets change channels awhile what do you think about your mother and david i think its great do you yes dont you as a matter of fact but it seemed to me youve been a little off since they called with the big announcement i think under the circumstances im allowed to be a little off but thats one turn of events i can be pleased about it feels right im happy for her for them hell be good to her and for her and the kids she always wanted more children now shell have them even if they come halfgrown i was halfgrown and she managed to be more of a mother to me than my own her shoulders tensed when hed tossed the question at her relaxed again shes too young to be your mother thats what i used to tell her and shed say its not the age its the seniority she loves you a lot feelings mutual whatre you smiling at i dont know i suppose ive been a little down today with one thing or another and i didnt expect to end the day sitting out here with you actually relaxing feels better to have said all that ugly business out loud cleanse the palate she added with another sip of wine then move on to something pleasant we can actually agree on weve got more common ground than either of us might have thought a year ago i suppose we do and im impressed that instead of having this discussion inside with your boots propped up on a coffee table were sitting out here wine candlelight even music she leaned back looked up at the sky stars its nice to know you can appreciate an attractive venue even for a discussion thats primarily business and distressful theres that but mostly i wanted to set this up out here so wed have a pretty setting when i seduce you she choked on her wine managed to laugh it off seduce me wheres that on your agenda coming right up he grazed a fingertip over her thigh just below the hem of her skirt i like your dress thank you i put it on to torment you figured that his gaze met hers bullseye she leaned over for the bottle again filled his glass when it came to sexual skirmishes she considered herself a veteran we agreed that part of our relationship was over no you were having a snit about something and i let you a snit she dipped a fingertip in her wine tapped it gently on her tongue i dont have snits yeah you do all the time youve always been a brat a really sexy brat and for the last while youve had some pretty rough times the spine hed just complimented her on stiffened im not looking for your sympathy macmillan or your tolerance see his grin a calculated insult flashed youre working up toward a snit temper snuck up her backbone added heat to rigidity let me tell you something if this is your idea of a seduction its a wonder youve ever scored with a woman heres a difference between me and most of the men you know his legs were stretched out his voice lazy i dont keep score i dont think about you like a notch on the bedpost or a trophy oh yes tyler macmillan highminded moralistic reasonable again he grinned at her but this time it was full of fun you think that insults me youre just using temper as a defense its your mechanism mostly i dont mind much giving it right back to you but im not in the mood for a fight i want to make love with you starting out here slow and working our way in upstairs into that great big bed in your room when i want you in my bed youll know it exactly taking his time he rose pulled her to her feet youre really stuck on me arent you stuck her mouth would have fallen open if she hadnt been so busy sneering please youll embarrass yourself crazy about me he slipped his arms around her chuckling when she pushed against his chest and arched away i saw you today more than once standing at the window looking at me i dont know what youre talking about i might have looked out the window looking at me he continued slowly drawing her against him the way i was looking at you wanting me he nuzzled gently at her neck the way i was wanting you and more his lips brushed her cheek as she turned her head away theres more than the wanting between us theres nothing she gasped when his hand squeezed the back of her neck then moaned when his mouth crushed down on hers if it was just this just the heat you wouldnt be so scared im not afraid of anything he eased back you dont need to be im not going to hurt you she shook her head but his lips came back to hers again gentle now and unbearably kind no she thought as she softened against him he wouldnt hurt her but she was bound to hurt him ty she started to push at him again and ended by gripping his shirt shed missed this the warmth he brought into her those twisted sensations of risk and safety this is a mistake it doesnt feel like one you know what i think he lifted her into his arms i think its stupid to argue especially when we both know im right stop it youre not carrying me into the house the staff will gossip about it for weeks i figure theyve already laid bets on how this was going to turn out he elbowed open a door and if you dont want servants talking about what you do you shouldnt have servants when we get home i figure you should move in with me then itll be nobodys business what we do move move in with you have you lost your mind put me down ty im not going to be carried up the steps like a heroine in a romance novel you dont like it okay well do it this way he shifted hauling her up and over his shoulder better this isnt funny baby he patted her butt it is from where im standing anyway theres plenty of room for your stuff at my place got three extra bedrooms with empty closets that ought to be enough for your clothes im not moving in with you yes you are he walked into her bedroom kicked the door shut behind him he had to give the staff credit he hadnt seen one of them on the trip upstairs hadnt heard a peep he gave sophia full marks too she wasnt kicking and screaming too much class he supposed as still carrying her he lit the candles scattered through the room tyler i can recommend a good therapist theres absolutely no shame in seeking help for mental instability ill keep it in mind god knows i havent been clear in the head since i got tangled up with you we can make an appointment together after you move in im not moving in with you yes you are he let her slide down until she was back on her feet and facing him because its what i want if you think i give a single damn about what you want right now because he continued skimming his fingers over her cheek im as crazy about you as you are about me that shut you up didnt it its time sophia we started dealing with it instead of dancing around it im sorry her voice shook i dont want this im sorry you dont want it too because its the way it is look at me he framed her face with his hands i wasnt looking for this either but its been there for a long time lets see where it takes us he lowered his mouth to hers just us just him she thought she wanted to believe it wanted to trust all these soft and liquid feelings that were flowing into her to love someone and have it be strong and true to be capable of that worthy of it she wanted to believe it to be loved by an honest man one who would make promises and keep them who would care for her even when she didnt deserve it that was a miracle she wanted to believe in miracles his mouth was warm and firm on hers patiently stirring desire the steady irresistible rise of passion was a relief this she could understand this she could trust and this she thought as she wrapped her arms around him she could give she went with him willingly when he lowered her to the bed he kept the heat banked this time there would be no mistaking what happened between them was an act of love generous selfless and sweet he linked his fingers with hers as he deepened the kiss as he tasted the beginning of surrender on her lips it was meant to be there in the old bed in the castello where it had all begun a century before there another beginning another promise another dream as he looked down at her he knew it blooming time he said quietly ours always the farmer she said with a smile as she unbuttoned his shirt but her hand trembled went limp when he took it in his pressed it to his lips ours he repeated he undressed her slowly watched the candlelight shimmer over her skin listened to the way her breath caught released caught again when he touched her did she know the barriers between them were crumbling he did he felt them fall when she quivered and knew the precise moment her body yielded to her heart they seemed to sink into the bed like lovers in a pool she gave herself to the sensations of those hard palms sliding over her that persuasive mouth roaming where it pleased she reached for him rose to him and answered the quiet beauty of knowing he would be there that he would hold on even as she did poured through her like wine in the blood when he pressed his lips to her heart she wanted to weep no one else he thought as he lost himself in her no one else had ever unlocked him this way he felt her rise under him an arch of welcome he heard her broken moan merge with his as she crested and knew when he looked down at her that she was steeped in what they gave each other a blend rare and perfect finally shared once again he linked his hands with hers holding tight now take me in sophie his body shook control ruthlessly held as he slipped inside her take me i love you her breath caught again as sensation swarmed into her tore at her heart fear and joy bursting ty dont he laid his lips on hers the kiss gentle devastating i love you take me he kept his eyes open and on hers watched tears swim and shimmer tell me ty her heart quaked seemed to spill over then her fingers curled strong to his ty she said again ti amo she met his mouth with hers now clung and let him sweep her away say it again drifting ty ran a fingertip up and down her spine in italian like that she shook her head her only sign that she heard the request and kept her cheek pressed against his heart i like the way it sounds i want to hear it again ty theres no point trying to take it back he continued his lazy stroke and his voice was clear and calm you wont get away with it people say all kinds of things in the heat of passion she scooted away and nearly made it off the bed heat of passion you start using clichés like that i know youre fumbling in one easy move he flipped her back on the bed say it again its not as hard the second time believe me i want you to listen to me she pushed herself up dragged at the bedcovers for the first time she could remember her own nudity left her feeling uneasy and exposed whatever i might be feeling at the moment doesnt mean god i hate when you look at me like that amused patience its infuriating its insulting and youre trying to change the subject im not going to fight with you sophia not about this just tell me again dont you understand she bunched her hands into fists i know what im capable of i know my strengths and my weaknesses ill just screw this up no you wont i wont let you she raked a hand through her hair you underestimate me macmillan no you underestimate yourself it was that she realized as she slowly lowered her hand again that simple and quiet faith in her more than she had in herself that left her helpless no one else would ever say that to me youre the only one whod say that to me maybe thats why im his nerves were starting to stretch but he gave her ankle an easy pat keep going almost there thats something else you push nobody else ever pushed none of the others loved you youre stalling sophie chicken she narrowed her eyes his were that calm lake blue she thought just a little amused just a little no she realized with a hard jolt not smug and amused there was strain behind them and nerves and still he waited for her to give him what he needed youre not the first man ive been with she burst out stop the presses he leaned forward caught her chin in his hand the patience on his face was beginning to shift toward temper it delighted her but heres a flash for you im damn well going to be the last and that she decided was exactly right okay ty here it is ive never said it to another man never had to be careful not to because it was never an issue im probably not doing you any favors by saying it to you but youll have to deal with it now i love you there that wasnt so hard he ran his hands over her shoulders as relief pumped into him but you didnt say it in italian it sounds really great in italian you idiot ti amo she laughed launching herself at him chapter twentysix contents prev next lieutenant demarco smoothed a fingertip along his moustache i appreciate your coming in signorina the information you and signore macmillan bring me is interesting it will be looked into what exactly does that mean looked into im telling you my cousin used the castello for assignations with his mistress for clandestine meetings with a competitor and with an employee i personally terminated none of which is illegal demarco spread his hands interesting even suspicious which is why i will look into it however the meetings were hardly clandestine as many employees at the castello and at the vineyards were aware of them they werent aware of jeremy demorneys identity or his connection with la coeur tyler put a hand over sophias as he spoke if he wasnt mistaken she was about to shoot off her chair and directly through the roof what this implies is that demorney was involved in the sabotage thats resulted in several deaths possibly others at la coeur are involved or at least aware since she couldnt shove away tys hand sophia fisted her own jerry is the grandnephew of la coeurs current president hes an ambitious and intelligent man who had a grudge against my father and very likely against my family every market share giambellis lost during these crises has been profit in la coeurs pockets as a family member thats profit in jerrys pocket and personal satisfaction along with it demarco heard her out and i have no doubt that when presented with this information the proper authorities will want to question this jeremy demorney obviously as hes an american citizen residing in new york im unable to do so at this point my main concern is the apprehension of donato giambelli whos eluded you for nearly a week sophia pointed out we learned the identity of his traveling companion or i should say the woman we believe to be traveling with him only yesterday signorina chezzos credit card has several extensive charges i am even now waiting for further information of course he used her credit card sophia said impatiently hes an idiot but hes not a fool hes certainly smart enough to cover his tracks there and to get out of italy the quickest and easiest way over the border into switzerland id imagine he contacted jerry from the como district the swiss border is minutes away the guards there barely look at a passport were aware of this and the swiss authorities are assisting us its only a matter of time time is a valuable commodity my family has suffered personally emotionally and financially for months until donato is apprehended and questioned until we have the answers and assurances that no other sabotage is planned we cant end it my father was part of this how much a part i dont yet know can you understand how this feels yes i believe i understand signorina my father is dead i need to know who killed him and why if i have to hunt down don myself if i have to confront jerry demorney personally and take on the entire la coeur organization to get those answers believe me thats what ill do youre impatient on the contrary ive been remarkably patient she got to her feet i need results he held up a finger as the phone rang his expression changed slightly as he listened to the stream of information when he hung up he folded his hands you have your results the swiss police have just taken your cousin into custody if was an education to watch her in action tyler didnt say a word wasnt sure hed have gotten one in if hed tried shed peppered demarco with demands questions scribbling down information in her notebook when shed marched out of demarcos office tyler had to lengthen his considerable stride just to keep up she moved like a rocket with a cell phone attached to her ear he couldnt understand half of what she was saying anyway she started in italian switched to french somewhere along the line and went back to italian with a few short orders in english she mowed her way through the tourists thronging the narrow streets clipped busily over the pretty bridges and beelined across squares and never stopped talking never stopped moving even when she had to cock the little phone between her ear and shoulder to drag out her filofax and make more notes she passed shop windows without so much as a glance he figured if she breezed by armani without it putting a hitch in her stride nothing was going to stop her at the main dock she jumped on a water taxi and he caught the word for airport in her brisk stream of italian he figured it was a good thing he had his passport in his pocket or hed be left in her dust she didnt sit even then but braced herself on the rail behind the driver and made still more calls fascinated he wedged himself in on the other side and watched her the wind teased her short cap of hair the sun bounced off the dark lenses of her glasses venice washed by behind her an ancient and exotic backdrop to a contemporary woman with places to go and people to see small wonder he was crazy about her tyler folded his arms tipped back his head and let himself enjoy the last breezes of the city built on water if he knew his woman and he did they were going to be spending some time in the alps tyler he tuned back in when she snapped her fingers at him how much money do you have cash on me i dont know couple hundred thousand in lire maybe a hundred american good she swung toward the stairs as the boat docked pay the driver yes maam she cut her way through the airport just as she had through the city streets per her orders the corporate jet was waiting fueled and cleared for the flight less than an hour after shed received the news her cousin was in custody she was strapped in for takeoff and for the first time in that hour she turned off her phone shut her eyes and took a breath sophia che what you kick ass she opened her eyes again and her smile came slow and sharp damn straight hed been taken from a tiny resort nestled in the mountains north of chur and near the austrian border the farthest hed thought ahead was perhaps getting over that border or alternatively into liechtenstein the goal had been merely to put as many countries between him and italy as possible but while looking north donato had failed to look at his own ground his mistress wasnt as dim as hed supposed nor half as loyal shed seen a news report on the television while lounging in a bubble bath and had found his cache of cash in his traveling case shed taken the money booked a flight placed a single anonymous call and had been on her way considerably richer to the french riviera when the efficient swiss police had broken into donatos room and plucked him out from under the bedcovers now he was in a swiss cell bemoaning his fate and cursing all women as the bane of his existence he had no money to hire a lawyer and desperately needed one to fight extradition for as long as possible for as long as it took for gods sake for him to think his way clear he would throw himself on the mercy of la signora he would escape and run to bulgaria he would convince the authorities hed done nothing more than run off with his mistress he would rot in prison for the rest of his life with his thoughts circling this same loop around and around he looked up to see a guard on the other side of the bars informed he had a visitor he got shakily to his feet at least the swiss had had the decency to let him dress though hed been allowed no tie no belt not even the laces in his guccis he smoothed his hair with his hands as he was taken to the visiting area he didnt care whod come to see him as long as someone would listen when he saw sophia on the other side of the glass his spirits soared family he thought blood would listen to blood sophia grazie a dio he fell into his chair fumbled with the phone she let him ramble the panic the pleas the denials the despair and the longer he did so the thicker the shell grew around her heart stai zitto he did indeed shut up at her quiet order he must have seen that she stood for her grandmother now and that her expression was cold and merciless im not interested in excuses donato im not here to listen to your pitiful claims that its all been a horrible mistake dont ask for my help im going to ask the questions youll give the answers then ill decide what will be done is that clear sophia you have to listen no i dont i dont have to do anything i can get up walk away you on the other hand cant did you kill my father no in nome di dio you cant believe that under the circumstances i find it easy to believe you stole from the family he started to deny it and reading his answer in his eyes sophia set the phone down began to get to her feet panicked don slapped his palm on the glass shouted when the guards started forward she coolly gestured them back picked up the phone again you were about to say yes yes i stole i was wrong i was stupid gina she makes me crazy she nags for more more babies more money more things i took money i thought what did it matter please sophia cam you wont let them keep me in prison over money think again i would yes my grandmother might not but it wasnt just money you tampered with the wine you killed an old innocent man for money don how much was he worth to you it was a mistake an accident i swear it it was only supposed to make him a little sick he knew he saw i made a mistake his hand shook as he rubbed it over his face knew what donato saw what in the vineyard my lover he disapproved and might have spoken of it to zia tereza if you continue to play me for a fool ill walk away and leave you to rot believe it the truth don all of it it was a mistake i swear it i listened to poor advice i was misled desperate he dragged at his already loosened collar his throat was closing choking him i was to be paid you see and i needed money if the company had some trouble if there was bad press lawsuits i would be paid more baptista he saw people i spoke with sophia please i was angry very angry ive worked hard my whole life la signora never valued me a man has his pride i wanted her to value me and killing an innocent old man attacking her reputation was the answer the first that was an accident and it was the companys reputation its one in the same how could you not know that i thought if theres trouble then ill help fix it and shell see and youd get paid from both ends sophia finished it didnt work with signore baptista he didnt get sick he died and they buried him believing his heart had just given out at last how frustrating for you how annoying then almost immediately nonna reorganized the company yes yes and does she reward me for my years of service no sincerely outraged he thumped a fist on the counter she brings in an outsider she promotes an american woman who then can question me so you killed margaret and tried to kill david no no margaret an accident i was desperate she was looking at the accounts at the invoices i needed wanted only to delay her a short time how was i to know she would drink so much of the wine a glass even two would only have made her ill it was inconsiderate of her to spoil things you sent bottles poisoned wine out on the market you risked lives i had no choice no choice you must believe me did my father know about the wine the tampering no no it was just a game to tony the business was his game he didnt know about the dummy account because he never took time to look he didnt know baptista because he knew no one who worked in the fields it wasnt his life sophia it was my life she sat back briefly her father had been weak a sad excuse for a husband even for a man but hed had no part in murder or in sabotage it was at least some small comfort you brought demorney to the castello to the winery you took money from him didnt you he paid you to betray your own blood listen to me his voice dropped to a whisper stay away from demorney hes a dangerous man you have to believe me whatever ive done you have to believe id never want to hurt you hell stop at nothing murder my father i dont know i swear to you on my life sophia i dont know he wants to ruin the family he used me for that listen to me he repeated laying his palm on the glass again i took money i stole i did what he told me to do to the wine i was misled now hell let me hang for it im begging you to help me im begging you to stay away from him when i knew cutter would expose me i ran i only ran sophia i swear it to you theyre saying i hired someone some thug from the streets to shoot him and steal the papers its a lie why would i it was over already for me it was done the twists of lies and truths had to be unknotted it would take a cold and steady hand to do so she thought even now after all she knew of him part of her wanted to reach out she couldnt allow it you want my help don tell me everything you know about jerry demorney everything if im satisfied ill see to it giambelli arranges for your legal needs and that your children are cared for and protected when sophia came back tyler thought she looked exhausted wilted before he could speak she touched a hand to his dont ask me yet im going to arrange a conference call on the flight so i only have to say it all once okay lets try this instead he pulled her in held her thanks can you do without the things you took to the castello for a few days ill have them packed up and sent we need to go home ty i need to be home best news ive had in days he kissed the top of her head lets go do you believe him tyler waited until shed completed the call until all had been said she was up now pacing the cabin sipping her third cup of coffee since takeoff i believe hes a stupid man with a weak and selfish core i believe hes convinced himself that signore baptista and margaret were unfortunate accidents he let himself be used for money and for ego by someone a great deal more clever now hes sorry but sorriest for being caught but i believe absolutely that hes afraid of jerry i dont think don killed my father i dont think he tried to kill david youre looking at demorney who else proving it wont be so easy tying jerry to any of this and making it hold wont be so easy tyler rose took the coffee from her hand youre revving yourself too high turn it off awhile cant who else ty i could see you didnt agree when we were on the call i can see it now im not sure what i think just yet i take longer than you to process things but i cant figure out why your fatherd have just met in your apartment with jerry or why after all this time all this planning jerry would kill him would risk that would bother doesnt ring for me but im not a cop and neither are you theyll have to question him even on the word of someone like donato theyll have to hell slither and hell slide but she stopped took a breath well be stopping in new york to refuel three countries in one day welcome to my world you wont get anything out of him sophie just the chance to spit in his face yeah theres that and hed get a charge out of watching her do it you know how to track him down its a big city she sat again and pulled out her filofax making connections is one of my best things thanks hey im just along for the ride let me tell you something that didnt escape my notice today sophie nothing does exactly i was plowing my way through this mess making calls arrangements pushing all the buttons you never interrupted me never asked me any questions never patted my head and told me to step back so you could handle it i dont happen to speak three languages that wasnt it it didnt occur to you to flex your muscles and take over to show me you could handle things for me just like it didnt dent your ego that i knew what i had to do and how to do it you dont have to flex your muscles because you know theyre there and so do i maybe i just like watching you flex yours she got up just to crawl into his lap curl there all my life ive made certain to hook myself up with weak men all show no substance with her head on his shoulder she could finally rest now look what ive done jerry made several calls himself from pay phones he didnt consider donato much of a problem but more of an inconvenience and even that would be seen to before long hed accomplished what hed set out to accomplish giambelli was fighting its way out of yet another crisis the family itself was in turmoil consumer trust was diving toward an alltime low and he was reaping the rewards personally professionally financially nothing hed done nothing hed done that could be proved had been illegal hed simply done his job as an aggressive businessman would and had seized opportunities that had come his way he was more amused than annoyed when lobby security announced he had visitors prepared to be entertained he cleared them then turned to his companion we have company an old friend of yours jerry weve got two solid hours of work to get through tonight kris uncurled her legs from the couch who is it your former boss why dont we open a bottle of the pouillyfuisse the sophia kris surged to her feet here why were about to find out he said as the buzzer sounded be a good girl wont you fetch the wine he strolled to the door isnt this a lovely surprise i had no idea you were in town he actually leaned forward to kiss sophias cheek she was quick but tyler was quicker his hand rammed sharply into jerrys chest lets not start out being stupid he advised sorry holding up both hands jerry stepped back didnt realize things had changed between you come in i was just about to open some wine you both know kris yes how cozy sophia began well pass on the wine thanks we wont be here long you appear to be enjoying all your new employee benefits kris i much prefer the style of my new boss to the style of my old one im sure youre a lot more friendly with your associates ladies please jerry pleaded as he closed the door were all pros here and we know executives switch companies every day thats business i hope youre not here to scold me for snatching one of yours after all giambelli wooed one of our best away just last year how is david by the way i heard he had a close call in venice recently hes doing very well fortunately for kris giambelli has a firm policy against trying to kill former employees but apparently not a strong enough one against internal wars i was shocked to hear about donato jerry lowered to the arm of a sofa absolutely shocked were not wired demorney tyler ran an arm down sophias arm to calm her so you can save the act we paid don a visit before we left europe he had some interesting things to say about you i dont think the police will be far behind us really hed been fast jerry thought but apparently not quite fast enough i have more faith in our system than to believe the police or anyone else for that matter will put much credence in the ravings of a man whod steal from his own family this is a difficult time for you sophia he stood again if theres anything i can do you could go to hell but im not sure theyd have you you shouldve been more careful she continued both of you she added with a nod toward kris spending time at the castello the winery the bottling plant its not illegal jerry shrugged in fact its not an uncommon practice for friendly competitors to visit each other that way we were invited after all you and any member of your family are always welcome at any la coeur operation you used donato guilty jerry spread his hands but again nothing illegal about it he approached me im afraid hes been unhappy at giambelli for quite some time we discussed the possibility of him coming aboard at la coeur you told him to tamper with the wine told him how to do it thats ridiculous and insulting be careful sophia i understand youre upset but trying to deflect your familys troubles onto me and mine isnt the answer heres how it was tyler had spent the hours in the air working it out in his head now he sat made himself comfortable you wanted to cause trouble serious trouble avanod bounced on your wife hard for a man to take that even if the other guys busy bouncing on every woman he can find but trouble just slides right off avano nothing sticks he keeps his wife just where he wants her which is out of his way but close enough to lock in his position with her family organization thats a pisser for you my exwife is none of your business macmillan but she was yours and so was avano goddamn giambellis gave the son of a bitch free rein now there ought to be a way to take that rein and hang all of them maybe you know avanos skimming maybe you dont but you know enough to look at don he cheats on his wife too and hes pretty friendly with avano dons a friendly guy wouldnt be hard for you to get close to him hint that la coeur would love to have him on the team more money more power youd play into his complaints his ego his needs you find out about the dummy account and now youve got something on him youre fishing macmillan and fishing bores me it gets better avanos snuggling up to sophias second in command isnt that interesting dangle a carrot under her nose and you get lots of inside information did he offer you money kris or just a corner office with a nice shiny brass plaque i dont know what youre talking about but she took a quick and careful step away from jerry my relationship with tony had nothing to do with my position at la coeur you keep thinking that ty said casually meanwhile demorney you keep playing on don nudging him along deeper deeper hes got some money problems who doesnt you lend him a little just a friendly loan and you string him along about the move to la coeur what else can he bring to the table inside information not good enough my company doesnt require inside information its not your company ty inclined his head when he saw the fury spurt out of jerrys eyes you just want it to be you talk to don about the tampering just a few bottles show him what he should do could do then how hed be able to step in and be a hero when the shit hits just like youll be a hero at la coeur because youre primed and ready to move when giambelli takes the hit nobodys going to get really hurt or thats what you tell that poor sap don but itd shake up the company good pitiful beneath his precisely tailored shirt a line of sweat ran down jerrys back no ones going to believe this fairy tale oh the police might be pretty entertained lets just finish it out ty suggested it goes wrong for don and an old man dies no skin off your ass of course youve got don by the short hairs now he talks hes up for murder meanwhile giambellis moving right along avanos still sliding and one of your own moves to the enemy camp weve managed to bump along without the help of david cutter he wanted to pour wine carelessly but realized his hand was shaking and youve taken up enough of my time nearly done youd already started a second front courting one of the brains in promotion feeding her dissatisfaction her jealousies when the crisis hits and youre going to make sure it does the giambelli spin is going to be off balance i had nothing to do with this kris grabbed her briefcase began stuffing papers inside i dont know anything about this maybe not your styles more the backstabbing variety im not interested in what you think or anything you have to say im leaving she bolted to the door slammed it behind her wouldnt count on too much company loyalty in that one ty commented you underestimated sophia demorney just like you overestimated yourself you got your crisis you spilled your blood but it hasnt been enough for you you want more and thats whats going to choke you going after cutter was stupid legal had copies of the paperwork and don knew it kris didnt worry him she could be sacrificed like any pawn if necessary obviously donato panicked a man whos killed once doesnt scruple to kill again thats right old don he doesnt figure he killed anybody the wine did and he was too busy running to worry about david i wonder who clued you in to the meet in venice and dons scramble to get the money out of his private account the copsll work on that angle and theyll start tying you in youre going to have a lot of questions to answer and before too much longer youll have your own public relations nightmare la coeurs going to prune you off pal just like they would a diseased cane ty got to his feet you figure youve covered yourself every inch nobody ever does and when don drowns hes going to drag you under with him personally im going to enjoy seeing you go under for the third time i didnt care much for avano he was a selfish idiot who didnt appreciate what he had don falls in the same category at a slightly higher level but you youre a dickless coward who pays people to do the dirty work you havent got the guts for doesnt surprise me your wife went hunting elsewhere for someone with balls he stood where he was hands at his sides as jerry lunged and he took the fist on the jaw without making a move to block it he even allowed jerry to knock him back against the door did you see that tyler asked sophia calmly he punched me now hes laying hands on me im going to ask him politely to stop you hear that demorney im asking you politely to stop fuck you jerry bunched a fist and would have rammed it into tylers belly if it hadnt been stopped an inch from its mark if it hadnt suddenly been crushed and the pain radiating up his arm hadnt dropped him breathless to his knees youre going to want to have that hand xrayed tyler told him as he gave him a light shove that sent jerry the rest of the way to the floor in a curl of agony i think i heard a bone snap ready sophie ah yes slightly dazed she let tyler draw her out the door toward the elevator inside she let out the breath she hadnt been aware of holding id like to point something out go ahead he punched lobby level leaned back i didnt interrupt or ask any questions i wasnt compelled to flex my muscles she continued as tylers mouth twitched or prove to you i could handle things i just want to mention all that got it youve got your areas of expertise and ive got mine he slipped an arm around her shoulders now lets go home chapter twentyseven contents prev next and then sophia dug into the leftover lasagna while the family gathered in the villas kitchen ty had his hand i didnt even see it happen it was like lightning this big hand covering jerrys pretty manicured one which was probably still stinging from rapping against tys jaw anyway she gulped down some wine all of a sudden jerrys gone white and his eyes are rolling back in his head and hes folding like i dont know an accordion toward the floor and the big guy heres not even breaking a sweat im goggling i know i am but who wouldnt and ty politely suggests that jerry might want to get his hand xrayed because he thinks he heard a bone snap good lord pilar helped herself to some wine really mmm sophia swallowed she was starving the minute shed walked in the door shed been starving i heard this little sound like when you step on a twig rather horrible really then we just left and i have to say here eli your glass is empty i have to say that it was so quietly vicious and exciting so exciting im not ashamed to say that when we got back on the plane i jumped him jesus sophie tyler felt heat rise up the back of his neck shut up and eat it didnt embarrass you at the time she pointed out whatever happens however this all comes out im always going to have the image of jerry curled up on the floor like a cocktail shrimp nobody can take that away from me do we have any gelato ill get it pilar got up from the table then paused and kissed ty on the top of the head youre a good boy eli drew a breath let it out he didnt leave much of a mark on your jaw there guys got pussy hands ty said before he could think then winced i beg your pardon la signora as you should i dont approve of such language at my table but as im in your debt ill overlook it you dont owe me anything i know she reached for his hand held it tight thats why im in your debt my own blood betrayed me and mine for days knowing that opened a hole in me made me doubt myself things ive done and things i havent tonight i look and see the daughter of my daughter and the boy eli once brought to me and that hole closes again i regret nothing im ashamed of nothing how could i be whatever happens well go on we have a wedding to plan she said smiling as pilar dished up ice cream a business to run vines to tend she lifted her glass per famiglia sophia slept like a log and woke early at six she was already closed in her office refining a press release and making personal calls to key accounts in europe by seven shed worked her way across the atlantic to the east coast she was careful very careful not to mention jerrys name and not to accuse a competitor of shady practices but she let the implication take root at eight she judged it late enough to phone the moores at home aunt helen im sorry to call so early not so early idve been out the door in fifteen minutes are you still in venice no im home and in need of a legal opinion on several pesky matters actually some involve international law corporate or criminal both you know donatos been taken into custody hes being extradited to italy today hes not going to fight it hes implicated someone privately to me at this point an american a competitor this person was at minimum aware of the tampering and the embezzlement and very likely was more involved doesnt that make it conspiracy can he be charged margaret died here in the states so hold on hold on youre moving much too quickly sophie the laws a slow wheel first youre going on something don told you he isnt very credible at the moment hell be more credible she promised i just want a picture im not an expert on international law im not a criminal attorney come to that you need to talk to james and ill put him on in a minute but im going to tell you this as your friend this is a matter for the police and the system i dont want you to do anything and i want you to be very careful what you say and what you print dont make any statements without running them by either me james or linc ive drafted press releases for here and overseas ill fax them over if thats all right you do that you talk to james now dont do anything sophia bit her lip she wondered what her surrogate aunt the judge would have to say about the visit she and ty had paid to jerry the night before at midmorning david stood among the rows among the young mustard plants at the macmillan vineyard he felt useless out of touch and more than a little panicked because his justturnedseventeenyearold son had driven off to school that morning behind the wheel of a secondhand convertible dont you have some papers to push tyler asked him up yours in that case i wont suggest you head over to the caves to check on the months drawing were going to be testing the merlot for starters i get to taste wine you get to rumble thats the breaks besides it wasnt much of a rumble pilar said you flattened him onehanded david tested his injured arm one hands still about all ive got though the sadist physical therapist says ill be back to two in no time i want to take a pop at him david strode between the rows to work off some of the temper i worked for the son of a bitch for years sat in meetings with him had lunches latenight strategy sessions some of them were about how to woo over some of giambellis accounts some of yours thats business thats right when la coeur copped the exclusive on allied flights to and from europe i went out and celebrated with him we nudged giambelli out on that one barely i patted myself on the back for days over that now i look at the timing go through the steps and realize we copped it because he had the inside track don fed him giambellis bid before it was made thats the way some people do business i dont it was the tone that made ty stop he supposed somehow over the past months theyd become friends almost family near enough that he understood the guilt and the frustration nobodys saying that david nobody thinks that no but i remember how much i wanted that account he started to jam his hands in his pockets and his bad arm vibrated goddamn it you going to finish beating yourself up soon because ive got a lot of work to catch up on seeing as i had to go to italy to help wipe your blood off the street you getting yourself shot really put a crimp in my schedule david turned back toward tyler did you use that same tone when you suggested that fucker demorney get an x ray probably its the one i use when somebodys being annoyingly stupid the raw edges in davids stomach smoothed away and the first glint of humor sparked into his eyes id take a swing at you over that but youre bigger than me younger too bastard now that i think of it i could take you down but ill give you a break because sophias heading this way id hate for her to have to watch her future stepfather kick your ass in your dreams im going to go sulk in the caves he started off pausing as he passed tyler thanks anytime he walked the opposite way until he met sophia youre late again priorities wheres david going i wanted to ask how he was feeling do yourself a favor and dont hes at the restless stage of his recovery what priorities oh solidifying some shaky accounts manipulating the press consulting with legal just another quiet day for the wine heiress how are we doing out here nightsve been cool and moist brings on mildew well do the second sulfur spraying right after the grapes have set im not worried good ill carve out some time for the vintner tomorrow and you carve out some for the promotion whiz back to teamwork now why havent you kissed me hello because im working i want to check the new plantings run by the old distillery and check on the fermentation vats and were testing today in the caves then weve got to move your stuff over to my place i havent said i was but since youre here anyway he leaned down and kissed her were going to have to discuss this she began then pulled her ringing phone out of her pocket very soon she added sophia giambelli chi si va bene she angled the phone away its lieutenant demarcos office don was transferred to his custody today ah she shifted the phone back in place si buon giorno ma che scusi no no still clutching the phone she sank onto the ground come she managed gripping tylers hand before he could take the phone from her she shook her head fiercely donato she lifted her stunned gaze to tylers e morto he didnt need her to translate the last he took the phone from her and identifying himself asked how donato giambelli had died a heart attack he wasnt yet forty sophia paced this is my doing i pushed him then i went to jerry and pushed him i might as well have drawn a target on dons back you didnt do it alone tyler reminded her im the one who yanked demorneys chain basta tereza ordered but without heat if they find donato died from drugs if they find he was murdered while in the hands of the police theres no fault here donatos choices put him where he was and the police were obliged to protect as well as contain him i wont have blame cast on my house and that she determined would end that he was a disappointment to me but i remember he was once a sweet young boy with a pretty smile ill mourn the little boy she reached out found elis hand brought it to her lips in a gesture sophia had never seen her make nonna ill go to italy to the funeral to represent the family no the time for you to stand in my place will come soon enough not yet i need you here eli and i will go and thats as it should be ill bring francesca gina and the children back with me if they want it god help us if they do she finished with spirit and got to her feet sophia studied lincs office no one she decided could accuse his father of preferential treatment the room was little more than a glorified box cramped windowless and stacked with law books and files she imagined there was a desk hiding under the mounds of paperwork welcome to my dungeon its not much linc said as he cleaned off a chair for her but its not much he dumped the files and books on the floor the nice thing about starting at the bottom is you cant get any lower if im a good boy ill get my own stapler with a skill that told her hed done so before he wheeled his desk chair around the mountain from somewhere under the mounds of papers and books a phone began to ring do you need to get that wherever it is if i do somebodyll just want to talk to me id rather talk to you how anyone could work in such confusion and disorder was beyond her she had to mentally sit on her hands to keep herself from digging in to organize now i feel guilty about adding to your workload but not guilty enough to stop me from asking if the papers i sent you are somewhere around and if you had a chance to look them over ive got a system he reached under a stack on the left corner of his desk pulled out a file its like the magicians tablecloth trick she commented nicely done want to see me pull a rabbit out of my hat grinning at her he sat you covered yourself here he began i fiddled with the press releases a little got to earn my inflated fee after all he passed the revised papers over i take it youre acting as spokesperson for giambellimacmillan i take it too at least as long as nonna and eli are in italy mamas not trained for this sort of thing i am david ty ill see they have copies just in case but its best that the media representative be someone from the giambelli family were the ones getting kicked around im sorry about don so am i she looked down at the releases again but she didnt see them funerals today i keep thinking about the last time i spoke to him how scared he was i know what he did and i cant forgive him for it but i keep remembering how scared he was and how cold i was to him you cant slap yourself around for that sophie mom and dad updated me on what went on at least what were sure of he got greedy and he got stupid he was responsible for two deaths accidents he called them i know what he did linc but who was responsible for him which brings us around to demorney youre going to have to be careful there keep his name out of your statements keep la coeur out of them mmmhmm idly she studied her manicure its leaked that the police are questioning him in connection with the tampering the fraudulent account even my fathers murder i cant imagine how the press got the information youre a devious package sophie spoken as my friend or my lawyer both just be careful you dont want any leaks traced back to you and if youre asked about demorney and youre bound to be go with no comment i have plenty of comments and the ones youre thinking of could dump you into a lawsuit let the system wind its tortuous way toward the end goal if demorney was involved you dont have proof he reminded her let me be a lawyer if he was involved its going to come out but dons word isnt enough he pulled the strings im sure of it and thats enough for me people are dead and why because he wanted a bigger market share for gods sake people have killed for less but ive got to say thats the weak spot hes a wealthy respected businessman its going to be a rough road tying him to corporate espionage embezzlement product tampering much less murder hes opened it up and the press is going to leap on the juicy morsel about his wife and my father humiliating him publicly he hates us and will hate us more as this plays out i felt that when i saw him in new york its not business or not just business its very personal linc have you seen our new ad the one with the couple on the porch sunset on the lake wine and romance very slick very attractive it had your name all over it yours i mean not just the company thanks my team put a lot of time and thought into it she reached into her briefcase pulled a photograph from a file folder someone sent this to me yesterday he recognized the ad though this copy had been computergenerated and altered in this the young womans head was tipped back her mouth open in a silent scream a glass lay on the porch the wine spilling out and bleeding from white to red the header read its your moment to die jesus sophie this is sick and nasty wheres the envelope i have it no return address naturally postmarked san francisco initially i thought of kris drake its her style but i dont think so she could study the doctored ad now without a shudder i think shes backing way off to keep herself clear of the fallout i dont know if jerry was on the west coast but he did this you need to take this to the police i took the original in this morning this is a copy i got the impression that while theyll look into it they see it as another ugly little prank she pushed to her feet i want the private detective youve hired to look into it too and i dont want you to say anything about it to anyone i agree with the first part but find the second stupid its not stupid my mothers planning her wedding nonna and eli have enough to deal with so do ty and david besides this came to me personally i want to deal with it personally even you cant always have what you want this is a threat maybe and believe me i intend to be very careful but im not going to have this time spoiled for my mother shes waited too long to be happy im not going to dump any more stress on my grandparents and im not telling ty not just yet anyway because hell overreact so its you and me linc she reached down for his hand im counting on you heres what ill do he said after a moment ill put the detective on it and give him fortyeight hours to work before i say anything if during that time you get another of these you have to come to me right away i can promise that but fortyeight hours thats the deal he got to his feet ill give you that because i love you and i know what youre feeling i wont give any more because i love you and i know what im feeling take it or leave it okay okay she said again on a long breath im not being brave and stupid linc stubborn maybe but not stupid he wants to scare me and throw my family into more turmoil hes not going to right now im going to meet my mother and yours were going shopping for a wedding dress she kissed his cheeks thanks maddys idea of shopping was hanging around the mall scoping out the boys who were hanging around the mall scoping out the girls and spending her allowance on some junk food and new earrings she expected to be terminally bored spending the day with three adults in fancy dress shops but she figured the points shed earn with her father for agreeing to go would translate into the streaks she wanted to put in her hair and if she played her cards right she could cop some pretty cool stuff out of pilar a potential new stepmother was prime fruit for plucking guilt and nerves by maddys calculations equaled shopping bags she was supposed to call ms giambelli pilar now which was weird but better than being expected to call her mom or something first she had to get through the lunch deal with pilar and the judge lady a girl lunch maddy thought with derision tiny portions of fancy lowfat tasteless food where you were expected to talk about clothes and your figure it wouldnt have been so bad if sophia had been with them but maddys broad hints that shed tag along with sophia while she did her errands had fallen on barren ground she resigned herself to a miserable hour or two more points she decided then was surprised to find herself walking into a noisy italian restaurant where the air was full of spice i should get a salad i should just get a salad helen repeated but i wont i already hear the eggplant parmesan calling my name fettuccine alfredo sure fine for you helen said to pilar you never put on an ounce you wont have to worry how youll look naked on your wedding night hes already seen her naked maddy said and had both women turning around to stare at her she felt her back go up her brows lower as she prepared for a lecture instead she got laughter and helen draped an arm around her shoulders lets get a corner booth then you can give me all the dirt on your father and pilar i havent been able to crowbar out of her i think they did it outside last night dad had grass stains on his jeans can you be bought pilar demanded maddy slid into the booth grinned sure lets negotiate pilar sat down beside her she wasnt bored she was surprised to find herself having fun not being shushed for wisecracks or expected to sit quietly and behave it was she thought a lot like hanging out with theo and their father only different good different and she was smart enough to realize it was the first womens outing shed ever had smart enough to understand pilar knew it too she didnt even mind being dragged into the dress shop or having the conversation turn absolutely and completely to clothes and fabric and color and cut and when she watched sophia dash in windblown flushed happy maddy at not quite fifteen had a revelation she wouldnt mind being like her like sophia giambelli she proved didnt she that a woman could be smart really smart do exactly what she wanted in the world and how she wanted to do it and look really amazing at the same time she didnt dress like she was craving attention but she got it anyway tell me you havent tried on anything yet no not yet i wanted to wait for you what do you think of this blue silk hmm a definite maybe hi maddy aunt helen she leaned over to kiss helens cheek then let out a quick whoop oh mama look at this the lace is fabulous romantic elegant and the color would be perfect on you its lovely but dont you think its a little young more for you no no its for a bride for you you have to try it while she studied the dress pilar laid a hand on sophias shoulder sort of absentmindedly maddy thought just to touch her own mother had never touched her absentmindedly not that she could remember theyd never had that connection if theyd had it she couldnt have left so easily try them both sophia insisted and this rose linen helens picked out if she wasnt in such a rush to hook this guy she could have something designed and i could lose ten pounds before i have to wear the matron of honor gown do i have time for liposuction oh stop okay ill start with these three when pilar went off with the sales assistant to the dressing rooms sophia rubbed her hands together all right your turn surprised maddy blinked at her this is a grownup shop youre as tall as i am probably about the same size she added as she studied her target mamas going for soft colors so well stick with that though id like to put you in jewel tones i like black maddy said for the hell of it yes and you wear it well i do mmm but well expand your horizons for this particular occasion im not wearing pink maddy folded her arms aw and i was imagining a pink organdy helen said with ruffles and little mary janes whatre mary janes ouch im old im going over to daywear and sulk well what are they maddy demanded as sophia went through the selections either shoes or pot or both im not entirely sure i like this she pulled out a fulllength sleeveless gown in smoky blue itd look okay on you not for me for you sophia turned held the dress up in front of maddy me really yes really i want to see you in it with your hair up show off your neck and shoulders what if i got it cut my hair i mean short hmmm lips pursed sophia mentally cut and restyled maddys straight mop yes short around the face a little longer in the back a few highlights streaks said maddy nearly speechless with joy highlights subtle ask your father and ill take you to my guy why do i have to ask about having my hair cut its my hair good point go try this on ill give the salon a call see if they can fit you in before we head back home she started to hand maddy the gown then stopped oh mama what do you think shed started with the peach the ivory lace romancing the bodice the skirt sweeping back into a gentle train be brutal helen come see sophia called out you look beautiful mama like a bride helen agreed and sniffled damn there goes the mascara okay halfdreaming pilar turned in a circle maddy whats your vote you look great dads eyes are going to pop out pilar beamed and turned in another circle we have a winner first time out it wasnt as simple as that there were hats headdresses shoes jewelry bags even underwear it was dark before they headed north with the back of the suv crammed with shopping bags and boxes which didnt include the dresses themselves maddy thought with wonder those had to be fitted and altered and fussed with but shed ended up with a pile of new clothes shoes really cool earrings that she was now wearing they showed off great with her awesome haircut and highlights this new girlfamily deal had definite high points men sophia was saying as she cruised north consider themselves the hunter but theyre not see they decide to go after a grizzly and thats their whole focus so while they track the big bear they miss all the other game out of their narrowed vision women on the other hand may track the grizzly but before or even while bagging it they take down all the other game as well plus men shoot the first big bear they see maddy put in from the backseat they dont take into account the entire world of grizzlies exactly sophia tapped the steering wheel mama this girl has real potential agreed but im not taking the rap for those shoes with the twofoot soles shes wearing that ones on you theyre great funky yeah pleased with them and herself maddy lifted her foot and the soles are only about four inches i dont know why youd want to clomp around in them sophia met maddys gaze in the rearview mirror its a mom thing she has to say that you shouldve seen her face when i got my belly button pierced you got your belly button pierced fascinated maddy reached for the snap of her seat belt can i see i let it grow back sorry she said with a chuckle as maddy sat back again in disgust it was irritating and she was eighteen pilar pointed out turning her head to give maddy a warning stare so dont even think about it until you are is that a mom thing too you bet but i will say the two of you were right about the hair it looks great so when dad connips youll calm him all down right well ill she turned back as the car squealed around a curve sophia at the risk of saying another mom thing slow down tighten your seat belts grimly sophias hands vised on the wheel somethings wrong with the brakes oh god instinctively pilar turned back to maddy are you strapped in yeah she grabbed the seat to brace herself as the car shot around another turn im okay pull up the emergency brake mama pull it up i need both hands here those hands wanted to shake but she didnt let them didnt let herself think about anything but maintaining control the car squealed again fishtailed around the next turn its up all the way baby and the car didnt slow what if we turned off the engine the steeringll lock maddy swallowed the heart that leaped into her throat she wouldnt be able to steer gravel spit as sophia fought to keep the car on the road use my phone call nineoneone she looked down briefly a half tank of gas she thought no help there and she wasnt going to be able to control the car around the upcoming s turns at this speed downshift maddy shouted from the back try downshifting mama shove it into third when i tell you its going to give us one hell of a jolt so brace yourselves but it might work i cant let go of the wheel ive got it its going to be all right okay hold on she pushed in the clutch and the car seemed to gain more speed now the car jolted hard though maddy bit her lip she couldnt hold back the scream into second sophia ordered wrenching the wheel from the shoulder of the road a line of sweat ran cold down her back now the car bucked threw her forward back again she had a moments panic that the airbags would deploy and leave her helpless weve slowed down some good thinking maddy were going to head downhill around more turns sophias voice was ice calm so the speeds going to pick up again some i can handle it once were through them we go up a slope and that should do it get my phone mama just in case and everybody hold on she didnt look at the speedometer her eyes were glued to the road now her mind anticipating each turn shed driven the road countless times the headlights cut through the dark slashed across oncoming traffic she heard the angry sound of horns blaring as she crossed the center line nearly there nearly there she whipped the wheel left then right it slicked in her hands as her palms sprang with damp she could see could feel the ground begin to level just a little more she thought a little bit more into first mama shove it into first there was a horrible noise a tremendous shudder sophia felt as if an enormous fist punched into the hood of the car something shrieked then clanged and as the speed dropped she pulled to the side of the road no one spoke when they stopped a car whizzed by then another is everyone all right pilar reached for the latch of her seat belt and discovered her fingers were numb is everyone okay yeah maddy dashed tears from her cheeks okay i think we should get out now i think thats a good idea sophie baby yeah lets get the hell out she managed to get out to get to the far side of the car before her legs buckled bracing her hands on the hood she fought to get her breath back and only managed to wheeze that was really good driving maddy told her yeah thanks here baby here pilar turned her held her when the shakes came and holding her reached out for maddy here baby she said again maddy pressed herself into that circle of comfort and let the tears come chapter twentyeight contents prev next nearly blind with terror and relief david bolted out of the house even as the police car braked he scooped maddy out held her cradled in his arms as he would a baby youre okay he pressed his lips to her cheeks her hair breathed her in as the shakes hed held off since the call took over youre okay he said it a half dozen times as she curled into him im all right im not hurt or anything but when she wrapped her arms around his neck her world came all the way right again sophie drove like one of those guys you and theo like to watch on the raceway it was kinda cool kinda cool yeah rocking now calming himself he kept his face buried in the curve of her throat while theo awkwardly patted her back bet it was some ride theo manfully swallowed the prickly lump in his throat there was a jittering inside his chest that came as much from seeing his father break apart as from anxiety over maddy ill haul her in dad youre going to wreck your arm unable to speak david just shook his head and held on his baby was all he could think his little girl might have been lost its okay dad maddy told him everybodys okay now i can walk we got the shakes after but we got over it but theo can haul in all the loot she rubbed her cheek against her fathers we kicked shopping butt right pilar right i could use a hand theo theo and ill get it she wiggled until david set her down whatd you do to your hair david ran his hand over the sassy crop of it left his hand resting warm on the back of her neck got rid of most of it what do you think i think it makes you look grown up youre growing up on me damn maddy i wish you wouldnt he sighed pressed his lips to the top of her head just another minute okay sure i love you so much id appreciate it if you wouldnt scare me like that again anytime soon i dont plan on it wait till you see the dress i got it goes with the hair great go ahead drag off your loot youll stay wont you maddy asked pilar yes if you want i think you should stay since theo had grabbed the bags she clomped off after him in her funky new shoes oh david im so sorry dont say anything just let me look at you he cupped her face skimmed his hands back into her hair her skin was chilled her eyes huge and full of worry but she was here she was whole just let me look im fine he drew her close seemed to fold himself around her and rock sophia shes fine the taut wire that had held her straight and steady snapped as she burrowed into him god david god our babies ive never been so scared and all the time it was happening they they were amazing i didnt like leaving sophie back there dealing with the police but i didnt want maddy coming home alone so tys already on his way down she drew a ragged breath then a second that came easier i thought he would be thats all right then come inside he shifted her keeping her close to his side tell me everything tyler swung behind the police cruiser with a harsh scream of brakes in the flashing lights sophia watched him stride over the road she could see him well enough to recognize rage as calmly as she could she turned away from the cop who was interviewing her and walked toward him he grabbed her fast enough hard enough to knock the breath out of her nothing had ever felt so safe i was hoping youd come i was really hoping did you get banged up any no the jeep on the other hand i think i blew the transmission ty i didnt have any brakes they were just gone i know theyre going to tow it in and check it out but i already know the words poured out of her shaky at first then gaining strength gaining temper it wasnt an accident it wasnt some mechanical failure somebody wanted to hurt me and they didnt care if my mother and maddy got hurt too goddamn it shes just a little girl tough though tough and smart she told me to downshift she doesnt even know how to drive the rage would have to wait hed have to wait to break something in half to plow his fist into something anything sophia was trembling and needed tending kid knows something about everything get in the car time for somebody else to take the wheel a little dazed now she glanced behind her i think they still want to talk to me they can talk to you tomorrow im taking you home fine by me i have some shopping bags he smiled and his grip on her loosened to a caress of course you do he meant what hed said about taking her home his home when she didnt argue the point he figured she was more shaken than shed admitted he dumped her shopping bags in the foyer then wondered what the hell to do with her you want like a hot bath a drink how about a drink in a hot bath ill take care of it you ought to call your mother let her know youre back and youll be staying here all right thanks he dumped half a tube of shower gel that had been around since christmas into the tub it smelled like pine but it bubbled he figured shed want bubbles he stuck a couple of candles on the counter women went for candlelit baths for reasons he couldnt fathom he poured her a glass of wine set it on the lip of the tub and was standing back trying to figure out what else to do when she stepped into the bathroom her single huge sigh told him hed already hit the mark macmillan i love you yeah so you said no no at this moment this exact moment no one has ever will ever love you more enough to let you get in with me in a tub full of bubbles he didnt think so and if he could overlook the mortification of that for the obvious benefits she looked beat ill take a pass on this one strip and get in you romantic bastard a half hour in here and ill feel human again he left her to it and went down to get her things to his way of thinking if he dumped her shopping loot in the bedroom it would take her that much longer to run off again as far as he was concerned this was the first stage of her moving in he grabbed her purse her briefcase four jesus christ four loaded shopping bags and started back up with them as long as he kept busy he told himself did what came next he wouldnt give in to the fury choking him whatd you buy small slabs of granite he tossed them on the bed considered the job done and her briefcase tumbled off he grabbed for it managed to snag the strap and upending it dumped out most of the contents why did anyone need so much junk in a briefcase resigned he crouched and began to gather it up again okay he could see the bottle of water her bulging filofax the electronic memo deal the pens though god knew why she needed a half dozen of them lipstick idly he uncapped it swiveled the tube out one sniff and he tasted her travel scissors hmmm postits paper clips aspirin a powderpuff thing a fingernail thing other assorted girl things that made him wonder why she bothered to carry a purse as well and what the hell she put in it breath mints a little bag of unopened candy a minitape recorder wet naps matches a couple of floppy disks and some file folders a pair of hiliters and a bottle of clear nail polish amazing he decided it was a wonder she didnt walk crooked once she strapped it over her shoulder just passing the time he flipped through the file folders as he replaced them she had a tear sheet of the first ad a comp of the second a ream of scribbled notes and a stack of typed ones he found the press releases with the notes scribbled over them lips pursed he read the english version and found it solid strong and smart hed expected nothing else then he found the altered ad holding it and a copy of an envelope addressed to her he came straight up he was still holding them when he shoved open the bathroom door what the hell is this shed nearly fallen asleep when she blinked the first thing she saw was his furious face and the second the sheets in his hands what were you doing in my briefcase never mind that where did you get this in the mail when a hesitation brief but long enough to let him know she was considering a cover dont bother jiving me sophie when did you get this yesterday and you were planning to show it to me when in a couple of days look would you mind if i finish up in here before we discuss this im naked and covered with boy bubbles a couple of days yes i wanted to think about it and i went to the police with it to linc just today so i could get a legal opinion i can handle it ty yeah he looked at her up to her chin in froth her face haunted by shadows of fatigue youre a real handler sophia i guess i forgot that part ty she slapped a fist on the water when he walked out and closed the door just wait a minute she got out of the tub and rather than drying off just wrapped a towel around herself she went after him leaving a trail of water and bubbles she called him again cursed him and heard the back door slam shut as she raced downstairs she slapped on the outside lights saw that his long angry strides were carrying him toward the vineyards tightening her grip on the knotted towel she ran outside her bare foot came down hard on a small stone inspiring a fresh string of curses as she continued in a limping run tyler just wait a damn minute she hurled insults at his back until she realized she was using italian and they might as well have been promises of undying love to his ear listen you idiot you coward you stop where you are and fight like a man because he stopped whirled around she all but plowed straight into him she pulled up short puffing like a steam engine and hopping to take the weight off her sore foot where do you think youre going she demanded you dont want to be near me now wrong to prove it she tapped a fist on his chest you want to take a shot at me fine she angled her chin id rather somebody take an honest punch than walk away as tempting as that is and believe me im in the mood to punch something i dont hit women go back in the house youre wet and halfnaked ill go back when you go back in the meantime we can have this out right here youre mad because i didnt come running to you over that nasty bit of business well im sorry i did what i thought best about it youre halfright you did what you thought best but youre not sorry im surprised you bothered to call me tonight just because somebody tried to kill you ty its not the same thing its just a stupid picture i wasnt going to let it upset me or you or anyone you werent going to let there you go teamwork my ass he was shouting now such a rare occurrence she could only stare up at him a big furious man whod finally snapped his leash you decide what youll give how much and when everyones supposed to fall in line with your schedule your plan well fuck it sophie fuck that i just stepped out of line goddamn it i love you he hauled her up on her toes calloused hands against pampered skin youre it for me if its not the same on both sides its nothing do you get it nothing furious with both of them he dropped her back on her feet now go inside and get dressed ill take you home please dont please she said touching his arm as he started to walk by her please god dont walk away the shakes were back but had nothing to do with fear for her life this was so much more im sorry im so sorry that by not doing something i thought would worry you i did something to hurt you im used to taking care of myself used to making my own decisions thats not how it works anymore if you cant deal with that were wasting our time youre right and youre scaring me because i understand this is important enough to make you walk away from me i dont want that to happen youre right and i was wrong i wanted to handle it my way and i was wrong yell at me curse at me but dont push me out his temper had peaked and ebbed and as always left him feeling annoyed with himself youre cold lets go inside wait his voice was so final so distant it tied knots in her belly just listen she gripped his arm her fingers digging desperately into his shirt if he turned away now she knew shed be alone as shed never been alone before in her life im listening i was angry when it came all i could think was that the bastard i know its jerry the bastards using my own work to taunt me to try to scare me and im not going to let him im not going to let him worry me or my mother or anyone i care about i thought i could handle it myself and protect you from the worry and i realize standing here right now that if youd done the same thing id be just as hurt just as angry as you are her voice hitched and she feared shed sob unfair tactics she reminded herself and bit down on grief i love you maybe thats the one thing i dont know how to handle not yet give me a chance to figure it out im asking you not to walk away from me its the one thing i cant take needing someone loving them and watching them walk away im not your father he cupped a hand under her chin he saw the tears brimming and her valiant attempt to hold them off and neither are you my being there for you taking some of the weight doesnt make you weak it doesnt make you less sophie he always let someone else deal with the sticky parts she drew in a breath let it out shakily i know what im doing ty when i push people back so i can deal with problems on my own i know what im trying to prove i even know its stupid and selfserving but i cant always seem to stop doing it practice he took her hand i told you before id stick didnt i a shudder ran through her yes you did to steady herself she brought their joined hands to her cheek ive never been it for anyone before no ones been it for me looks like you are that works for me we square now i guess we are her lips curved he made things so simple she thought all she had to do was let him its been a hell of a night so far lets go back finish it off he slid an arm around her to lead her back to the house automatically taking her weight as she limped served her right he thought riling him up the way she had hurt your foot the amused and satisfied tone didnt escape her notice i stepped on a rock while i was running after this big stupid culo which would be me i understand enough gutter italian to know when the woman i loves calling me an asshole but very affectionately since youre up on the language why dont we finish the night off by she rose up to whisper in his ear ending the provocative italian with a quick nip on his lobe ummm he didnt have a clue what shed said but the blood had cheerfully drained out of his head i think im going to need a translation on that one happy to she said once were inside it surprised pilar to see tyler outside the kitchen door at what she imagined hed consider the middle of the morning it surprised her a great deal more to see the bouquet of flowers in his hand good morning hi he stepped inside the cutter kitchen nearly shuffled his feet i didnt expect to see you here or idve embarrassed he shook the flowers in his hand you know brought more i see you brought them for maddy ty delighted with him she reached up squeezed his cheeks youre so sweet yeah right well howre you feeling fine lucky she stepped toward the inside doorway and called for maddy sophia was amazing steady as a rock yeah thats sophie i gave her a break left her sleeping this morning he looked over as maddy came in hi kid hey whatre those i think theyre flowers for you her eyebrows drew together in puzzlement me i have to go ill just say goodbye to david and theo pilar kissed maddy lightly absently on the cheek and made the girls color come up see you later yeah okay how come theyre for me she asked tyler because i hear you did good he held them out you want them or not yeah i want them she took them noted the little flutter in her belly as she sniffed a kind of muscle reflex she supposed it was a nice one nobody ever gave me flowers before they will i figured id get you something for your brain too but i havent come up with it yet anyway what did you do to your hair i cut it so so just asking he waited while she got out a vase the new do made her look like a brainy pixie ty thought boys he realized with a little tug of regret were going to come sniffing at the door you want to hang with me today ive got to check for mildew then see how the works going over at the old distillery start on the weeding yeah thatd be good tell your dad when she was settled in the car beside tyler maddy folded her hands on her lap ive got two things i want to ask you sure shoot if i were like ten years older and had actual breasts would you go for me jesus maddy i dont have a crush on you or anything i sort of did when we first moved here but i got over it youre too old for me and im not ready for a serious relationship or sex damn right youre not but when i am ready i want to know if a guy would go for me theoretically tyler ran a hand over his face theoretically and leaving out the breasts because thats not what a guy looks for if you were ten years older idve already gone for you okay she smiled slipped on her sunglasses okay but thats bull about breasts guys say how they look for personality and intelligence some of them say how theyre leg men or whatever but its the breasts and you know this because because its something we have you dont he opened his mouth shut it again this wasnt a debate he could comfortably enter into with a teenage girl you said you had a couple of questions yeah well she shifted in her seat to face him the others an idea vinotherapy vinotherapy yeah i read about it grape seedbased skin creams and stuff i was thinking we could start a line of products we could i need to do more research some experimenting but this companys doing it in france we could corner the american market see red wine contains antioxidants polyphenols and maddy i know about polyphenols okay okay but see the seeds and you ditch them during wine production they have antioxidants and thats really good for the skin plus im thinking we could do an herbal deal internal too a whole health and beauty line health and beauty what next look kid i make wine not skin cream but you could she insisted if i could have the seeds when you harvest and a place to experiment you said you wanted to give me something for my brain give me this i was thinking more like a chemistry set he mumbled let me mull on it he intended to let the mulling wait until after work but maddy had different ideas sophia was in the vineyard watching the cutters weed with their wedgeshaped blades maddy headed straight for her and started before sophia could speak i think we should move into vinotherapy like that french company really sophia pursed her lips a sure sign she was carefully considering thats interesting because ive had that idea on a back burner for a while now ive tried the facial mask its marvelous were winemakers ty began and will always be sophia agreed but that doesnt preclude addressing other areas theres an enormous market for natural beauty products ive had to table the idea because weve had a difficult year and other things demanded my attention but maybe this is a good time to consider expansion rather than damage control she mused and was already playing on the spin ill need to accumulate more data of course i can get it maddy said im good at research youre hired once research moves toward research and development well need a guinea pig as one they turned to study tyler he blanched actually felt the blood fall away from his face forget it chicken sophias amused expression faded as she spotted the two figures walking toward them the police are here claremont and maguire it cant be good news deliberate sophia thought as she sat in tylers living room the fourwheel had been tampered with as deliberately as the wine had been part of her had known it but having it confirmed now with cold hard facts brought a fresh chill to her skin yes i use that vehicle often primarily i drive my car to and from the city but its a twoseater the three of us were spending the day in san francisco shopping for my mothers wedding we needed the bigger car who knew of your plans maguire asked her a number of people i suppose family we were meeting judge moore so her family did you make appointments not really i stopped by to see lincoln moore before i met the others for lunch the rest of the day was loose and the last place you stopped for any length of time claremont asked we had dinner mooses at washington square the car was parked about ninety minutes from around seven to eightthirty or so we left for home from there any idea ms giambelli who would want to cause you harm yes she met claremonts gaze levelly jeremy demorney hes involved in the product tampering in the embezzlement in every problem my familys had this year i believe hes responsible for it that he planned it and used my cousin and whatever whoever else came to hand and as ive told him so personally hes unlikely to be happy with me just now mr demorneys been questioned and im sure he had plenty of answers hes responsible you saw the ad he sent sophia frustrated tyler pushed to his feet it was a threat and he made good on it we cant prove demorney sent the ad maguire watched ty prowl the room big hands she noted demorney must have crumbled like plaster under them weve confirmed he was in new york when the package was mailed from san francisco he had it sent then find a way to prove it tyler shot back thats your job i believe he killed my father sophia kept her voice calm i believe his hatred of my father is at the core of everything thats happened he may tell himself in some skewed way that its business but its personal basing that on the alleged affair between avano and the former mrs demorney its a long time to wait for payback no its not maddy spoke up not if you want to do it right pull everyone in on it claremont took the interruption in stride gave maddy a quiet goahead look if he goes after sophias father right after the divorce then everybody knows hes whacked out over it shed spent some time analyzing it running theories like if i want to get theo for something i sit back wait figure out how to hit him best then when i do hes not expecting it and doesnt even know why hes getting it she nodded its scientific and lots more satisfying the kids a genius ty commented a dish best served cold claremont mused on the drive back to the city it fits demorneys profile hes cool sophisticated erudite hes got money position impeccable taste i can see that type waiting planning things out tugging strings but i cant get his type risking losing that position over a cracked marriage how would you handle it if your man cheated on you oh id kick his ass then scalp him in the divorce and do everything in my power to make the rest of his life a living hell including sticking pins in the throat and balls of a doll made in his image but then im not sophisticated and erudite and people wonder why im not married claremont flipped open his notebook lets go talk to kristin drake again was infuriating to have the police come to your place of business people would be talking speculating snickering there was nothing kris hated more than people gossiping behind her back and as she saw it the blame of it was squarely on sophias shoulders if you want my opinion the problems giambellis been facing this year were brought on because sophias more interested in promoting her own agenda than in the company or the people who work for it and that agenda is claremont asked sophia is her own agenda and her selfinterest as you see it has resulted in no less than four deaths a shooting and what might have been a fatal accident involving herself her mother a friend and a young girl she remembered the cold rage on jerrys face when shed been in new york and sophia and her fanner had cornered him obviously shes pissed somebody off not her problem kris assured herself not her deal besides you ms drake maguire said pleasantly its no secret that i left giambelli on less than amicable terms and the reason for it was sophia i dont like her and i resent the fact that she was brought in over me when i clearly had seniority and more experience and i intend to make her pay for it in the market how long were you being courted by demorney and la coeur while you were still drawing a salary from giambelli theres no law against considering other offers while employed with another firm its business how long she shrugged i was first approached last fall by jeremy demorney yes he indicated that la coeur would be pleased to have me on their team he made an offer and i took some time to consider it what decided you i simply realized i wasnt going to be happy with giambelli as things stood i felt creatively stifled there yet you remained there stifled for months during that period were you and demorney in contact with each other theres no law against ms drake claremont interrupted were investigating murder youd simplify the process by giving us a clear picture we simplify it for you by asking questions here where youre comfortable rather than bringing you into the station house where the atmosphere isnt nearly as pleasant were you and demorney in contact during that period so what if we were during those contacts did you give mr demorney confidential information about giambelli business practices promotional campaigns personal information that may have come into your hands regarding members of the family her palms went damp hot and damp i want to call a lawyer thats your privilege you can answer the question and help us out here maybe cop to some unethical business practices were not interested in using against you or you can hang tough and possibly end up charged with accessory to murder i dont know anything about murder i dont know anything about that and if jerry jesus jesus she was starting to sweat how many times had she gone back over the scenario tyler had painted in jerrys apartment how often had she wondered if what hed said even part of what hed said was true if it was shed be connected it was time she decided to break the link im willing to play hardball to get what i want in business i dont know anything about murder about product tampering i passed jerry some information yes gave him a headsup on sophias big centennial plans the scheduling maybe he asked about personal business but it wasnt anything more than office gossip if he had anything to do with tony she trailed off and her eyes glimmered with oncoming tears i dont expect you to believe me i dont care if you do but tony meant something to me maybe at first i started seeing him because i saw it as another slap at sophia but it changed you were in love with him maguire infused her voice with sympathy he mattered to me he made me promises about my position at giambelli hed have made good on them i know it if hed lived i told you before id met him in sophias apartment a couple times not she added the night he was killed we were cooling it awhile i admit i was upset about that at first rene had her clutches in him deep it hurt you when he married her it pissed me off kris pressed her lips together when he told me they were engaged i was angry i didnt want to marry him for gods sake who needs it but i liked his company he was good in bed and he appreciated my professional talents i didnt care about his money i can make my own renes nothing but a golddigging whore which is what you called her when you phoned her apartment last december maguire stated maybe i did im not sorry for saying what i think saying what i thinks a long way from having anything to do with killing somebody my relationship with jerrys been professional right down the line if he had anything to do with tony or any of the rest its on him im not swinging with him i dont play the game that way some game maguire slid behind the wheel give me a nice clean i killed him because he cut me off on the freeway any day of the week drakes running scared shaking down to the toes she thinks demorney set all this up and shes in line to take the fall hes a slick son of a bitch yeah lets pump up the pressure on him the slicker they are the harder you squeeze chapter twentynine contents prev next he wasnt going to tolerate it the idiot police were certainly on the giambelli payroll he had no doubt of it of course they could prove nothing but the muscle in jerrys cheek twitched as doubts danced in his head no he was sure of that sure of it hed been very very careful but that was beside the point the giambellis had publicly humiliated him once before avanos affair with his wife had put his name on wagging tongues forced him to change his life his lifestyle he could hardly have remained married to the unfaithful slut particularly when people knew it had cost him placement and prestige in the company in his greatuncles eyes a man who lost a wife to a competitor could lose accounts to a competitor and jerry always considered the la coeur heir apparent particularly by himself had been taken down a painful peg the giambellis hadnt suffered because of it the three giambelli women had remained above it all the talk of pilar had been respectful sympathy of sophia quiet admiration and there was never talk of the great la signora or hadnt been jerry reminded himself until hed made it happen years in the planning and stylish in its execution his revenge had cut through to the core of giambelli it had sliced through the family keen as a scalpel disgrace scandal mistrust and all brought about by their own perfection whod been taken down a peg now even with all his planning his careful stages they were turning it on him they knew hed bested them and they were trying to drag him under he wouldnt permit it did they think hed tolerate having his associates speculate about him a demorney the idea of it made him shake with black bitter rage his own family had questioned him questioned him on business practices the hypocrites oh they didnt mind seeing their market share increase had they asked questions then but at the first sign there might be a ripple in the pond they laid the groundwork to make him a scapegoat he didnt need them either didnt need their sanctimonious questioning of his ethics or his methods or his personal agenda he wouldnt wait for them to ask for his resignation if they would dare to do so he was financially comfortable it might be time to take a break from business an extended vacation a complete relocation hed move to europe and there his reputation alone would ensure him a top position with any company he selected when he was ready to work again when he was ready to pay la coeur back for their disloyalty but before he restructured his life yet again he would finish the job personally this time macmillan thought he didnt have the guts to pull his own trigger hed learn differently jerry promised himself they would all learn differently the giambelli women were going to pay dearly for offending him sophia zipped through her interoffice email shed have preferred attending to the reports the memos the questions personally in her san francisco office but the law had been laid down she didnt go to the city unaccompanied period tyler refused to be pulled away from the fields the weeding wasnt complete the suckering was just begun and there was a mild infestation of grape leafhoppers nothing very troublesome she thought with a little twist of resentment as she answered an inquiry the wasps fed on the leafhopper eggs thats why blackberry bushes which served as hosts for the predator were planted throughout the vineyard hardly a season passed without a slight infestation but there were stories and those who loved to tell them of an entire crop being devastated by the little bastards she wouldnt budge tyler until he was certain it was under control and by that time shed be so busy with the lastminute details of her mothers wedding she wouldnt be able to spare a day to go into the office much less out to the vineyards when the wedding was over the harvest would begin then no one would have time for anything but the crush at least the demands the tight schedule helped keep her mind off jerry and the police investigation it had been two full weeks since shed careened around turns with no brakes as far as she could tell the investigation was at a standstill jerry demorney was a different matter she too had her sources she was perfectly aware there was talk about him questions not only by the police but by his superiors and the board members led mortifyingly she hoped by his own greatuncle it was some satisfaction to know he was being squeezed as her family had been squeezed between the greedy fists of gossip and suspicion she brought up another email clicked to open the attached file as she watched it scroll onscreen her heart stumbled then began to race it was a copy of the next ad one set to run in august a family picnic a wash of sunlight the dapple of shade from a huge old oak a scatter of people at a long wooden table that was loaded with food and bottles of wine the image sophia had handpicked was of several generations a mix of faces expressions movement the young mother with a baby in her lap the little boy wrestling with a puppy on the grass a father with a young girl riding his shoulders at the head of the table the model whod reminded her of eli sat his glass lifted as if in a toast there was laughter in the picture continuity family tradition this image had been altered subtly slickly three of the models faces had been replaced sophia studied her grandmother her mother herself her eyes were wide with horror her mouth gaping with it stabbed into her chest like a knife was a bottle of wine it read this is your moment itll be the death of you and yours you son of a bitch you son of a bitch she jabbed the keyboard ordered the copy to print saved the file then closed it he wouldnt shake her she promised herself and he wouldnt threaten her family with impunity she would deal with him she would handle this she started to slap the hard copy of the ad in a file hesitated youre a handler tyler had told her suckering the vines was a pleasant way to spend a summers day the sun was warm the breeze mild as a kiss under the brilliant blue cup of sky the circling vacas were upholstered with green the hills rolling down lush with the promise of summer his grapes were protected from that streaming midday sun by a lovely verdant canopy of leaves natures parasol his grandfather called it the crop was more than half its mature size and before long the black grape varieties would begin changing color green berries miraculously going blue then purple as they pushed toward that last spurt of maturity and harvest each stage of growth required tending just as each stage brought the season to its inevitable promise when sophia crouched beside him he continued his work and his pleasure i thought you were going to hole up in your office all day waste this sunshine hell of a way to make a living if you ask me i thought a big important vintner like yourself would have more to do than suckering vines personally she combed a hand through his hair lavishly streaked by the sun wheres your hat pal around somewhere these pinot noir are going to be our earliest to ripen ive got a hundred down with paulie on these babies i say theyre going to give us our best vintage in five years his moneys on the chenin blanc ill take a piece of that mines on the pinot chardonnay you ought to save your money youre going to need it financing maddys brainstorm its an innovative forwardthinking project shes already buried me in data were putting together a proposal for la signora you want to rub grape seeds all over your body i could do it for you no charge he shifted their knees bumped before he laid a hand on hers whats the matter baby i got another message another doctored ad it came through a file attached to interoffice email as his hand tensed she turned hers over so their fingers linked ive already called it was sent under pjs screen name she hasnt sent me any posts today someone either used her computer or had her account information and password it couldve come from anywhere where is it back home i printed it out locked it in a drawer im going to send it to the police add it to their pile but i wanted to tell you first as much as i hate the idea i suppose the thing to do is call a summit meeting so everyone in the familys aware and on guard but i wanted to tell you first he stayed as he was crouched his hand dwarfing hers overhead a cloud teased the edges of the sun and filtered the light heres what i want to do i want to hunt him down and peel the skin off his bones with a dull knife until that happy day i want you to promise me something if i can no sophie theres no if you dont go anywhere by yourself not even from the villa to here not even for a walk in the gardens or a quick trip to the goddamn minimart i mean it i understand how worried you are but you cant understand because its unreasonable its indescribable he tripped her heart by bringing her free hand up pressing his lips to the palm if i wake up in the middle of the night and youre not there i break out in a cold sweat ty shut up just shut up in one fast and fluid move he got to his feet to walk off the nerves and the rage ive never loved anyone before i didnt expect it to be you but it is and thats it youre not doing anything to mess this up for me well naturally we cant have that he turned gave her a look of profound frustration you know what i mean sophie fortunately for you i do i dont intend to mess this up for you or me either great lets go pack your things im not moving in with you why the hell not frustration had him dragging his hands through his hair youre there half the time anyway and dont give me that lame excuse about needing to be home to help with the wedding its not a lame excuse its a reason potentially a lame reason i dont want to live with you why just tell me why maybe im oldfashioned like hell you are maybe im oldfashioned she repeated in this one area i dont think we should live together i think we should get married thats just another the words sank in momentarily dulled his brain whoa yes and with that scintillating response i need to go back home and call the police you know one day youre actually going to let me work through a process at my own time and pace but since that isnt the case on this one at least you could ask me in a more traditional way you want me to ask you fine will you marry me sure novembers good for me he cupped her elbows lifted her a couple inches off the ground which was when i was going to ask you but you always have to be first i figured we could get married have a nice honeymoon and be back home before pruning time kind of a tidy and symbolic cycle dont you think i dont know i have to think about it culo back at you honey he gave her a hard kiss then dropped her back on her feet let me finish this vine then well go call the cops and the family ty mmm just because i did the proposing doesnt mean i dont want a ring yeah yeah ill get to it ill pick it out no you wont why not im the one wholl be wearing it youre the one wearing your face too but you didnt pick that out either on a sigh she knelt beside him that makes absolutely no sense but she tipped her head onto his shoulder as he worked when i came here i was scared and angry now im scared angry and happy its better she decided a lot better this is who we are tereza stated lifting her glass and who we choose to be they were dining alfresco in a kind of giambelli reflection of the ad a purposeful choice sophia thought her grandmother would stand straight against a threat and kick it dead in the balls if need be the evening was warm the sunlight still brilliant in the vineyards beyond the lawns and gardens the grapes were growing fat and the pinot noir as tyler had predicted was just beginning to turn forty days till harvest sophia thought that was the old rule when the grapes took color harvest was forty days away her mother would be married by then and just back from her honeymoon maddy and theo would be her brother and sister and back in school she would be planning her own wedding though shed pressured tyler not to announce their engagement yet life could continue because as la signora said this is who they were and who they chose to be when we have trouble tereza continued we band together family friends this year has brought trouble and changes and grief but its also brought joy in a few weeks eli and i will have a new son and more grandchildren and it seems she added turning toward maddy a new enterprise in the meantime weve been threatened ive given considerable thought to what can and should be done james your legal opinion of our options he set down his fork gathered his thoughts while evidence indicates demorney was involved even perhaps instrumental in the embezzlement scheme the tampering theres no concrete proof donatos claims notwithstanding there isnt enough to convince the district attorney to file charges on those matters or tony avanos death its been confirmed that he was in new york when sophias car was tampered with he would have hired someone david began be that as it may and i dont disagree until the police have evidence against them theres nothing they can do and nothing james added you can do my best advice is to stay above it let the system work no offense intended to you or your system uncle james but it hasnt been working very well to date donato was murdered while he was in the system sophia pointed out and david was shot on a public street those are matters for the italian authorities sophie and only tie our hands all the more hes harassing sophie with those ads tyler shoved at his plate why cant they be traced back to him i wish i had the answers this isnt a stupid man or thus far a careless one if hes at the core of all of this hes covered himself with layers of protection alibis he walked into my apartment sat down and shot my father in cold blood id consider that at the very least a careless act he needs to be punished he should be hounded and pursued and harassed just as hes hounded pursued and harassed the family sophia helen reached across the table im sorry sometimes justice isnt what we want it to be or what we expect he set out to ruin us tereza spoke calmly he hasnt done so damaged yes caused us loss but hell pay a price for it today he was asked to resign his position at la coeur im pleased to believe that discussions eli and i had with certain members of their board and discussions david had with key executives bore this particular fruit she sipped her wine enjoyed the bouquet im told he didnt take it well ill use whatever influence i have at my disposal to see to it he finds no position at any reputable winemaker professionally hes finished its not enough sophia began it may be too much helen corrected if hes as dangerous as you believe this sort of interference will push him into a corner make it only more imperative that he strike back as a lawyer as your friend im asking you all of you to leave it alone mom linc shook his head could you yes the single syllable was a fierce declaration to protect what mattered most i could i would tereza your daughter is about to be married shes found happiness shes weathered a storm and so have all of you this is a time for you to celebrate to move on not to focus on revenge and retribution we each protect what matters most helen in our own way the suns going she said tyler light the candles its a pleasant evening we should enjoy it tell me do you still pit your pinot noir against my chenin blanc i do he worked his way down the table setting the candles to flame of course its a winwin situation as were merged when he reached the head of the table he met her eyes speaking of mergers im going to marry sophia damn it ty i told you quiet he said so casually sophia sputtered into silence shes the one who asked me but i thought it was a pretty good idea oh sophie pilar leaped up from the table and rushed to throw her arms around her daughter i only wanted to wait until after your wedding to tell you but big mouth here couldnt keep it shut that part was her idea too tyler agreed as he circled the table sophies not wrong that often so its hard to get it through her head when she is the way i figure it you just cant have enough good news here he grabbed her hand holding it when she tugged he took a ring out of his pocket and slipped the simple and spectacular squarecut diamond on her finger that makes it a deal why cant you just its beautiful it was my grandmothers macmillan to giambelli he took her hand lifted it and kissed it giambelli to macmillan it works for me she sighed i really hate it when youre right revenge jerry decided made stranger bedfellows than politics not that theyd quite gotten to the bed yet but they would rene was so much easier a mark than hed have believed i appreciate your seeing me like this listening hearing me out he reached for renes hand i was afraid you believed those vicious rumors the giambellis are circulating i wouldnt believe any of them if they said the sun came up in the east rene settled back on the sofa made herself cozy over and above her loathing for the giambellis was a keen sense for a man with money she was quickly running out of cash tony damn him hadnt been honest with her shed already sold off some jewelry and if she didnt land another fish soon shed have to go back to work im not saying i didnt play hardball thats my job believe me la coeur was behind me all the way until things got sticky sounds like the way the giambellis treated tony exactly oh hed use that use that and her innate hatred to turn his tide don offered me inside information i took it of course the giambellis cant have that stand cant abide people knowing they were undermined by their own so it has to be me i have to have coerced or finagled or bribed or god knows i took what was offered its not like i held a gun to their heads he broke off squeezed her hand jesus rene im so sorry what a stupid thing to say its all right if tony hadnt lied to me hadnt cheated and snuck around with that little tramp who worked with sophia hed still be alive today and she wouldnt be damn near broke kris drake for effect he pressed a hand to his brow i didnt know about her and tony before i hired her the idea that she might have had something to do with tonys death if she did she was still working for them theyre behind it all of it could she be more perfect he only wished hed thought of using rene months before theyve ruined my reputation i guess i brought part of that on myself i shouldnt have wanted to win so much winnings all there is he smiled at her and im a man who hates to lose in anything you know when i first saw you i didnt know you and tony were an item and i well i never got the chance to compete there so i suppose that doesnt qualify as losing more wine yes thanks she pursed her lips considering how to play it while he reached over for the bottle i was swept away by tonys charm she began and i admired what i thought was his ambition im very attracted to clever businessmen really i used to be one he said as he poured the wine now jerry youre still a clever businessman youll land on your feet i want to believe that im thinking of moving to france i have some offers there or would have he thought grimly damn well would have luckily i dont need the money i can pick and choose take my time it might do me good to just travel awhile enjoy the benefits of the years of hard work ive put in i love traveling she purred it i dont feel i can leave until ive straightened all this out until ive dealt with the giambellis facetoface ill be frank with you rene because i think youll understand i want to pay them back for putting this smear on me i do understand in what could be taken for sympathy or otherwise she laid a hand over his heart they always treated me like something cheap that could be easily ignored she worked tears into her eyes i hate them rene he moved in slowly maybe we can find a way to pay them back for both of us later when she lay naked her head pillowed on his shoulder he smiled into the dark tonys widow was going to clear his path straight into the heart of the giambellis and he would rip it out it was going to be fun rene dressed carefully for the role she was about to play dark conservative suit minimal makeup she and jerry had worked it all out just what shed say just how shed behave hed made her rehearse countless times the man was a little too demanding for her taste but she figured shed bring him around if she kept him long enough for now he was useful entertaining and a means to an end and he as most did underestimated her he didnt realize she knew he also considered her useful entertaining and a means to an end but rene foxx was nobodys fool particularly no mans fool jerry demorney was dirty up to the knot of his hermes tie if he hadnt called the shots in that whole product tampering business shed start wearing offtherack suits gave those rotten giambellis a good kick in the ass with that one she mused as far as she was concerned a man smart and devious enough to pull that off was just what she was looking for she decided walking into the homicide division with the box in her hands was her first step into a very lucrative tomorrow i need to see detective claremont or maguire she began then spotted claremont just rising from behind his desk oh detective she was pleased shed tagged him first she always did better with men i have to see you right away its urgent please is there somewhere take it easy mrs avano he took her arm how about some coffee oh i couldnt i couldnt keep anything down ive been up half the night she was focused on the job at hand and missed his quick signal to his partner well talk in the coffee room why dont you tell me whats upset you yes i detective maguire its good youre here too im so confused so upset she set the safe box on the table pushed it to the center as if she wanted distance then sat i was going through some of tonys things his papers i hadnt gotten to all of them yet i couldnt before i found this box on the top shelf of his closet i couldnt imagine what might be in it id already had to deal with all the insurance papers the legal papers she fluttered her hands there was a key in his jewelry case i remembered coming across it before but not knowing what it was for this she said gesturing it was for this open it please i dont want to look through it again records she said when claremont opened the box and began to sift through the paperwork ledgers or whatever theyre called from that false account the giambellis set up tony he mustve known and thats why they had him killed i know he must have been gathering this evidence trying to do the right thing and it cost him his life claremont glanced through the accounts and correspondence passing the sheets on to maguire you believe your husband was killed over these papers yes yes what was he rene thought impatiently an idiot im afraid i might be partially responsible im afraid of what might happen to me i know someones been watching me she said dropping her voice it sounds paranoid i know but im sure of it i snuck out of my own apartment like a thief to come here i think theyve hired someone to watch me who would do that the giambellis she reached out gripped claremonts hand theyre wondering if i remember but i didnt i didnt until i found this and if they know theyll kill me that you know what that sophia killed my tony rene covered her mouth with her hand and sacrificed her makeup to tears thats a serious accusation maguire rose to grab some tissues why are you making it renes breath hitched her hand trembled as she reached for the tissues when i found these i remembered id come home it was so long ago a year ago sophia was there she and tony were arguing upstairs she was furious and he was trying to calm her down they didnt even know id come in i went into the kitchen i could still hear her she was shouting as she does when shes in that terrible temper of hers she said she wasnt going to stand for it that it was none of his business i didnt hear what he said because his voice was low she dabbed at tears again tony never raised his voice to her he adored her but she she detested him because of me the cardianili account she said the name but i didnt think of it again the cardianili account would be left alone and that would be the end of it if he did anything with the ledgers she would make him pay she said very clearly if you dont leave this alone ill kill you i came out of the kitchen then because it made me angry almost at the same time she came flying down the stairs she saw me said something vicious in italian then stormed out she released a shuddering breath sniffled delicately when i asked tony about it i could see he was shaken but he brushed it off said it was business and she was just blowing off steam i let it go sophia often blew off steam that way i never thought she meant what she said but she did he knew shed been involved in embezzlement and she killed him for it so maguire tipped back her chair when she and her partner were alone you buy any of that for somebody who didnt sleep last night she looked pretty alert for somebody terrified and upset she remembered to match her shoes to her purse and coordinate her hose youre a real fashion cop partner no way she just came across these papers shed have been through every drawer closet and cubbyhole within a day of his death to make sure she had access to every penny maguire i dont think you like the widow avano i dont like people who think im stupid question if she had these papers all along why turn them over now if she didnt have them before who passed them to her demorneys in san francisco claremont tapped the tips of his fingers together wonder how far he and the widow go back one thing for certain theyve both got it in for the giambellis and that one wants to put the screws to sophia g and she wants it bad bad enough to give a false statement to the police oh hell she enjoyed that and shes smart enough to know she didnt say anything we could hook her on we cant prove if and when she found those papers and if it came down to it the argument scene would be her word against sophias whos likely to have argued with her father at some point during the last year of his life no way to cook her on that even if we wanted to bother never made sense for her to marry avano and kill him the day after she doesnt gel there for me doesnt gain her anything and shes in it for what she can get if we bought this she could cop a little revenge thats what shes after now yeah and sos demorney claremont rose lets see how tight we can link them chapter thirty contents prev rene slithered onto the sofa beside jerry and accepted the flute of champagne i got some very interesting information at the salon today what might that be ill tell you she ran a fingertip down the center of his shirt but itll cost you really he took her hand lifted it to bite gently on her wrist oh thats nice too but i want something a little different lets go out lover im so tired of staying in take me out to a club where therere people and music and wicked things going on honey you know id love to its not smart for us to be seen together in public quite yet she pouted nuzzled against him well go somewhere nobody knows us and even if they do tonys been dead for months and months no one expects me to grieve alone forever from the reports that had winged back across the atlantic rene hadnt grieved alone for a week just a little

villa giambelli she wanted it to be perfect the kind of night theyd all remember and laugh about for years shed planned it organized it finetuned the details right down to the scent of the candles for the aromatherapy treatments in twentyfour hours sophia thought her mother would be dressing for her wedding but for her last evening as a single woman she was going to bask in a world of females when we have our products maybe we should sell direct to spas for a while maddy sniffed at the oils already arranged by the massage table make them like exclusive so people are dying for them youre a clever girl madeline but no business tonight tonight is for female ritual were the handmaidens do we get to talk about sex of course this isnt about exchanging recipes ah theres the woman of the hour sophie already in her long white wrap pilar circled the pool house i cant believe you went to all this trouble various stations were set up with lounging sofas and salon chairs the evening light shimmered toward sunset while scents from the gardens clung to the air tables held abundant platters of fruit and chocolate bottles of wine and sparkling water baskets and bowls of flowers along the wall water spilled down the brass sculpture and into the pool to add sensuous music i was shooting for a roman bath thing do you like it really its wonderful i feel like a queen when youre finished youll feel like a goddess where are the others were wasting pampering time upstairs ill get them no you wont maddy pour mama some wine shes not to lift a finger except to pick up a chocolate strawberry ill get everyone what kind do you want maddy asked her just water for now honey thanks its such a lovely evening she wandered toward the open doors then laughed lightly massage tables on the patio only sophie i never had a massage before mmm youll love it as she spoke as she looked out over the garden pilar ran a hand absently over maddys hair left it lying on her shoulder the gesture made everything inside the girl go warm and made her sigh whats wrong nothing maddy passed pilar the glass nothings wrong i guess im looking forward to everything youre bluffing david said around the cigar clamped in his teeth and tried to stare eli down yeah put your money up son and call me go ahead dad theo had a cigar unlit in his teeth as well and felt like a man no guts no glory david tossed chips in the pot call show em three little deuces eli began and watched davids eyes gleam standing watch over two pretty ladies son of a bitch a scotsman doesnt bluff over money son eli jubilant raked in his chips the mans scalped me so many times over the years i wear a helmet when we sit down to cards james gestured with his glass youll learn lincs head came up at the knock on the door somebody ordered a stripper right i knew you guys wouldnt let me down its the pizza theo leaped up more pizza theo you cant possibly want more pizza sure i can he shouted over his shoulder to his father ty said i could i said he could order it for me he inhaled the last order linc sent tyler a sorrowful look you couldnt arrange for a stripper to deliver the pizza they were all out of strippers shriners convention likely story well i hope he got pepperoni at least my god sophie this was a brilliant idea thanks aunt helen they sat side by side tipped back with purifying masks thick and green covering their faces i wanted mama to feel relaxed and completely female thisll do it can you see tereza and maddy over there getting pedicures and arguing mmm sophia mused they disagree about the name for the beauty products we dont even have yet i dont know if its maddy or the concept but its boosted nonnas morale im glad to hear it ive been worried about her all of you since we talked last the idea of rene trying to make tony a hero and you a villain over the cardianili business it fries my cookies sophia tensed deliberately relaxed again it was a stupid move demorneys behind it and its one of the first truly stupid moves hes made hes cracking that may be but it caused more upset she held up a hand and thats all im going to say about it tonights not about problems its about indulgence wheres pilar dont think about it sophia ordered herself think pure thoughts treatment room b otherwise known as the lowerlevel guest bath fullbody facial you need to be near a shower fabulous im next champagne maria sophia roused herself enough to sit up youre not to serve youre a guest my manicures dry she showed off her nails i have a pedicure next you can bring me champagne then thats a deal maria glanced over as pilar looking soft and relaxed came back in youve made your mama happy tonight everythings going to be all right now you sure know how to show a woman a good time jerry ran a hand over the butt of renes snug black pants you havent seen anything yet this is going to be a night to remember for everyone they moved through the vineyard now it had been a long hike from the car and the sack he carried seemed to gain weight with every step still there was something to be said for doing the job himself that he hadnt experienced before not just the amused gratification hed felt at other times but a deep and personal excitement and if anything went wrong hed simply sacrifice rene but he didnt intend for anything to go wrong he knew the setup here between don and kris and his own observations he was aware of the security setup and how to avoid setting off alarms it was simply a matter of patience and care and a single driving ambition before the night was over giambelli would one way or another be in ruins stay close he told her i am not to spoil the party but i wish i was as sure as you are this is going to work no second thoughts now i know what im doing and how to do it once the winerys on fire theyll come spilling out like ants at a picnic i dont care if you burn the whole fucking vineyard to ashes in fact she got a thrill out of the image and of her dancing at the edge of the flames i just dont want to get caught do what i tell you and you wont once theyre out here busy trying to put out the fire we go in plant the package in sophias room get out were in the car and heading back five minutes later we call the cops from a pay phone give them an anonymous tip and were back at your place popping champagne before the smoke clears the old ladyll pay off the cops she wont let her precious granddaughter go to prison maybe let her try it wont matter theyll be ruined sooner or later you find the right straw and thats the one that breaks the back isnt that what you want something in his voice had a chill snaking up her spine but she nodded its exactly what i want when he reached the winery he took out the keys don had been slick enough to make copies and hed been smart enough to duplicate those these get tossed in the bay when were done he slid the key into the first lock no ones going to need them after tonight theyll have a hell of a time explaining how a fire started inside a locked building with that statement he opened the door sophia lay on the massage table and looked up at the stars mama am i obsessive yes is that a bad thing pilar glanced back from her stance at the edge of the patio no occasionally annoying but not bad do i miss the big picture because im drilling on the details rarely why do you ask i was wondering what id change about myself if i could if i should i wouldnt change anything because im perfect sophia asked with a grin no because youre mine is this about ty no its about me up until well im not exactly sure when but up until i was sure i had everything figured out knew what i wanted and how i was going to get it not sure anymore oh no im still sure i still know what i want and how im going to get it but the things i want changed on me i was wondering if they were there all along and i was just missing the big picture i could you give us a minute she said to the therapist she sat up holding the sheet to her breast when she was alone with pilar please dont get upset i wont not that long ago i still wanted you and dad to get back together i wanted it because i didnt know how to want anything else i think because i felt if you did hed be what i needed him to be not what you needed or what he was but what needed that was the detail i kept obsessing over and i missed the big picture id change that if i could i wouldnt you wouldve been a good daughter to him if hed let you you were willing to be you needed to be no i wouldnt change that that helps she took pilars wrist turned it to check the time on her watch its just midnight happy wedding day mama she pressed pilars hand to her cheek then started to lie back whats that it looks like oh my god the winery the winerys on fire maria maria call nineoneone the winerys on fire she rolled off the table and snagged her robe on the run as jerry had predicted they poured out of the house raised voices running feet from the shadows of the garden he counted the figures wrapped in white robes that raced down the path and out across the vineyard in and out he whispered to rene piece of cake you lead the way shed given him the location and setup of sophias room but he wanted her going in first she might have made a mistake she claimed shed only slipped into sophias room once but that was once more than hed managed he couldnt risk turning on the light though he was sure his flashlight would be enough he only needed to plant the package at the back of her closet where the police even if they were idiots would find it he moved up behind rene up the terrace steps glancing over his shoulder he could see the bright orange and gold of the fire against the night sky a brilliant sight it illuminated the figures rushing like frightened moths toward the flame theyd put it out of course but not quickly it would take time for them to realize the water had been turned off for the sprinkler system time for them to gather their wits time for them to watch helplessly as precious bottles exploded as equipment was ruined as their god of tradition burned to hell so he didnt have the guts to do his own dirty work gingerly he flexed his hand it still twinged now and then theyd see who had the guts when the sun came up jerry for gods sake rene hissed at him from the terrace outside sophias room this isnt a tourist attraction you said we had to hurry always time for a moment of pleasure darling he stepped swaggered up to the terrace door sure this is hers yes im sure well then he pushed open the doors stepped inside and drew a deep satisfied breath of her scent just as sophia dashed through the opposite door and slapped on the lights the sudden glare slashed across his eyes the shock froze his brain before he could recover from either he was fighting off a hundred and ten pounds of enraged woman she leaped at him blind fury catapulting her across the room even as she sank her teeth into him the edges of her vision glowed red with blood lust her only clear thought was to inflict pain monstrous pain and when he howled the feral thrill of it spurted through her like lava he struck out caught her across the cheekbone but she didnt even feel it she went for his eyes freshly manicured nails already tipped red slashed out missed by a breath and scored like the tongs of a rake down his cheek the burn of it maddened with no goal but to free himself he tossed her aside and sent her into a shrieking rene he could smell his own blood intolerable shed ruined all his careful plans unforgivable even as she scrabbled to her feet prepared to leap at him again the gun was out of the pouch in his hand with his finger sweaty on the trigger he nearly ended it then with one quick twitch of his nervous finger then her body jerked to a halt and her eyes cleared of rage and filled with shock and fear finally he thought facetoface and he wanted more than survival he wanted satisfaction now isnt this interesting you shouldve run out with the others sophia but maybe its fate you end like your worthless father with a bullet in the heart jerry we have to get out of here just go rene pushed herself to her feet stared at the gun my god whatre you doing you cant just shoot her oh he thought he could and that was a revelation he didnt believe hed have any trouble with it at all and why not thats crazy its murder im not having any part of murder im getting out im getting out now give me the keys to the car give me the damn keys shut the fuck up he said it coolly and in an almost absent gesture smashed the gun into the side of her head when she went down like a stone he didnt even glance at her but kept his eyes locked on sophias she was a pain in the ass on that we can agree but shes useful and this is perfect youll appreciate the spin on this sophia rene started the fire shes had it in for you all along she went to the cops a few days ago tried to convince them youd killed your father and tonight she came here fired the winery and broke into your room to plant evidence against you you caught her you struggled the gun went off the gun he added used to shoot david cutter i had it sent to me forwardthinking which im sure youll appreciate youre dead and she hangs for it very tidy why because nobody screws with me and gets away with it you giambellis think you can have it all and now youll end up with nothing because of my father she could see the bright orange glow from the fire through the open doors behind him all of this because my father embarrassed you embarrassed he stole from me my wife my pride my life and what did any of you lose nothing just another bump to you ive taken my own back and more id have been satisfied to ruin you but deads better youre the key tereza well shes not as young as she was your mother she hasnt got what it takes to bring the company back without you the heart and the brains are dead your father was a user a liar and a cheat yes he was no one would come for her she thought there would be no one to race back from the fire to save her she would face death on her own youre all that and so much less if there was time wed debate that but im a little pressed so he brought the gun up another inch ciao bella vai a farti fottere she cursed him in a steady voice she wanted to close her eyes to find a prayer an image of something to take with her but she kept them open waited when the gun exploded she stumbled back and watched blood seep through the tiny hole in his shirt baffled shock crossed his face then another shot jerked his body to the side and dropped him in the doorway helen lowered the gun to her side oh my god oh god aunt helen her legs gave out sophia stumbled to the bed lowered herself to it he was going to kill me i know slowly helen came into the room sat heavily on the bed beside sophia i came back to tell you the men had come i saw he was going to kill me just like he killed my father no honey he didnt kill your father i did i did she repeated and dropped the gun she held to the floor im so sorry no thats crazy i used that gun it was my fathers it was never registered i dont know why i took it that night i dont think i planned to kill him i wasnt thinking at all he wanted money again it was never going to end what are you talking about sophia took her shoulders she could smell gunpowder and blood what are you saying linc he was using linc against me linc god help me linc is tonys son theyve got it under control its pilar rushed in the terrace doors stopped cold oh dear god sophie no wait sophia sprang to her feet dont come in dont touch anything her breath came out in pants but she was thinking thinking fast aunt helen come with me come with me

i killed tony pilar i betrayed you myself everything i believe in thats not possible for gods sake what happened here she saved my life sophia said a blast rent the air as bottles exploded in the winery she barely flinched he was going to kill me with the gun that shot david hed sent for it kept it like a souvenir helen what happened with my father he wanted money over the years hed contact me when he needed money he never actually demanded never actually threatened hed just mention linc what a fine boy he was what a bright and promising young man then hed say he needed a bit of a loan i slept with tony she began to weep then silently all those years ago we were all so young james and i were having problems i was so angry with him so confused we separated for a few weeks i remember pilar murmured i ran into tony he was so understanding so sympathetic you and he werent getting along either you were considering a separation he was charming and he paid attention the way james hadnt been theres no excuse i let it happen after i was so ashamed so disgusted with myself but it was done and couldnt be changed i found out i was pregnant it wasnt jamess because we hadnt been together that way so i made my second hideous mistake and i told tony i might as well have told him id decided to change my hairstyle he could hardly be expected to pay for one nights indiscretion could he so i paid tears dripped down her cheeks and i paid linc is tonys child hes jamess helen looked pleadingly at pilar in every way but that one he doesnt know neither of them know i did everything i could to make up for that night to james to linc god pilar to you i slept with my best friends husband i was young and angry and stupid and ive never forgiven myself for it but i did everything i could to make it up i gave him money every time he asked for it i dont even know how much over the years and you couldnt give any more pilar concurred the night of the party he told me he had to see me told me when and where i refused it was the first time id done so it made him angry and that frightened me if i didnt do as he said hed go inside then and there and tell james tell linc tell you i couldnt risk it couldnt bear it my baby pilar my little boy with the loose shoelaces when i went home i got the gun out of the safe its been there for years i dont know why i thought of it dont know why i took it it was like a veil over my mind he had music on in the apartment and a good bottle of wine he sat and told me his financial troubles charmingly as if we were old dear friends i dont remember everything he said im not even sure i heard him he needed what he liked to call a loan a quarter of a million this time hed be willing of course to take half by the end of the week and give me another month for the rest it wasnt too much to ask after all hed given me such a fine son i didnt know the gun was in my hand i didnt know id used it until i saw the red against his white tuxedo shirt he looked at me so surprised just a little annoyed i could almost imagine him saying damn helen youve ruined my shirt but he didnt of course he didnt say anything i went home and tried to convince myself it had never happened never happened at all ive carried the gun around with me ever since everywhere you could have thrown it away pilar said quietly how could i what if one of you were arrested id need it then to prove id done it myself i couldnt let him hurt my baby or james i thought it could be over and now i need to tell james and linc first i need to tell them before i talk to the police cycles sophia thought sometimes they needed to be stopped if you hadnt used that gun to save my life tonight you wouldnt have to tell them anything i love you helen said simply i know it and this is what happened here tonight just exactly what happened she took helen by the shoulders pay attention to me you came back saw jerry holding me at gunpoint hed brought both guns with him hed intended to plant them in my room to implicate me wed struggled and the other gun the one that killed my father was on the floor near the doorway you picked it up and you shot him before he shot me sophia thats what happened she took helens hand squeezed it took her mothers isnt it mama yes thats exactly what happened you saved my child do you think i wouldnt save yours i cant yes you can you want to make it up to me pilar demanded then youll do this i dont care about what happened one night almost thirty years ago but i care about what happened tonight i care about what youve been to me most of my life im not going to let someone i love be destroyed over what over money over pride over image if you love me if you want to make up for that mistake so long ago youll do exactly what sophies asking you to do tony was her father who has more right to decide than she jerrys dead sophia said he killed threatened destroyed all because of one selfish act by my father and it ends here im going to go call the police someone should take a look at rene she leaned forward brushed her lips over helens cheek thank you for the rest of my life late late into the night sophia sat in the kitchen sipping tea laced with brandy shed given her statement had sat her hand holding helens as helen had given hers justice she thought didnt always come as you expected helen had said that once and here it was unexpected justice it hadnt hurt that rene had been hysterical had babbled to everyone including claremont and maguire when theyd arrived that jerry was a madman a murderer and had forced her at gunpoint to come with him some snakes slithered through sophia supposed because life was a messy business now at last the police were gone the house was quiet she looked up as her mother and grandmother came in aunt helen shes finally sleeping pilar went to the cupboard got two more cups weve talked shell be all right shes going to resign her judgeship i suppose she needs to pilar set the cups on the table ive told mama everything sophia i felt she had a right to know nonna sophia reached for her hand did i do the right thing you did the loving thing that often matters more it was brave of you sophia brave of both of you it makes me proud she sat down sighed helen took a life and gave one back that closes the circle we wont speak of it again tomorrow my daughters getting married and well have joy in this house again soon the harvest the bounty and another season ends the next is yours she said to sophia yours and tylers your life your legacies eli and i are retiring the first of the year nonna torches are meant to be passed take what i give you the faint irritation in her grandmothers voice made her smile i will thank you nonna now its late the bride needs her sleep and so do i she got to her feet leaving her tea untouched your young man went back to the winery you dont need so much sleep true enough sophia thought as she raced across the grounds toward the winery she had so much energy so much life inside her she didnt think shed ever need to sleep again hed set up lights and the old building hulked under them she could see the sparkle of broken glass from the windows the smears from smoke the chars from flame but still it stood it withstood perhaps he sensed her she liked to think so he stepped out of the broken doorway as she ran up and he caught her held her close and tight and inches off the ground there you are sophia i figured you needed a little time with your mother then i was coming to get you i got you first hold on okay just keep holding on you can count on it even as he did the ice skimmed through his belly again he pressed his face to her hair god god when i think dont think dont she said and turned her mouth to his im not going to be able to let you out of my sight for the next oh ten or fifteen years right now that suits me fine you all alone here yeah david needed to get the kids home and i sent granddad back before he keeled over he was exhausted james was still pretty shaken so linc took him back to my place since your moms with helen good everythings as it should be she rested her head on his shoulder looked toward the winery it could have been worse he eased her back touched his lips gently to the bruise on her cheek it could have been a hell of a lot worse you shouldve seen the other guy he managed a strangled laugh as he held her tight again thats a little sick maybe but its the way i feel he died with my mark on his face and im glad of it im glad i caused him some pain and now i can put it away all of it lock it away and everything starts now everything ty she said well rebuild the winery rebuild our lives and make them ours giambellimacmillan is going to come back bigger and better than ever thats what i want thats handy because thats what i want too lets go home sophie she tucked her hand in his and walked away from the damage and the scars the first hints of dawn lightened the sky in the east when the sun broke through she thought it was going to be a beautiful beginning
