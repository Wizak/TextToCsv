the occurrences of that night sixteen years ago had all come rushing back in a flood of vivid memories and the beat of trasks heart had picked up speedtomatchthesuddenflowof adrenaline david he said making it a question chung answered with a grim nod simply that and whisked him into the elevator but as the doors slid shut on them and they were alone he uttered those words which trask most dreaded

ebranch i harrys passing to the members of ebranch bad dreams were an occupational hazard it was generally accepted that nightmares went with the work ben trask current head of the branch had always had his share of bad dreams indeed since the yulian bodescu affair twelve years ago hed had more than his share and only half of them when he was asleep the sleeping ones were of the harmless variety they frightened but couldnt kill you they were engendered of the waking sort which were very different sometimes they could kill and worse because they were real as for this one it wasnt so much a bad as a weird dream and weirder because trask was wide awake having driven his car through the wee small hours of a rainy night into the heart of london and parked it opposite ebranch hq without knowing why and trask was fussy about things like that he generally liked to be responsible for his actions it was a sunday in midfebruary of one of those rare days when trask could get away from his work and switch off or rather switch on to the normal world which existed outside the branch it should have been one of those days anyway but here he was at ebranch hq in the middle of the sleeping city and in the eye of his mind this weird dream which wouldnt go away this daydream repeating over and over like flick ering frames from an old monochrome movie projected onto a window so that he could see right through it a ghost film if he blinked his eyes rapidly it would vanish however momentarily and return just as soon as he relaxed a corpse smouldering with its firebjackened arms flung wide steaming head thrown back as in the final agony of death tumbling end over end into a black void shot through with thin neon bars or ribbons of blue green and red light it was a tortured thing yes but dead now from all of its torments and no longer suffering unknown and unknowable as the weird waking dream which it was and yet there was something morbidly familiar about it so that watching it trasks face was grey and his lips drawn back in a silent snarl from his strong slightly yellow teeth if only the corpse would stop tumbling for a moment and come into focus give him a clearer shot of the blistered silently screaming face trask got out of his car into a sudden squall of leaden raindrops as if some invisible one had dipped his hands in water and scooped it into trasks face and muttering a curse as he turned up the collar of his overcoat he glanced at the building across the street craning his neck to peer up at the high windows of ebranch up there he expected to see a light just one burning in a window set centrally in the length of the entire upper storey which was the branch lighting the room which housed the duty officer through his lonely night vigil well he saw the duty officers light right enough and keeping it company three or four more which he hadnt expected but he saw more than the lights for even the rain couldnt wash away the tortured monotonously tumbling figure from the screen of his mind trask knew that if he were someone or thing other than who and what he was head of a topsecret in more than one way esoteric security organization that the experience must surely scare the hell out of him except well hed been scared by experts or he might believe he was going mad but there again ebranch was ebranch this thing he was experiencing it must be in his mind he supposed it had to be for there was no physical mechanism to account for it or was there hallucination well possibly someone could have got to him fed him drugs brainwashed him but to what end why bring him here in the dead of night and why bring these other people here why were they here sir a girl struggled stiffly awkwardly out of the metro she was anna marie english a branch esper english by name but never an english rose nor any sort of rose by any other name she was enervated pallid dowdy a stray cat drowning in the rain it was her talent trask knew and he felt sorry for her she was ecologically aware or as she herself was wont to put it she was as one with the earth when water tables declined and deserts expanded so her skin dried out became desiccated when acid rains ate into scandinavian forests her dandruff fell like snow in her dreams she heard whale species singing sadly of their decline and inevitable extinction and she knew from her aching bones when the japanese were slaughtering the dolphins a human lodestone she tracked illicit nuclear waste monitored pollution shrank from yawning holes in the ozone as a coral polyp from a divers probing spearpoint yes she was an ecopath she felt for the earth and suffered all of its sicknesses and unlike the rest of us knew that she too was dying from them trask looked at her she was twentyfour and looked fifty despite his pity perhaps paradoxically he thought of her in harsh disassociated almost disapproving terms thicklensed spectacles liver spots hearing aid stragglyhaired crumpled blouse splaylegged and knew he disliked her because she mirrored the decline of the world and that was his talent at work ben trask was a human liedetector he recognized a lie when he saw felt heard or otherwise perceived one as other men recognize a slap in the face so that conversely in the absence of falsehood he must acknowledge truth except anna marie englishs truth was unbearable if greenpeace had her and could make the world believe in her they would win their case in one though of course it would be lost at one and the same time for theyd suspect that they were too late but trask also knew that it wasnt quite like that the world was a huge creature and had been sorely wounded and anna marie english was just too small to sustain so much damage but while she was suffering almost beyond endurance the earth could go on taking it for a long time yet this was trasks view of it anyway he supposed it made him an optimist which was something of a paradox in itself can you see it he said do you have any idea what its all about she looked at him and saw a mouseyhaired greeneyed man in his late thirties trask was about five feet ten a little overweight and slopeshouldered and wore what could only be described as a lugubrious expres sion perhaps it had to do with his talent in a world where the plain truth was increasingly hard to find it was no easy thing being a liedetector white lies halftruths and downright fables came at trask from all directions until sometimes he felt he didnt want to look any more but anna marie english had her own problems finally she nodded her bedraggled mop of a head i see it yes but dont ask me what its all about i woke up saw it and knew i had to come here thats all but ive a hunch the worlds a loser yet again her voice was a coughing rasp a hunch this thing isnt specific to me she frowned this time im just an onlooker it isnt hurting me i feel for him yes but his fate doesnt seem to have made much impression on the world in general yet at the same time somehow i think it makes the world less do you know him i feel that i should know him certainly she answered simultaneously shaking her head and ruefully i know that i was watching him when i should have been watching the road i went through two red lights at least trask nodded took her by the elbow and guided her across the street lets join them and see if anyone else has a clue in fact he already had more than a clue but was unwilling to give it voice if he was right then just like the ecopath he could scarcely view this phenomenon as earthdamaging in fact it might even be a relief with whitehall no more than a ten minute walk away the torn front page from a discarded pravda seemed strangely out of place where it spun slowly in the current of the flooded gutter inching soggily and perhaps prophetically towards the ironbarred throat of a gurgling sump but as if in defiance of the stinging rain the night and all other distractions the phantom hologram continued to display itself wherever the glances of trask and anna marie english happened to fall it was there in the tiny unmanned foyer playing on the neutral grey doors of the elevator as if projected there from their eyeballs and when the doors hissed open to admit them they took it with them into the cage to be carried up to the top floor offices of ebranch hq the rest of the building was a wellknown hotel bright lights at the front and a uniformed doorman from the corps of commissionaires sheltering from the rain under his striped plastic canopy or more likely inside taking a coffee with the night clerk now that all the guests were abed but up here on the top floor this was a different world and a weird one ebranch ben trask felt much the same about it now as he had fourteen years ago when he was first recruited and as every branch esper before and since alec kyle an old friend and exhead of branch was dead and gone now but he had come closest to it when hed used to say ebranch a bloody funny outfit ben science and sorcery telemetry and telepathy computerized probability patterns and precognition gadgets and ghosts we have access to all of these things now that now had qualified it for at the time kyle had been talking about harry keogh and later he had become harry keogh keoghs mind in kyles body anyway the cage jerked to a halt its doors hissed open trask and the unnaturally aged girl and the hologram got out hologram or phantom trask wondered gadget or ghost when he was a kid hed believed in ghosts then for a time he hadnt now he worked for ebranch and sometimes he wished he were a kid again for then it was all in the imagination lan goodly the night duty officer was waiting for them in the corridor very tall skeletally thin and gangly he was a prognosticator or hunchman grey and mainly gauntfeatured goodlys expression was usually grave he rarely smiled only his eyes large brown warm and totally disarming belied what must otherwise constitute a rather unfortunate first impression that of a cadaverous mortician anna he offered the girl a polite nod ben trask returned the unspecified query do you see it too we all do goodly answered his voice highpitched and a little shrill but not unusually so and before trask could say anything else t guessed youd be in ive told them to wait for you in the ops room how many of them goodly shrugged everyone within a thirty mile radius trask nodded thanks lan ill go and speak to them and youd better go back to keeping watch again goodlys shrug very well but apart from this its going to be a quiet night this thing is happening and soon it will be finished and then well see what well see he began to turn away trask caught his arm and stopped him any ideas goodly sighed i could give you an educated guess but i suspect youd prefer to let it play itself out right like all hunchmen he was cautious about being too specific the future didnt like being pinned down someone had called the elevator its doors closed and the indicator signalled its descent as goodly made to return to his watch trask uttered a belated right then turned left along the corridor and headed for the ops room and anna marie english limped along behind him in the ops room they found their colleagues waiting for them in front of the briefing podium an area had been cleared of chairs where eleven espers formed an inwardfacing circle trask and the girl made thirteen a witchs dozen he thought wryly we complete the coven as the circle opened up and its members adjusted their positions the better to accommodate the latecomers so trask saw the point of the formation the combined awareness of the espers added to the holograms authentication to experience the thing as a group was to focus it lend it definition and the hitherto nebulous mental projection expanded in a moment from a d picture in trasks minds eye to a seemingly physical apparently solid figure right there in front of him but only apparently solid for obviously it wasnt real the ring formed by the espers was maybe fifteen to eighteen feet in diameter the location of the smouldering corpse where it tumbled backwards head over heels free of the floor as on some invisible spit was no more than ten feet away from any individual viewer if it were solid if it were here at all then the figure would have to be that of a child or a dwarf but its proportions were those of a normal adult human being and so the apparition was some kind of hologram viewed as from a considerably greater distance than was apparent it was like a scene in a crystal ball they were seeing something which had happened or which was even now in enactment somewhere else and more than ever trask believed he knew this victim and more than ever he suspected that this was a scene from another world even another universe on entering the room the head of branch had noted the identities of the eleven there was millicent cleary a pretty little telepath whose talent was still developing there seemed little doubt but that one day she would be a power in her own right but right now she was vulnerable telepathy could do that to a person and trask thought of her as the kid sister hed never had then there was david chung a hugely talented locator and server he was slight wiry slanteyed and yellow as they come but he was british from birth a londoner and fiercely loyal to the branch all of them were loyal or else the branch would fail chung tracked soviet stealth subs ira units in the field drugrunners especially the latter addiction had killed his parents which was where his talent had its genesis and it was still growing the precog guy teale stood to the left of trask like lan goodly he was gifted in reading the future a suspect talent at best the future didnt like being read and had kicked back more than once teale was small thin jumpy easily startled he lived on his nerves his sometime partner frank robinson a spotter who infallibly recognized other espers stood next to him robinson was as blond as teale was dark boyish and freckled he looked only nineteen or thereabouts which was seven years short of the mark the pair had worked with trask on the keogh job some six or seven months ago theyd helped him corner the necroscope in his house near edinburgh and burn the place to the ground that had caused harry to escape right out of this world to a place on the other side of the perchorsk gate since then everyone who knew the score had prayed that he wouldnt be back and he hadnt been until now trask wondered is this image is it harry and he suspected that they were all wondering the same thing and just like him theyd all be glad that it was only an image paul garvey a fullblown telepath stood directly opposite trask on the other side of the circle he caught trasks eye through the rotation of the projection and nodded almost imperceptibly it was his acknowledgement of trasks thought which garvey had heard yes they were all thinking pretty much the same thing garvey was tall wellbuilt and had been a goodlooking thirtyfive year old but then that time six months ago hed tackled a murderous swine called johnny found and lost most of the left side of his face since then some of the best plastic surgeons in england had worked on garvey till he looked pretty good but a real face is made of more than flesh garveys was mostly tissue now and the nerves didnt connect up too well he could smile with the right side but not the left and so avoided the travesty by not smiling at all it had happened when they were tracking harry keogh who in turn had been tracking found a necromancer whose speciality was to molest women before and after they were dead garvey had made the mistake of finding harrys quarry first that was all but the necroscope had squared it later in a graveyard the police had discovered pounds body so badly chewed up that he was barely recognizable and despite everything else that was happening at the time the fact that harry had been a prime target garvey still reckoned he owed him for that as for ben trask he reckoned they all owed harry keogh something the whole world it would have been so easy for the necroscope to release the plague of vampirism which he carried within himself upon all humanity and be emperor here with an entire planet for his empire but instead hed let them hound him into exile in an alien world of vampires where he would be just one more monster harry had let it happen yes before the thing inside him could take full control but whenever trask thought back on that on the alien passions which had governed harry how hed looked the last time trask saw him in the garden of his burning house not far from edinburgh then his own mixed emotions would sort themselves out in short order and he would know it was for the best the lower half of harrys figure had been mistshroded visible only as a vague outline in the opaque milky swirl of his vampire mist but the rest of him had been all too visible hed worn an entirely ordinary suit of dark illfitting clothes which seemed two sizes too small for him so that his upper torso sprouted from the trousers to form a blunt wedge framed by a jacket held together by one straining button the bulk of harrys ribcage had been massively muscular his white opennecked shirt had burst open down the front revealing the ripple of his musclesheathed ribs and the deep powerful throb of his chest the shirts collar had looked like a crumpled frill insubstantial around the corded bulk of his leaden neck his flesh was a sullen grey dappled lurid orange and sick yellow by leaping fire and gleaming moonlight and he towered all of a foot taller than trask quite literally dwarfing him but his face that had been the absolute embodiment of a waking nightmare his halogen halloween eyes which had seemed to drip sulphur and his grin a grin was that what it had been maybe in an alien vampire world called starside on the other side of the mdbius continuum but here on earth it had been the rabid slavering grimace of a great wolf here it was teeth visibly elongating curving up and out of gleaming gristle jawridges to shear through gums which spurted splashes of hot ruby blood here it was a writhing of scarlet lips a flattening of convoluted snout a yawning of mantrap jaws that face that mouth that crimson cavern of stalactite stalagmite teeth as jagged as shards of white broken glass what like the gates of hell that and worse for harry had been wamphyri trask started massively as anna marie english standing on his right grasped his elbow and needlessly breathlessly stated sir hes moving away from us she was right as everyone there could see the hologram of the corpse was getting smaller falling or receding faster and faster towards a multihued nebulous origin or destiny out of which the blue green and red ribbons of neon light reached like writhing tentacle arms to welcome it the smoking rotating figure dwindled it became a mote a speck it disappeared and where it had been an explosion a sunburst of golden light expanding silently hugely awesomely so that the thirteen observers gasped and ducked down and despite that it was in their group mind they turned away from the blinding intensity of the glare and what flew out of it all except ben trask who shielded his eyes and shrank down a little but continued to watch because he must know the truth trask and also david chung who cried his astonishment staggered and almost fell but they had seen both of them those myriad golden splinters speeding outwards from the sunburst angling this way and that sentient seeking disappearing into as many unknown places those pieces of the necroscope harry keogh all that remained of him and as the last of them had zipped by trask and vanished silently out of view out into the corridor apparently so the streamers of blue green and red metaphysical light had blinked out of being returning the briefing rooms illumination to normal except that last golden dart had seemed so real why trask could have sworn that it had actually materialized right here in the ops room sentient and solid before speeding out into the corridor and disappearing from view and now within the room thirteen startled gaping extraordinary human beings but perfectly ordinary in comparison to what they had witnessed trask forced himself into action stepped across the room to where david chung was still mazed staggering he took hold of him steadied him snapped david are you all right no yes the other answered but he isnt he licked dry lips and closed his slack mouth halfpointed and flapped a hand towards the centre of the room where the espers were moving about once more was it harry trask breathed chung sighed heavily and collapsed a little into himself oh yes it was harry ben it was him the end of him chung nodded opened his trembling hand and showed the other what he was holding a pigbristle hairbrush whose oval wooden plaque fitted snug in his palm for a moment trask was mystified then he understood it was chungs talent he was a sympathetic tracker a locator following the bodescu affair harry keogh had stayed here at ebranch hq for a month filling in the blank spaces for a time hed even considered taking on the position of head of branch but with the loss of his wife and son the necroscopes world had collapsed and hed moved on become a recluse up in scotland the hairbrush had been his one of several items hed left behind ive kept it all this time since i was first recruited into the branch chung now explained to the other espers as they gathered round this and one or two other pieces which were his six months ago when the russians reported harrys escape through the perchorsk gate i took out his things and tried to locate him i mean i obviously couldnt locate him but it was just the same as when jazz simmons went through i knew that harry wasnt here not in this world but he wasnt dead either he was in starside and now it was anna marie english worrying for her world for herself chung shook his head now he isnt not in starside one of the younger espers gasped you mean hes come back hes here again chung shook his head showed them the brush in his hand this piece of wood these few bristles meant something told me something they told me that the necroscope was alive if not here alive somewhere only let me pick up this brush or harrys other things and i knew it now its just a hairbrush no longer alive and neither is harry keogh he died a few moments ago somewhere and we all saw it harrys dead ben trask made no bones of it what weve just witnessed was him somehow he found a way to let us know give us peace of mind thats how i see it anyway lan goodly came in with a pair of late arrivals another esper and the branchs minister responsible the minister was in his midforties young for his job but had a mind sharp as a knife he was small and dapper with keen blue eyes and dark hair brushed back and plastered down his blue suit was fashionable in the corridors of power somehow his dress as a whole marked him as a person of class in no way psychically talented still the minister was branch he too had felt the call something had lured him here until a moment ago when it had stopped while trask told the minister what had happened goodly fetched coffee then for an hour two the entire group sat around and remembered harry they said very little but were satisfied just to be there and despite that they should be jubilant they werent and for all that a great plague had passed them by most of them felt theyd lost a friend david chung had put harrys brush in his pocket every now and then he would reach in and touch it with his fingertips but it was just a brush now wood and glue and bristle inanimate without being and thats how it would stay for sixteen long years a fortnight later zek foener called from her greek island home in zante shed put it off until it was unbearable but in the end had to speak to trask are we friends again ben for all that she couldnt see him he nodded and smiled he knew that zek would sense it for she was a powerful telepath after that job we did on janos ferenczys creatures in the med well always be friends zek despite that i helped him in the end her voice was a little distorted by the line but her anxiety was real enough trasks talent was working for him so that her sincerity was as tangible as the steady beat of his own heart he shrugged which she would also sense and said youre not the only one who helped harry zek you too i somehow thought you would i took a chance he told her if it had gone the other way i could have ended up the biggest traitor mankind has ever known by now there might have been a new world order i know i thought much the same thing but it was harry after all half of it was anyway trask answered actually he died six seven months ago she said what shed taken trask by surprise he was dead to us the moment he went through the perchorsk gate she explained or as good as there was no way we were ever going to see him again hed used both of the gates the one in the urals and the one in romania he couldnt come back the grey holes would reject him trask had been happy to hear her voice talk to zek but suddenly his mood was grim shed brought something up that he didnt like to think about thats true as far as it goes he said but his son used a different route harry had considered himself the master of the mobius continuum but in fact he was a novice those are his words not mine harry junior was the real master but if anyone knows that you do its how he brought you and jazz out of that place back here there was a pause before she answered the dweller still worries you right the dweller trask frowned but in the next moment oh yes you mean harry junior he worries me right enough the perchorsk gate worries me and the resurgence of one of the danubes tributaries near radujevac in romania they all worry me for theyre all routes into this world from the world of the vampires but theyre covered now surely harry junior isnt and now it was trasks turn to sense the shake of a head he wont be coming back zek told him he was wamphyri yes but he was different as different as the lady karen as different as his father he fought for his territory on starside and hell stay there and keep it he battled with the vampires ben destroyed them and to my knowledge he didnt create one out of himself he kept no thralls no lieutenants no vampire lovers just friends but they did love him even as much as the great majority loved his father she had reassured him zek i know youve turned me down before he said but i really think you and jazz should come over here some time be our guests and stay in london a while at our expense and tell us your story in full no you dont owe us anything neither one of you but you said it yourself were friends and the pair of you have such a lot of information locked in your heads about starside the wamphyri even things about harry keogh and his son that only you know the worlds improving zek not by leaps and bounds not yet but who knows maybe you can help it along the way or if not help it protect it at least and before she could answer him i mean its not like it used to be zek not any more you were used you and jazz both oh and too many others by russias ebranch and by ours too but lessons were learned and it isnt like that any more we are learning all the time ive thought about it a lot and its as if everything the necroscope touched upon has been improved and changed forever before hed even discovered the mobius continuum he had to use checkpoint charlie in berlin to get into east germany and talk to mobius in his leipzig grave and wheres the checkpoint now eh as for romania do you see what i mean zek its as if mankind has turned over a new leaf and all since harry came along or since he left us but should we be surprised really i remember harry once said there are a great many talents among the dead and they have their ways of using them but it was him who showed them how to talk to each other connecting them up in their graves since then just look around the world are they responsible the teeming dead who knows what theyve achieved or how they did it communism is on its last legs a dismal failure and the worlds a safer place after we send the rest of our false ideological gods packing then maybe we can start over a grand restructuring the ecology of mother earth herself right now the world is safer but its still not safe enough could you and jazz help make it just a little bit safer zek thats what i want you to think about if not for me for harry i mean dont you reckon its worth finishing the job that he started thats cheating ben she told him well think about it anyway later she did think about it zek and jazz both but they didnt go to london it would take a long time for their wounds to heal a long time before they would forgive the worlds espbranches while sixteen years isnt a long time in the great scheme of things still changes do occur people faces places change governments and organizations come and go causes and ideologies collapse and others spring into being but establishments are wont to continue if only because they are established cold wars had come and gone hot ones too however brief localized the worlds secret services were always in demand even during periods of intense perestroika and glasnost that most esoteric of all services ebranch had gone on with ben trask continuing as head of branch while some of his agents were no more and others had been recruited to take their places the organization itself was an extremely successful establishment there would always be work for the branch and if ever that should change the truth of it was that the government of the day probably wouldnt know what to do with the branchs esoteric talents if they were disbanded at least this way the espers could be seen to be working for the common good as for the current state of the world communist china was slipping fast on the worndown heels of russia into a bog of stagnation and economic decay and the ussr itself was much less unified internally russia was still recovering from seventy years of selfinflicted wounds but its occasional haemorrhages were all on the inside now and issued from vastly reduced lesions there was no longer even a remote threat of global conflict the last remaining superpower the usa was ultimately potent and alert as were her allies but more importantly theirs was a generally benign alliance and just as ben trask had once forecast the world was a much safer place now so much so that it had become a fad among political and historical commentators to attempt to identify the turning point and name the prime factors and movers the microchip lech walesa giant technological spinoffs from the space race and the star wars programme spies in the sky chernobyl the total collapse of european communism president reagan prime minister thatcher and to some extent premier gorbachev the war in the gulf where the entire world had watched with fascination astonishment and more than a little horror as uninspired warriors with outmoded outgunned weapons were mown down under the previously unimaginable onslaught of outraged passions and superior technology and through all of this no one except perhaps a handful of ebranch members remembered harry keogh necroscope or attributed anything of the current world order to his works and other than that same small handful no one credited the great majority the teeming dead with even the smallest part in it which was the way things stood on that monday morning in january when trask arrived at ebranch hq in the heart of london and found david chung prowling to and fro in the foyer with a cellphone waiting for him except it wasnt the cellphone which brought trask up short as he entered the building but the look on chungs face and what he was holding in his other hand an old hairbrush harry keoghs old hairbrush before trask saw that however he recognized chungs urgency and commenced to say sorry david my earphone is on the blink and anyway theres so much interference these days a man cant even think let alone speak is there a problem were you trying to contact me by then hed seen the hairbrush and jerked to a halt the occurrences of that night sixteen years ago had all come rushing back in a flood of vivid memories and the beat of trasks heart had picked up speed to match the sudden flow of adrenaline david he said making it a question chung answered with a grim nod simply that and whisked him into the elevator but as the doors slid shut on them and they were alone he uttered those words which trask had most dreaded to hear hes back trask didnt want to believe it he he husked knowing full well who he must be the only one he could be harry chung nodded shrugged helplessly seemed lost for words something of him he answered at last who or whatever he is now but yes ben im talking about harry something of harry keogh has come back to us ii harrys room from the hotel managers point of view ebranch didnt even exist he occasionally forgot that the hotel had a top storey which wasnt strange for hed never seen it the occupants of that unknown uppermost level had their own elevator situated at the rear of the building private stairs also at the rear even their own fire escape indeed they owned the top floor and so fell entirely outside the hotels sphere of management and operation as to who they were international entrepreneurs or so the hotel manager had been given to understand nor was he alone in his ignorance for from the outside looking in very few would suspect that the building in toto was anything other than it purported to be an hotel which was exactly the guise or aspect or lack of such which they wished to convey and so except to its members and to a select core of very important persons in the corridors of power who could be numbered on the fingers of one hand only one of which the minister responsible knew the actual location of ebranch hq the branch simply did not exist yet paradoxically ebranchs existence and indeed its location were known of elsewhere in the world to one organization at least and probably more than one the soviet equivalent knew of it certainly and possibly chinas mindspy organization too they knew about e branch hq but made no great show of it not yet let it suffice that the hotel had been earmarked and was a target in the unlikely event of global conflict it would be an early casualty simply because it gave the west too much of an edge this was of small concern since the end of world war two inner london itself had been a target as were all centres of government finance and commerce worldwide not to mention a thousand military establishments and for that matter so were the russian and chinese espagencies targets including soviet hq on protze prospekt in moscow next door to the state biological research laboratories also the soviet listening cell in mogocha near the chinese border where a team of telepaths kept an eye on the yellow peril and likewise the chinese outfit itself on kwijiang avenue chungking the commencement of world war three would be a hot time for espers which was as good a reason as any why such agencies should work for its prevention and so to all intents and purposes perestroika and glasnost were still very much the order of the day which was why it came as no surprise to trask when chung told him our friends on protze prospekt have confirmed it something has come through the perchorsk gate theyve got it trapped there and want our help with it urgently he used the term friends loosely the british and soviet ebranches had never been more than wary adversaries in fact the necroscope in his time had twice pared the opposition down to the bone but ever since the chernobyl disaster the russians had been far less reluctant to ask for outside help theyd asked for it not only with that horror but also with the decommissioning and mothballing of a dozen more outdated outmoded and positively lethal nuclear reactors and for ten years now the west had been helping them dispose of the rest of their seemingly endless toxicwaste junkyards for earths sake if for no other good reason as the elevator doors hissed open letting them out into the main corridor trask said i think youd better start at the beginning let me see the whole picture also lets have every available hand in on it the duty officer espers doing paperwork administration the whole shoot but chung had anticipated him theyre waiting for us in the ops room but only millie cleary knows what its about she was duty officer last night and took the call from moscow just an hour ago as for myself i couldnt sleep and came in early then passing harrys room i i sort of felt it by which time the head of soviet ebranch had been on the blower asking to speak to you harrys room trask frowned they were heading down the corridor towards the ops room chung took trasks elbow and brought him to a halt looked over the others shoulder at a door behind him and nodded harrys room yes he said the expression on his face was curious questioning then trask remembered when harry keogh stayed here after the bodescu affair theyd given him a room of his own indeed the necroscope had literally lived here however briefly until his wifes problem had become apparent that had been what a quarter century ago and eight years after that he had been debriefed here after his return from starside god the passage of time it made trask feel old who was he kidding well past fifty he was getting old and too fast he turned and looked at the door which had its own faded plastic name plate harrys room trask frowned again and said you know i dont think ive ever been in there well not since harrys time anyway he looked at chung and saw that he was suddenly pale his mouth was tight and his slanted eyes were blinking rapidly david the other shook his head its nothing just this room i think youve never been in there well youre not alone the necroscope used it for a while since when he shrugged the room housed a computer terminal for eight years until we refitted in fact the old machine is still in there gathering dust then the room fell into disuse and no one seems to have had any use for it at all but now i find myself wondering if it doesnt go deeper than that i mean its always cold in that room ben all of the espers feel it it has an aura the room itself doesnt seem to want anyone it doesnt want to be messed with chung stared hard at trask havent you felt it too trask looked blank i dont think ive even noticed the room he said i mean i have noticed it the name plate and all but it hasnt made any impression its just a place ive lived with every day of my life all these years without really seeing it thats exactly what i mean chung answered and all of the others say the same thing someone stuck that plate on the door god knows how long ago and since then its been harrys room and thats all but ever since he returned to starside we might have forgotten harry or tried to but its like this room hasnt a phrase the necroscope had used came back to trask his last vestige on earth chung shrugged something like that trask nodded and said well look into it later first i have to know whats been happening in perchorsk waiting for trask and chung in the large operations room one half of which was an auditorium a small group of espers occupied seats in the lower tier facing the stage and podium as the head of branch entered the low murmur of their voices reached out to him for a moment then the noise fell away and showing their respect they stood up trask waved them back into their seats climbed steps up onto the stage with chung following on behind to one side of the podium a table and chairs faced the audience the two men seated themselves and trask went straight into it being who and what you are you probably know as much as i do about whats going on briefly something has come through into perchorsk from starside now were each and every one cm fait with the problem at perchorsk so its no wonder our colleagues over there seem to have a flap on anything that comes through the gate has to be highly suspect except this is more so because david here tells me its harry keogh something of the necroscope chung cut into their gasps and whispers something with powerful connections we know harry was well changing but he would have to be changed completely to come back through the gate grey holes dont do return tickets once through thats it theres no way back except maybe through the other gate into an underground river which rises again into the danube but this thing has come through into perchorsk also harry keogh is dead we all saw him die that time sixteen years ago or was he simply undead no for he was already that before he went through the gate so while my talent tells me its harry my reasoning tells me it just cant be which means it has to be something like him something of him trask took it up again in a minute or two ill be talking to turkur tzonov the oppositions top man we know what his talent is face to face he reads minds but very accurately hell want to speak to me onscreen so i can only tell him the truth that squares things up because turkur knows my talent and that he cant lie to me either its why the handful of conversations weve had in the past have always seemed tentative lumbering awkward things and in all probability this one too right now it looks like the opposition will be asking for our help before that i want your ideas want to know what well be dealing with if we offer our assistance lately we havent had too much on our plate nothing special anyway well with the exception of the nightmare zone so maybe were all just a wee bit rusty where the really important stuff is concerned this could be just the opportunity we need to get our various talents out of neutral he looked at their faces looking back at him millicent cleary who had taken the call from moscow of all ebranchs agents trask probably related most to millie he sympathized with her telepathy was her talent and it was also her curse shed stayed single as had most of the espers but in any case they were already married to the branch the job was one reason she was still single anyway and the other was her mindreading for as millies telepathy had matured along with her body so all thoughts of young love marriage and children had flown out of the window what be a telepath and know your lovers every thought even the bad thoughts which we all have from time to time and if kids should come along perhaps pass the talent on to them no way for just exactly like trask himself millie had learned that for every basically pure mind out there there were also the tainted ones and for far too many of those there were totally corrupt minds and that at the very limits of the human spectrum there were others so filled with acid that they ate inwards into themselves and outwards into the world in general she knew what was out there for it was her job to look into such minds sometimes even the worst of them although she was a woman of thirtyeight now trask still thought of her as his kid sister thered been a sort of girlnextdoor freshness about her which galvanized his protective urges a shyness and alltoorare innocence which at the same time permitted her to flash her green eyes wrinkle her pretty nose toss her head of copper hair and get really mad if necessary occasionally it was and shed never failed to stand up for her principles millie had retained all of these qualities and somehow despite the job shed managed to hold on to something of her innocence too millie trask said did you pick up anything from your conversation with tzonov she shook her head he sounded cool superior almost disdainful he wasnt onscreen just a voice on the line if i had been able to see him maybe and maybe not there was a lot of static i mean mental static trask said there would be he rubbed his chin and scanned the other faces anna marie english at twentyfour she had looked fifty and amazingly now that she was forty she still looked fifty it said a lot for mother earth ecologically aware englishs disease had been held in abeyance by the planets partial recovery she would be as good a place as any to start trask nodded his intention a nod which she returned however imperceptibly before answering can we step through into ops maybe use the screens and charts trask and chung came back down off the dais followed the other espers into the ops section where they switched on table screens and illuminated walls as shutters whirred into position covering the windows so the room lit up suddenly it took on a sort of cold technological life of its own on one large wall screen the earth was shown in flat stereographic projection with colours which were lifelike as seen from space anna marie english went to the screen paused and looked at the other espers especially trask her unlovely face was tinged blue in the glare of the projection and her eyes were invisible behind the reflective sheen of her spectacles the ecopaths voice was a rasp as she asked of no one in particular is our world under threat she shrugged and turned to the screen i can only offer my opinion the next step was one which everyone present understood well enough sympathetic perception she reached up and placed a trembling right hand over a mountainous region of russia the urals some four hundred miles north of sverdlovsk and closing her eyes she held her breath and leaned her physical and metaphysical weight on that one sensitive extension of herself several long seconds ticked by and as many quiet heartbeats before she straightened up withdrew her hand and faced her colleagues again well trask gave voice to all of their anxieties she took a deep breath and said perchorsk reads to me just exactly the way it did the last time i scanned it menacing the place itself is well a dire threat obviously but i detected nothing of any additional hazard i did sense something new however something warm in my opinion if something someone has come through to our side he she or it is harmless to our world maybe even benevolent trask sighed like everyone else hed been holding his breath he looked around who else could he use david chung was standing close to him but he shook his head i can only tell you what ive already told you it feels like the necroscope to me like him but thats all the precog guy teale had taken over duty officer from millicent cleary as the group of espers had entered the ops area teale had been summoned to duty by his pager which was locked into branch communications now he returned and said its the opposition turkur tzonov again still wanting to speak to you sir he looked at trask i patched him through to the screen in here when youre ready he can wait a minute more trask growled but he knew that if tzonov was that impatient this was at least as important as he suspected it to be he looked at the others gathered round him lan goodly seemed on the point of saying something knowing how reluctant hunchmen usually are to air their talents trask prompted him lan i was waiting until guy got back the gangling cadaverous esper answered being likeminded so to speak both of us being precogs prognosticators im interested to get a second opinion your own opinion will do for starters trask told him goodly shuffled uncomfortably then shrugged were going to be involved he finally said trask turned towards teale likewise said the other who or whatever it is thats come through he frowned and paused no whoever it is he needs our help he thats my guess teale answered educated as always and thats it heavily involved goodly nodded i see interesting times ahead he held up a hand but dont ask me to look any deeper than that ben not yet its never safe and right now it isnt necessary again trasks sigh this time of frustration right he said no more guesswork however informed its time we knew for sure im going to speak to tzonov i would prefer all of you offscreen however so if you dont mind as they moved out of range trask made himself comfortable in a black padded swivel chair before a large flat screen on a central console but as teale made to switch on the televiewer wait trask stopped him i want you to cover me all of you lets play the opposition at their own game and have some mental static around here tzonovs a damn fine an extraordinary mentalist if im not covered hell be able to read things in my head that even i dont know are there and as they shielded him with the combined energy of their minds teale switched on the signal from moscow unscrambled itself onto the opaque screen a fuzzy hitech background blinked into being while in the foreground sharp features under a highdomed totally bald head faced trask and held him with penetrating eyes he stared back as the picture gained stability and clear almost betterthanlife contrast onscreen the russians face was certainly larger than life in order to make himself that much more impressive hed given his screen extra amplification which was scarcely necessary the looks of the man were startling but ben trask was a hard man to intimidate its not easy to impress a human liedetector a man who will instantly recognize even the most remote distortion or elaboration it was the reason trask had always liked and been impressed by harry keogh not so much by the necroscopes awesome powers but by his humility and his truth truth mr trask tzonov raised his right eyebrow but there you have the advantage as long as your agents keep you covered you can lie to your hearts content and remain hidden in their static as for myself i have no such safeguard nor do i need one not on this occasion if i wanted to play games well im sure you know i have enough clever chessmen without my own personal involvement so there we have it i am here to ask a favour of you not to lie to you or spy on you tzonovs voice wellmodulated and without accent and to all intents and purposes lacking in emotion nevertheless contained the merest suggestion of a sneer trask smiled back however tightly for someone who protests my advantage over his own innocence you picked that out of my mind easily enough tzonov naturally im concerned about the truth i always have been and always will be it happens to be my talent while he answered he studied the others face turkur tzonov was partturk partmongol all man without question he was an alpha male a leader an outstanding mind housed in an athletes body his grey eyes were the sort that could look at and into a man or through him if the mind behind them considered him of little or no importance it was a measure of trasks stature that tzonovs eyes looked at him and not without respect the russians eyebrows were slim as lines pencilled on paper upwardsslanting they were silverblond against the tanned sharpetched ridges of his brows from the eyebrows up he was completely hairless which was so in keeping with his other features as to make it appear that hair was never intended certainly his baldness wasnt a sign of illhealth or premature aging the broad bronze dome of his head glowed with vitality to match the flesh of his face where the only anomaly lay in the orbits of tzonovs eyes deepsunken and dark their hollows seemed bruised from long hours of study or implacable concentration trask knew it was a symptom of the mans telepathy tzonovs nose was sharply hooked which despite his light grey eyes might mark him as an arab except trask suspected it had been broken in an accident or a fight probably the latter for the head of russias ebranch was a devotee of the martial arts his mouth was wellfleshed if a little wide above a chin which was strong and square his cheeks were very slightly hollow and his small pointed ears lay flat to his head the picture overall was of a tooperfect symmetry where the left and right halves of the russians face seemed mirror images in the majority of people this would be a disadvantage trask thought the physical attractions of a face its good looks are normally defined by imperfections of balance turkur tzonov to the contrary paradoxically he was a very attractive man the secret lay in the eyes which were a fascination unto themselves trask could well understand the branchs profile of this man which detailed a long string of beautiful and intelligent female companions none of them had voiced any complaint when he moved on they had all remained loyal to him in their various ways trask wondered if it were true loyalty or simply that tzonov knew too much about them how could any woman speak out against a man who knows every detail of her pastlife only a stupid or insensitive or entirely innocent woman would dare none of which were tzonovs sort and now those nearhypnotic eyes those telepathic eyes of turkur tzonov were intent upon trask as the two heads of british and soviet espintelligence measured each other across a distance of more than fifteen hundred miles trasks appraisal of the other had taken moments possibly the russian had read something of it in his mind in any case there had been nothing there he could possibly object to and if there had been well he was the one who was asking for help trask nodded so you have a problem turkur er do you mind if i use your first name i know youre still fond of the term comrade over there but were hardly that turkur by all means the other shrugged and permitted himself the ghost of a smile as for comrade its true our organizations have had their differences in the past mr trask or should that be ben but that is history and this is now and the future is oh a very big place in a world scrutinized by alien intelligences perhaps even under the threat of attack we wouldnt find it so difficult to be comrades am i right his argument and the way he presented it were disarming especially since trask knew what he was talking about perhaps trask knew even more than tzonov thought for instance he knew or suspected that the intruder from the other side was a man and now there might be a way to confirm his suspicions is that what you think he said that your visitor is a spy for the wamphyri their advance guard as it were someone working for harry keogh perhaps if his words caught the other off guard there was little outward sign of it a single blink and the almost imperceptible narrowing of cool grey eyes then tzonovs answer the reputation of your branch is welldeserved ben that is precisely what i think its at least a possibility between us we control talents with which to combat any such incursion but until we know what the threat is or that it definitely exists he let his words taper off you havent been able to fathom him then trask took it that guy teale had been correct what had come through the perchorsk gate was a man as yet were not wholly in a position to fathom him no tzonov said rather he is not in a position to be fathomed can you explain that were holding him within the gate tzonov obliged at our end just beyond the perchorsk threshold what but do you think weve learned nothing from the lessons of the past that we would simply let such a creature in without first considering our actions a thing possibly a man which at least has the looks and present shape of a man from the parallel dimension of the wamphyri holding him trask couldnt help but frown since that time all those years ago when harry keogh had gone through the gate ebranch had lost much of its interest in perchorsk it had been taken for granted that the russians were adequately equipped to close the place down or if not that certainly to deal with whatever might come through ah said tzonov nodding and for the first time during their conversation he seemed surprised and pleased you dont know of the precautions which weve taken at perchorsk weve always assumed you sealed the place up trask told him permanently any responsible authority would have seen to it at once that had been tried before tzonov answered with a grim smile before my time but do you know im told that it was far better to be in perchorsk and living in fear than out of that place and not knowing what was going on and i believe it for since then weve had the experience of an entirely separate but analogous comparison i refer to chernobyl of course you may recall that the sarcophagus was a sealed unit too until they opened it up again and again but the place is still alive and dangerous and will continue to be for a long time to come which is why they must now open it yet again a third time in order to be certain they know whats happening well perchorsk was the same we had to know what was happening he paused and in a moment continued weve taken precautions of course such as these safeguards are they have allowed us to contain this most recent visitor at our end of the gate so that we now have a choice we can study him if its at all possible or simply destroy him out of hand i would prefer to study him and you want to let us in on it trask kept his face expressionless that would seem very big of you if i didnt already know that you cant handle it on your own it was so he knew also that everything tzonov had told him was the absolute truth the needle on trasks mental liedetector hadnt so much as wavered but what you havent yet told me is the sort of help you expect from us how about it turkur what is it weve got that you need several things the other accepted his reading made no pointless attempt to deny the accuracy of trasks deductions your branch has a wealth of experience in such matters for one thing not to mention a diversity of esp talents you yourself would be invaluable ben your ability to look at what weve got here and know the truth of it whether our visitor is merely a man and harmless or much more than a man and a monstrous threat as i am sure youre aware your talent is unique and we have nothing like you then there are your prognosticators your hunchmen teale and goodly we too have a man who reads the future our own precog of course alas his talent is tzonov shrugged middling at best and im sure youre aware of that too but your men are the best at the first sign of danger theyd recognize it immediately indeed it is their nature to know well in advance it was trasks thought to ask what is it about this man or thing that interests you why dont you just destroy it out of hand what do you hope to gain from studying it but if he asked those questions and tzonov chose to lie or obfuscate their new found rapport could be broken and trask knew now that he needed the cooperation of the russian telepath as much as he himself was needed of course he did for if david chung was correct and the visitor was in some way revenant of harry keogh if you wont help us and were obliged to work on this alone and if theres any profit in it then we alone reap the benefits can you really afford to refuse us i should think youd jump at the chance to help he was right if the visitor was like or of harry he must never be allowed to fall so easily into the oppositions hands what a weapon theyd make of him before trask let that happen and if it should be necessary why hed kill the visitor himself very well he nodded you shall have our cooperation but this is a busy time turkur and if were to work together in perchorsk there are things i have to see to here first ill get my duty officer to phone you back within the hour to make the necessary arrangements to phone me tzonov raised his customary eyebrow is it not better to talk face to face trask smiled the walls of trust are built by degrees my friend first pebbles later boulders the russian nodded and they are just as easily tumbled remove a pebble and the whole wall breaks that is one of our sayings exactly trask answered very well tzonov agreed my duty officer will stand by for your duty officers call for i too have things to put in order meanwhile i shall look forward to working with you and yours his face disappeared from the screen and was replaced by white dazzle just the two of us trask spoke to his precogs myself and one of you two the flip of a coin he held a penny his goodluck piece of predecimal coinage between thumb and finger lan goodly shook his head his highpitched voice belied his mournful expression as he answered no need for that ben we already know guy teale pulled a wry face im staying here thats how we see it anyway trask shrugged and said to goodly then youd better get your things together it wont be long his advice wasnt necessary but between them the espers kept their conversations as near normal as possible as the precogs left his office trask saw david chung waiting in the corridor and called him in david td like to come with you you think youd be of use im fascinated to know the connection between this thing and harry keogh and thats it more or less trask shook his head youre one of our best david and i know you have enough to do right here also i have to think of the branch if anything were to happen to us out there well the organization would be weakened enough without losing you too still its not my decision entirely ive just been speaking to the minister responsible hes okayed it however reluctantly but just for the two of us so im afraid thats that incidentally youll be in the chair while im away and if anything was to happen to us in perchorsk youd most likely stay in the chair so you see theres no way we can also jeopardize the life of the heir apparent chung remained silent standing there before trasks desk until the head of branch felt obliged to ask was there something else chung looked embarrassed dont you think its possible you made a mistake when you were talking to tzonov onscreen in what way when you asked him if he thought his visitor at perchorsk might be a spy for the wamphyri possibly working for harry up until then harry keogh hadnt been mentioned it seemed to me an error to bring up the question of the necroscope trask shook his head i only mentioned him by name not by talent i deliberately avoided even thinking of harrys talents but you see youd already put thoughts of harry into my head they were in there fresh after sixteen years tzonov is possibly the worlds finest telepath his eyes look right into your mind so even covered by all that static i still wasnt sure he wouldnt read something the easy way out was to mention harry but slightly out of context that way tzonov would know what i thought he thought and look no further you see david through you were reasonably certain that something of harry keogh has come back into our world but the opposition knows nothing of that not yet he smiled its just one more reason why i wont take you east with us youre much too valuable right where you are he stood up and saw chung to the door out there the long central corridor was empty now silent chung said what about harrys room trask nodded it cant hurt to look inside what was that you said about it always cold in there as they walked down the corridor and paused at the door in question chung answered cold yes always the heating is on but the room stays cold he reached for the doorknob and the door opened both men gasped and started then breathed mutual sighs of relief glancing at each other sheepishly as the cleaning lady mrs wills came into the corridor armed with her appointments galvanized bucket shortbladed squeegee mop and dusters she perspired freely sure that his shock was still registering trask made an effort to cover his embarrassment well mrs wills doesnt look very cold he said and speaking directly to the cleaning lady mr chung was telling me how this room always feels too cold how do you find it mrs wills was a short rather stout fiftyish londoner not especially bright she was a hard worker and had a heart of gold she was the only permanent member of staff who was in no way talented and in all her fifteen years service to the branch she had never had the slightest idea what it was all about except that its simple rules were for obeying and its people not for talking about indeed mrs wills had been chosen for her singular lack of curiosity now her face lit up ruddily as she beamed first at trask then chung two of the gentlemen what she did for finally trasks question got through to her what mr arrys room sir cold did yer say cant say ive noticed it meself but the eatings working all right concerned she followed them in at the back there was a recess with a sliding door containing a wash basin shower and toilet in front just a small overnight bedroom maybe four paces by five from the days when the top floor too had belonged to the hotel the floor space along one wall was occupied by an obsolete computer console with a chair and space below for the operators feet plus a second swivel chair and ample work surface in a corner a small wardrobe stood open it was equipped with coat hangers and shelving to one side chung nodded to indicate the wardrobes interior some of harrys things he told trask a shirt of his trousers and a jacket a bit mothy by now i should think plus a few other bits and pieces on the top shelf there the other items were left behind by people we lost from time to time i kept them because i didnt like to destroy them as a locator id used them all in my time stuff belonging to darcy clarke ken layard trev jordan these things formed my link with them in the field as chung talked trask was looking into the wardrobe but he wasnt seeing rather he was feeling and chung was right the room was cold or if not cold empty despite the computer console the wardrobe and its contents it felt like an empty space as if nothing was here not even trask chung and mrs wills trask felt like an echo of himself in this room like a shadow he felt if he stood here just a little while longer he might fade into the walls and disappear forever the place was psychically charged definitely and the cold wasnt physical but metaphysical psychological supernatural whichever trask shivered anyway mrs wills had finished with her dusting there we are she said drawing trask back into himself all spicknspan again as my jims always saying meg me love whatever yer do just be sure yer keeps arrys room spicknspan thats what my jim always says as she turned away trasks jaw fell open and he glanced at chung then shed gone back out into the corridor and the two espers were after her in a moment er mrs wills trask caught her by the elbow did you and er jim i mean did you know harry then her hand flew to her mouth and her eyes went wide oh my was i talking about jim again oh dear i am sorry sir i mean after all these years yerd think id let it be now wouldnt yer trask raised his eyebrows looked mystified waited see she said my jim was a talker lord jim could talk of a night before wed go ter sleep hed just talk and talk and talk about all and everything and nothing very much i used ter tell him jim wills yerll likely talk yerself ter death one day and bless him he did a heart attack anyway but well yer see i was so used ter jims voice that sometimes i ears it even now and even if i never did know mr arry whoever he is it seems my jim must ave known him or eard of him anyway truth is my jim says an ell of a lot of em knows or knew arry keogh that did it there may be plenty of harrys in the world but by trasks reckoning there could only be one harry keogh the necroscopes second name had never been mentioned or it shouldnt have been in front of mrs wills her knowledge of his christian name was easy to explain shed been reading it five days a week plainly visible on the plaque on the door but his surname trask glanced at chung david chung was thinking much the same thing as his boss through harry the espers of ebranch had learned that death is not the end but a transition to incorporeality immobility the flesh may be weak and corruptible but mind and will go beyond that people when they die do not accompany their bodies into dissolution but become one with the great majority and merging into a sort of limbo a darkness where thought is the all the minds of the teeming dead occupy themselves naturally with whatever was their passion in life great artists continue to visualize magnificent canvases pictures they can never paint architects plan faultless worldspanning cities they can never build scientists follow through the research they werent able to complete in life whose benefits can never be passed on to the living and jim wills the cleaning ladys husband in life hed just overflowed with words and the one hed loved to talk to most of all had been his wife was it so strange and how many other lonely people hear their absent loved ones talking to them trask wondered but out loud he only said what else has jim told you mrs wills perhaps there was a tear in the corner of her eye as she looked at him but she hid it and smiled anyway only how i should be a good girl she said and treat others the way id expect to be treated and remember that jim loved me and only me all his days part two nestors story trask nodded thats all good advice he said softly but i meant about harry what did jim tell you about harry she shrugged and sighed not much just ter look after his room and keep it spicknspan thats all meg me love whatever else goes ter the wall you look after arrys room he says and when i asks him why he shrugs and says well yer never knows when hell be needin ter use it again now does yer she looked at the two espers and smiled and the tears were gone now anyway thats what my jim always says i sunside three days earlier at the dawn of a long sunside day the vampire lord nestor had gone to earth in the forest a mile or two north of the leper colony on the fringe of sunsides prairie belt in fear loathing and great trepidation trembling aye even the necromancer lord nestor of the wamphyri he had plunged headlong through the deep dark woods away from the goldstained horizon where the sun rose inexorably menacingly in the south there in the gloom of the forest stumbling into a stream he had stripped naked and washed himself scrupulously clean in every part until even his metamorphic vampire flesh was raw red and broken from his furious scrubbing and in his shrinking mind one terrifying thought eclipsing all others that hed spent last night among szgany lepers watched over by lepers tended and fed by lepers and infected perhaps by lepers leprosy great bane of the wamphyri and nestor had been with these stumbling crumbling people from sundown to sunup in their place unconscious in one of their beds and covered by their blankets theyd discovered him where his crippled flyer had come down in the forest close by they had touched him lifted him up taken him to their colony their wooden spoons had carried soup to nestors dribbling mouth while his lungs had breathed air which theirs had breathed out their bandages and healing salves had covered his wounded face and eyes but what were ointments against the curse of leprosy and so he had scrubbed his body raw then dressed himself in his soiled leather clothing and with something of his composure regained followed the stream east and a little north mainly nestor had walked in the shallow water shaded by dense foliage along the banks his eyes had been halfblinded by silver shot and though the lepers had pricked most of the tiny poison pellets out of his flesh it would be a while yet before his parasite leech could heal him completely by sticking to the water he avoided obstacles he couldnt crash into things and further damage himself but always hed been aware of the furnace suns rising however gradual and had known he must find shelter before its lethal rays could strike through the trees and discover him there and shortly where the stream slowed broadened out and flowed deep over its bed in a cave under a rocky vinedraped outcrop that jutted over the water there nestor had collapsed on a shingly ledge and stretched himself out to sleep hopefully to regain his strength but sleep was difficult he was not long awake following a nights rest in the place of the lepers his mind wove this way and that as he considered and reconsidered his position his chances actually they were good so long as he stayed here in this cave through the hours of daylight he would survive at sundown avoiding the makeshift camps of travellers he would venture north climb the barrier mountains by the light of the stars and send out a mindcall through the passes in the peaks to his lieutenant zahar lichloathe once sucksthrall upon a time zahar had been vasagi the sucks man now nestors he had taken his necromancer masters cognomen for his own lichloathe was the name that the wamphyri of wrathstack had given nestor out of respect for his talent which lay in tormenting corpses for their secrets but it was not that nestor loathed the dead rather that they loathed him as for the wamphyri they had grown to respect him perhaps even to fear him in however small a degree for with nestor something had come among them which seemed worse than dying the dark and harrowing art of necromancy by use of which an adept might carry vengeance even beyond death itself it was an awesome talent but torturing the dead in wrathstack was a far cry from this bed of pebbles in a cool dark cave so nestor had lain there making his plans to climb the barrier mountains and call for zahar who would come for him with a flyer to bear him back to the last aerie before then however a seemingly endless day and the best part of a night had lain ahead and nestor would be wise to rest his mind and body both yet still sleep eluded him in part it was the agony of rapid metamorphic healing worse far it was the terror of dreams he knew he must dream of sloughing flesh and a crumbling ruin of a man shunned and forgotten perhaps walledup and abandoned fretting to dust little by little in some cold lonely starside niche or crevice a man called nestor so hed tossed and turned in a fever upon his pebble bed and as the day wore on the air had grown heavier and more oppressive beyond the low mouth of his cave dragonflies had danced over the slowflowing water where sunbeams glanced and sparkled like gold and silver fire on the ripples it had all seemed so very peaceful out there harmless there had been a time in some misty mythical past when it was quite harmless he felt sure but now nestor could almost hear the sunlight seething like a refuse pit only let him venture beyond the mouth of this cave into those soft yellow rays they would eat him alive like the metalmolding acids of the szgany east of the great pass whose skills in the forging of wargauntlets alone kept them safe from the raids of the wamphyri the sunlight would kill him reduce him to so much smoke and stench to tar and sticky black bones for nestor was a vampire and the sun his mortal enemy and yet it had not always been like this except he couldnt remember when or how it had been different in nestors early days in the last aerie towering tall over starsides barren boulder plains he had frequently suffered from sleeplessness then the place had been alien to him and full of fearsome sounds weird sighings strange laughter and screams a great many of those eventually hed discovered a trick by means of which he might lull his jittery mind and thumping heart to sleep it was a simple device he would try to recall to memory details of that earlier time before he became wamphyri all a waste of effort and useless as counting goats on a crag for he rarely remembered anything of his life before those days hed spent in the lonely home of brad berea deep in the sunside forest but in his cave by the gurgling stream safe for the moment from his terror of the lepers and the sun alike this time nestor had tried a variation on the theme he had attempted to recall all that had occurred since that night when he left the shelter of brad bereas cabin to follow the coldly glittering northstar and seek out the wamphyri in starside and this time it had worked almost before nestor could begin gathering his few vague memories of prewamphyri times together at last he had fallen asleep except his device worked better than hed supposed so that even whilst sleeping the chain of thought which he had set in motion continued thus as nestors body rested and his metamorphic flesh worked unseen to repair itself his dreaming mind recounted in vivid detail all of his morbid story but few men would have called it dreaming at first it came in flashes nestors neardrowning the burly brad berea fishing on the riverbank somewhere east of twin fords and saving nestors life when his body came drifting headdown in the water then brads cabin his daughter glina who had wanted nestor for his body well shed wanted something more than that a man to call her own and fill her lonely days and nights he had been all of a man certainly enough for any woman as well though that she hadnt wanted a mind for nestor had been an amnesiac damaged his head broken he had no memories no past except a lone voice in the back of his mind which was wont to repeat insistently i am the lord nestor but only a notion for obviously he was not wamphyri the sun didnt harm him he ate common fare like common men his senses were less than a vampires indeed less than those of a whole man no it had been a fantasy some lone fragment from lost times or a forecast glina made him a man in part anyway but never a whole man pondering a vanished past nestors mind was wont to wander lacking the cohesion of memory his brain and body seemed detached as if he lived by the will of another knowing glinas flesh and having her became instinctive an automatic thing so that in fact there was nothing of love in it but with blood racing in his veins and his shaft rocking to and fro within her passion of a kind would light in his eyes and emotion of a sort blaze up in his heart but it was never love glina had known that and sometimes at the climax of nestors strange cold passion as he jerked to a crescendo in her body she had sensed that he would like to kill her for then at the height of their sex his hands would leave her breasts and seek her throat so that she must protect herself sometimes too she would hear him speak a name misha misha it had been like a curse bitter as a wormy apple on his tongue so that glina had hated this misha without even knowing her because nestor had known and loved her yes and shed hurt him more than glina ever could or so brad bereas homely daughter suspected then came the night of the wamphyri their flyers wafting high overhead the propulsors of their warriors making thunder and stenches in the clear night air but the house of brad berea was hidden in a forest thicket camouflaged secret secure the wamphyri passed by like swiftfleeting clouds heading north for the northstar to starside across the barrier range but nestor had seen them he felt their weird allure and in the back of his mind as always a small but insistent voice repeating i am the lord nestor of the wamphyri a vampire lord perhaps he had been upon a time and now by some freak of misfortune was changed back to a man one way or the other he had to know that night as the house slept nestor crept out into the dark and took his leave of the bereas but trekking through the gloomy heart of the forest he was never alone like a clot of blue ice frozen and glittering over the barrier mountains the northstar was both beacon and companion for he knew that the star of illomen shone down not only on sunside but also on starside and the last great aerie of the wamphyri towards dawn nestor had found himself in the foothills and in the presence of monsters a pair of wamphyri lords had come to fight a duel on sunside which nestor witnessed wran killglance was one and vasagi the suck the other vasagis face was a nightmare in itself with no mouth or chin as such but a tapering trunk and flickering needle proboscis like the siphon of some monstrous insect but worse than a nightmare when wran was done for then vasagis face had looked like the hole which is left behind when a limb is wrenched from its socket all bloody and dripping from its rim but nestor had been more than just a witness indeed he had been part of the fight and had probably saved wrans life for in his horror of the conflict the animal ferocity which the enormously powerful combatants displayed nestor had temporarily forgotten his perverse desire to be a lord himself and of the two who fought wran had at first seemed the least alien at first aye later with the flush of a false dawn flowing like molten gold along the far southern horizon wran had dragged vasagi to the hillside and pegged him down to await the suns rising and while he worked so he questioned nestor about his part in all this and discovered his motive that he would be wamphyri at that a grimly ironic scheme had entered wrans mind here was one vampire about to die vasagi and his leech still in him and here a szgany youth just itching to take his place and why not wran owed him that much at least it would be such a simple thing to arrange it had been arranged wran had sent nestor on some small errand and in his absence opened vasagis spine through skin flesh muscle and ribs to find and drain his leech for to a vampire the blood is the life and the best vessel from which to drink it is another vampires parasite preferably an enemys drained and dying finally the sucks leech had deserted him and issued its egg as nestor returned wran caught up the small skittering pearly spheroid into his hand to stare at it in grim satisfaction he knew that if he wran were a suitable vessel then that vasagis egg would soak like quicksilver through his skin and inhabit him but he already had a mature parasite leech of his own which would devour any intruder in a trice then opening his fist to show nestor the naked egg wran had called him closer and as if blowing a kiss hed sent the thing flying into the others gawping face it had taken nothing more than that it was the quickest easiest way to become a vampire not the virulent bite which brings about lethargy death and undeath and not sex which likewise transmits stuff of the vampire between bodies for in cases such as these the transition is only gradual the victim will become a vampire always invariably but not always wamphyri ah but when the egg itself is passed on the melding had caused nestor such pain as he could never have believed possible without experiencing it by the time he had recovered strength enough to crawl the sun was very nearly up but there on a bluff vasagis flyer had waited its spatulate head nodding this way and that in a soughing breeze off sunsides forests and nestor had known what he must do making his way to the flyer he passed close to vasagi who still clung to life despite his hideous wounds then the suck had begged him to loosen the pegs which held him fast to the hillside for after all nestor already possessed vasagis egg and would soon become heir to his flyer so what more could he want surely he could afford to spare his life what little of it remained and not leave him to melt in the sun nestor had been naive in the ways of the wamphyri if his egg were a mature leech doubtless it would have caused him to laugh but with his own agonies so fresh in his mind he could scarcely bear the thought of anothers and such agonies to slump into gurgling glue vaporize to roiling smoke and stench and steam away to nothing like a slug tossed into a campfire and so hed paused a moment to loosen and yank free the sucks pegs before carrying on towards the patiently waiting flyer before thered been a crossbow bolt transfixing the v of muscle between vasagis neck and shoulder nestor knew for he was the one who had put it there now the ironwood bolt lay in the bloodied dust and nestors empty crossbow swung at his hip automatically he had taken up the bolt and clipped it into its housing under the crossbows tiller for if he was really on his way to starside it would be as well to take a weapon along especially now that he knew what to expect there the crossbow should provide some security at least for in all sunside there was no finer shot than nestor so they had used to say back in back in back where but nestor no longer remembered then hed found vasagis bloodied battle gauntlet hanging by a thong from the flyers saddle where wran had left it for him but even then with the deadly furnace sun so close to breaching the far horizon and just as close to sending out its sighing searing golden rays still the flyer had known its wouldbe rider for a stranger and would not launch until the crippled vasagi sent a mindcall winging to stir the beast to action aye you were ever a faithful creature when i told you to stay you stayed but now you belong to another it pleases me to give you to him for a while at least and now its time to fly or die so fly fly only then on vasagis command had the flyer extended its wings and as alveolate bones membrane and muscle stretched in metamorphic flux so the creature had launched itself aloft a moment more and then wind whipping in nestors face as his mount glided out and turned in a rising thermal over sunside and as its arched manta wings formed vast scoops or airtraps so the beast rose up towards the peaks where soon the sun would strike with hammers of gold but nestor was no longer afraid not of anything for welling up from deep within his changelings mind and body hed heard the first discordant notes of a strange savage and wonderful song wamphyri and how that silent song of metamorphosis had thrilled in his contaminated blood for at last he had known he was on his way to starside to the last aerie wamphyri wamphyyyyri in nestors dream the past came alive with such immediacy and in such vivid detail it was as if he lived it again indeed as if it were happening even now with the reins trapped in his right hand and gripping the lefthand horn of twin pommels in the other he used his knees to cling tightly to the hump of the wellrubbed leather saddle and flattening himself down out of the slipstream he leaned a little forward into the force of the blast but even lacking fear and feeling a wild exhilaration still he hung on for dear life the wind in his face snatched at his breath and struck cold against his clenched teeth he found his position precarious to say the least and jammed his heels firmly up under the flyers wings where they met its body to give himself more purchase but at least he was airborne and starside bound at last and his weird mount so heavy and unwieldy on the ground now it glided like some prehistoric bird balancing itself on turbulent currents of air and steadily gaining altitude bravo ah but while it knew how to fly nestor did not perhaps he had known it upon a time but all long forgotten now vague memories revenant of some elusive shadowy past of a flyer just like this one all crashed and broken on sunside screaming in lethal sunlight as its skin cracked open to issue jets of steam and its fluids dripping free like the juices of a pig on a spit were all that remained maybe that was how hed got himself marooned and lost his memory in the first place by crashing his flyer on sunside and banging his head it was an explanation at least well and now hed be a lord again and have new things to remember ah but new things to learn first like flying as the mountainside fell away and the furious bluster slackened he leaned forward between the jutting pommels and wiped at his streaming tears and slitting his eyes finally he could see again meanwhile in its search for thermals the flyer had spiralled south and there far out across the furnace desert nestor spied a spear of yellow light lancing from the molten horizon striking west upon the flanks of the gaunt grey mountains sunup and nestors time on sunside was at an end north he shouted at his mount north starside the last aerie from the west all along the spine of the barrier range the fan of fire crept closer and the mountains came alive with light the yellow egg of the sun was set to hatch on the southern horizon to let its golden bird of prey fly free but now as if answering nestors cry however grudgingly his flyer wheeled lumberingly north and seemed to hang there a moment in midair suspended between the uppermost peaks and as in a frenzy he cried faster fly faster the beast commenced a leisurely drift inwards over peaks ravines and plateau jumbles till finally lowering its tapering neck and head it slid gradually into a glide nestor couldnt know it but his mount found no great novelty in all this drama it had flown this way before with vasagi the suck and knew the route well enough there was nothing new here except its rider a feebleseeming fellow at best his thoughts were blunt as wedges not needlesharp like the sucks hed not once used his spurs but sat there wan and windlashed in the saddle why he was here at all remained a mystery perhaps nestor sensed the flyers slow dull thoughts and its low regard for himself but with the sun at his heels he was done with gentling the beast he snatched the dart from under his crossbows tiller leaned forward between the pommel horns and tickled the creatures spine then concentrated his thoughts in a stream of abuse along its leathery neck and into its head and he finished with a threat make haste now or ill crawj along your neck and stick this in your ear the beast heard him more than that it felt the first hot breath of the sun upon its hindquarters put its nose down and glided into the shadows of a pass and safe from the sun at last it sped for starside nestor breathed a sigh of relief and in the next moment heard guttural laughter and a ringing cry bravo it was wran he launched his flyer from the shadows of a ridge and came up alongside you made it by a breath what on a count of ten your beasts wings would have blackened and crisped to dust aye and its a long way down lord nestor of the wamphyri his words carried on the air but they were also in nestors mind it was an art of the wamphyri at close range like this they were thoughtthieves to a man but some much better than others vasagi had been a veritable master of telepathy while wrans talent was merely middling now it was nestors turn why did you wait ahhh wran was taken by surprise but recovered in a moment what a mentalist too but is it you nestor or simply the effect of vasagis egg if the latter then obviously you got a good one considering its source that is and again he laughed as to why i waited simple curiosity frankly i didnt think youd make it since you have and since im responsible or your predicament it seems only right that i should escort you into starside introduce you and make explanation for youre a cool one nestor and in no way the fool i first considered you the suck was my enemy but youu make a useful ally and what will you get out of it well believe me youll need all the friends you can get in wrathstack wrathstack it was news to nestor but the suffix stack had brought a flash of memory synonymous with aerie it had painted a picture in his mind of the last great redoubt of the wamphyri called karenstack it had been upon a time of that he was sure also that he had been there before but when how his thoughts were so intense that wran picked them from his mind without difficulty and answered many a lord or lady has dwelled there from time to time i should think since the early days of turgo zolte i cant say for i dont know starsides history but now the aerie has new tenants and on the whole we call it wrathstack after the lady wratha who brought us here from turgosheim in the east his thoughts had turned sour now shes your leader nestor was mainly innocent careless in his choice of words she was for a while wran growled in his head and with a strong man to ride and guide her who can say she could be again well a partner in leadership at least but thats for the future plainly hed grown tired of the conversation now lets make haste for ive been too long away aye and things are wont to change in a hurry in wrathstack he drew ahead put on a spurt and sent his flyer diving into the great pass which split the barrier range in a dogleg north to south nestor followed to hurtle above the bed of the pass at breakneck speed the bend in the dogleg lay to the rear a haze of yellow where the suns lethal rays were trapped for now any danger of burning was past and the hackles on nestors neck lay flat the earlier exhilaration of his ride returned feeling more in control he began to enjoy it he urged his flyer on faster faster get in front show that sluggish creature how to fly his beast responded pulled ahead left wran in its wake hah wran called after him and so you see he bred good creatures old vasagi but on the other hand why theres not so much meat on you and then less grudgingly still you do sit the beast well so that what with your mentalism and all i fancy youll do all right nestor looked back and laughed and cried out loud til do better than all right oh really wran pulled alongside again well i hope you do but the odds are all against it what you have to remember is this in wrathstack were all vampires born and me why i might well have been born in the saddle but this time his laughter was grating as iron in cold ashes as he swerved his flyer in towards nestors caught it a glancing blow and almost sent it crashing into the wall of the canyon turning sideon to fan the precipitous rock the creature flattened like a leaf to scrape the weathered stone and for a moment nestor felt hed be tilted into space then the danger was past and he could breathe again and from up ahead so youll do better than all right will you maybe you will at that but first you must live long enough eh it had been a lesson and nestor wouldnt forget it just one of several things which he wouldnt forget about wran the rage the end of the pass was now in sight where the mountains sloped down to starsides boulder plains and on the left just coming into view the bulging blinding dome of the halfburied sphere portal to the helllands nestor knew it without knowing how he knew likewise the plume or finger of glowing poisoned earth that pointed from the gate out across the barren plains towards the icelands to him these things were more than adequate confirmation that indeed hed been here before if only he could remember but he was given no time to ponder the enigma for up ahead wran swerved right eastwards away from the gate and out towards karenstack the last great aerie of the wamphyri miles sped by beneath the manta flyers where their moon and starcast shadows flowed like stains in the immemorial dust or like clots of darkness over bald domed boulders and riven earth alike and looming in the northeast vast monument to the evil of ages past wrathstack was a lone fang among the stumps of fallen stacks where the shattered aeries of the olden lords lay in tumbled disarray littering the plain like corpses or rotted mushrooms petrified to stone and as if wran read nestors mind again though in fact he merely conversed his question came ringing oh and have you been here before too lord nestor aye he had the once at least these jumbles of toppled stone their configurations seemed so familiar they were like memories in themselves yet they failed to spark others in the aching void of nestors head but he made no comment neither speech nor thought except to drive his beast that much faster and draw level again with his vampire companion ahead loomed a stack threequarters of a kilometre broad at its screelittered base rising to three hundred metres high by two hundred wide where its hollow neck was like the shattered bole of an ancient tree felled by lightning and turned to stone the rest of it the aerie that had been lay in blocks like the knuckles of a skeletal spine stretched out across the plain but it was only the first of many side by side wran and nestor rose up and flew across the mighty stump from side to side and looked down into its yawning hollowed maw there were rooms down there vast pits and stairwells of bone and stone and polished vats like the molds for making monsters exactly so cried wran picking up nestors thoughts again for this was an aerie upon a time why it must have rivalled wrathstack itself in turgosheim in the east men and warriors have clashed and blood been spilled over many a lesser manse than this nestor looked across at him and yet now why do you live lumped together in wrathstack ahhah wran cried it must be the recluse in you as it was in vasagi he too would have stayed on his own if he could it was because the suck felt crowded in turgosheim that he came here with the rest of us to olden starside or perhaps its simply your longing for an aerie and territories of your own which is an urge common among the wamphyri but you know what nestor why i find myself halfwilling to believe that the spirit of some olden creature some vampire out of time has indeed returned to inhabit you in other words youre a natural lad a natural they sped on gaining height over a wilderness of twisted bone and fretted rock ruins over tortured cartilage relics and fireblackened mounds where other grand aeries had exploded in their bases and slumped down into themselves forming pyramids of scree and rubble and wrathstack drawing ever closer rearing on high its uppermost towers battlements launchingbays and windows most of a kilometre high and more than an acre in crosssection ii the last aerie and up now up wran shouted let the winds take you where they spiral round this last great spire climb nestor commanded his flyer follow on behind gain height form scoops with your wings trap the air and rise on the rising thermals it was all sound advice but wasted good practice but nothing more his creature was experienced in all such matters and wrathstack loomed closer still less than a hundred metres from the wall of the colossal stack both flyers discovered sighing currents of air and commenced a mighty rising spiral and as they climbed so nestor benefited from wrans knowledge of the place down below the rage sent in the nethermost levels the very bowels of the place thats gorvis domain the dark and devious gorvi the guile he keeps the wells and has flightless warriors on the ground to repel any wouldbe incursions hah a pointless exercise if ever were attacked it wont be from the ground its just a measure of the way he watches his back we dont call him the guile for nothing ah see here he comes now eager to know who won the duel and now returns victorious out of sunside but myself or vasagi what odds it will make no difference to gorvi hell be sour he always is a flyer launched from a cavern mouth beneath an overhang of rock and came spiralling up behind fresh from resting the creature fanned its manta wings and rapidly gained on wran and nestors weary beasts nestor twisted in his saddle and looked back and down his wide curious eyes met gorvis only a wingspan to the left and a metre or two below and he saw immediately how well the others nickname suited him the guile sat hunched by no means cadaverous yet remarkably corpselike scowling in his saddle the dome of his head was shaven save for a single central lock with a knot hanging to the rear dressed in black with his cloak belling out like tattered wings the contrast of his sallow features turned him to a leprous vulture settling to its prey with eyes so deeply sunken they were little more than a crimson glimmer yet shifty for all that and hands clutching the reins like skinny claws this was gorvi he seemed a sinister creature but of course for he was wamphyri and he didnt like the way nestor stared back at him whats this gorvi finally called out to wran some captive youve brought back out of sunside a new lieutenant perhaps was he your second in the duel wran and if so did vasagi have one also if not be sure therell be some who say you cheated wran dropped back a little and settled lower levelling with gorvi do you think so he called across scowling to match the others scowl theyll say i cheated eh well as long as youre not one of them youll be safe or is it that you too would care to fly to sunside with me and try your luck in the gloomy forests i meant nothing by it gorvi shrugged and reined back a little i was making conversation thats all and so youve taken a prisoner but a proud one if im not mistaken again nestor turned to look back at gorvi and this time his lip curled a little as he shouted you want to know who i am gorvi the guile then speak to me not about me my names nestor lord nestor of the wamphyri and the last thing i am is a captive eh gorvi was astonished if not outraged but no buts wran cut him short learn all about it at my reception but until then keep your nose out im instructing the young lord nestor in the ways of the stack its personalities and their responsibilities in the various levels which they inhabit our time is short so begone gorvi reined in more yet and fell to the rear and wran continued proudly these next levels up a good many as you see are mine mine and my brother spiros wherein we control the main refuse pits and methane chambers these are a great responsibility a huge weight upon our shoulders which are broad to take it if not for the diligence of the brothers killglance the stack would go without heat and light eventually without inhabitants seven great levels highceilinged indeed cavernous and likewise huge across that is the extent of madmanse for weve named our place in memory of our old manse in turgosheim do you see but new madmanse is far and away superior to our haunted old promontory home in the east and oh so well equipped we have launching bays vats for the brewing of creatures and all manner of rooms halls and stables in turgosheim in the time of the tithe fresh meat was hard to come by we kept beasts to supplement our diet but here sunside is a wellstocked larder a hive full of honey a bottomless well of sweet whatever and chuckling obscenely he glanced across at nestor as they spiralled higher still nestor began to shiver for the cold was finding its way into his bones soon hed no longer notice it too much but for now he sat like an icicle in his saddle in any case he was soon distracted as out from a yawning launching bay sprang spiro killglance aboard a flyer of his own ho brother he shouted gleefully across at wran so youve had it out and the suck is no more i for one never doubted the outcome but how did you deal with him and who is your friend his eyebrows came together in a frown as first he stared then glared at nestor nestor in turn stared back and committed spiros details to memory patently the brothers were twins and possibly even identical though certainly not in their mannerisms or mode of dress for where wran actually looked the lord spiro seemed far more a vagabond or ruffian removed from his brother as chalk from cheese he was loutish with a loosehanging lower lip and mainly malign expression and his clothes were disreputable to say the least a rag of leather for a shirt a dirty breechclout and a strip of cloth on his forehead to keep his unkempt hair out of his fiery scarlet eyes other than this and the fact that wran wore a small black wen upon his chin the brothers were physically alike tall broadshouldered and a little overweight they might even be said to be handsome or perhaps handsome specimens certainly they were not ugly not in appearance anyway by now vasagis blood is boiling to slime wran answered his brothers query i drained his leech then pegged him out on a hillside to await the suns rising as for this one he glanced again at nestor he was of use to me at any rate i count him an ally he is the lord nestor spiros eyebrows peaked a lord did you say indeed wran answered for he has the sucks egg ahhh sighed the other in amaze but you must tell me all all in good time wran replied but for now lets get on and to nestor where was ah yes madmanse which now falls behind and bejow and up ahead mangemanse where canker canison crows to the moon and higher still suckscar hah but now it shall have a new name to go with its new master what do you say to that nestor in nestors youth hed learned a trick to keep his brothers thoughts out of his mind though his youth and even his brother were forgotten to him now the trick itself remained accessible it involved thinking obliquely to one side of his main stream of thoughts and so keeping his secrets to himself the art was an instinctive thing and useful now as never before for wran believed that vasagi had melted in the sun perhaps he had and perhaps not but nestor saw how hazardous it could be to admit what hed done namely that hed set vasagi free after wran had left him for dead perhaps for a similar if not quite the same reason he should also leave well enough alone in the renaming of vasagis manse for which reason finally let the name stand he answered wran in his own mode suckscar will suffice for now at least but then a moment more and he gasped aloud for suddenly wrans meaning had sunk in that suckscar should be named anew with a name to suit himself its new master lord nestor of the wamphyri and finally no longer guarding his thoughts but letting them fly free for now i really am wamphyri but huh came spiros mental grunt and to wran brother youre changeable as the winds chasing themselves around wrathstack i thought wed arranged that i should be master of suckscar that way between us wed control almost half the stack and now now wran answered why with this simpleton nestor in place if we can fix it it will amount to much the same thing that way before too long and after we settle one or two other scores why youjl still be available to inhabit some other level eh then for a while gradually receding their chuckles hung black as sin and just as secretive dwindling to nothing in the mental ether and now there were four flyers all strung out in a row climbing towards the higher levels and bays nestor wran eventually called aloud as rocky caverns and ledges fretted bone causeways and external staircases of fused cartilage and stone slipped down and away into the abyss of air there goes mangemanse below only four levels as you see more than sufficient for the great hound who dwells there and not much i can tell you about them their masters responsibilities are few indeed he seems to exist only to keep us apart wratha and the rest of us i mean but when we take to our beds canker is often on the prowl he keeps more bitches than the rest of us he has his needs you know but his real mistress is the silver moon oh youll hear his howling soon enough as he sings his devotions to his goddess on high still it surprises me hes not here for my reception ah but other things are on his mind spiro cut in across the blustery gulf for canker builds a thing of bones he builds a what wran shook his head and laughed his amaze a device of pipes large and small made from the hollow bones of warriors where he finds them littered on the boulder plains hes spent the entire night with his lieutenants flying to and fro lifting up bones to his kennel but why for what good reason a device you say what sort of device spiro shrugged an instrument musical he says musical wran was nonplussed like the szgany troupe which devetaki skullguise kept in masquemanse aye they were musicians but canker an instrument of hollow bones to help him in his devotions spiro tried to explain he swears the moons deaf and cant hear him or else shed come down to be his lover and so hes determined to sing all the louder with the help of the thing which he fashions from these bones how dont ask me ask him hah and to think they call us the mad ones but we only rage we dont rave suckscar wran cried forgetting in a moment cankers doings and these were vasagis levels yours now nestor or soon to be we hope not much to tell not much to do in suckscar for the heavy duties are all below but vasagi was the expert in metamorphism he could make monsters his vats will be yours now including the beasts which are brewing in them but youll doubtless fashion creatures of your own given time and with a little help a favour for a favour eh spiro he winked at his brother gliding now to one side we can all use a little help from time to time but in any case enough of that for youll soon be exploring suckscar to your hearts content he lifted his head looked on and up and smiled a gaping smile and now to my reception threequarters of a kilometre below the collapsed mounds and shattered stacks of toppled aeries were stony jumbles on a pebble plain southwest majestic now the barrier mountains were golden in their peaks while central and to the east the grey gradually faded to yellow hours yet some thirty or more before the sun would strike through the central peaks and play her rays on wrathstack and then only in these highest levels still and all in other times the wamphyri would be preparing for their long sleep for even the thought of the sun was unbearable except now a victor had returned out of sunside and desired his reception it was only just after all wrathspire cried wran and why not for it is indeed the very spire of the stack and wrathas the lady who dwells here her apartments are the loftiest and dare i say it the lordliest so where better to accept the grudging applause of my peers and see the mistress herself awaits us riding a gusting wind wrans flyer rounded a jagged natural buttress and settled towards a cavernous landing bay the others were close behind spiro then gorvi jumping the queue and finally nestor he was busy now anxiously commanding his flyer follow the others stay in line easy now easy but not so busy he could fail to notice the lady wratha where she leaned against the carved bone balcony of an observation port above and to one side of the bay even a glimpse was riveting magnetic so that nestors eyes felt compelled to linger upon her that couldnt be however for gorvis flyer was already down and shuffling to one side making room for nestors beast nestors creature knew what it was about balancing on the wind it waited its turn its wings were arched into huge traps thrusters extended forward to take the shock of landing briefly nestor experienced a moment of vertigo the sheer height was appalling he didnt look down but clung to reins and saddle and wisely refrained from issuing any further commands finally gorvis beast cleared the landing area and nestors flyer inched forward and settled to the grainy rock as thralls came forward to take the reins and lead the creature aside nestor slid gratefully to the ground except it wasnt the ground but the mouth of a cavern two thousand eight hundred feet high above the boulder plains and even safe on the floor of the vast landing bay still nestor staggered wran came from somewhere took his arm and whispered now is not the time to show weakness let me do the talking and all will go well nestor was only too pleased to submit to this scheme he was dizzy awed and had no words at the back of the landing bay stone staircases with balustrades of bone climbed the rock wall to tunnels and balconies which in turn led to higher levels of honeycombed rock descending to the lower levels other gangways passed through steep shafts or cartilage stairwells but on high looking down from one of the balconies there stood wratha and lured by her presence finally nestors eyes focused upon her and she was a sight for sore eyes for her part wratha merely glanced at him however speculatively before speaking to wran the lord killglance back from sunside i see and all in one piece she raised an inquiring eyebrow the suck need you ask wran returned smiling like a skull oh i know your preferences wratha but alas it isnt so by now vasagis all rendered down a stain on the hill where i pegged him out to await the rising sun and indeed the sun was hot on our heels as we left we again her eyes flickered over nestor and returned to wran wran glanced at nestor his is a story i can tell at my reception wratha nodded well i prepared a feast for one of you whoever was the victor so now will you join me in my apartments on high the others gorvi and spiro were already on their way up a boneembellished causeway wran and nestor would follow them at once but there came an interruption from below out of one of the sunken stairwells the hugeshouldered figure of a man appeared clad in the polished leather garb of a lieutenant my lady he called up to wratha i beg pardon for the intrusion but i believe it is my right his eyes under shaggy black brows were feral scarlet in their cores a true disciple of vampirism wratha scowled down on him vasagis man indeed he replied i am gore sucksthrall first out of sunside firstmade of vasagi in suckscar now keeper of the vats it seems my masters manse goes wanting a leader if i am worthy of that honour i would ascend while wratha and gore exchanged words the lords on the stairs and in the landing bay paused to listen as gore finished gorvi the guile clapped his hands briefly and cried well said for he could smell trouble a mile away and invariably encouraged it but wran grasped nestors arm tightly and muttered damn it to hell a complication and wratha nodded and called down well then gore sucksthrall maybe youd better come up and sweeping her eyes over the others but gentlemen no gauntlets if you please it is a rule im obliged to enforce certain of my creatures are easily disturbed and volatile to say the least it was meant as a warning not a threat wratha kept her small personal warriors chained when she had visitors but as she slipped away her deceptively sweet laughter came floating down to them and to a man they knew who was mistress here in the aeries heights through all of this nestor didnt take his eyes off her until the moment she drifted out of sight through an archway behind the balcony then he blinked looked at wran and said wratha but it seemed as if her afterimage still burned on his retinas and he could still see her there she was tall even as tall as nestor himself with hair black as night in plaits that fell to her shoulders around her neck she wore a golden torque or harness with ropes of black bat fur depending vertically to form a smoky curtain milky limbs gleamed as if oiled through the black stripes of fur but her naked arms projected likewise the points of her tilted breasts a jong pale oval of thigh and a delicate knee the image was fading now but nestor continued to examine what remained of it wrathas eyes had been least in evidence protected by a scarp of figured bone upon her brow their fire had been subdued by the ornamentation of blueglittering crystals fixed to her temples and matching earrings in the furred lobes of her fleshy ears but apart from the shelllike whorls of those wamphyri ears and the somewhat flattened aspect of a nose whose convolutions had not seemed too exaggerated and the scarlet flicker of her split vampires tongue of course apart from those things she might well have been szgany in short she had looked more woman than a lady of the wamphyri as nestor might have expected one to be looked it at least wratha the risen aye wran answered sourly starting up the stone stairs but after two paces he paused looked back at nestor and said what does she interest you then stricken are you what you he slapped his thigh and laughed hah and was sober again in a moment better watch your step nestor she fancies young men out of sunside nestor following behind inquired something to fear not really the other grunted sweeping up the stairs not unless you make her angry its not a good idea to make the lady wratha angry and behind them both gore sucksthrall followed in surly mood saying nothing at all they climbed through three expansive levels to wrathspires great hall where the ladys thralls had prepared a table for five the table was enormous five feet wide and extending all of fortyfive feet down the hall from wrathas bonethrone it could easily have accommodated three dozen people at its head upon a shallow platform and so slightly elevated there stood wrathas great chair in which sat the lady herself the bonethrone was a monstrous marvellous thing the skeletal lower jaw of some vast longdead creature which she had acquired along with the furniture and all other appurtenances of wrathspire the day shed arrived in this abandoned derelict place out of turgosheim the stack had been derelict then at least but now due chiefly to wrathas industry it had returned to loathsome life already seated when her thralls ushered her guests into the great hall wratha came briefly to her feet and made apology of a sort i had prepared for five since it appears were now six my girls are setting an extra place or perhaps two for canker may yet honour his obligations wran killglance as victor you will take the chair directly opposite mine at the guests head of table you others may sit where you will female thralls scurried finished setting places then fled out of sight wran seated himself opposite wratha at the end of the table as she had suggested and indicated a seat to nestor some three chairs away on his left nestor took the indicated chair and sat there wondering what to do with himself the chair was built for a man or more properly a lord of the wamphyri seated in it he felt like a mere boy in time his vampire leech developed from vasagis egg would attend to that his metamorphic flesh would stretch and fill out but for now well at least he could try thinking like a lord spiro killglance sat on nestors left with some five or six chairs separating them opposite spiro gore sucksthrall took his place and gorvi the guile edged into a chair across from nestor on the table in front of wrathas guests wooden platters hollowed into shallow bowls contained barbed stabbing spikes of soft gold there were leather drinking jacks and several large jugs of fired pottery patterned in the fashion of sunsides szgany containing sweet water or weak wine for the jacks wratha knew better than to serve strong drink her own plate and cup were of gold she likewise knew how to make her guests feel small and even unworthy the fare was scarcely extravagant lightly braised hearts kidneys and livers of shads and four suckling wolves roasted on spits and basted in a sauce of their mothers milk urine and blood individual or special requirements were not catered for the food was simply an expression of wrathas hospitality the wamphyri normally refuelled themselves in the first hours after sundown according to personal needs habits and tastes that which at this hour would be breakfast to a traveller was therefore a mere novelty to them nestor on the other hand was hungry he had last eaten well before sundown in the cabin of brad berea in the forest in the timescale of a parallel world beyond the starside gate that was the equivalent of four days there was no way nestor could know that but he did know that since sundown hed survived on a few nuts and a piece of wild fruit in the woods scarcely sufficient to keep body and soul together well too late now to worry about his soul but his body must go on at least also while his memory was still largely impaired prior to his time spent with the bereas his mind itself was completely healed and receptive made receptive by his parasite egg which demanded that he be strong and cunning so that he was constantly learning the ability indeed the need to learn anew had been sparked within him and with no background as such an empty past every smallest item of new information was soaking into his brain like rain into desiccated earth while deep in his subconscious thirsty seeds of ambition knowledge even memory however misshapen or mutated from their source material were waiting to spring to life but he could not become wise strong wamphyri in a depleted body and so he ate he ate with gusto stabbing a slice of shad liver which was in any case a szgany delicacy and doing it justice as he held it in his hand and tore at it with strong teeth and such was his hunger that the meat never even touched his platter another slice followed and a steaming kidney whole which he manoeuvred onto his plate without losing but a splash of gravy then a jack of wine and tender flesh from a thigh of suckling wolf the szgany didnt eat wolf but nestor didnt know what the meat was whatever he would have eaten it it was strong and imparted strength and while he ate he studied his surroundings the great hall was all of a hundred and fifty feet long by sixty feet wide it ran parallel with the southfacing wall of the stack where windows had been cut through the solid rock to the chasm of open air that spanned the boulder plains all the way to the barrier mountains in places these deep embrasures in the wall of the spire were almost tunnels in others where the rock was thinner they formed archways out onto high balconies of grafted bone whose baffles of hide and cartilage were so constructed as to turn aside and deaden the buffeting of the wind framed in one such opening nestor observed the fluttering of a banner which periodically displayed wrathas sigil a kneeling man in silhouette with slumped shoulders and bowed head each window was fitted with black batfur drapes which presently stood open giving access to the pale dawn light many hours still to go before the sun shone on wrathspire by which time the curtains would be drawn but from where nestor sat if he turned his head a little he could see the morning mists of sunside gathering in the gaunt grey peaks and passes forming clouds and drifting free the sight was nothing new to him except in previous times hed seen it from the other side perhaps at that at these distant echoes and thoughts out of the past of sunside and what he had been there nestor felt something of poignancy for a life gone and forgotten forever but all such emotions were rapidly fading now in two of the corners of the mainly irregular hall curtained areas hid wrathas smaller personal warriors from view but in a third she had deliberately left the drapes open at the sight of the creature shackled there her guests were reminded yet again of wrathas sovereignty in these dizzy aerial levels twice the size of a man and nine times heavier with overlapping inchthick scales of bluegrey chitin armour the creature was mainly claws jaws and teeth going on all fours like a bear it would occasionally rear upright grunt and mutter questioningly and shake its chains curiously but purely out of habit during the daylight hours proper when the sun was high and wratha had taken to her bed two of these beasts would be stationed in the stairwells near the launching bays while the third would roam through wrathspire top to bottom guarding mainly against aerial incursions but also patrolling wrathas chambers the ladys lieutenants and thralls some of whom had duties in these unsociable hours had her scent upon them of course and so were safe but as for any stranger nestors gaze was attracted to the dome of the ceiling where on several occasions hed sensed some strange furtive activity now he saw what it was a colony of giant desmodus bats for in the darkest corners and the gloom of deep ledges wrathspires lesser inhabitants clung like dense black cobwebs or fragments of a shroud to walls and ceiling causing the darkness to crawl there even as nestor watched a party of latecomers entered through a window chittering shrilly as they dispersed to various parts of the living blanket vampires all though not of the human strain these were wrathas familiars and nestor wondered but in no way morbidly if he would be heir to just such a colony five levels down in suckscar while making these observations nestor had continued to eat until now he was replete sighing he stripped a last morsel of tender flesh from the thigh bone of a wolfcub glanced round the table and paused in his chewing every eye seemed rapt upon him the way he had disposed of his food finally he put down the gleaming bone ran his fingers through his hair to clean them and glanced at wran questioningly the rage seemed to find something amusing he stifled a laugh and merely grinned and took another sip from his jack but wratha no less fascinated than the others raised an eyebrow and said well at least one of us has an appetite which galvanized the rest of her guests to something of activity at least for now they too took up their skewers in a little while as all of them about the table joined nestor in swilling wine and picking at various tidbits wratha stood up and rapped for attention my lords she began dryly we are gathered here to honour a special person upon a rare and special occasion namely the reception of wran killglance on his return out of sunside where in the night he had business with vasagi the suck alas vasagi is no more i now call upon wran called the rage and rightly to tell us all and spare no detail of trial and triumph in the telling she sat down it had been a standard opening the lords among them had all heard much the same before in turgosheim usually from vormulac unsleep master of melancholy vormspire wran sat up straighter and made as if to begin at which an interruption it was a sound or series of sounds a burble of notes piping trills as of sunside birds issuing from a stairwell at first an odd fluting soon it turned to laughter and then the two interspersed curious whistles and gales of raucous laughter and canker canison wran scowled before that one had even presented himself but in another moment he appeared with one of wrathas thralls bowing him in nestor looked saw him and his jaw dropped so this was the missing lord but a lord the others around the table were mainly human or born of woman at least but this one oh there was something of humanity in him but there was a great deal more of something else later nestor would learn a little of cankers history his unutterable lineage that somewhere in his ancestry there had been a fox dog or wolf whichever the creature had probably strayed from its normal hunting grounds on sunside or in the mountains and wandered into the swamps east of turgosheim to drink there it had become infected by a spore and emerged a vampire changeling after that the possibilities were several it had bitten or savaged someone and so passed on a canine strain of vampirism or inside the beast a leech had developed from the vampire spore whose egg later transferred to a man or woman who became wamphyri and ascended in turgosheim or some vampire had sired a litter on a dog bitch shewolf or vixen not necessarily by miscegenation probably by biting the creature when she was pregnant or in the case of someone like canker perhaps even sexually whichever evidence of this mongrel ancestry had been apparent in the line ever since and never more so than in canker canison standing upright and leaning forward he was tall as a tall man but his limbs were all out of proportion shoulders thighs and chest were massive while forelegs were slender sinewy wolflike cankers hands were hands but his knoblike thickly padded feet were plainly paws instead of nails his hands and feet alike were equipped with claws face and head while basically human were also disturbingly doglike with long jaws and canine teeth triangular eyes and pointed ears which were mobile expressive and thickly furred named after the disease of the inner ear which had driven his father baying mad and caused his suicide canker by use of his metamorphism had caused the lobes of his own ears to be fretted into curious and intricate designs which included his sigil a sickle moon cankers hair was a wiry foxy red his eyes too though in dusk or darkness they could as easily turn yellow and feral his gait was more a longstriding lope than a walk proper and from time to time he would fall to all fours then push himself upright with sinuous ease when he laughed there was more than a hint of howling in it and the gape of his jaws was enormous then too he would throw back his head and shake from tip to toe he was laughing now mainly at the longsuffering expressions on the faces of his peers but as the dogthings laughter died away so his spiky eyebrows came together in a frown over his long muchconvoluted snout and his voice became a growling rumble eh what and have you started without me the first gold is on the peaks canker wratha observed without turning a hair it is you who are late for someone who observes the future in dreams you scarcely seem to observe the present at all you have no sense of occasion but now that you are here wont you be seated late he sniffed the air glancing here and there about the table am i in which case you must excuse me i serve the moon as well you know and my industry on her behalf is great in honour of my silver mistress in the sky i am constructing an instrument he lifted a bone flute to his moist mouth blew several earpiercing notes then loped to a chair midway between nestor and spiro and seating himself canker tossed down the flute upon the table this was my inspiration the flute rolled to a rocking standstill in the middle of the table between nestor and gorvi the guile the latter picked it up examined it and said you found inspiration in this a szgany toy no canker shook his head and scowled only the pattern is szgany but i made this flute of bone szgany flutes are of reed and they break too easily this ones notes are purer because the bore is perfect then having made it i remembered all the times i had flown over the boulder plains and seen the remains of olden battles why in places the plains are a veritable boneyard the wars of our ancestors were bloody indeed men and monsters alike have died out there and for a thousand years their bones have bleached under the cold stars made silver by the moon in her passing and i thought those bones have worshipped her too but all in silence they have worshipped my silver mistress whose light has shone on them through all the centuries and remembering this flute or szgany toy if you insist i knew what i must do and i have started in my house are many windows facing north the icelands and the cold winds that blow i shall build baffles there in the central level to gather the winds within my manse there too i shall build my instrument he looked at the bone flute where gorvi had put it down for if a mere toy such as this in combination with lungs such as mine can make music fit for the ears of men how then a mighty orchestra of bones and the lungs of the very wind itself so shall i worship her on high while wrathstack thunders to the songs of the long dead and forgotten he fell quiet and glared all about the table gorvi nodded and put the flute down and murmured wrily fit for the ears of men aye what canker had heard him his ears were sensitive to a fault but gorvi only shrugged i was merely savouring the phrase your appreciation of music goes deeper than we had suspected canker the other sat back again loosely in his chair and likewise shrugged its a means to an end thats all to lure my silver mistress from the sky and make her my mistress proper he held up a cautionary protesting hand no no not the moon itself but the one who dwells there who who calls to me he saw the looks that passed between them gave himself a shake and sat up straighter then too as if for the first time he noticed nestor and gore sucksthrall but whats this do common thralls and lieutenants attend your reception wran and turning his head the other way do you sup with servants wratha or is it perhaps that theyre the main course and he leered at nestor wran said canker you are plainly exhausted gore sucksthrall here is a lieutenant sure enough but nestor this one has ascended he has an egg indeed he has vasagis egg for the suck has no more use for it but im surprised you didnt sniff it out for yourself ahhh the vampire egg of vasagi this boy canker leaned closer to nestor and sniffed cautiously as if at suspect meat but in a moment yes i see youre right and now if youll hear me out ill tell all said wran the others were all ears except nestor himself he knew the tale well enough and could afford to let his attention wander a little it didnt wander too far however for diagonally across the table gore sucksthrall was glaring pure poison at him from furious blazing eyes ill lord nestor of the wamphyri wran kept it short vasagi and i we flew off in different directions from madmanse and suckscar our arguments had been one too many and our enmity seemed insurmountable this was the only honourable way to settle it man to man on sunside for weapons we had our gauntlets nothing else i saw vasagi flying at a distance we acknowledged each other a nod of the head and even at that range he sent a thought i hope youve said your last farewells wran i not too late now for only one of us can return ajas it wont be you i thought to make some derisory answer but the distance was increasing despite vasagis superior mentalism he probably wouldnt hear me my range was not so extensive in that respect who among us is or was equal to vasagi having no speech as such his telepathy supplemented his ridiculous miming still his words had served as a warning not that i feared him you understand but he had reminded me of his skill as a thoughtthief from then on i would keep my own thoughts very well guarded i landed on sunside east of the great pass and manoeuvred my flyer back into a thicket of tall trees growing on the hillside in front was a bluff when all was done i could call my creature forward and launch without hindrance and then i waited he paused you waited said gorvi you didnt hunt for him wran shook his head my thought was that he would hunt for me if i moved about changing my location it would only make his task more difficult and the sooner we came together the better and so i waited well for a little while but this was sunside and i could smell the smoke of a szgany campfire not long extinguished so that suddenly the urge was on me oh its true i was here for different game this night of nights but i saw no harm in mixing business with pleasure i went to my flyer and cautioned him to be still quiet and wait for me i forbade any sort of commotion for whatever reason then i headed east on foot through the foothills the smoke stench came from that direction it was faint due to distance and the dispersal of small winds its source might be as much as seven or eight miles away that was nothing for i had an entire night at my disposal also i made no effort to hide my tracks but left a strong spoor that way if the suck should discover my flyer he would be able to follow my trail without difficulty but i kept my thoughts constantly guarded for if he sensed my confidence it might caution him to keep back well eventually i found a small family group of travellers where they sheltered in a cavelet my first knowledge of them came when i stumbled across the male having a piss in the dead of night a little way from the cave when i found him he was half asleep fully asleep when i had done the sleep of the undead by now enthralled doubtless hes following me through the pass later ill find him making his way to wrathstack wailing like a banshee and gnashing his teeth where he stumbles across the boulder plains i hereby lay claim to him but last night having had his blood a good deal of it now i would enjoy his woman but first i must deal with his children lest there be crying and a deal of confusion there were two szgany whelps a girl and boy the girl was six or seven i smothered her in her sleep her brother was a bairn i crushed his head and their mother was succulent wran paused to glance at wratha but i wont be indelicate you men can ask me later for now ill tell you only this she lasted well later i trekked back towards the place where id left my flyer the boy child dangled from my belt trailing blood which made my spoor easier still to follow and always i kept my mind shielded but do you know such had been my extravagance with the woman that i actually felt weary it was as if i had raged though in truth i had not my flesh had raged a little perhaps but such is the nature of lust so that what with these excesses of mine and all the trekking afoot plus the fact that during the previous day id been excited by the prospect of the night ahead and so had not slept as best i might i felt depleted or perhaps i had supped too well on the blood of the man and what little id had from his wife and the rest of what i had had from her until i was replete in every sense and now must sleep it off except somewhere out there in the night vasagi the suck was likewise afoot it gave me pause but eventually i puzzled my way out of the dilemma i hastened to my flyer and curled myself in a belly ridge where the thrusters are lodged and before sleeping i commanded the beast that if someone approached namely vasagi the suck i was to be awakened at once or if not if he came gliding and in great stealth or disguised in a mist remaining hidden until the last moment then that my creature must thrust me aside to safety and roll or fall upon vasagi and so crush him but no such incursion i slept the best and possibly the longest sleep of my life then awakening i sensed sunup some hours away and knew that time was narrowing down and still my business with the suck remained unsettled so i would try to lure him one last time and if that failed then i must resort to hunting him i left my flyer proceeded some small distance on foot and there built a fire in the lee of a rocky outcrop i commenced roasting the boy child upon a spit and before too long felt a presence the feeling was momentary but strong in the night and the dark i fancied i felt eyes upon me perhaps from on high and of course i wondered had vasagi passed fleetingly overhead it would seem the most likely explanation certainly the sweet smell of roasting bairn would be a vast attraction if so then he had surely seen me i continued to roast my breakfast and waited and in a little while someone came ah but he was clumsy perhaps too eager above me in a nest of rounded boulders i heard a pebble slither did he intend to jump down on me possibly but i was ready fully rested and wide awake even eager he came to his doom be sure except it wasnt vasagi it was this one and here wran pointed dramatically at nestor however unwittingly this strange nightprowling szgany youth had distracted me when concentrating upon his approach i had failed to detect the sucks or rather vasagi had utilized this ones clumsiness to mask his own far more sinister slither and while i was confused finally he attacked then nestor shouted a warning also he put a bolt in the sucks shoulder but can you credit it the interven tion of a traveller a szgany youth in a grand duel of vampire lords it was astonishing and it was ironic for to my way of thinking it evened up the balance admirably vasagi had used this lad to get close to me and paid for his deviousness when nestor turned on him but injured the suck was yet more dangerous and in the fight which ensued i sustained grave injuries of my own mainly to my back i intend to keep the scars to illustrate the extent of vasagis ferocity perhaps on some future occasion you may even prevail upon me to display them for you this time when wrans pause threatened to extend itself indefinitely gorvi the guile put in all very interesting i readily submit though none of it explains this nestors custody of vasagis egg was it won or illegally bequeathed which is to say not by the suck but by his destroyer wran youll concede i have a point for here sits gore sucksthrall firstchosen lieutenant of vasagi himself and rightful aspirant to suckscar must he now stand aside for this nestor an unusual procedure to say the least bah this from wratha whats so unusual gorvi think back on your own ascension as i often think on mine its the getting there thats important not the means aye the getting there and the wanting to be there and yet it would seem youve asked a valid question was it done out of spite maliciously conceived and contrived by wran the rage or was nestor receptive and i ask another if the latter how so for in all my days ive never yet heard of a traveller who desired to be wamphyri not before the fact at least canker canison sat up straighter slapped a hand flat on the table and barked only one person to ask and turning to nestor where so far hed sat silent you nestor you have a vampire egg in you but did you desire to be wamphyri or was it forced upon you what the hell odds does it make wran roared coming to his feet wratha has it right its getting there that counts as for eggs dont we bequeath them where we will we do when we have the choice well when last i saw vasagi the suck he had no choice i pegged his broken body out to burn and now i wish id let his leech and egg burn with him may i speak gore sucksthrall growled but quietly and when they looked at him it seems to me that the lord wran engineered this thing gore said not to thwart me of course not for i am nothing as yet but to punish his old enemy the lord vasagi who was my master it would seem a grand jest to transfer the sucks egg to this this innocent and of course cowed by wran and afraid of us all this unworthy receptacle sits here numb and dumb and praying its all a dream myself i would aspire to suckscar and no question about it except a usurper has vasagis egg doubtless it was torn from my masters body or fled him upon his death which seems to me the easiest way to regain it and now before the egg becomes a leech or while the vampire is still a tadpole wherefore i challenge this nestor to a trial of combat the time place and manner of his death i leave to him gore was right deep in nestors core vasagis seed was as yet a tadpole be that as it may already it could sense the strength of its host and his weaknesses but the latter only served the parasites purposes rather they worked to its benefit nestor had no history nothing to cling to and therefore no resistance to the seething metamorphosis taking place within him on the other hand his vampire had no real intelligence as such as yet embryonic its sole purpose was to enhance the darker facets of its host while simultaneously blunt ing his human compassion and deadening his sensibilities in so doing it honed to a razors edge those skills necessary to nestors and of course its own survival for above all else the vampire is tenacious and gore was quite wrong instead of sitting there numb and dumb nestor had taken his small but deadly crossbow from his belt and into his lap fitted its bolt and now only required to load it while the first of these actions had been easy going all unseen behind and below the bulk of the great table the last would take some small effort and could never be accomplished in secret especially now that all eyes were on nestor he hesitated there was still time enough he would wait and see what he would see canker on nestors immediate left had doubtless seen his furtive movements he said nothing but simply said there feral eyes blazing holding his dogs breath and glancing from nestor to gore and back again gore had meanwhile put both of his huge hands flat on the table and looked about ready to stand up his eyes were likewise feral and full of murder he had made his challenge if it went unaccepted or even unanswered by nestor plainly gore would have the right to act nestor sat stiff as a ramrod and looked at gore the man was a vampire he had put on flesh and bulked out until he was almost as massive as a lord clad in heavy leather he made two of nestor on the other hand he was unarmed even more important he had no egg perhaps nestor could talk him down for as well as tenacious the vampire is devious when it seemed the tableau could hold no longer that gore must now get up come round the table dispose of nestor and claim his rights that was when nestor spoke but even now alien stuff was at work in him and as well as being tenacious and full of guile in circumstances like these the vampire is often abrupt and aggressive it happened much as wran told it he began in a voice deep dark and arresting yet also as you have it gore sucksthrall i was coming to starside the last aerie to be a lord except i believed i already was wamphyri or had been and i had forgotten or been robbed of my inheritance why i still believe it even now it was as if i cried out to be wamphyri all of which i made known to wran the rage and im in wrans debt its true for in his own sweet way he reminded me of certain procedures so that however you would have it the fact remains that i am now wamphyri and i caution you gore be my thrall and live or or gore was on his feet what i should become your thrall or he was grey as lead puffed up bloated with rage and lust lust for nestors blood egg life all three he licked his lips greedily knotted his fists into clubs at his sides thrust his head forward menacingly for a moment his eyes stood out like yellow plums in his face then he moved but as for coming round the table nothing so refined gore sucksthrall took the shortest route and came over it platters large and small went flying jugs of wine were hurled aside as the lieutenant swung up onto the table took one pace forward and crouched down to launch himself full in nestors face nestor came to his feet knocking his chair on its side as he threw himself backwards and in his few remaining seconds he loaded his crossbow roaring with rage gore was already in midflight too late he saw the weapon in nestors hand nestor didnt have time or need to aim but merely pointed and pulled the trigger the bolt took gore dead centre between the eyes caved in the bridge of his nose smashed through his brain and only came to a halt when its head bit through the back of his skull in a splintering of bone and splash of blood dead in midair or as dead as a vampire can be while still he has a head his mouth chomped and drooled vacuously as he flew but his eyes no longer saw and his outstretched hands were limp as rags nestor stepped lithely aside as gore crashed down upon the polished stone floor and skidded to a crumpled halt possibly he could survive even now as a crippled mute if nothing else certainly his metamorphic flesh and bones would heal and part of the brain repair itself at least but nestors vampire nature was stirring to life and he wasnt about to allow that these lords and lady harboured doubts about his fitness to be one of them well he was wamphyri and now as good a time as any to show them there was one large knife on the table for carving nestor could take gores head if he wanted it but he saw another far easier way astonishingly the fallen lieutenant had pushed himself up onto all fours he was kneeling there headdown slopping blood and brains and shaking like a palsied dog and a stream of slurred stuttering meaningless words or noises was issuing from his morbidly grimacing mouth nestor dropped his crossbow to the floor went to him grasped his topknot with both hands and dragged him to a window on hands and knees gore skidded in blood drool and brain fluid forward onto a fretted cartilage balcony nestor got behind him put a foot firmly on his backside and shoved part of the balcony shattered and gore took the pieces with him into space out there close to three thousand feet of unresisting air and at its bottom the scree jumbles dirt and solid rock when he hit gore sucksthrall would shatter into so much mush and a fistful of jellied pieces gorvi the guiles flightless guardian warriors would snarl and threaten over what few morsels they could salvage nestor turned from the window and on his way back to the table picked up his crossbow gorvi malicious as ever was the first to find his voice pointing at nestors weapon he said that is forbidden not only in wrathspire but even throughout the entire aerie canker slapped the table and barked but we all knew he had it hes szgany isnt he this is how they arm themselves szgany aye and a mere youth its just that we knew or we supposed that hed never have the guts to use it nestor stood by his toppled chair lifted his crossbow by its tiller overhead and said if this weapon offends you then it likewise offends me so be it and he brought it down shatteringly on the tables rim so as to break it into pieces in any case ive no more use for it not now that i have vasagis gauntlet and turning to canker canison you are wrong canker perhaps i was szgany but no more all of these had been good moves coming in quick succession and startling they had fixed the attention of the others about the table frowning they stared at nestor in silence for long seconds then wran grinned however lopsidedly and looked along the table at wratha lady he said i recall you were saying something about your own ascension if the stories ive heard are true that too was a bloody affair on another occasion wratha might well have taken offence and even now it was her instinct to say oh and what of your own and spiros and gorvis but for the moment her thoughts were elsewhere so that she musingly answered those stories youve heard are true aye except she wasnt looking at wran but at nestor the newcomer was made of the right stuff she could feel it in him why given time she might even feel him in her and that was a pleasant thought for her male thralls handsome creatures though some of them might be were like mice in her bed timid and creeping when nestor was fully ascendant it was possible hed make a worthy lover not to mention an ally wratha gave herself a mental shake and turned her gaze to wran i was szgany and ascended in turgosheim by my wits alone when others would destroy me i destroyed my socalled master and took his egg all true as is what i said but a moment ago its the getting there that counts well wran cried and hasnt nestor got there no she shook her head not yet a while for being here and surviving here are different things but certainly hes on his way then nodding her approval and looking at them all in turn spiro canker gorvi wran and lastly nestor finally she said my lords i give you lord nestor of the wamphyri perhaps but what say you canker accepted him readily enough you must visit me in mangemanse he barked by all means come and inspect my instrument of bones wran and spiro were well satisfied but didnt wish to display it and so answered in unison cautiously lets wait and see how all works out gorvi scowled and said it seems im a minority of one but very well nestor is a lord with one proviso well give him five sunups and if he doesnt fit then he goes back to sunside and to certain death wratha looked at nestor and said well he shrugged ive no complaints good she said and to the others lifting her goblet a toast then to lord nestor of suckscar a successful ascension success they chorused lifting their jacks gorvi with some illgrace but before drinking he couldnt resist adding success aye or whatever however alien in aspect vasagi had been wratha the risen had regarded him as something of an ally hence his habitation of the levels closest to her own now as wrans reception broke up the killglance brothers offered to accompany the newcomer down into suckscar before returning to their flyers canker whose mangemanse levels lay directly below nestors went with them coming up hed used exterior causeways covered ledges and dizzy bridges suspended from the underside of various flying buttresses he could have flown of course but that would have meant saddling a flyer a launching landing etcetera and canker having only just remembered his appointment had been late enough already on the spur of the moment out of grudging respect for the property of another not to mention the very real threat of hostility from who or whatever the suck had left in charge in his absence canker had chosen his vertiginous but otherwise unobtrusive route around suckscar now that he knew nestor however and with his permission on this occasion a return descent through suckscar seemed the easiest most obvious route oddly as the four descended and wran and spiro led the way proceeding a little ahead of nestor canker stayed very much to heel behind him glancing back on occasion nestor would find the other padding along in his wake tongue lolling for all the world like some grotesque upright dog but in no way a pet and yet in some ways that too for whenever nestor paused canker would likewise come to a halt and cock his head on one side as if he waited on some command or other on the other hand his halfhuman expression was difficult to gauge nestor had seen similar looks on the faces of wolves tracking their prey through wrathas launching bays they went down massive stairs chiselled from the bed of a sloping shaft towards the uppermost of suckscars levels here the brothers killglance proceeded cautiously indeed prompting nestor to inquire a problem glancing back at him in the gloom of the unlit stairwell spiro scowled and impatiently replied what and didnt you see wrathas warriors do you think shes the only one who keeps guardians like that well let me tell you we all have them and so did vasagi canker at once put a hand on nestors shoulder and thrusting his muzzle forwards snarled at spiro then you should let nestor go first he has vasagis egg after all and just as i sniffed it out so shall they why anyone would suspect that suckscar was yours now yours and wrans together and not nestors at all meaning wran turned swiftly in the cramped confines of the sloping tunnel his eyes had narrowed to slits of scarlet light but nestor intervened squeezing forwards and replying on cankers behalf meaning simply that as suckscars new master i shoujd go first canker is right indeed i am canker growled following close behind and now the brothers brought up the rear nestor went a little faster he was eager to discover the extent of vasagis holdings and just exactly what his inheritance would be and as he went he noticed that even in the dim light of the tunnel while he was fully aware of the darkness still he could see almost as well as in broad daylight which could only be further evidence of his vampire change eventually reaching a landing and turning through thirty degrees as light showed at the bottom of the shaft where the echoes of their footsteps had preceded them so other sounds came back but these were the echoes of furtive movement and now it was nestors turn to pause no canker growled in his ear go on they will recognize you take my word for it you are wamphyri on sunside nestor had always had a way with dogs he and his forgotten brother alike as children wild dogs had come to them out of the forest not to harm them but to play domesticated wolves guard dogs had permitted the very roughest of roughandtumbling without turning on them wild wolves in the hills had sat still at their approach and not slunk but moved cautiously almost reluctantly out of their path nestor had never made anything of it it was simply that canine creatures trusted him and he in turn trusted them and was unafraid and it was the same now with canker canison nestor believed what canker said and he understood why this what this monster stuck so close to him out of nothing a relationship had been formed nestor wasnt sure if he appreciated it or not but he trusted it certainly he went unafraid down the stairwell to the bottom only pausing when something stirred and flowed forward in a narrow archway at the very foot of the stairs and something was as good a way as any of describing it it was different again from one of wrathas personal guardians black as night shaped like a bat hanging from a ceiling but upright with its head at the top wider than a man and a good deal taller eyes which were crimson wedges in a furred elongated head a bat probably or what was once a bat yet manlike too a composite creature bred of vasagis vats retaining sufficient intelligence to obey his commands or one command at least to guard this stairwell the thing was hard to discern it seemed wrapped in darkness shrouded in gloom cloaked in its own smoky fur but when it thrust its halfrodent halfhuman face forward to hiss and spit saliva its purpose and determination were obvious and if nestor and the others would go forward the only way was past this guardian huh canker coughed in nestors ear gripped his shoulder not so grotesque all of vasagis creatures are different he was always experimenting ive not seen this one before but go forward present yourself the monster was three paces away still mainly hidden in its own gloom and that of the archway nestor took one tentative step along the now horizontal corridor and the guardian flowed out of its niche blocking the way also it became more nearly visible it was cloaked in darkness in black leathery membranous wings which folded across its body overlapping but where the folds hugged closest to flesh there the darkness was alive with pink wriggling worms now the creatures jaws cracked open and yawned wide and its teeth were visible like row upon row of long white needles receding into its scarlet throat teeth like that could strip a mans flesh to the bone leaving his face or limbs flensed in a moment but even now the thing was not as awesome as wrathas guardian beasts you are mine nestor told it i have vasagis egg stand aside for i would pass likewise these men with me who are my friends for now at least he took another breathless pace forwards and the creature flowed to meet him its wings opened but they were not wings from its forearms and underarms down the sides of its body to its knees or where knees would be in a man a thick webbing of flesh formed furry blankets which were like wings on both sides of the creatures body superficially they were wings but in reality they were traps on sunside there were flowers which functioned similarly they had spined fleshy petals that closed on insect victims to devour them but this thing wasnt designed to devour insects and the sunside flowers werent intelligent and mobile under the wings before they closed on nestor he saw that the pink worms were merely the tips of a nest of lashing tentacles based around the dark orifice of a grinding suctorial mouth the thing had two mouths only one of which was in its face then the tentacles locked him in trapping his arms and crushing him to that more immediate mouth where its huge quivering lips tasted him for a moment a single moment nestor was deaf dumb and blind he was nauseated by the smell of rotting meat the stench of an open stomach the slick feel on his skin of some bioacidic solution a single moment before the guardian released him folded its flaps and flowed back from him in a confused fashion blinked furnace eyes hesitantly then shuffled backwards into its niche and cowered down nestor might have staggered a little but canker had come forward and was holding his elbow excellent the dogthing growled vasagis beast acknowledges its new master nestors skin was crawling from head to toe but he and canker went on and behind them the thing in the dark archway opened its flaps again lashed its tentacles and hissed menacingly as wran and spiro followed until nestor turned and cautioned it be quiet did i not say that these men were with me and as the thing fell silent and shrank back so the four proceeded down into suckscar at the end of the short corridor two more of vasagis creatures were tethered in niches set back a little from the main passage they were not too unlike wrathas personal guardians brutal ferocious things that howled and gibbered tearing at their chains as nestor and the others came into view their new master spoke to them at once saying i am the lord nestor of the wamphyri vasagis egg and all of vasagis things are mine now what is this commotion desist or suffer it was enough the warriors sniffed him out and at once fell silent shuffling uncomfortably in their places wran and spiro were frankly astonished being wamphyri of course they too could have calmed the beasts given sufficient time to threaten cajole and work on them but nestor had no experience of such things even with vasagis egg still he was a newcomer here and yet he instinctively almost automatically fitted into place yes wran told him i think youll do very well indeed in suckscar but his scarlet eyes were shrouded for it seemed to wran that perhaps nestor would do just a little too well here thralls and lieutenants alike had heard the rowing warriors two of the latter came at the run just as nestor and the others entered suckscars main hall they were massive men as are all the chosen lieutenants of the wamphyri so that nestor felt dwarfed between his three companions and these newcomers but the lieutenants seeing canker wran and spiro skidded to a halt looked at each other and approached more cautiously while they were still out of earshot canker whined now comes the real test for these are not dumb beasts but men and they have brains that think better let me handle it for now at least who goes there said one the biggest of the two you lords are trespassers unless gore sucksthrall accompanies you and possibly even then you have no business here vasagi would never have deigned to invite you he pointed at nestor and scowled and what pray is that despite cankers warning nestor narrowed his eyes and made to step forward but the dogthing got in his way you lads had better listen he coughed the sucks no more for wran the rage killed him which i dont need to tell you for im sure someone at least must have been at a window waiting for vasagi to return out of sunside ah but while the suck is gone his egg goes on for it fled into nestor here or the lord nestor to you their mouths fell open but after a moment the bigger one spoke up again oh really and this ones come to claim suckscar right well lords canker wran spiro no disrespect to you but i am zahar thirdincommand in suckscar after gore and i say to you that i myself could eat this one he prodded nestor in the chest with a hard finger and as for when gore sucksthrall sees him he threw back his head and laughed and went to prod nestor again but nestor was lightning fast he caught the offending finger in a clenched fist and bent it back all in one movement so that it broke with a loud crack then as zahar howled and fell to his knees nestor kicked him as hard as he could in the throat which served to silence him and send him sprawling in another moment nestor was down beside him on one knee pinning his topknot to the stone floor and in the next the sharp point of nestors sixinch knife was pricking the bulge of the lieutenants throbbing adams apple before the knife in nestors belt had seemed barely significant a piffling toothpick the wamphyri lords and lady had ignored it like his crossbow he wouldnt dare consider using it against such as them ah but their thralls were a different matter gore sucksthrall is dead nestor snarled i killed him now swear allegiance to me and at once or follow him into eternity gak gak urk said zahar holding up a trembling hand and arm it might have been threatening or pleading that hand for it was the one with a dangling digit whichever nestor couldnt take any chances he slashed at the tendons in the joint of the elbow which showed through where leather sleeves came together and the arm flopped uselessly to the floor and fast as thought nestor caught the crippled hand and took the finger so that its stump had barely started to spurt as he came lithely to his feet zahar writhed like a crippled snake on the floor hissing and coughing but making no sensible noises whatsoever his inability to answer made no difference for as nestor now told him good then you are now my man now watch and he deliberately gashed his own thumb and let the blood drip into the joint of zahars arm and onto his bloody hand see now blood of my own wamphyri flesh the power of renewal so that your arm may heal itself and your hand be whole again why i have even honoured you zahar you could as well be a bloodson well of sorts but my bloodson and not vasagis for vasagi is no more and so a fatherly word of warning from this time forward cower as you approach me and when you stand in my presence be sure to make no threatening movements for if you do the first will be the last remember even now you would be dead except i need you to run my manse nestor turned his back on the writhing crippled zahar and faced the second of the two and he saw how canker ad held him back when he might have come to zah s aid then raising an eyebrow as if in faint surprise nestor said whats this do you molest a man of mine canker canker released the lieutenant at once and nestor offered his hand and forearm in the old szgany greeting the other was young not long out of sunside but already he was inches taller than nestor broad wellmuscled grey of flesh and feraleyed a vampire in his own right not wamphyri no but given a hundred years he might be if he lived he spoke up but falteringly im grig sucksthrall or i was he sensed the authority in nestor and possibly the presence of vasagis egg too and was awed and disadvantaged by the hot eyes of so many lords looking on then remembering the ways of sunside he fumblingly went to grasp nestors preferred forearm but no nestor grasped grigs hand instead and pressed zahars severed digit into his palm and as grigs jaw dropped nestor told him eat it accept my food and live and take shelter with me in suckscar or deny me now and suffer the consequences but whats this do you tremble ah dont worry i shall not kill you but set you free on the boulder plains to take your chances with the lowest of the low and live like a trog in a crevice how shall it be grig looked at the bloody finger in his grey hand then at zahar who had struggled to a seated position where now he was bent forward rocking himself to and fro and moaning and finally lord he told nestor zahar is my friend friend friend nestor looked astonished and am i to be known as the lord nestor who gives shelter to friends no i desire no friends in my house but only thralls and obedient lieutenants who eat or go hungry at my command he stared hard severely at the other for the last time then whats it to be there and then grig ate zahars finger and because nestor held his gaze the while he scarcely grimaced at all iv suckscar nestor sent grig and zahar off to tend to the latters damaged hand and arm and then the four lords explored suckscar wran spiro and canker had all been here before but just the once the day they arrived here along with wratha vasagi and their lieutenants a handful of flyers and another of warriors out of the east then mainly at wrathas direction or insistence theyd moved in and laid claim to the various levels and suckscar had become vasagis he had named the five levels which made up his section of the stack out of admiration for their dramatic external appearance they were deeply scarred from front to back with massive downward slanting gouges almost as if the sun rising over the barrier mountains had steamed their outer layers away like vampire flesh but in fact the sun had never risen so high as to light on suckscars levels it was simply the result of the natural tilt of the rock layers which were somewhat softer here and the weathering of centuries and even millennia now these five levels set immediately over canker canisons mangemanse belonged to nestor and he explored them eagerly in the first level he saw the great communal hall where common thralls dwelled in caverns in the outer immensity of the perimeter wall and a sweeping rockhewn staircase the width of the hall itself led up to vasagi the sucks onceprivate chambers at the top and to the sides of the staircase were warriors or guardians of a unique design which in function were similar to the creature in the stairwell encountered during the descent from wrathas landingbays they looked like thick brown rugs sewn up from the skins of bears but rugs dont creep as nestor had climbed the stairs so these creatures had flowed inwards along the upper steps closing on him but their stealth was such that when halfway up he paused to stare at them the things were only rugs again at which canker canison who accompanied nestor had sniffed the air and gone more cautiously pointing out more of the sucks things aye he was a master of metamorphism that one then nestor had climbed diagonally almost threateningly towards the closest of the two guardians commanding it come on then and well see what manner of creature you are and creepingly silently the creature had flowed down from above likewise its twin on the other side converging on him until the last moment when suddenly they reared up and then nestor saw just how thick they were like doughy blankets of flesh like great bears yes but with their skeletal frames extruded and their flesh spread out thick in the centre and thin as membrane at the edges with great bands of grey muscle rippling on the underside and bearlike in their general structuring too except their legs and arms were boneless supported only by springy cartilage but sufficiently agile to lift and thrust themselves upon hapless victims more nestor saw their mouths like the guardian in the stairwell they had more than sufficient of those or precisely sufficient considering vasagis purpose in creating them for all these creatures consisted of was mouth stomach and crushing muscle and tiny red eyes hidden in the topside fur the mouths were many small red and suctorial without teeth that nestor could see or if they were toothed then these were small and inconspicuous but the drool which they issued smoked where it touched stone so that nestor knew it was acidic and then he understood wrapped in a creature such as this a man would be completely immobilized fixed like a fly in honey smothered and softened by digestive juices and finally slurped away until his flensed bones were discarded in a clattering heap but nestor was no such victim his egg by now the merest tadpole of a leech was strong and growing stronger by the moment its strength was nestors who was strong in his own right suckscars guardian creatures had been vasagis and now were his all of them and they must be made to understand that hed suffer no more threats not in his own house standing his ground he coughed up a great gob of phlegm to spit into the poisonous heart of the monster rearing before him and turning on his heel he pointed a commanding threatening finger and issued a mindblast that sent the other beast shrinking back from him begone something of vasagi was in him and just like the sucks other weird constructs these things knew it they collapsed like piles of fur to the steps and bellied back from nestor grovellingly to their accustomed places and now there was no one and nothing in suckscar to say no him canker was impressed and followed even closer to heel as they went up to vasagis old rooms over the great hall behind them wran and spiro were nowhere in sight they were exploring on their own a fact which had not gone unnoticed by nestor as well to suffer their rudeness for now at least at the top of the wide flight cartilage balconies extended left and right grafted to ledges in the rock which spanned halfway across the great hall just below the ceiling up here nestor would be able to move about keeping watch over the industries of common thralls and lieutenants alike tunnels in the walls at the rear of the ledges led to lesser rooms galleries storehouses dizzy observation platforms supported by cartilage buttresses and landing bays and stables in the outer skin of the aerie whose rock had been worn into those deep and impressive scars for which the manse was named from the outermost turret looking hard right nestor spied the barrier mountains golden in their peaks while on high the clouds over teetering wrathspire were lined with silver and hazy with deadly sunlight such observations helped with his orientation temporal spatial and mundane all three for just as he had begun to think of himself as invincible he was reminded of his mortality and the suns destructive power and when hed momentarily considered himself magnificent the stacks awesome majesty had reduced him to a flea from which time forward his excitement was somewhat reduced this was as well for after the view from the platforms landingbays and bartizans nestor found vasagis rooms something of a disappointment patently the suck had not been one for luxuries but within wamphyri parameters had been satisfied with a life of austerity his bed was of stone slabs raised up with a large depression hollowed in the middle and filled with the cured furs of sunside animals beneath the bed was a fire hole containing a few scattered ashes a blackened bone flue angled off from the head of the bed to join with another above a massive fireplace in the vastly thick outer wall in a curtained corner niche a darkstained hole angled down into the floor from which issued the occasional draught of fresh air it was just as well that the other end of this hole vacated in some lofty inaccessible exit over the abyss for it had been vasagis toilet from another room hewn deeper into the stacks porous outer sheath a large deep circular window fitted with cartilage baffles gazed out in a northeasterly direction showing on the one hand the barrier range dwindling into distance and on the other the far darkblue sheen of the auroralit icelands horizon there were rooms with wooden tables and chairs and others with benches cut in the walls a large sloping hall was enclosed behind an eastfacing wall with a row of window holes admitting a maximum of light and of air before being walledin this draughty gallery had been one of the manses great scars during the period of vasagis occupation at least it had become his studio this was where the suck had worked on the designs of his metamorphic creatures before he gave them life in his vats and as nestor examined the huge and intricate paintings he felt glad vasagi had not invested ojj of them in flesh the east wing of this one level had now been explored and nestor and canker returned to the sweeping staircase down into the great hall but as they descended a cry rang out and canker was galvanized into activity hah i had expected it he growled the brothers killglance scavenging what nestor looked at him you can only mean pillaging surely but i am the master here and all that is here is mine would they dare canker snorted wratha was right being here and existing here are different things unless you are sure of a person or thing never invite him or it into your house if you must make sure he or it enters of his own free will which is to say he faces the consequences of any transgressions whether of his making or of yours letting the brothers in here why that was like giving them a licence to work their will remember wran the rage killed vasagi already he may consider himself entitled to whatevers on offer while you as yet merely aspire he shrugged in my way i tried to warn you from now on i shall value your warnings nestor told him but right now i may require your help here they come wran and spiro had emerged from one of the tunnels into the great hall behind them they dragged female thralls with their clothes stripped mainly from them and hanging in rags the women were vociferous in their protests here in suckscar they knew what was their lot but in madmanse hurrying towards wran spiro and their struggling prizes zahar and grig went to intercept back from seeing to the formers wounds they seemed affronted by the twins rapaciousness but these were the killglance brothers lords of the wamphyri if things turned nasty nestors lieutenants wouldnt stand a chance still it said a lot for zahar that even with a dangling arm and damaged hand he now knew where his loyalties lay for the moment at least laughing the lords faced down the wouldbe defenders of suckscar but spiro grew calm in a moment his grin becoming a scowl as zahar and grig drew closer until at last he queried oh and is there a problem giving his captive a backhander in the face he sent her skittering among a crowd of cowering thralls where theyd emerged from their various places so far suckscars people had kept well out of it they had guessed that the lord vasagi was no more but had not known the nature of their new master curiosity is a powerful force however especially among vampires a good many of them were here now anxious to discover what was their lot make or break canker coughed in nestors ear where they too closed on the frozen tableau its come sooner than i thought gore sucksthrall was the best of vasagis men and hes dead these others are useless to you and the killglance brothers are fiends in a fight i i like your cut nestor but this is not my problem its up to you now a diplomatic solution cowardice if you like or a beating and possibly death or something else nestor answered in a voice empty of emotion cold as the winds off the icelands watch your back eh canker glanced to the rear and saw nestors furry familiars flowing across the halls flags behind them even without you nestor told him in that same emotionless voice i am not alone and im not about to be beaten canker paused a moment then threw back his head to howl like a mad thing and shake from head to toe and catching up with nestor he said why now i like your cut even more my crafty lord nestor not to mention the odds very well we stand together well spiro took a threatening pace towards grig who had now come to a halt and wran still smiling for the moment told zahar man if you persist in blocking my way theres a very strong chance ill eat your heart right here and now off this immaculately clean floor gentlemen nestor growled coming upon them i see you found my women and picked out two of the comeliest to show me what is my get that was thoughtful of you but now alas matters have come to a head and i must show you off my property as you see two of my creatures are here to make sure you have not forgotten the way out and in his mind rear up menace them issue your smoking juices he stepped aside canker likewise and the guardians of the staircase at once flowed forward reared upright presented their muscular underbellies and dripped acid wran released his captive both he and his brother crouched down looked this way and that their crimson eyes now blazed with fires so hot they almost smoked then do you threaten no longer a gentleman wran looked about to explode indeed to rage threaten nestor put on a surprised expression in what way i merely provide you with an escort from my place for as i have said matters are coming to a head what matters spiro snarled clasping his brothers arm as if to hold him in place why only that the sun is up nestor answered youve a little time to spare of course but if you would collect your flyers from wrathas landingbay and return to madmanse without inconvenience then its time you were on your way wrans captive had wriggled away from him she hid behind nestor clutching his jacket the brothers fumed they glared at each other at canker and at nestor with his knife in his belt but mainly at his familiars wran and spiro were not equipped for war and even nestors common thralls had now taken heart hissing and creeping closer hah spiro snarled not a threat in no way nestor answered i invited you in here and you entered of your own free will what sort of hospitality to threaten you now also wran is responsible for my being here i would be in his debt except of course i saved his life on sunside and so were even and while we talk the sun is risen soon to burn on wrathspire i was thinking of your safety and only that wran took a deep breath held it a moment then slapped his thigh and burst out laughing however harshly a prodigy he cried through gritted teeth a babe out of sunside grown to a man in a single morning and master now of an aerie manse well and didnt i say youd do well in suckscar indeed you did nestor gestured to indicate the way out and in so doing cleared a path for them across the floor of the great hall towards the tunnel stairs to wrathas landingbays and so i shall but each of us in his own place and yours is in madmanse the brothers left they took their time walking across the floor but they left behind them nestors staircase guardians flowed across the flags leaving a whiff of acid stench in the air and ahead of them nestor sent a thought to the darkfurred batthing in its archway niche the men who approach jet them pass then spit at them hiss and shepherd them up and out of suckscar from this time forward they shall not pass again nestors male and female thralls his lieutenants most of his people and all of them vampires were gathered to him now knowing that things were afoot theyd converged on the great hall from their various work places he stepped up onto a table and turned in a circle letting all of them see him clearly their babble ceased in a moment look well he told them and remember i am the lord nestor master of suckscar you are my people should there be those among you who do not wish to be mine who may not desire my food protection or the comforts of my house then by all means choose a window and make your exit for in future that is how i shall punish any rebellious creature of mine a long last screaming flight and a few stains on the scoriae scree so much for mere dissension but as for treachery or insurgence he let his gaze wander to settle on his carpet creatures where they flowed with scarcely a ripple up the stairs to their accustomed places the guardians of my staircase have their needs and so i make it simple my word is law one law for all and whosoever breaks it gets broken in his turn so be it nestor looked down on the faces closest to the table and said canker zahar grig he held out his arms to help them up and of canker this one canker canison master of mangemanse is my friend he held up his hand ah no it bestows no privileges upon him but merely grants that canker is not my enemy you will respect him but not obey him canker shrugged grinned and nodded appreciatively as for these two nestor glanced at zahar and grig each in turn they are my lieutenants whose word next to mine is law zahar is the senior and my righthand man his arm shall grow stronger and his hand yet more heavy nestor considered what he had said and nodded he was satisfied but one final command and a warning seemed in order i shall see you about and you shall see me but when you least expect it and now it seems your various works go wanting while you stand idle and gawping let him who has no work learn how to fly and quickly the crowd dispersed hastened by zahar and grig who got down among them from the table only the two mistreated vampire women held back examining their bruises and glancing sideways at nestor he saw that they were young and very beautiful and said to them vasagis rooms were cold but mine will be warm his hearth has no fire and his bed is hard these things are mine now put them in order and wait for me a moment later when they were alone canker danced like a dog on its hind legs and chortled excellent all excellent and i no longer fear for you the surly sucks no more and my new neighbour is much to my liking why i can see us now scampering like pups on sunside chasing the chickens to and fro he became serious and whined pleadingly but now let me beg you come down with me into mangemanse and see my great work that instrument fashioned of bones with which ill lure my silver mistress down from the moon nestor considered it for a moment then shook his head later perhaps if youll show me the way down and promise to speak on my behalf to whatever guards the way but first i must explore all of suckscar for after all this is just one level ive now seen the east wing of just one level and the north south and west wings still unseen and four more levels to go it was hard to keep the elation out of his voice the vampire is territorial nestors territories along with his expectations were expanding fast canker was downcast ah of course but already it seems youve been here forever and i feel that i have known you that long at least also its my instinct that youll be fascinated by that which these socalled colleagues of ours despise and it will be splendid to have a visitor in mangemanse who i can trust as soon as ive at least stuck my head in each corridor room hall and workshop then i shall visit you nestor promised no matter the hour excellent canker was delighted i shall expect you before nightfall and should i enter of my own free will nestors voice was cold his expression blank canker looked at him stared into his eyes perhaps there was a hint of red in them even now as early as this tuttut we are friends as wran was my friend no as i am your friend so be it said nestor very well canker answered now we proceed directly to your nethermost level where i shall show you the stairwell and pass down into mangemanse and on the way down ill advise my creatures as you suggest nestor looked all about the great hall a few thralls were busy in a kitchen to one side a female swept the floor industrious sounds echoed from various sidetunnels and passageways the lord nestor had issued a warning against sloth and it was obvious that his people had taken it seriously zahar he called out as canker led the way towards a stonehewn stairwell attend me and to canker i need him when you have gone he shall accompany me on my tour of suckscar good said the other that way you will seem to have purpose and not be seen wandering aimlessly i do have purpose nestor retorted i shall be seen to be interested in everything and where things dont work they shall be put to rights even if they do work but i dont like the way they work i shall change them a new broom sweeps clean said canker and a new lord of the wamphyri commands respect he shook his head and frowned and great shaggy red eyebrows met over the bridge of his nose but still i cant get over how quickly youre settling in maybe theres more to that story of yours than meets the eye about your having been wamphyri before and forgotten it could it be youre someones bloodson i wonder is it possible that somewhere in your ancestry some lord took a sunside girl and the issue had nothing of the vampire in him except the desire to be wamphyri nestor nodded shook his head shrugged i dont know you could be right but i do know this if i havent always been wamphyri certainly i have always wanted to be then zahar joined them and they proceeded down into the lower levels after canker had gone zahar took nestor on his tour how many rooms do i have nestor inquired you have stables storerooms and a granary a slaughterhouse and cold store zahar answered you have kitchens and rooms for dining quarters for your thralls workshops and a laundry and launchingbays you have a hall of metamorphosis with great vats hollowed in the floor and cages in the walls for your warriors and of course you have your own rooms over the great hall but how many i doubt if anyone ever counted them lord oh then have it done nestor answered at once i want them counted listed and mapped mapped aye on skins five skins in frames one for each level all accurately marked with the location of every room chamber hall whatever with arrows showing north south etcetera and all landmark curiosities clearly displayed for it strikes me a man could get lost in suckscar which would never do but with a map i may check my route before i go abroad from my rooms is all understood yes lord zahar answered i know a man a thrall on sunside he drew maps of the traveller trails likewise here in suckscar except he drew them for vasagi when the suck raided he knew where he was going good said nestor a useful man that later you must send him to me and after a moment now tell me zahar where should i look first he sounded tired now and zahar noted the fact also that they were quite alone in suckscars nether levels hugging his wounded arm and hand finally zahar answered vasagis vats may be of interest creatures of his or yours lord are waxing even now he looked at his arm and hand and so did nestor the bleeding had stopped zahars metamorphic vampire flesh was healing him he would soon be good as new to the vats then said nestor before retiring he would see what vasagi the suck had fashioned but the idea of bed was appealing now and the long arside day still lay ahead for some time to come nestor would continue to sleep like a traveller until his change was complete but after that the sun would act on him like a poisonous drug compelling him to sleep in his dark shadowy room with the curtains drawn against the light they climbed up to the centre level then made their way northwest through a maze of passageways and halls to a place where the rock was of a volcanic origin the ancient lava was pitted like the alveolate bones of birds and in a vast lowceilinged hall longescaped gasses had left cavernous pits in the grained fibrous floor except for these sunken vats the floor had been levelled the vats had been lined with clay and sealed with tar from sunsides tar pits this was where vasagi and doubtless many other lords of the old wamphyri before him had bred their warriors and familiars and as zahar had said some of the sucks constructs were waxing even now from a swirl of gluey fluids a great colourless eye gazed vacuously up at nestor where he stood at the rim of a vat the metamorphic liquid in the vat was almost opaque the creature it covered was little more than a vague outline like a series of submerged rocks covered with spines only the quivering of the greygreen surface told of life and the mindless gazing and swivelling of the eye of course a warrior zahar informed quietly tonelessly almost as if he feared to breathe where he stood directly behind nestor at the vats rim a replacement vasagi lost several in traveller traps on sunside some of the tribes are very well organized under brave leaders the szgany lidesci are clever indeed and will pay heavily for their cleverness eventually nestors vampire was alert alive wriggling frantically in his body and mind it sharpened his previously dull and damaged wits expanded his five mundane senses and awareness to their present limits issued warnings he couldnt ignore he did not need to glance over his shoulder to know that zahar was only an inch away and that his good arm and hand hung down on a parallel with nestors spine he could almost feel the pent pressure in that hand and arm and certainly he could hear the deadly design of zahars mind a lunge forward a shove was all that was needed nestor stepped aside and his motion was so swift that it left zahar stumbling a little and merely glancing at him nestor said what is this liquid at the end of the vat was a ramp sloping down and disappearing into the murk and slop it was flanked by narrow stone steps nestor moved towards that end and behind him he heard zahar take a deep breath but inside nestor his vampire was still at work and what was instinct to it became instinct to him so that even before zahar spoke he knew what the fluids were the metamorphic juices of life this vat was a cold womb for the foetal fashionings of a vampire thing and vasagi the suck had been both father and mother to the contents the liquids were the white of the egg which sustains the yellow chick a plasma soup of lymph and protoplasm derived mainly from innocent blood but contaminated or fertilized with vasagis own urine blood spittle and sperm it is the sweet juice of forty travellers all squeezed by vasagi said zahar his throat clogged with weird emotion perhaps pleasurable anticipation it feeds his creature oils its joints and defines its very allegiance emerging from its vat it would know him at once in another sunup and sundown it will emerge he let his voice tail off and nestor looked at him but the question is will it know me zahar shrugged and struggled with himself not to smile his thoughts were sinister and nestor knew it he also knew a little about nature the way the travellers imprint wolves by midwifing the bitches and supplanting the dog fathers so that the whelp grows up as guardian to child and man it was one of those memories which occasionally sprang to mind unbidden out of a mainly forgotten past but who could take chances with a creature such as this what approach such a thing with outstretched hand as it woke to monstrous life and vacated its vat best to imprint it now and stamp his own seal over whatever remained of vasagis he couldnt know it but the thought was not original to him or it was but it had been spurred by the process of metamorphosis taking place within him he looked at zahar again a man must be careful in this place he said apparently innocently it would seem a dire thing even perilous to put a foot wrong and fall into a vat such as this indeed lord zahar agreed with just the suspicion of a smirk but said nestor his voice hardening i am not a man i am wamphyri and he slowly very deliberately stripped off his clothes even discarding his belt and knife to step down naked into the tepid swirl and sluggish gurgle and fixing zahar with his eyes in which the spark of red was now grown to an ember he moved alongside the bulk of the waxing warrior and touched it with his hands you are mine he told it all which was vasagis is mine that which he was is now in me i have eaten him and you are my creature for ever and ever the ripples in the fluids became small waves as the warrior flexed its great body palps with claws which were as yet of soft flexible chitin closed on nestor and various appendages lifted out of the glue to clasp him but gently he was examined and accepted the thing lay still again and its uppermost eye regarded nestor with something of fixation and perhaps something of fear you are a good creature he told it then and i shall care or you and feed you well when you are ready to be born call me and i shall attend to it myself and leaving the thing to wax and wallow he waded to the steps climbed them and stepped up onto the level floor and stood there with the muck dripping from him in small puddles gazing at zahar with eyes as cold as the warriors but oh so much more knowing take off your leather jacket he told him what zahar stepped back a pace his adams apple wobbling his eyes went from nestor to the thing in the vat and back again my jacket lord are you hard of hearing nestors voice was harsh your jacket now yes lord zahar stripped it off let it fall now your shirt of cloth said nestor lord zahar gibbered you may be wamphyri no you are wamphyri assuredly but i am just a common thrall a lieutenant aye and a vampire of course but just a man for all that to me these special liquids are a poison if i were to do as you have done and plunge myself into them be sure i would not surface and even if i did your warrior would roll on me with its spines nestor held out a hand for the shirt and yet these were the things you would have wished on me just a few moments ago indeed it was even your thought to push me in did you think i would not know now one last time your shirt zahar needed help with it nestor dragged the shirt from the grey flesh of his back for a moment they stood there the little master calm and his great thrall trembling and finally nestor dried himself on the shirt this is loathsome stuff he said i would not ask any man to swim in it and certainly not a brave and loyal lieutenant but neither do i want it on my body and smiling now however sardonically better put on your jacket zahar why shivering like that youll catch a chill yes lord zahar sighed lowered his head in relief and took up his jacket and nestor tossed the soiled shirt aside and dressing himself nestor said zahar think on this you had better mend your ways and soon there will be no more warnings the next time i have reason to rebuke you i will be speaking to meat on a hook in my cold store yes lord zahar said again and he knew it was true will you sleep now lord zahar inquired as they went up two levels to suckscars great hall yes nestor answered my limbs ache my head hurts im not quite myself its your change zahar told him ive heard about such things in some it is a long process but you your eyes are red even now and the morning just begun i think you will be a very powerful lord im tired nestor told him and yet i am not tired my body is astir i want to laugh but fear i might not stop ah but then i could cry too except tears are unseemly in wamphyri eyes also i lust after things without quite knowing what they are i am proud of suckscar he turned suddenly on zahar be sure to guard it well for me while i sleep as always lord i must have oh several hours of sleep six seven eight should be more than enough then come to me and wake me you or grig and so we shall continue until i know suckscar and all of my thralls and the work which they perform and all there is to know like the lines in the palm of my own hand it shall be done lord and be aware nestor told him the other lords and perhaps a certain lady too think im easy meat set a watch and see to it that the men are alert prowl among them when it is quiet and if you catch one idling punish him yes lord about canker canison yes lord i trust him for now for hes a great dog and i have a way with dogs but even the best trained dog may make mistakes these are my orders he is only to enter suckscar when i myself am to house and awake is that understood yes lord good as for the rest i trust gorvi not at all and the brothers killglance are deranged well so is canker for that matter but crazy like a fox aye and the lady wratha we shall see what we shall see she is very beautiful nestor was uncertain she is a lady huh zahar felt obliged to return and when nestor looked at him i have heard stories lord then tell me all said nestor but some other time they were at the foot of the staircase where it swept up to nestors apartments sleep well lord nestor of the wamphyri said zahar be sure of it nestor answered and climbed the stairs a fire burned in his hearth there was water in an earthen bowl the two girls were in his bed already asleep after washing himself nestor climbed in with them one of them murmured and reached for his member he brushed her hand away time now for sleep time for the other later and between the vampire girls soft and warm and musty he slept like a dead man or one who is undead anyway v mangemanse spiders cankers moon lure when nestor woke up the girls were still there still asleep neither grig nor zahar had come to awaken him for he had not slept out his full eight hours the thing inside him had awakened him for it had needs of its own rather its needs were now nestors it required to grow wherefore he was required to be up and about active a vampire and now he must take sustenance not only for himself but also for his leech his parasite nestor had eaten well in wrathspire and shouldnt be hungry yet deep inside him there was a different hunger in his stretching bones an ache in his loins a ripeness requiring an outlet and in this core which hed never even known was a part of him a great emptiness a gnawing red hunger it was blind and it was insistent and he knew that it was red it was salt and it was life and it was death and undeath now that he was wamphyri it was his weird unnatural nature his vampire women slept on the soft loose breasts of one were in his face the other was behind him a leg draped across his thigh the pubic covering of her quiescent core rough where it pressed against skin which grew ever more sensitive even to the texture of shadows and the breath of bats in the silence nestor could hear the hearts of the women pumping the coursing of the blood in their veins from below through the honeycombed rock of suckscar he felt the motion of thralls where they patrolled the murmur of faroff voices the hum or chitter of great bats yes his own desmodus colony where they clustered in the crevices of a dark lodge of their own while from outside from above he could feel the sear of the sun on wrathspire which was one of the several things that had awakened him his skin previously itchy from the touch of the musty hair of the woman sleeping behind him now crawled he knew that the sun was up burning on wrathspire and that his own days of sunlight were gone forever for a moment there was panic as all the memories of the last few hours of his life crowded where none had been before as they ordered themselves and firmed from what might have been spumy dreamstuff into the rock of reality and he knew where and what he was panic as his own heart pounded a little faster his limbs stiffened to immobility and all of his vampire awareness reached out like a mist from him like a presence in its own right to gauge the day for danger but there was no danger for this was his place suckscar and all that it contained was his everything umph the girl in front of him murmured as she turned a little and one of her soft nipples brushed his lips and for a moment he remembered sunside he saw it in the eye of his mind a reflection from the screen of his impaired memory a misty riverbank in the still of evening not far from brad bereas lonely cabin in the forest the place where brads homely daughter glina an innocent in her own right mainly had taught him what little he knew and used his body for her pleasure while in turn giving him pleasure it had not been love but lust perhaps not even that but need for he was a young man and his body an engine geared to life but that was then and this was now when his needs were the amplified needs of the wamphyri what had been a pulse a throb a fire in his blood was now an agony a driving force the cap of a volcano straining against the pent pressures of the magma core and these girls were not homely but very lovely they were vampires with vampire stuff in them which had changed and enhanced them even as it now enhanced nestors emotions specifically his lust he sucked the girls nipple into his mouth felt it grow hard and grew hard himself between her thighs still sleeping she snatched air in a sharp gasp parted her legs reached down and guided him in her wet core was like an automatic thing a creature in its own right its slippery sheath sucked at nestor like a pouting mouth so that he need hardly move at all reaching down he pushed at the second girls hip until her leg slid off his thigh then parted her bush and sought her bud with his fingers her reaction was instinctive immediate gasping she opened herself reared against him and sucked at his hand it was drawn in to the wrist where the neck of her vulva tightened on him like a soft leather sleeve nestor wanted to feel the girl he was in to explore and know all of her he freed his hand from the furry trap behind him and heard the girl moan she was waking up he rolled onto the one he faced and took the initiative driving deeply into her flesh as if to split her she too was coming awake the free girl was kissing his ear the tips of her divided tongue licking and wriggling inside it while her hand moved between his legs rolling his balls in her palm his tongue was drawn down a convulsing throat resilient breasts flattened under his chest and he squeezed their bulge with his upper arms the second girl was now kneeling between his legs rubbing nestors back with her breasts her hands were under him and his partner toying and teasing around the area of their sexual organs manipulating both of them nestor moaned wanting it to last but it couldnt and when he came it was as if fire jetted from him which also activated an orgasm in his frantically writhing partner mine now sighed the second girl catching his hips and rolling him over and still jerking trickling semen drowning in the sweet singing agony of his flesh nestor felt her sucking mouth come down on him eager for the last drop then fuck me me now she gurgled sliding her small pointed breasts up his chest in a trail of semen from her mouth lowering her moistly shuddering flesh onto his shaft and shuffling her tight round backside in an ecstasy of erotic motion until he had slithered in so it continued and at least one of nestors needs was satisfied but neither the first nor the last of them a need then and the needs of his vampire women too a rare day when theyd enjoyed vasagis socalled lovemaking feeling his organ expanding into their bodies to fill them while his hollow siphon proboscis of needletipped chitin slid into breast neck cheek or root of tongue to draw off blood and heighten his unthinkable pleasure but they had enjoyed nestors so had nestor despite that only one need had been served so far and when finally exhausted all three lay still still his hunger was there like a raw red wound inside him some of the metamorphic ache of flesh and bones had subsided yes or been dulled by excess but as nestor drifted into a second deeper sleep his nameless hunger remained and was absent when he woke up replete he started awake grigs hand was on his shoulder and grigs mouth was a dark hole in his grey face open as if a hinge had snapped in his jaw what said nestor and then he saw what his women had not woken up the one with the small firm breasts lay there breathing but feebly ashen and cold completely exposed where grig had laid back the bedcovers but the other was motionless corpselike without a breath of life in her body and what nestor said again trying to understand that one maria will live lord grig told him pointing at the ashen one but the other carmen she must sleep for some time sleep undeath said grig in your sleep you drained her you took from her and you gave to her she was a vampire thrall but mainly human when she wakes up she will still be a vampire but mainly inhuman essence of your leech is in her eventually if she is allowed to continue she will be wamphyri nestor tried hard to grasp the principle but the intricacies of vampirism were such that even with his own vampires instinct still he was confused he stood up took the undead girls hand in his let it flop loosely lifelessly back among the furs on sunside he said speaking slowly and mainly to himself when the wamphyri make their thralls they are only thralls so whats so different here he looked at grig accusingly and why do you understand when i do not i have been here some time lord grig answered and i have learned there were things which vasagi did and things which he did not do he bred vampires not wamphyri on sunside in the hunt the lords take women for their pleasure and the comforts they give also for their blood of course some of their blood they also take men for thralls lieutenants and for the provisioning of the manse the difference is this they dont kill them they take a little give something back the fever gets into their szgany victims who are then brought back here or make their own way or they are discovered by the travellers and put to death on sunside except he searched for words and nestor grew impatient yes except except if a man or woman is drained if so much blood is taken that he or she dies then the vampire your vampire compensates gives more of itself the more you take the more you give and after the sleep of undeath the transition is that much faster nestor looked at the dead girl again but with a different expression on his face she could be wamphyri he glanced at grig and held up a hand to still his tongue yes i know if she is allowed to continue he looked at the other woman but this one maria is only a thrall but a weak thrall lord grig nodded for your hunger was very great the furs are soaked red where your thirst ran over she needs food soup meat in order to serve you again she must first recover suddenly nestor felt bloated suddenly he was aware of his red hands face even his eyes he was still a novice and had taken too much while his system was changing it had not yet had time to adjust or prepare itself for such a gorging his ascendant leech had been too eager he reeled beside the bed clutching the high stone headboard for support and indicating carmen he choked out deal with that the provisioning but as grig lifted her up light as a leaf no wait lie her in state somewhere until i can think then return and care for this one this maria but for the moment nestors gorge was beginning to heave leave me ajonef and as grig carried carmen from the room lord nestor of the wamphyri groped his way blindly to the curtained niche in the corner and almost but not quite made it nestor and grig went down into mangemanse at least grig would have accompanied his master if he had been allowed but where a deep dark stairwell descended in a steep narrow spiral into black bowels of rock and a recess in the wall facing the shaft housed a second batthing guardian there nestor took his lieutenants arm to bring him to a halt and he pointed out a sigil carved in a flagstone at the head of the steps it was cankers mark a sickle moon then as if at some signal though none had been given a growl echoed up from below and was followed by a single ululating howl which slowly died away the guardian showed alarm flowed forward in its niche and hissed but nestor cautioned it be quiet all is well and lord grig looked at him uncertainly and waited canker and i have an agreement nestor told him when in future we visit we go alone of our own free will it was not my intention that you would accompany me further than this point but that youd wait here until i return then you shall show me suckscar taking over where zahar left off for there remains a great deal to be seen and i want to know all meanwhile move about and make yourself useful by all means but stay within earshot of this stairwell when i return i shall call for you yes lord but but grig looked at the steps leading down and at the nitrestreaked walls that is an odorous place lord a kennel by all accounts are you sure you would see it and again as if at some command the unseen creature howled far below and a wave an almost visible reek of animal musk came wafting up out of darkness there was ordure in the smell strong urine the stench of some feral beasts lair grig turned to nestor again and said lord that howling was not a man said nestor grig shook his head no lord canker canison makes creatures in his own image nestor shrugged still i made a promise and i must be known by my word also canker will make a powerful ally well an ally of sorts he started down the deeply hollowed steps wait for me and when i return answer my call yes lord and nestor proceeded down into mangemanse the spiral staircase was deep nestor went cautiously his wamphyri eyes were now so changed that he saw almost as well as in daylight there was no more howling but an aura of expectancy without even knowing he did it nestor sent his vampire awareness ahead of him probing the root of the shaft something was down there but keeping well back and keeping quiet now and nestor sent i am the lord nestor your master canker canison has asked me to attend him who harms me dies if not by my hand by cankers certainly snuffles echoed up to him but that was all at the foot of the steps nestor was appalled to the left a natural cave led back into darkness absolute in which feral eyes huge yellow malevolent glared for a moment then blinked out but this was not the source of his concern that was the veritable midden which lay in a second smaller cave to the right the reeking dung of some large beast possibly the thing with the yellow eyes was piled in slumping heaps out of which grew squat corpsewhite mushrooms while around and in between the piles swirled sickening green puddles of piss nestor stood on a narrow raised unpolluted path midway between the two the unknown guardian on the one hand and its despicable depository on the other but if this was how canker kept mangemanse generally then it well deserved its name and holding his breath he proceeded along a corridor towards an area where a row of tiny round windows let in a little grey light from the west and also the wind which hummed a different tune through each orifice and sucked away the stench of the stairwell midden perhaps this was where canker had derived the inspiration for his instrument but now as nestor left the windows behind and their song dwindled in his ears so the way ahead turned inwards from the outer sheath and into the rock of the stack proper and the corridor grew dark again striding out nestor found himself listening to the slap slap slap of his own footsteps on the worn stone but when he came to a sudden breathless halt he knew that he heard much more than that for from somewhere not too far behind sounded a soft and regular yet strangely irregular padding and the panting of a loping fox or wolf both of which paused only a split second after nestor paused one of two things he was either being tracked as prey or hed acquired a wary escort looking back he saw the corridor disappearing into the gloom of its own curve its walls glowing with a dim phosphorescence of their own and in the core of darkness between the walls at a height about central to a mans thigh those yellow eyes the guardian of cankers stairwell but escorting him or stalking him and his concentrated vampire senses detected a thought which sped by him in a moment into mangemanse something is here a trespasser a sneaking thing and human it he pretends to know you and have business here but i dont trust him no he cannot be the one you mentioned your friend only command me and he shall be no more it was never a human thought but a beasts the illformed message of a beastmind a dog or great wolf but having far more of intelligence than any warrior or guardian so far encountered something of panic set in then or if not true panic an instinctive reaction to danger a deadly cold emotionless desperation causing nestor to shut down his own probes and emanations and withdraw into himself at once like a shadow merging into deeper shadows it was his vampire of course its sense of selfpreservatiop which now directed his actions but if there was any sort of telepathic answer to the trackers murderous suggestion that too was shut out leaving nestor naked and alone with his own fancies and imaginings perhaps it were best to try contacting the doglord except could he trust canker now could he really trust him a few more swift silent paces brought him to a junction like the hub of a great wheel with spoke passageways or rooms leading off choosing the first room on the right and slipping quietly in through its arched entrance nestor put his back to the wall and waited it had been his parasites instinct to cast the merest pulse of a probe ahead of him into the room sufficient to discern no human or inimical animal inhabitant at least but no more than that and then he was inside whatever followed him must pass close by depending on the nature of the beast and if it failed to detect him nestor had two choices to let it carry on and then escape back along the way hed come or to leap upon the creature and try to kill it to that end his knife was in his hand and standing there with his back to the cold stone wall scarcely daring to breathe nestor looked all about his bolthole to discover its contents function and any other exits or escape routes which might exist of the latter there were none the place was quite simply a dry cave with a high ceiling crumbling ledges gloomy niches and no obvious evidence that it had ever been inhabited or furnished by men but it did have its own function and it did provide habitation of sorts for spiders their black webs half as thick as a mans little finger didnt become visible until nestor craned his neck to stare up through a great many irregularly concentric tiers of crumbling sandstone ledges like the interior of some crooked burnedout chimney receding to the ceiling high overhead then the webs looked like intricately patterned cracks in the darkness no two patterns alike all of them faintly luminescent layer upon layer of them bridging the gaps between the ledges as they receded with them into the heights of the place and he was still staring at them pondering their meaning when they began to shiver and tremble all in unison like the dewy webs of much smaller commoner forest and plains species when their makers shake them to trap mites following which the truth of it became obvious ever since childhood nestor had known something of the wamphyri szgany legends had been full of them despite that in those days the old wamphyri were no more when nestor had played with other traveller children he had always taken the part of a vampire lord indeed as a child he had truly desired to be wamphyri so that it was not so very strange that these were the only genuinely material things which he remembered from those forgotten days of yore he had been familiar with all the wamphyri myths and had known about their powers their mentalism and their ability to conjure mists out of their bodies their familiars the bats of starside great and small which they commanded but there was another part of the legend which was less wellknown the way they used lesser creatures to spy for them and perform other functions one such myth had been that the wamphyri used spider silk to spin their clothing while another hinted that they kept the corpses of victims wrapped in spidershrouds which preserved their meat for eating such memories sprang to mind now perhaps enhanced and given substance by his new vampire instinct so that even without knowing the mechanics of the thing nestor knew that something of these ancient beliefs was true he also knew why the asyetunseen spiders in the ledges of the cave were shaking their webs to trap whatever intruder had entered into their place namely himself it was an automatic thing and natural in any case he was no cavern bat to go flitting to his death in the shimmering heights he scarcely felt threatened not by spiders however large but nevertheless turned more fully towards the doorway and in that same moment became aware of the furtive slap of padded feet and a low panting which issued from the mouth of the long corridor back to the stairwell whatever it was that stalked him it was here even now and nestor gripped his knife that much tighter and stayed hidden in the shadows of the doorway until the thing began to emerge into the hub of the cavern system then seeing it come slowly cautiously into view he took a last deep breath and held it and continued to hide in the shadows and the knife in his hand felt like a brittle twig and his flesh soft as the pulp of fungi as the thing more fully emerged lowered its face to the floor where he had stepped and sniffed with a drooling snout more than a foot long nestor had seen his share of grey ones the wolves of the barrier mountains but never a one like this something of the wolf was in it certainly but very little of nature no for this was a creature spawned of cankers vats and it had been bred in something of cankers image at that lupine yes but foxred too its lope was nightmarish made nightmarish by the fact of its six legs the first four of these moved like the legs of any ordinary tame dog or wolf in diagonal agreement but the pair that brought up the rear moved in tandem with the centre pair like the small deer of sunsides forests when startled to flight yet all with a sinuous grace the thing was something less than eight feet long from snout to tip of tail stood maybe thirtysix inches off the ground and must have weighed in excess of four hundred pounds the pads of its paws were larger than nestors hands with claws that clicked against stone where the flags of the floor were uneven and its head and face were quite monstrous again they reminded nestor of a wolf their dimensions were those of a huge wolf certainly but the furtive unblinking intelligence behind the burning sulphur of the eyes and the colour of its fur that was all fox in combination the feral talents of the two animals would be formidable they were formidable the guardian took another weird loping pace forward its long snout again touched the floor where nestor had paused and sniffed and the long sensitive ears swivelled to point at him in his hiding place he would draw further back but didnt dare move this creature wasnt something he could shout at and subdue it wasnt one of his own but canker canisons over which he had no claim or control at all it had allowed him to enter this place of his own free will but that didnt mean it had to let him out again nestor had instinctively automatically shuttered his eyes still the yellow orbs of the wolfthing found the red flush of his own and grew large in its sloping face as its entire body aimed itself like an arrow at his doorway then growling low in its throat stifflegged and salivating from jaws like an ivory mantrap the thing advanced and it was no more than five of nestors paces away when he felt a tap on his shoulder any ordinary man might have fainted at that touch even the bravest szgany traveller would have cried out but nestor was no longer szgany no longer a traveller he was wamphyri he moved but a fraction turning l his body only an inch or two at most but his knifehand moved like greased lightning and he slashed unerringly at whatever had touched him the keen edge of his blade bit into but didnt quite cut the ropelike thing touching his upper left shoulder instead the weapon seemed attracted to that slender hairy strand and in order to retrieve it he must wrench sharply downwards which only served to bring him into further contact with the thread of gluey spider silk slapping against the sleeve of his jacket from shoulder to elbow it adhered at once and began to vibrate nestor glanced out of the door the wolfthing had come to a halt and was crouched down snarling only two paces or a single bound away its sleek muscles were bunching even now while descending from above a foot or two overhead a great red spider crept effortlessly headfirst down the strand and in the walls the rubyglinting eyes of others were visible where they swung from ledge to ledge coming to investigate the nature of their victim but there are spiders and there are spiders relatives of these creatures dwelled on sunside too in deep caverns from which they emerged at dusk to fashion their webs and trap moths that species was three to four inches long with a bite that was poisonous but rarely fatal it produced a numbness and even partial paralysis accompanied by dizziness and vomiting but lasting only three or four hours at most that was sunside however while this was starside these aerie spiders were at least four times longer with forty or fifty times the bulk nestor gave his arm a desperate yank and his sleeve was torn away down the stitches to dangle there on the adhesive thread the violence of the movement shook the spider loose it flopped to the floor and at once rolled itself into a ball without pause nestor kicked it straight into the face of the wolfthing and as cankers creature reared back and yelped he stepped into the open with his knifearm upraised whats all this canker whiningly queried loping forward across the open span of the hub is it the lord nestor what and do you threaten my creatures he grinned do i what nestor was astonished and angry hah canker barked or do they threaten you eh the great spider scurried by them into the darkness of the cave and cankers guarddog shrank down and grovelled then backed off with its tail between its legs canker scowled at it and said well done then pointed and added and now begone the creature turned and slunk away returning the way it had come your dog would have attacked me nestor accused and your spiders did attack me on the first count wrong said canker my dog as you have it was instructed to follow you and see you came to no harm he was only suspicious because you were so furtive whereas i had said you would be bold and on the second count also wrong because the great red spiders are only mine insofar as they dwell here i dont cant command them they are what they are and do what they do but you have spiders of your own surely or should i say there are spiders in suckscar ah but i note your confusion as yet youve not explored your manse to the full and so you fail to understand the special functions of creatures such as this well thats easily put to rights let me show you he led the way back into the spider cavern but nestor stayed where he was what canker glanced back at him do you hold back no need for caution now nestor indeed quite the opposite the more noise the better and with that he barked and capered and laughed in his maddog fashion within the cave the echoes of his actions went up and dust rilled down and high overhead the luminous webs stopped shivering and grew still blind canker laughed or very nearly ah but they hear well enough why you must have crept in here nestor that they should mistake you for something small but quite obviously we noisy creatures are not bats and so the spiders are fled to their high niches but come see and understand he loped through the cavern across a floor inches deep in defunct castoff webs which had lost both their glow and adhesion to a corner which was festooned in dusty drapes of spider silk and behind these shrouding curtains there said canker pointing and now nestor saw that the old szgany legends were true for there against the wall stood a geometrical structure like a small section cut through a beehive honeycomb six hexagonal tubes formed the base with five more on top then four three two and one a pyramid of tubes storage tubes of wax produced and fashioned by the spiders in which to preserve what the tubes were almost seven feet long by two feet across the bore nestor approached the pyramid and brushed dust away from wax which was not quite opaque the tube he had chosen was in the row of three about shoulder high the fourth in height from the floor and lodged within all wrapped in silk threads except for his face was that a human figure well subhuman anyway for it was a brown and leathery trog from starsides caverns under the barrier mountains apparently mummified and more than a little shrivelled but dead nestor fancied he saw the faint flutter of an eyelid and the merest twitch of a protuberant lip also the wall of the waxy tube directly above his face was misty as from shallow breathing bravo said canker your developing vampire instinct you chose to examine the one cell currently in use cell nestor looked at him and canker shrugged hatchery then nestor frowned shook his head and canker sighed then leading the way back out now listen he said and i shall explain the spiders fashion these combs in size according to their prey here in mangemanse and throughout the aerie in general we the wamphyri provide the prey wherefore the tubes are mansized the process is simple we hunt on sunside or in this case on starside down in the bottoms beyond the sucking sphere of white light the helllands gate indeed in the trog caverns where the earth shines helllands gate did you say aye ive heard my thralls call it by that name when ive brought them out of sunside let me begin again we hunt on sunside and take thralls lieutenants women but not everyone can be a thrall or lieutenant and sometimes a woman can get used up too quickly of course there is always the provisioning a manse has its needs no less than its inhabitants i have warriors to feed and familiars and then there are my common vampire thralls and my men but what use to keep a surfeit of flesh around especially if it be useless surly or ugly well i have cold storage rooms as do we all but i prefer my meat red and afoot when i can have it right now i dont have much use for the spiders none of us do but in time of siege if that should ever come to pass and well it might for we have powerful enemies in the east or if ever fresh blood should prove hard to come by then the aeries spiders come into their own for they have a bite which will put a man to sleep as easily as my own ha ha except men will rise from my bite if i wish it while the spider bite will freeze them for long and long it is not undeath no but similar in its way it does not make vampires but simply preserves meat and so you see the value of the spiders bitten by them and wrapped in their cocoons a man is slowed down down down and lasts a year or more so that if the time comes when i may not journey abroad well so what my larder is full at home oh ha ha i have thirty men preserved in this way aye and even a handful of women the antidote is produced by the female when her eggs are due to hatch it lets blood flow freely in the incubator that is the body of the victim in which she has laid her eggs in men these are deposited in the gut and even as the antidote stirs the victim to agonized life so the hatchlings are busy eating their way out ah but of course that is not allowed to happen as soon as a man is stilled and cocooned before eggs can be laid in him i have him removed from this place to my larder later when i require him up and about its the work of a moment to have a female administer the antidote what could be simpler walking with canker through the hollow echoing maze of mangemanses upper level nestor offered a shrug deep inside perhaps something of the old nestor rebelled if so his parasite quickly subdued it it seems simple enough he finally answered except do you keep trogs in your larder too eh canker frowned ah that one back there no no he is not for eating not by me at least but you see the spiders look after me and i must look after the spiders that trog you saw he is a receptacle a hatchery what and should i let the beasts die out no of course not for they serve me too well the trogs dull life is burgeoning even now and so is a new generation of grubs burrowing in his innards but enough of that lets down into mangemanse proper and see whats to be seen they had reached the northeastern corner of the stack where windows looked out on mile upon mile of barren boulder plains and a distant darkblue horizon cold and sombre under the occasional writhing wisp of auroral sheen here a wide staircase led down and as nestor followed on close behind the doglord his first view of cankers great hall surprised him more than just a little here at least mangemanse was not what hed supposed it would be if nestor had been puzzled by cankers remark about descending into mangemanse proper he was puzzled no more up above in the level immediately below his own suckscar the aura had been one of emptiness desolation abandonment ah but all deliberately contrived nestor saw that now that the upper level had been kept that way gloomy echoing guarded and forbidding because of its proximity to the onetime manse of vasagi the suck there was nothing up there which a neighbour would covet just empty rooms mazy corridors a cave of spiders and a ferocious guardian equipped not only with a physical voice but also with a cunning intelligence and a strong telepathic connection with its master that level was a gantlet a place to be approached with great caution and suspicion if not actual fear and trepidation though who in his right mind would want to run such a gantlet in the first place nestor couldnt say perhaps those powerful enemies in the east which canker had mentioned but down here as opposed to a midden stinkhole or kennel mangemanse proper was immaculate which in the richness and variety of its appointments by far outdid the austerity and dingy furnishings of suckscar the walls were hung with tapestries hunting scenes mainly at which wellclothed vampire women worked even now stitching and embellishing a kitchen in an alcove to one side issued mouthwatering aromas and billowing wafts of smoke and steam into a chimney hole in the ceiling more windows cut high in the walls let in all that was required of light since these faced well away from the sun and towards the northeast their ornate baffles screens and batfur curtains were kept mainly open aerating the place canker pointed out a great high archway in an inner wall surmounted by a recently cemented keystone bearing his sicklemoon sigil this was the entrance to his private apartments he made no attempt to show nestor inside but explained i keep a watcher just within who has no eyes and so works by smell alone this makes him extra vigilant and he accepts only me and mine instant death to anyone else friend foe whatever who so much as puts a toe across that threshold be advised that is one place where you must never go neither of your own free will nor by invitation not even mine no for you are a lord of the wamphyri in your own right be sure he would sniff out your leech and fall on you in a moment they left cankers great hall and struck out north through a maze of wellkept corridors and lesser halls and in a while as they proceeded it was a mistake to come here said nestor musingly how so canker coughed because it makes me realize how much of my own place goes unseen as yet unexplored but since we seem to have struck up something of a friendship it would have been impolite of me to refuse you impolite canker grinned but ruefully precious little of politics here nestor what rules the wamphyri make are for breaking their chivalry is a sham if a lord can lie and go undetected be sure hell never tell the truth if you find one you think you can trust odds are hes made a fool of you when a lord laughs with you make sure he doesnt continue when your back is turned and any bargain you may strike strike it twice and make doubly sure you nail it down nestor looked at him earnestly oh and is your chivalry the friendship which youve shown me a sham canker do you also lie in trusting you am i a fool do you laugh with me or behind my back im as big a liar as the rest the doglord answered carelessly as for chivalry let a man cross me ill ambush and gut him at my first opportunity comradeship and laughter there are laughs and there are laughs but you he paused in his loping caught nestors arms and looked him straight in the eye very seriously with his great shaggy head cocked a little on one side you are different to answer your question no ill not betray you but youre not yet fullfledged and when your leech rides ascendant well it could yet be a question of who betrays who by now they had crossed the span of mangemanse to reach a cold and blustery cavern in the northfacing wall out there seen through a series of small round window holes the distant horizon was of a variegated blue and purple shimmering through amethyst to indigo and back again under the weave of the icelands aurora but here inside the cavern once a long lowceilinged landing bay by its looks this was where canker had been at work on his musical instrument nestor gazed in open astonishment at the gleaming white jumble where canker stepped proudly carefully among the various halffinished assemblies and marvelled at the doglords industry that he had conceived of and commenced to build such a thing it was of alveolate bones of course many of them thin as a mans arm while others were vast beyond reason the leg and thighbones of warrior creatures of the old wamphyri who in ages past had warred with each other and ridden their vampire beasts to battle and death out across the boulder plains more than two thousand feet below for in those days there had been many aeries whose lords and ladies were forever feuding and so the littered gullies and driedout river beds of starsides bottoms formed a monstrous ossuary now canker had started to carve these hollowed relics of bygone ages to pierce them and fit the holes with oiled sliding plugs and to join the resulting flutes together in series from large bones to small he had strapped them side by side with leather fastenings their open ends facing the blustery gulf beyond the landingbay while in the mouth of the bay itself there a series of massive baffles the oarlike scapulae of monsters were held in position by ropes and turned on pivots at cankers command and indeed there seemed something of order in his work which was why nestor marvelled there said canker gratified i see it in your face you acknowledge my skill in the construction of this work ah and one day youll applaud my artistry too as i orchestrate the very winds and cause these bones to sound but would you like a demonstration stand back then and you shall see oh its not perfected not yet by a long shot but one day one day and as nestor looked on canker loosened the baffleropes where they were coiled on capstans vi the bonesong wratha carmen in all the levels of the last great aerie of the wamphyri in echoing halls which now were mainly empty except for drowsy vampire guards and watchkeeping monsters in winding mazy corridors and stairwells storerooms communal and private places the sound gradually became apparent it might be the sighing of the wind flowing down from the icelands drawn by the sun rising over sunside where even now mists had been lured up from foothills and crags to obscure the yellow peaks of the barrier range it might be a mewling of monsters waxing in their vats things which had been men and now were less than men giving hideous voice and readying themselves for their new roles it might be the scorching of the sun on the southfacing flanks of wrathspire itself as if its rays ate like acid into the harrowed rock of morbid centuries it might have been any or all of these things a combination of sounds amplified by the comparative quiet and the aching acoustic hollowness of the kilometrehigh stack but it was none of them it was instead a sounding of bones it was canker canison at his first fumbling trial run adjusting the baffles which directed the gusting dawn winds through the maze of grotesque bone pipes which was his moon lure and it sounded however faintly at first in every inch of the stack from gorvis basement apartments to the tip of the topmost turret of wrathspire itself down in guilesump the water in gorvis wells seemed to tremble on the surface as from some internal stirring dust falling in rills formed curtains like drifting smoke or the weird weave of icelands auroras without their phosphorescent sheen the guiles watchmen turned wondering eyes upwards to cavern ceilings only to blink and feel the sting as the fine grey dust settled into them in madmanse the brothers wran and spiro killglance slept and dreamed their red dreams but all disturbed and distorted by the sound halfwaking wran aimed a sluggish thought at unseen but suspect guardian creatures which he supposed were quarrelling be still stop fighting keep watch or should i simply dissolve you in the vats and start again having issued the threat he returned to his hideous dreaming but still the sound was there and spiro cried out once twice sharply and fearfully from his bed and whined eygor our father which we murdered but are you here too does your uneasy spirit prowl the last aerie the new madmanse just as it stalked the corridors of that haunted old place in turgosheim so be it i am not afraid for theres no power in your eyes now you may not destroy me with a glance all very defiant and bravesounding bravo but spiros voice had faded to a dry mumbling croak at the end and there was no answer except the bonesong in suckscar zahar and grig shared the duties of lieutenant of the guard the better to keep an eye on the common thrall pickets and watchmen for nestors orders had not gone astray currently grig was halfasleep on a bench not far from where nestor had left him on his descent into mangemanse and zahar nursed his crippled but rapidly healing arm and hand as he crept up on watchmen to catch them out to them the wail and throb and thunder of cankers music seemed a song of grave foreboding issuing from mangemanse it might easily spell trouble and even death for their new master who seemed bent on suicide in those unknown levels of kennelstench and canine perversion aye for even among the wamphyri canker was perverse not that zahar and grig would worry much over nestors demise but more about their own futures if such were the case and overhead in wrathspire wratha tossed in her bed and called out wearily for her lovethrall to attend her he came shuddering from his furdraped bench in a niche massaged her back with trembling hands and told her hush now rest easy lady no harm befalls her vampire lover was young and strong but not as strong as he had been and no longer so young he ate like a shad but his weight went down ounce by ounce his cheeks were sinking in upon themselves his nerves were breaking and the smile he must smile for wratha was often as not a grimace but not when she could see it only when he practised for in his heart of hearts he knew it would not be long before the lady sought a replacement knew also what had befallen the one who had gone before him wrathspire had its requirements and little went to waste there was always the provisioning to wrathas lovethrall the bonesong was the merest hum vibrating upwards through the rock under his feet and into him a loose window baffle perhaps thrumming in a crosswind but to wratha it was something else her acute wamphyri senses which numbered more than five loaned it new accent and meaning especially in her vampire sleep it was an accusing voice which howled out of the past and was borne to her on beams of sunlight from far across the barrier mountains the sun is risen and smiles her sick yellow smile at me she whispered her voice all trembly drowsy and dreaming as her thralls clever hands soothed her a little aye smiling even as she smiled at karl the crag that time and turned his hair to smoke and burned his eyes out i can hear him crying out to me demanding revenge his voice is in the sun which burns on wrathspire even now and perspiring yet with something of a shiver in her voice she queried are the drapes drawn are they yes lady throughout all of wrathspire except this room has no drapes for there are no windows you rarely sleep where the sun can find you lady true she sighed in answer drifting deeper into fevered dreams but i nightmare wherever i sleep in mangemanse nestor leaned back against a curved inner buttress with his hands clapped to his ringing ears there stood canker like a huge upright dog outlined against the deep blue sheen of the northern horizon with four baffleropes wrapped around each arm he tried desperately hard and uselessly to control all of the wind inlets at once the result for the last six or seven minutes had been an absolute cacophony until nestor could stand it no longer now pale and shaken he watched the laughing doglord releasing rope after rope until the numerous cartilage baffles were set loose to pivot and turn at will knocked to and fro by the mindless wind then for a while it was even worse several of the bellows between the baffles and the organ assemblies ruptured as great blasts of uncontrolled air tore into them an eight foot tall baffle was wrenched loose from its seating in a splintering of cartilage and went clattering away along the outer wall of the stack and down into the abyss one of the assemblies virtually a pyramid of bones began vibrating so violently that its bindings snapped setting free a dozen or more mighty white tubes to go rolling and bouncing this way and that across the floor of the onetime landing bay canker hastily winding ropes on capstans had to dance to avoid being knocked off his feet at last the chaos was over and there came a blissful surcease and despite the moaning of the wind round the last aerie the silence was such that it was deafening furious about the damage canker stamped and roared and finally turned to where nestor staggered wan and very nearly deafened against the buttress did you hear did you see the dogthing barked on the one hand his fury was still plain to see but on the other he seemed partially satisfied at least and what did you think think nestor answered have you left me a brain with which to think was it that bad canker was at once crestfallen bad is not the word for what it was aye you are right the other nodded too much for one man to handle i think but it was the first time id tried it after all perhaps when ive repaired it next time youd care to give me a hand nestor shook his aching head but carefully i think not compose your orchestra of lieutenants and thralls canker for even the strongest friendship has its breaking point but youll admit the thing has possibilities will it make music will it lure your mythical lady down from the moon is that what youre asking for a moment cankers face turned yet more bestial and his jaws gaped wide snarling but in the next his expression was sad mythical nestor he halfpanted halfwhined huh i might have expected that from the others but not from you i tell you i have dreamed of her and she must be from the moon where else all dressed in silver with her yellow hair and blue eyes have you not seen how the moon tumbles blue and yellow through the skies blue in those parts which are turned to the icelands and yellow in the half that is lit by the furnace sun and sometimes silver head to toe when the sun is down and the aurora flutters pale in the north do you not know that i am an oneiromancer and can read the future in dreams until you can readily understand such things dont speak to me of myths and fancies i didnt mean to offend you nestor told him and in any case who am i to say youre wrong i cant even remember my own past well except in brief meaningless flashes let alone read the future canker came to him and clapped his shoulder i am not offended we are friends you and i and must always speak the truth to one another thats how it shall be but tell me how may i learn the music i mean i understand the principle but have no idea of the tune it is for dancing am i right and for singing well i can sing you may believe it and i dance in a fashion though not like you szgany sing and dance the tune nestor was puzzled but im sure theres more than one tune i think i know a few notes of several bring me a flute out of sunside and ill teach you a song of love of devotion of worship canker yelped his excitement that is what i require i shall imitate your most beautiful tune and fit my song to it then eventually ill lure my silver mistress down from the moon moon madness nestor thought but kept the thought well hidden on their way back to the midden stairwell to suckscar nestor was quiet a while before saying something is amiss here eh canker looked at him where they paused in the passageway to the foot of the stairs where lurked the sixlegged wolf creature something amiss in what way it was my impression that is i was given to understand nestor paused for a moment and finished in a rush that you lived like a beast and backing away a little from the other if we are to be true friends then surely i can say these things canker threw back his head and laughed and was serious in a moment that is an image which i have deliberately fostered and after all i am a beast but so are they all and you too nestor or you will be but yes i understand your meaning my reason for this lifelong subterfuge is simple survival if my socalled colleagues think there is nothing to covet in mangemanse then they will covet nothing if they believe i dwell in a pigsty they will surely stay out of it just as long as they consider me a strange mad creature i have little to fear from them for quite obviously i am harmless that is as long as im left to my own devices and not threatened when abroad hunting on sunside i ravage and rage and pose a dire threat to females especially there seems no purpose to the things i do ah but there is a purpose certainly i achieve some gratification some small satisfaction from certain acts which others might consider gross but more than that i perpetuate my image the light in which those others see me he paused here in mangemanse however as you have seen and as i trust you will keep to yourself things are very different my place is clean neither a kennel nor a midden except in its approaches which is a deliberate contrivance what is more i would hazard a guess that in its appointments its staff equipment furnishings and facilities mangemanse is superior to almost any other house in all this great stack well with the exception perhaps of wrathspire for indeed wratha the risen likes her little luxuries but only let some vile intruder enter by this route or by any route up down or sideways and hes bound to think as you thought when first you ventured here into stench and ordure and so proceed no farther thus are my credentials and my manses security established and shall remain so nestor nodded also i know your state of mind i think my state of mind canker raised a shaggy red eyebrow your attitude in this respect nestor answered i seem to remember that sometimes on sunside if a guarddog or wolf is tethered or kennelled for too long in one place then he may become kennelproud which is to say hell suffer no other creature within the boundary of his territory whenever this occurs only the dogs master may command him within that perimeter or bring him safely out of it add to this the fact that the wamphyri are notoriously territorial your reasoning is sound canker nodded you are saying that perhaps i am suffering from this kennelproudness and it could be that you are right except theres a flaw in it for it doesnt explain why i invited you to come down here unless for master we substitute the word friend but understand this one thing i am proud of is my ancestry however mongrel the dog even the fox and especially the wolf they are all of them noble beasts dont you agree certainly said nestor though he was not convinced but best to keep the doglord happy for the wolf is a hunter who lives in the wild and relies solely upon his own skill canker went on the fox is colourful crafty beyond measure a sneak thief and merciless killer and as for the dog when he is trained what more faithful creature exists in all the world nestor was surprised do the wamphyri keep dogs its not unknown in turgosheim several lords keep dogs aye they keep them as pets and occasionally for the hunting ah but its common knowledge that the szgany of sunside keep a great many dogs for the security which they give not only to guard their encampments against hostile strangers but also for early warning of wamphyri raiders as for myself why mangemanse is full of dogs they are my children your chil oh haha canker capered i have wives nestor a good many and theyve borne me a good many pups ah youve likely heard it said that girls stolen out of sunside dont last too long in mangemanse eh not so well thats the way they tell it anyway but its untrue just because i kill on sunside and remember canker has killed with his member lad thats not to say i do it in mangemanse what i should worry my girl thralls to death like a wild dog among goats not at all they are my wives who pleasure me but none outside mangemanse knows it except you for you have seen they work in my kitchens at my tapestries in my laundry and butcher shop even in the pens and launching bays as for my yelping bloodsons what better way to build an army and staff it with faithful lieutenants than to ensure theyre of your own blood and so another legend brought to its knees i am a beast aye when it suits me to be one nestor nodded slowly and said any who think you are mad canker canison quite obviously they are mad but as he made his way up into suckscar alone he thought to himself as for your silver mistress in the moon well theres madness and theres madness at the start of the next sunup nestors vampire came into its true ascendancy in the interim for a period equivalent to five days in the world beyond the glaring helllands gate he had expended furious and frightening wamphyri energies exploring charting and reorganizing suckscar and in that same period he had grown changed taken on a shape which was like yet unlike his own the shape of a true lord of the wamphyri his excessive activity was like a fever in his blood which would not let him rest it was the change that shapes it was his rapid metamorphosis into something other than the nestor he had been and as the furnace sun rose up again beyond the barrier range to banish the shadows from the mountains then it was that his vampire leech became fully ascendant the speed with which the change had occurred was astonishing the activity of his parasite amazing he would launch out from his manse upon his flyer and when the others saw him circling wrathstack or soaring over wrathspire itself laughing into the wind then they would wonder at it but the fact of it was that vasagi the suck had been a master of metamorphism and the answer lay in the genetic makeup of his egg in that and in nestors urgency to be wamphyri then too the other side of his morbid ancestry came into play but morbid only in the sense of its infinitely dark possibilities not in the nature of the one who had explored possessed and used them a man called harry keogh necroscope in his own world a parallel universe away nestors father had been beloved of the teeming dead the great majority how could it have been otherwise for harry had been a lone candle glimmering in their eternal darkness a warm spot in the chill of their unbeing the only man of all living men who could talk to them and give them comfort and more he had been the only one who could die for them in the end he had done just that died for the dead and the living alike for all the generations that were and those yet to come in two worlds except his end had signalled a monstrous beginning and nestor was just another link in the endless chain thus harrys darkest talent or an even darker one had been inherited by this gypsy son of his just as it had been passed on to nestors brother nathan but in nestor the dark side was ascendant and the dead would never love him indeed those who had passed beyond and should be beyond all fear and feeling would very soon fear him above all other living dead and undead creatures fear him yes together with all of his works because some of them would even feel the works of the vampire lord nestor nothing of which was known to nestor himself for the necroscope harry keogh had died when he was still a child and nestor had long since forgotten nathan as a brother and now thought of him only as some hated rival or grim enemy out of the past but harry keoghs talent was in him for all that or a hideously warped version of it at least lord nestor of the wamphyri necroscope no never but necromancer ah indeed it started like this nestor was out flying it seemed the only way to ease his spirit still the weird tides surging in his blood and calm his burgeoning wamphyri passions out there in the crisp cold air under fading icechip stars feeling the rush of the slipstream over his flyers head and neck he could forget things and that in itself was strange for in truth he had very little to forget except perhaps the rushing whirlpool of numbers spiralling in his head that madly whirling vortex which on occasion he dreamed of even now the vortex and its treacherous origin the mind of his olden enemy on sunside for upon a time nestor had loved the ache was still there in his heart and the hatred he had loved and had been rejected or rather his olden enemy had stolen her away that was as much as he remembered of it that and the fact that afterwards well he had not been the same nor would he ever be the same again for his change then had been physical wrought of a damaged mind and body while his change now was psychical of the spirit indeed there was very little of the human spirit left in him but an inhuman spirit and so nestor rode out upon his flyer and bared his teeth and laughed into the wind even though he felt that the laughter wasnt entirely his but the gold was back on the peaks of the barrier mountains and he dared not fly too high soon the tallest towers of wrathspire would be bathed in yellow glare and all of wrathas curtains closed against the light of day that was still several hours away however and for the moment nestor displayed his newly acquired mastery of flight urging his beast into intricate aerial configurations in and out of wrathspires hollow turrets and fretted rock needles then he saw the lady wratha herself she was in a turret watching him at his play and keeping her thoughts hidden nestor had sensed her there before on several occasions but had never seen her seeing her now distracted by her presence he momentarily lost control of his flyer and came close to striking a bartizan but his mount concerned for its own skin as well as its masters instinctively avoided the collision hearing wrathas laughter nestor wheeled his flyer in a tight circle alighted on a quarteracre of roof like a small sloping plateau dismounted and went striding towards her turret observation post funny was it he queried angrily to distract me so that i might easily have crashed wrecked my flyer and gone tumbling over the edge to a certain death from somewhere behind and below her there sounded a warning echoing rumble and the clatter of scrabbling claws the turret must conceal a stairwell down into wrathspire it was one of the ladys exits onto the roof and wratha had brought up an escort with her one of her small personal warriors now her laughter gay as a girls died away oh and do you find me a distraction then nestor wrathas expression was almost but not quite innocent as she stepped from the turret to display herself in her revealing robe of black batfur ropes but a pleasant one i trust anyway there was nothing malicious in it this is my place after all and i often look out from here oh ive watched you once or twice and monitored your change aye and i like what ive seen of you nestor came to a halt ten paces away as something dark rose up behind her adding its darkness to the shadows inside the turret and then he asked himself has she deliberately lured me here nestor had left his gauntlet behind hanging from his flyers saddle well and what odds even with his gauntlet hed stand no slightest chance against even a small warrior these were some of the thoughts that passed rapidly through his head as he stood glaring at the lady and the shadowy shape in the turret behind her but in the next moment ridiculous he thought what am i thinking o i land on anothers territory unbidden and of my own free will approach her in anger and at once consider murderous combat with a warrior madness quite obviously this white heat inside my body and head is burning up my brain his thoughts were confused a jumble entirely unguarded and aha said wratha and so he rises nestor was taken aback he glanced this way and that and saw nothing who rises she smiled at him wickedly teasingly perhaps why your leech my young lord your parasite he or it rises to ascendancy it explained a lot and was the only clue nestor needed i i had wondered he said lamely dont we all she answered when first we feel the fever heat the boundless energy the furious passion but looking at you now oh its perfectly obvious your leech is risen and is as one with you yes you are wamphyri you need not concern yourself with getting there any longer nestor you are there and soon your fever will cool and leave you fully forged and in command or so youll believe anyway her words shocked him in one way pleased him in another but shocked pleased or both still some spiteful or prideful urge caused him to reply and was there ever any doubt possibly not she tossed her head possibly he shook his head no definitely not and if the change had been slower dyou think i would have submitted to gorvi the guiles time limit and let them throw me out hah gorvi setting limits indeed what they would have to invade me in my manse and drag me out of it first and believe me the suck had monsters no less than your own well and theyre mine now she clapped her hands you have such energy nestor and all from your leech but if you werent so strong the change would not have been so fast and so you see you and your parasite fit each other like a hand in a glove you are strong aye her eyes beneath their scarp lingered on him but just look at you you were a boy and now youre a man you were oh a good sixfooter but now youre six and a half you were handsome well halfhandsome i suppose but lacking style and now youre dark sinister seductively powerful every inch a true lord of the wamphyri come step closer he did so saying canker is not dark sinister seductive he is a monster gorvi is gaunt as death and devious to a fault only wran fits my picture of a true lord and he is overweight and has a wen whats more i suspect that he and spiro are mad so all in all it strikes me theres nothing glorious about the wamphyri not this bunch anyway but their passions are glorious she answered quietly her voice husky where she laid a trembling hand upon his arm and felt the blood coursing and the muscles bunching and am i not glorious you are very beautiful he answered or would appear to be and yet i have heard tales would appear to be tales her voice was suddenly cold as she drew back from him what tales sensing her changing emotions wrathas guardian creature rumbled and glared greeneyed at nestor from the darkness of the turret knowing that the thing would react instantly to her slightest command he took a precautionary pace to the rear and towards his flyer where it nodded vacantly some small distance away just tales he answered the way you keep your eyes hidden beneath that scarp of bone the blue crystals in your temples to cool the furnace of your glance the lie of your flesh which is not a girls but a hags aye all of these things and more for as i understand it the wamphyri especially their ladies are often deceptive in appearance for a moment she was silent then listen to me she told him but with nothing of anger listen and learn in an hundred years or even two hundred if you are fortunate you will be an old man but will you look like one of course not because you are wamphyri vain as most of us are you will look much as you look now it is how you will keep yourself and it is how i have kept myself what would you have me wrinkle to a prune when i can look the way i do for remember the blood is the life and it is also the youth it is my gift to look this way forever and so i shall it is my nature and yours but i may tell you this my handsome lord nestor wratha was never a hag i was beautiful and i still am except you have made it very plain to me that you dont appreciate beauty so begone her voice had turned sour this is my roof and i did not give you permission to land here it would serve you right if i loosed my guardian creature upon you she began to turn away until nestor stepped forward and on impulse caught her hand then immediately she turned to him and deliberately fell into his arms her eyes beneath the scarp on her forehead were ablaze firing the figured bone with red she halfshuttered them but not so much as to subdue their scarlet allure the ropes of her robe parted to display first the tips then the quivering globes of her proud breasts and her breath was sweet as nestor lowered his mouth to drink from hers but sweet as blood not honey it made no difference there was no difference not to nestor not now indeed it seemed entirely possible that honey would be bitter by comparison and as he kissed her and fondled her breasts the furious heat inside him threatened to overflow and boil him from within so hot indeed that wratha felt it too and knew her danger she would not be raped up here on her own roof not with all the fading stars peeping down and not with a huge and empty bed in her rooms below but all of that must wait she had no desire to appear easy meat so that finally when his kisses and fondling threatened to engulf her despite her feigned reticence come she pulled herself breathlessly away and issued her mental command protect me being so close to her nestor heard her mindcall and witnessed its result her creature came it was one of the warriors which nestor had seen in wrathspires great hall nine feet tall when upright yet squat for its height a thing of inchthick bluegrey chitin armour a thing of claws jaws and dagger teeth its face was huge and slategrey ratlike flattened and sloping from chin to forehead yet almost human too what almost nestor knew better than that that indeed the thing had been human upon a time but its eyes were set too far apart at the sides giving it a wide angle of vision it had short hind legs long reaching arms and a shambling but energetic gait as nestor now saw for roaring like a rutting shad but five times louder the creature bore down on him where he backed off from wratha and turned to run for his flyer he might even have made it but in his haste tripped and went to one knee and wrathas warrior was on him then hold she sent a mindblast do him no harm but simply detain him the thing stopped snorting and bellowing at once it grabbed nestor around the waist and by his shoulder and picked him up literally as if he were some szgany childs toy it drew him close and gazed at him turning its loathsome head this way and that the better to observe him and holding him in midair while wratha approached it breathed upon him the stench was awful nestor held his breath he also held still and made no move or protest but simply waited for death for if that was wrathas purpose certainly no one could deny her now but it was not her purpose she approached and looked up at him almost curiously he gradually eased his head to one side away from the face of the monster and its gaping jaws and stared down at her wheyfaced he was totally defenceless he knew that he was at her mercy and death only a bite away but he was also wamphyri so it looks like like im not going to live for two hundred years after all he said and if it had been possible he might even have shrugged for a moment wratha said nothing but merely smiled and he saw how cold that smile of hers was but in another moment she brightened gave herself a shake and said men have always been my problem as a szgany girl as karl the crags thrall in cragspire even as wratha the risen in the dark and rocky gorge of turgosheim why it was because of weak and malicious men that i fled west to this last great aerie where even now theyre the bane of my life these dullards with their manses in my stack but you are not a dullard and i think i prefer you alive it could be im making a mistake but take him to his flyer her warrior obeyed stood nestor on his feet close to his mount and pushed him in that direction stumbling he caught up the reins and hauled himself up into the saddle and as he urged his beast to flight visit me again some time wratha sent amazingly there was never a hint of enmity or malice in her voice what of my own free will he replied sarcasm dripping from his mind a moment later his flyers thrusters uncoiled sending mount and rider skimming down the gentle slope of the plateau she laughed in his mind wejj then invite me down into suckscar for ive only ever been there the once and we are neighbours after all but im the one with warriors in suckscar he answered and now he sensed her shrug but also her frustration so be it my handsome lord nestor but im sure well meet again some time he shot out over the precipitous rim of the last aerie and ordered his mount home he had women of his own there a gaggle of them what need had he of wratha the risen but on the other hand the needs of the wamphyri are great and wratha shone in his mind like some strange dark jewel how could his thralls compare with her the promise hed felt when he held her in his arms had been limitless he knew that her fire could match his any time all of which were thoughts that nestor kept hidden as well as he could but perhaps not well enough for as his flyer dipped below the rim so wrathas tinkling mindlaughter came to him again and in the cup of his burning hand the feel of her silky breasts and on his lips the taste of her tainted kiss in suckscar zahar was waiting on the return of his lord when nestor landed his flyer in the yawning weathered socket of his personal landingbay his first lieutenant was there to take the reins and guide the floundering beast to its pen nestor could see that the man wanted words with him and so waited until his flyer was penned then lord said zahar joining him and entering into suckscar proper and following him to his rooms there is a matter oh and what is it nestor turned on the sweeping stone stairs and stared at him and read trouble in his feral eyes out with it zahar it is the lady carmen lord nestor gave a start the lady car and he paused with the name unspoken but he knew well enough what and who zahar was talking about and carmen he finally said yes and what of her and again he knew the answer before it came it is sunup lord its unlikely shell rise up from her bench through sunup but when the sun goes down as the last light fades on the crags of the barrier mountains and their shadows creep across the boulder plains towards the icelands then we shall have a lady in our manse nestor finished it for him and slowly nodded and for now how goes it with her how goes it zahar raised an eyebrow she is dead lord or undead as we say she sleeps her sleep afterwards perhaps even a long time afterwards when she is risen up she will suffer the change that shapes just as you are suffering it then she will be a true lady and mistress of suckscar on whose authority nestor snapped why on yours lord for theres no denying it you have brought her into being and she will be wamphyri nestor pulled at his right earlobe i had forgotten her no i had put her from my mind it seemed a cruel way to use her to use her even unto undeath and then destroy her but that was then lord and this is now perhaps you see things differently now nestor stood tall gritted his teeth i cannot have a lady in my house my women yes but not a lady the provisioning is the answer see to it he made to turn away but zahar said lord the provisioning yes is something amiss very much so she is wamphyri lord if your thralls eat of her it could be problematic grind her down fool nestor snarled as the growing but inexperienced thing within sent him conflicting messages for be sure she wont be up to infecting anything in the smallest of small pieces but indeed she will lord said zahar very quietly and grimly on sunside the szgany stake vampires through their hearts they cut off their heads and burn them to ashes and they are only vampires not wamphyri nestor knew all of this he remembered it the moment his lieutenant was through speaking the words he had known how the szgany would have dealt with him if theyd caught him after he left brad bereas house in the forest or how at that time he had thought they would deal with him and now he felt a fool in front of zahar but if his lieutenant was so full of knowledge perhaps he might have ideas too so nestor asked him what then do you suggest take her to the barrier mountains now zahar was eager he didnt fancy serving two masters or one master and one mistress in suckscar lie her down in a place where the sun will strike in just a few hours time after that your work will be done no said nestor your work will be done should i keep dogs and do my own barking zahar bowed as you will lord then be about it yes lord he turned to go but nestor caught his arm wait take me to her i would look upon this carmen one last time if im to destroy a thing its as well i know what im destroying and zahar took him to where carmen lay in state looking at her on the cold raised stone slab where she lay nestor felt no pity he had thought he would had remembered that once long ago hed known how to but no longer knew how to carmen was she was flesh but for all that she had lain here for more than one hundred hours where a massive window ten feet deep had been cut through solid rock to face east and the winds blew in without hindrance she was not cold flesh or she was but not the claycold of death she was the grey unwrinkled undecayed and unending flesh of undeath if you had zahar started and paused if this situation had been initiated twentyfour hours earlier lord by now she would be up and about this close to sunup her rising is delayed he fell silent i have made love to this woman nestor mused sombrely you loved her to death lord zahar reminded him and nestor made up his mind she is dead he said do with her as you have described and to carmen placing his hand upon her brow farewell whaaaat her answer rang in his mind like a cracked bell sending him staggering fareweeeellllj but im not going anywhere nestoooor im coming baaaack ahhh he cried out loud lurching like a drunkard she speaks to me but that cant be zahars jaw fell open as he took his masters arm see she still sleeps and will continue to do so until the change wakes her or until the sun finds her wanting carmen is dead until she wakes or dies the true death fool nestor ranted pointing a trembling finger at the shrouded figure on the raised slab i tell you she spoke and she knows me and oh yesss i know you now carmen told him inside his head you are nestor of the wamphyri my wouldbe muuurderer no wouldbe about it take her nestor gasped as he was sent staggering yet again take her now to the barrier mountains you do it you zahar do it now and make sure its done well and zahar did it that was how it had started and in his fevered dreams where he lay in a dark damp cave under the bank of a sunside river nestor shuddered as he often shuddered in his sleep proof perhaps that something of the old nestor lingered on deep inside or perhaps not perhaps he shuddered simply in recognition of his own monstrousness whichever for a while after that he dreamed no more and slowly so laboriously slowly his metamorphc vampire flesh worked to heal his wounds while beyond the low mouth of the cave the river water sparkled and sunsides dawn grew to a full day part three the opposition i perchorsk it had been snowing heavily in moscow when the disklike british airways vtol hawk stooped down through its landing window and ben trask lan goodly and one hundred and ten other businessmen disembarked turkur tzonov himself had met them off the plane bypassing customs hed seen his guests out of the airport and into a brand new moscowbuilt fordvolga premier their transport to a small military airport ten kilometres cut of the city from there theyd travelled by jetcopter all the way with a fuelling stop in kirov before the streamlined wasp of an aircraft turned onto a more nearly northerly heading over berezniki and set out to parallel the snowcapped urals for a further two hundred miles in all the journey from london to perchorsk had taken two hours fiftyfive minutes and it was pm local time as the aircraft switched back to hovermode sidestepped between gloomy peaks under lowering clouds and gentled down into the dull grey perchorsk ravine back in moscow at the airports and between them tzonov had been a courteous efficient escort full of mainly solicitous inquiries about the weather in london the physical wellbeing of his guests following their flight from england the quality of service inflight and so on the head of soviet espionage had made an energetic but paradoxically empty or at best ephemeral host ephemeral because his comments and questions were mainly meaningless and empty because he studiously avoided mentioning the real reason why trask and goodly were here trask believed he knew why when tzonov required to know anything really important he would probably pick it right out of their minds at least he would expect to be able to do so but in any case he wouldnt attempt it until after theyd seen perchorsks prisoner it would be pointless to try to discover their opinions before theyd had sufficient time to form them which meant that for the time being the russian would continue in his guise of companionably disarming escort and guide nevertheless they deliberately avoided thinking about harry keogh this required an effort of mental vigilance which would not be easy to maintain over a protracted period of time but short term it wasnt too difficult there was in any case more than sufficient to focus their minds upon without concerning themselves with any conjectural connection between perchorsks alien intruder and a man who had been dead for all of sixteen years from moscow to perchorsk tzonov had been mainly silent having explained how his work had kept him busy the previous night right through until the early hours immediately after takeoff hed stretched out his legs reclined in his seat and fallen asleep apparently thus his guests the only other passengers aboard the small shortrange military reconnaissance aircraft had been left to their own devices for trask this was no problem following tzonovs example he slept for an hour leaving the precog goodly awake to read what he dared of their immediate future while up front in the bubble cockpit the pilot and copilot in their dowdy illfitting army aviator jump suits would glance back every now and then nodding at goodly and smiling blank ostensibly affable smiles but now as the jetcopter descended into the perchorsk ravine and goodly shook trask awake so turkur tzonov stirred and a few seconds later sat up without so much as a yawn and all three stared out through clear wraparound flexon panels in the cabins walls and floor down into the depths of the gorge and watched its slategrey scarps and crags floating up around them towards the fading light of the bitter cold urals night while down below there were lights in the pass a helicopter landing zone was marked by a circle of yellow strobes rotating clockwise on the concrete plateau of a dams wide wall searchlights illuminated the choppers vertical descent their glare mirrored in a weaving silver lattice on the surface of an otherwise leaden lake all of which was reflected from icesheathed rock scarps and made scintillant in the refraction of freezing spray from the shining arcs of four huge spouts of water erupting from conduits in the lower dam wall shading their eyes trask and goodly glanced at each other and thought much the same thought that there were far too many lights a veritable dazzle of them perhaps someone had decided that they shouldnt see too much a futile exercise in camouflage at best american spysats had had the perchorsk ravine mapped out in fine detail for close on twenty years now impossible to hide something as big as this from electronic eyesinthesky capable of reading headline newsprint from orbits a hundred miles up and in any case what was there to hide nothing not any longer or if tions but one which the russians had well under control didnt they it had always been assumed that they did until now a defensive system which had backfired from day one the perchorsk projekt had been intended as the ussrs answer to americas sdi or star wars scenario the object was to create an impenetrable dome of destructive energy twenty miles high in the sky which would kill off any and all incoming enemy missiles an umbrella so that no one in the whole wide world could ever again threaten to rain on mother russias parade as soon as it had proved itself in an exhaustive series of tests a device such as this would on its own elevate the ussr to an unassailable position as the planets number one superpower that was what perchorsk had been all about until its epic failure had jeopardized not only the ussr but the entire human race as trask came more fully awake he started to think back more clearly on what he knew of the whole can of worms the russians had built and tested the projekt tested it just the once and disastrously back in the early eighties but despite their best efforts at technological camouflaging the results of that test were seen and recorded not only by american spy satellites but also by friendly forces on the ground and when all of the reports had been processed at the time and while no one had known exactly what was going on down there in the guts of the perchorsk ravine still it had been sufficient to kickstart the usas space defense initiative into real being and in small powerful very secretive circles throughout the western world there had taken place a good many worried discussions about such things as apb powered lasers even aooui a tneorencai iviagma muiui which might tap the gravitational energies at earths core finally the firsthand report of a western sympathizer had come leaking out of one of the logging camps east of perchorsk trask had been privy to the contents of the document and remembered them to this day not the work of an educated man indeed that of a peasant in forced exile a relocated exukrainian dissident still the wording had been vivid and evocative it had been a bright clear night with the shimmer of aurora boreajis like a pale shifting curtain in the northern sky the observer a lumberjack out hunting near the mountain pass had been aware as always of the distant hum of giant turbines transmitted through the earth from the projekt some four kilometres away but as the whine of the engines had wound itself up the man had stopped and looked back through the evergreens to see the rim of the perchorsk ravine bathed in a wash of flickering light like pale foxfire suddenly it had seemed that the night held its breath only to expel it in a great gasp or sigh and as the whining of the turbines had climbed higher yet a beam of pure white light had shot up from the ravine turning night to day as it bounded into the sky a pulse of light which lasted just long enough to leave its afterimage burning on the eyeballs and then was gone and in its wake a bright clear night until then but as the weird white searchlight had blinked into and out of being and perchorsks turbines fell abruptly silent so a hot wind had blown down from the crags and within the hour clouds had boiled up out of nowhere to rain a strange warm rain then as if intensified by the rain a smell of burning an acrid electrical burning like ozone maybe had seemed to permeate the damp night air but before that indeed within minutes of the flash of light itself there had been the sirens perchorsks sirens like the voice of the ravine wailing its agonies but in fact they were the agonies of men there had been an accident a big one and for the next fortnight helicopters shuttling in and out ambulances in the mountain passes and men in radiation suits decontaminating the walls of the ravine and the one whisper that got out as local soviet authorities moved to shut down certain fifth column elements in the logging camps was this blowback the perchorsk experiment had discharged itself into the sky all right but at the same time it had backfired into the underground complex that housed it and like some fantastic freewheeling incinerator melting men and machinery alike it had almost blown the lid off the place before burning itself out after that trask remembered several things which the soviets had not been able to cover up like the apparent mass migration of many of their topflight doctors mainly radiation specialists from moscow omsk and sverdlovsk into the understaffed and illequipped frontier hospitals in beresovo ukhta and izhma no one had experienced much difficulty figuring out what that was all about as well as all of the dead they must have taken a good many badly injured men out of the ravine since when the experiment if not perchorsk itself had been abandoned and so there had been only the one test firing but one too many the damage it caused had been permanent and turkur tzonov was correct to liken perchorsk to the chernobyl sarcophagus trask would go even further in his mind both places had much in common with pandoras box they each harboured plagues which in their diverse ways might oh so easily have endangered and even doomed the entire world and one of them perchorsk itself might do so even now the jetcopters passengers sensed rather than felt its landing as the aircraft gentled to a touchdown on the dam wall just as surely trasks thoughts also came back to earth looking out through windows already blurred by a thin sheath of ice formed from the mist of the dams cascade he made out a figure in a white parka waiting in the safety margin beyond the lethal glimmer of the fan then the highpitched whining of the rotors wound down to a reassuring whup whup whup and the copilot came hunchshouldered from the cockpit to let down a curving side panel into preformed steps signalling that they should watch their heads tzonov ushered trask and goodly down onto a rubberclad surface and guided them through the rotors bluster towards the figure in the parka a statuesque platinum blonde whose looks were classically scandinavian smiling a welcome she handed parkas to the british espers and helped them shrug into them then turning to the head of soviet ebranch she hugged him covered his shoulders with a wing of her own hugely oversized parka and hurried him towards an open jeep where a driver sat waiting smiling blandly pampered and proud of it tzonov offered no slightest resistance to any of this trask and goodly exchanged covert glances and the latter raised a querying even wistful eyebrow which trask answered with a shrug there was nothing for it but to follow on behind tzonov and his lady trask took the seat alongside the driver which left his precog colleague to cram himself into the back of the vehicle with tzonov and the girl where they huddled like lovers quite obviously they were lovers introductions would be out of the question over the throb of the jetcopters engine the stuttering cough of its idling rotors and the clatter of the jeeps exhaust tzonov didnt even attempt it but confined himself to hugging the girl and whispering something in her ear her answering laughter was whipped away by turbulence from the rotors as the jeep turned right off the dam wall onto a road dynamited from the face of the ravine a hundred and fifty yards up the precipitous road the driver brought his vehicle to a halt on a level hardstanding and leaned on his horn until massive motorized steeljawed doors under a frowning overhang rumbled open it was the way into perchorsk the throat of the subterranean complex and as a swath of light blazed out and the jeep drove through it into a brightly illuminated interior so the jaws closed again shutting out the gaunt ravine from view finally the jeeps motor was switched off and its row faded to an almost painful silence at last trask and goodly could hear themselves think and now they must guard against others hearing them think as they climbed out of the jeep tzonov said welcome to the perchorsk projekt or rather to the system of passageways and caverns which once housed it for now of course the projekt exists in name only and the complex houses something else entirely from the jetcopter to this place these outer environs of the perchorsk complex had taken no more than a minute and a half maximum but trask was glad of his parka likewise lan goodly in such a short time the bitter cold of the ravine had seemed to eat right into his bones both men rubbed their hands briskly and trask turned to the girl we really ought to thank you for these excellent garments miss er dam she held out her hand and grinned mischievously no not a swearword just my name sigrid dam or siggi to my friends like tzonovs her accent was scarcely noticeable what there was of it wasnt russian but trask believed hed detected what a swedish lilt or danish possibly the surname was danish certainly ben trask he smiled and this is my colleague lan goodly im sure well enjoy being your friends as she shook hands with the gaunt gloomyseeming precog turkur tzonov snapped his fingers exchanged concerned glances with all three and exclaimed ah unforgivable what must you think of me to forget the introductions but there was no opportunity you must forgive me my dear and turning more fully to his guests siggi is my constant companion a mutually stimulating friendship im sure trask said and tried desperately to keep his thoughts to himself but with a girl like this it was difficult not to envy his russian counterpart sigrid dam was thirtyish taller than average and slim and athletic under that parka the garment seemed cut for a giant and covered her like a poncho halfway down her thighs yet still looked stylish on siggi but then she would probably have the same effect on a potato sack from the bottom of the parka down her long tapering legs were clad in shimmering black skipants while beneath it she wore a matching black top the wide bottoms of the pants formed bells over furlined calfboots under expressive blonde eyebrows siggis eyes were the deep blue of summer fjords her mouth was perfectly shaped if a little cold her nose was just a fraction tiptilted hinting at a strong even aggressive personality all in all and while her skin was marginally paler than tzonovs the general impression which trask received was much the same one of radiant good health and yet the picture was marred something didnt add up something about her eyes maybe trask thought he knew what it was but would wait and see what developed and meanwhile he wondered about siggis relationship with tzonov their real relationship that is he wondered if it was real in which case just seeing this woman in the company of turkur tzonov trask could easily understand their mutual attraction in a world full of mainly mundane unexceptional people a pair such as this would naturally gravitate together why they might easily be the leading roleplayers in a hollywood epic from trasks youth people too rare or beautiful to even exist except among their contemporaries in a surreal celluloid world apart trask caught her looking at him what appreciatively at which moment she blinked and said anyway its turkur you must thank for the parkas they were his idea your overcoats may be just the thing in london but were fifteen to twenty degrees colder here goodly turned to tzonov and in his somewhat fluting voice said its all very considerate of you you seem to have taken our welfare so much into account and all so far in advance there was something in his wording which caused trask to glance at him but tzonov merely grinned ah yes of course your penchant for the future mr goodly er lan and then to his woman by way of explanation lan is a precog siggi she clapped her hands but in that case perhaps you had foreseen the provision of the parkas goodly shook his head shrugged apologetically far too specific he said anyway turkur was enjoying this i didnt arrange for the parkas until twenty minutes before we landed and trask thought oh when you were supposed to be sjeeping hed known of course that tzonov wasnt asleep but if not asleep what then merely resting or had he been talking to siggi dam now trask saw how everything fitted like the pale purple in the orbits of siggis eyes which betrayed her telepathy but only to someone who knew his business to most other men that slightly bruised look would only serve to complement her sensuality might even be mistaken for a symptom of her dissipation lingering over after the excesses of a long night once again he was aware of her sharp glance but this time she was frowning goodly offered a rare if somewhat tortured smile and so siggis a powerful telepath i thought so but such beauty and talent combined it hardly seems fair i suppose i should have foreseen it he looked at tzonov that you two would be a perfect match birds of a feather tzonov answered his smile arent we all and to siggi before anyone could say anything else my dear will you see our guests to their rooms it wont be the ritz im afraid but as siggi pointed out this isnt london an hour or so on your own time enough to clean up and rest a while after your journey and then ill collect you for a tour of the place trask nodded during which will we get to see your visitor certainly tzonov answered and a lot more than that into the bargain this is a fascinating place ben with a fascinating history but with all the good will and the gjasnost in the world its not the sort of place you get to see every day a few minutes later in the privacy of their rooms a pair of steelwalled interconnected cells more like trask and goodly conversed in lowered tones despite that in accommodation this austere it was difficult to see where bugs could be hidden goodly had already checked his own room using a tiny detector which doubled as a pocket calculator hed satisfied himself that the place was clean then hed gone through into trasks what compartment to sit on his lumpy army bed and watch the other wetshaving over a dented aluminium washhand basin as they talked their glances met in the mirror over the basin seeing the detector trask had just this moment pulled a wry face and given his head a shake sending bubbles of shaving foam flying thats not necessary he said id know it if something was other than it appears to be its all as you see it cheap and nasty but clean as can be the same goes for our hosts too theyre squeaky clean so far goodly raised an eyebrow you find no fault with their behaviour trask tidied up his short grey sideburns not really do you ask yourself this what welcome would we have given tzonov if wed known in advance that he was coming to london goodly shrugged our best men would have been on the job from square one with their science and sorcery theyd be all over him even if he was there to do us a favour goodly raised an eyebrow in which case wed let him get it done and then wed be all over him with our science and sorcery yes i agree so maybe hell be more interested in us later goodly nodded and said im sure he will and after a moment you know he wasnt sleeping in the chopper tzonov trask dried his face no hed simply chosen to withdraw turkur tzonov has a talent lan one which hes used to using but with us he cant and still expect our cooperation so in the close confines of the jetcopter he opted out backed off and chose to sleep right through the flight that way he wouldnt be tempted to look at us or look into us face to face it seems he genuinely needs our help and doesnt want to scare us off well and it isnt without precedence there was a time when the oppositions top man worked alongside ours on the bodescu affair too that was before tzonovs time goodly pointed out and it was a disaster our branches dont work well together trask put on his shirt is that what you foresee a disaster goodly looked more gaunt and morose than ever ben you know as well as anyone that im frightened of my talent most precogs are the future has an uncanny knack of doing what we expect but not how we expect it i read it sparingly and not too far ahead because well like turkur tzonovs motives its not to be trusted no i dont foresee a disaster not yet anyway but it wont be a joyride either trask studied his grave face so can we simply say that youre uneasy goodly nodded uneasy yes look at it this way my knowledge of the future springs from the past and the present with me its a sort of unconscious extrapolation where i remember whats still to come like you remember your dreams with fuzzy edges and lacking in fine detail but despite that a dream will rapidly fade if its a good one it can set you up for the rest of the day where by the same token a nightmare will only upset you and make you irritable well thats how i feel right now itchy and irritable now keep that in mind and concentrate on what we know of tzonov his psychological profile trask said musingly i know something about his physical profile we should have known about this siggi dam she wasnt in his file and so has to be a recent conquest goodly shook his head and said yes but im not talking about her im talking about tzonovs mind the way he thinks hes proud dedicated and a bad loser thats the thread that connects his past present and future its what steered him to where he is now head of russias ebranch and its what makes me itchy trask couldnt see where this was leading explain proud goodly pressed of himself of his abilities and definitely of his country despite its humpty dumpty act that it fell so badly apart the rest of us have scarcely been able to put it together again proud and dedicated to his talent his job and to the security of mother russia proud dedicated and a very poor loser who knows the entire history of his organization from gregor borowitz dragosani and the chateau bronnitsy right up to the present moment in every minute detail knows all of its triumphs and especially its tragedies and knows who to blame for most of them harry keogh goodly shook his head then changed his mind and nodded if not harry the ones he was working for he said namely us ebranch revenge he intends to use us then punish us goodly shrugged hes a true son of mother russia this turkur tzonov he cant bear it that shes the worlds sick old lady he bears a grudge against everyone who had a hand in her decline despite that the actual breakdown was no ones fault but her own and so in his own field hell do whatever he can to even up the score but not until afterwards trask said eh after hes used us and only then if he can get clean away with it youre right of course i notice it whenever he uses the word glasnost meaning openness the fact that its the one word that doesnt ring true but we know hes looking for a position in the partys demokratik politburo and so follows premier gustav turchins line but only because he has to not because hes a true believer in world unity oh turkur tzonovs no oneman resurgence of oldstyle hardline communism no but he is ambitious and youre probably right that his ambitions extend to the entire ussr or what used to be the ussr he would like to see russia out there in the race again with himself in the driving seat and hed relish the opportunity to run over a few toes and settle some old scores on his way up the main drag which to put it another way is like saying hes what a patriot goodly nodded from his point of view anyway and from ours hes dangerous goodly answered but not just yet and thats the other thing about his psychological profile the fact that only a very thin wire separates his genius from downright instability and just like a tightrope thats a wire we darent jerk about too much so for the moment while i admit im itchy im not yet sweating and when you start to sweat the precog nodded promising youll be the first to know it looking at goodly trask made no reply he knew that the precog would be right but he couldnt help wishing he didnt look so much like a mortician later tzonov guided his guests through perchorsks labyrinth of corridors and levels down towards its core which the handful of men who knew of its existence had christened the gate you probably know the background to all of this as well as i do he said i was a mere youth at the time an avid student of espionage at the moscow academy i knew nothing of all this my forte was metaphysics not physics anyway when they tested their device it backfired and the energy it released was unbelievable in the immediate vicinity of the pile matter flowed like water and radiating outwards from it im told there were three kinds of heat nuclear radiation though not as much as one might expect then the physical heat of combustion and finally an alien heat which warped melted and fused things together but without burning tzonov paused to open a doorsized hatch in a steel bulkhead ushered trask and goodly through and followed on behind as for the radioactivity he continued on the other side it has been cleared up now a very few hotspots remain but dont worry we shall of course avoid them there are several places we cannot avoid however which define various zones of contamination the areas in which those common and alien heat energies which i mentioned expended themselves this corridor is an example of common heat the sort that burns beyond the bulkhead door the corridor reached out ahead wound to the left and receded from sight strip lighting in the ceiling loaned everything a bluetinged sheen and flicker humming electrically where sections of old neon tube were starting to short out despite the absence of tracks platform benches still trask found the place strangely reminiscent of a certain neglected london tube station in the wee small hours one which he must have used frequently fifteen years ago before they were all refitted but couldnt name or bring to mind now except as an echo of this place but there was one other big difference between some nameless underground station of the early nineties and this place evidence of that terrific physical heat which tzonov had mentioned sufficient to blacken and even partially melt the rough rock of the ceiling until it had run down like lava to solidify on the cooler metal of wall panels and bulky steel stanchions underfoot rubber floor tiles had burned through to naked steel plates which themselves were buckled right out of alignment while in the walls veins and drips and splashes of red fused copper were all that remained of ancient wiring leading the way tzonov nodded curtly to a group of labsmocked scientists where they leaned against a pockmarked wall and compared notes they still study this place as avidly should i perhaps say as morbidly as ever he wryly commented when the scientists had been left behind they measure examine photograph and sample without ever reaching any positive conclusion other than the one viktor luchov reached all those years ago that when the blowback occurred the pile ate itself and mundane matter bent inwards and outwards and even backwards in spacetime until it warped through the wall of this universe and created the gate tzonov glanced at his guests and quickly added oh dont worry im not going to give too much away what why our best physicists have been working at it for twenty years and getting nowhere so dont take it as an insult if i doubt that you two will discover the secrets of the universe in a few short hours days or even weeks anyway your agent michael j simmons was here that time and the necroscope harry keogh too before you chased him out of this world surely one or both of them have already filled in most of the blank spots for you trask shook his head harry was never able to stay here too long he said looking the russian straight in the eye and even he had to admit that the math was too much for him the gate was an accident when the universe suffered a power surge and its computer crashed that was how he explained it anyway as for jazz simmons he never returned to england and lives in the greek islands still in those days our department of dirty tricks pulled a fast one on him hes never forgiven us and i for one dont blame him the same must be said for zek foener but in her case it was your people who gave her the runaround tzonov shrugged trask had given him the opportunity to read his mind and he hadnt wasted it every word the british esper had spoken had been the truth as he saw it well times change the russian said and by way of changing the subject so actually this is all quite new to you most of it trask told him the sight and feel of it certainly a picture is better than a hundred words the physical reality is better than a blueprint oh tzonov raised a thin eyebrow as he came to a halt at the head of a flight of aluminium stairs which from their bright sheen were a recent fitment its better to see something than to have an accurate description well i take your meaning of course and normally would agree with you except there are things here which were better sight unseen they lie in an area that suffered the other sort of heat which may only be experienced in the melting pot of spacetime if it were my choice i would not show such things to you but since they lie between us and the gate he shrugged again and led the way down the stairs im told that viktor luchov called these the magmass levels magmass lan goodly was trembling slightly where he followed on after the others on uncertain legs descending into a dimly lit region between levels proper trask sensed the tremor in his colleagues voice and guessed it was his talent working well tzonov had tried to warn them and yes the russian answered but very quietly now as he came to a halt and quite unnecessarily he pointed magmass now you can have the sight and feel of it and perhaps you will even feel something of what it must have been like when perchorsk was gutted like a softbellied fish trask and goodly looked and knew that they had entered a region of sheerest fantasy they stared into the dim recesses of a weird chaos a vastly disordered cavern or vault where the lighting was deliberately subdued so as to hide the most monstrous effects for certainly what little could be seen was frightening or disconcerting to say the least it was as if the stairs had carried them out of this universe into a place where human laws no longer applied where geometry and substance and science itself had failed and the magmass had taken over tzonov was on the move again and drawn in his footsteps the british espers followed silent where they gazed on these creations of drugged hallucination and madness down through a tangle of warped plastic fused stone and blistered metal they passed where on both sides amazingly consistent smoothbored tunnels some two or three feet in diameter wound and twisted like the wormholes of ocean parasites in rotting coral except they drove through solid rock crumpled girders and other far less recognizable debris or residua and trask thought its like an alien alchemy some titan force tried to make everything one here or change it all to a new unreality looking at him tzonov nodded yes he said to change it or deform it beyond all recognition its not so much that the various materials have been fused by heat and fire rather that theyve been folded in like a mass of dough or plasticine in the hands of a vast mad child but this is only a small part of it and i certainly wont show you the worst no for metal and plastic and rock were not the only materials which suffered this awful magmass change but at least they are not what biodegradable i am sure you take my meaning goodly shuddered what a horror he said tzonov agreed the more accessible areas were cleansed with hard acids while other places were simply sealed off a good many of the magmass moulds simply dont bear scrutiny the stairs had descended to a bed of magmass levelling into a catwalk along a vertical wall of unbroken rock like the face of a cliff seen over the aluminium handrails and through the metal lattice of the walkway the floor was chaotically humped and anomalous where different materials were so mixed as to have no individual identity whatsoever and looping the loop twisting and twining through all the warped congealed mass of this earthly yet hideously immundane material there ran those weird wormhole energy channels which had carried the flux of a nightmarish nuclear cancer through the heart of perchorsk reducing it to this looking at it he began to feel nauseous and was sure that goodly must feel the same until suddenly looming on the left of the walkway and bringing a sense of renewed reality a perfectly circular opening appeared in the face of the wall of warped rock here the catwalk turned left into the mouth of the shaft widened out to become a rubbercoated stairway then continued its descent towards a region of eerie illumination down below the core tzonov informed his guests tonelessly as a group of armed uniformed soldiers came clattering up through the shaft heading in the opposite direction the hole or cavern which was eaten out of the solid rock when the atomic pile imploded and formed the gate a most unnatural cavern as you will see the guard has just now been changed and these soldiers released from duty ah but see how eager they are the core is not a pleasant place and even though the gate is now secure made safe to the very best of our ability still we guard it one can never tell at the lower end of the shaft there was a railed landing this time of steel and supported on steel stanchions flanked by trask and goodly tzonov went to the rail and leaned on it staring grimly at the scene below he had called this place a cavern of sorts but a most unnatural one now the british espers could see why it was like being in a cavern but there was no way one might mistake it for any ordinary sort of cave the solid rock had been hollowed out in the shape of a perfect sphere a giant bubble in the very roots of the ural mountains but a bubble well over a hundred and twenty feet in diameter the curving shinyblack wall all around was glasssmooth except for the wormholes which riddled it everywhere even in the domed ceiling where the three men were standing the mouth of the shaft pointed downwards at fortyfive degrees directly at the centre of the space the core itself which was occupied by what looked like a huge steel ball supported on a tripod of massive hydraulic rams the ball would have to be a little more than thirty feet in diameter inside it the gate tzonov explained we cased it in carbon steel a foot thick welded together in three sections the rams support the sections and can apply massive pressure to keep them welded together if it were ever necessary but within the shell the gate supports itself floating there dead centre right where it was born on the night of the accident when the test was aborted trask looked at him in the painful bluewhite glare of faulty strip lighting and thats where youve trapped your visitor in there inside the gate obviously no way we can let him through until we know what were dealing with i think its time we saw him trask said how long has he been here four days tzonov told him after premier turchin himself was informed i was the first to know of his arrival ordered here from moscow i saw assessed contacted you you know the rest youll understand of course that the complex isnt my ordinary place of work until now my interest in perchorsk has been purely academic when one considers the esoteric aspect of this latest incident obviously i was the right man for the job goodly seemed puzzled but four days in there he must be starving tzonov looked at him reprovingly do you think were all barbarians then he has been fed of course indeed it was an opportunity we really couldnt afford to miss to find out what he eats oh yes for other creatures have come through the gate before this one lan whose appetites were well suspect to say the least without another word he led the way down steel steps to a perimeter walkway and out over a wide gantry catwalk to the enigmatic shining ball of carbon steel ii the visitor and a visit around the steel sphere encircling it like an inner ring of saturn but so close as to almost touch the ball itself the railed catwalk was maybe ten feet wide it was equipped with consoles computers viewscreens a handful of scientists and technicians were seated at a master console others moved around the cores catwalk carefully measuring and examining concentrating on their various instruments and tasks crossing the gantry trask had absorbed all he could of the socalled cavern there were no soldiers in attendance at the core itself but a trio of emplacements on the perimeter under the inward curving walls were manned and equipped with high velocity cannons and the battery directly opposite the master console was further equipped with a small tracked vehicle bearing a dull metal container and the obscene squatnozzled hoses of what could only be a flamethrower unit well read in what few documents were available concerning the perchorsk gate trask knew enough to appreciate the significance of all of these precautions likewise he understood the meaning of a trio of scaffolding towers which reached up from the curving floor higher than the gantry consoles and central sphere itself to where a triangular framework suspended from the ceiling joined them up and strengthened the structure central in this metal web a nest of carboys was connected to a sprinkler system whose outlets were aimed down onto the inner walkway and gantry should the system be activated a hard acid rain would drench this entire area so much for scientists consoles and catwalk draconian but effective the system left no room for speculation about the inimical nature of what these people might be called upon to deal with down here and everywhere trask looked the claustrophobic wall of the bubble cavern formed a shinyblack backdrop glasssmooth except for the wormholes riddling it through all its quarters in the upward curving floor encircling walls and domed ceiling alike that dull black glitter of allenclosing seemingly endless surface alive with its myriad firefly reflections of the inadequate lighting system like standing in the heart of some strange dark crystal as for what turkur tzonov had said that the core was not a pleasant place well that had to be the understatement of the century trask knew that if he were a russian soldier hed consider perchorsk a punishment posting as the three men approached the master console so one of the seated scientists turned saw them and gave a small involuntary start he reached out and flipped a switch viewscreens dissolved at once into white static and dazzling oscillations quiet conversations tailed into silence all heads turned and cold stares greeted the newcomers tzonov smiling thinly told trask and goodly as you see they dont even trust me yet let alone you two they consider me muscle like the kgb and here in the united soviet states we dont yet have your own degree of cooperation between mind and muscle also they are scientists while we are mere metaphysicians fakirs in whom they have no great faith fortunately we know that we are more truly mind than they could ever give us credit for and in any case no one here may gainsay me his smile went out like a light turned off as he snapped some order in russian at the console controller the man sat there staring at him for a moment but tzonovs authority and his eyes had already won the battle of wills the scientists lips twitched a little in the lefthand corner as he switched the screens on again and our visitor said tzonov it was sudden but the british espers had been expecting something like it and were able to cover their astonishment at first the white dazzle a backdrop of pure white a veritable snowfield got in the way but as their eyes adjusted to the blaze and focused on the man on the screens they saw that he was harry keogh or alec kyle or both of them he was the necroscope or a twentyyearold version of him anyway harry junior trask and goodly could scarcely be blamed for thinking the selfsame thought which they kept to themselves as best they could as it happened they were right in one sense and totally wrong in another but out of the corner of his eye trask saw turkur tzonovs satisfied nod and wondered if the telepath had zoomed in on them tzonov didnt keep him in suspense i think so too he said an indicator that trask could stop trying to conceal his suspicions and give his full attention to the scene in the scanners he did so goodly on the other hand chose to hide his thoughts and feelings behind a screen of questions closed circuit tv you have cameras on the inside how observant tzonov let his sarcasm drip hed seen through the precogs ploy at once yes of course miniature cameras trained on the area immediately behind the steel section the metal is ten inches thick armoured on the inside what you see on the screen there is no more than four or five feet from where youre standing if you hammered on the panel you could give him a headache despite that goodly knew hed been rumbled he clung to his pretext how do you feed him tzonov pointed you see that groove in the metal not merely a groove but a hatch a door hermetically sealed and magnetically locked down at the bottom there that circular mark is an even smaller door through which we pass food of course we dont do it while hes awake but when hes sleeping and now that hes satisfied to eat what we give him we could just as easily poison him or we might pump lethal gas in there or squirt acid at him we might do so even now if we cant satisfy ourselves that hes just a man during which conversation trask had taken the opportunity to satisfy himself that first impressions must be correct this was harry keogh junior the son of the necroscope who as an infant had spirited his ailing mother away into an alien dimension he looked maybe ten years younger than he should but there again hed come to manhood in a different world still the discrepancy was such as to cause trask to frown he felt that he wasnt seeing the whole picture as for what he was seeing the man in the viewscreen was seated crosslegged on what was barely discernible as a white floor it seemed no different to the rest of his surroundings except his thighs and backside flattened out when pressed against it and the rest of his surroundings were white there was little more to say of that tunnel between worlds it was a glaring white expanse joining up our universe to some other it was the gate again trask examined the visitor and discovered another anomaly however small alec kyles hair had been brown and plentiful naturally wavy this ones hair was blond and shining like damp straw with grey streaks to both sides which gave him a look of intelligence or erudition well in advance of his years and his hair was long falling to his shoulders giving him something of the appearance of a viking moreover his eyes were of a sapphire blue where kyle keoghs had been as brown as his hair trask was certain that genetically this was alec kyles son but at the same time he seemed to have inherited his what spiritual fathers colours as for the rest of his features there could be no denying that this was the son of the necroscope as if the visitor had suddenly heard or sensed something he thrust himself upright until his sandalled feet flattened to the white floor and looked directly into the eye of a scanner all of which was performed in a dreary slowmotion which must be an effect of the gate a technician adjusted the picture until the whole man was revealed his eyes narrowed and brow furrowed where he stood with his gaze slightly elevated into the camera trask couldnt gauge his height but suspected hed be a sixfooter he had an athletes body broad shoulders narrow waist powerful arms and legs his eyes might be very slightly slanted or it could simply be a result of his currently suspicious frowning expression his nose was straight and seemed small under a broad forehead flanked by high cheekbones over a square chin which jutted a little his mouth was full and tended to slant downwards a fraction to the left in others this might suggest a certain cynicism but not in him rather the opposite there was an air of patience inevitability even of vulnerability about him beyond that of a creature trapped in an unknown unknowable environment now that he relaxed a little his expression changing eyes opening wider and frown melting away trask saw something else which could only be revenant of harry a natural innocence and compassion the soulfulness of the mind behind the face so that without being keoghs spitting image still the visitor felt like him and as that fact dawned trask knew that it wasnt so much what hed seen when first he looked at this one rather what hed experienced inside that made him sure of his identity gut feelings on the one hand supported by trasks weird talent on the other which could not be confused or mistaken this was the necroscopes son so why was it he wondered that something continued to bother him as for the visitors clothes he was clad in a fringed jacket with a high collar and wide lapels and in trousers which were tight at the knee and flared at the calves to fit snug over soft leather boots the outfit was almost wild west in cut yet flowing and gypsyish at the same time and its material was a finely patterned skin or leather like alligator hide soft sandcoloured flexible it looked comfortable if a little worn and dusty then trask noticed the earring in his left ear a queer twist of yellow metal only an inch long and presumably gold but if trask had been frowning before now the lines deepened on his brow he knew the significance of that odd shape knew what it was the mobius strip the metaphysical symbol which had been harry keoghs passport to another world it was the final piece in the puzzle which validated all the rest and caused them to click into place trask put it to the back of his mind at r once something else to be hidden in the hypnotic abyss behind his eyes and that in a nutshell was the visitor overall there was nothing in his clothing manner or appearance in general to suggest the haughty aggressive arrogance physical superiority and awesome metamorphic arts of the wamphyri so that despite trasks other perhaps ulterior political motives he knew that his prime purpose in being here the validation of the visitor as a man and only a man had been justified off tzonovs voice cut into his thoughts causing trask to start as the screens blinked into a grey opacity he turned to the russian and answered his gaze and was at once aware of its bite now the telepath would read his or goodlys mind if he could like the colours of a chameleon his eyes changed until their grey so diluted itself as to drain them of colour while yet their pupils seemed to enlarge to magnifying lenses which on another occasion might look right into trasks mind but not this time for as the russians gaze fastened on his eyes so something deep in trasks brain snapped into action and channelled the others telepathy down an empty tunnel tzonov knew it in a moment without knowing how it was done that trask was impervious or perhaps not impervious his mind was accessible but blank and goodlys pale smile told him the same thing that his mind too had been secured hypnotism the russian finally grunted his bottom jaw falling open and seeing trasks expression he knew that hed guessed correctly youve been hypnotized if i so much as look at you your minds switch off he clapped a hand to his forehead and ground his teeth then grew calm in a moment and actually forced a smile until he became aware of the cores scientists worriedly staring at him you may get back to your work he told them turning on his heel and starting unsteadily back along the gantry trask and goodly looked at each other then followed on behind tzonov paused and waited for them at the bottom of the ramp through the entrance tunnel as they came up the steps he said all very clever but it wasnt part of our deal i have held to my part he was in control again but cold as a midwinter siberian blizzard trask said and well hold to ours but it wasnt part of the deal to have you in our minds did you ever consider simply asking tzonov pursed his lips at times at times im almost given to believe that my telepathy isnt just a tool sometimes i feel that i am the tool and my talent the master and i have to admit its hard to own or be owned by such a talent without using it if i was presumptuous then im sorry its just that it seemed the easiest way thats all and trask knew that he was telling the truth the russian saw it in his face relaxed nodded and said very well im asking is he what he seems to be just a man the son of harry keogh or is he an imitation a spy decoy or invader from another world and something we should destroy without delay hes a man trask answered at once but he was careful to leave tzonovs just out of his reply and i believe hes harrys son yes tzonov sighed i read as much in your minds almost without trying he said yet when i tried goodly spoke up saying that was your mistake turkur we cant be forced we can offer up the information voluntarily or else be taken by surprise tricked eavesdropped but face to face the moment your f eyes lock on posthypnotic commands take over we shut up shop and our minds go blank telling him didnt hurt tzonov would work it out for himself quickly enough ah he said smiling his thin smile which fell away at once but it will be difficult to work together in circumstances such as these he began to turn away but trask said under your rules it would be impossible our minds are our own turkur the russian looked at him but you have the advantage he said an edge of frustration in his voice if i lie if what i say is not the precise truth youll know it immediately then try not to lie trask answered starting up the tunnel towards the magmass levels it shouldnt be too hard after all youve been doing all right so far on their way back to quarters trask said i think its time you answered a few questions turkur for example since you are able to look at your visitor any time you want to face to face on screen why havent you read his mind why did you need me to tell you about him the truth of him tzonov shrugged perhaps youve answered your own question perhaps he too has been hypnotized believe me i would love to read his mind but cant it could be interference from the spheres skin its event horizon which lies between the visitor and the wall of his steel cell maybe its related to the slowmotion effect which you observed when he stood up i dont know but whichever his mind is likewise a blank wall to me just like your own perhaps when we bring him through to this side things will be different we must wait and see that was my next question trask said when will you bring him through tzonov knew he couldnt lie and so replied with an ambiguous soon then as trask and goodly reached their door he looked at them and said siggi of course will find no great difficulty in reading your minds her talent does not rely on eye to eye contact but only if we should relax our guard goodly told him i mean if she catches us with our pants down which wouldnt be cricket now would it tzonov laughed our great cultural difference cricket the rules of the game the fact that you have them and we do not also that we have ladies goodly answered while you have only comrades and as tzonovs smile turned sour the british espers passed through into their adjoining rooms and closed the door on him later the four ate together in perchorsks mess hall where a socalled executive dining area had been screened off for the use of officers and scientists to separate them from the common soldiers as the hour was late they were in any case alone the heating of the hall was only just adequate but siggi dam seemed perfectly comfortable despite that her dress was almost mediterranean a fact which trask and goodly couldnt help but notice after tzonov had helped her out of her coat following which they studiously avoided paying her too much attention she wore a short tight figurehugging skirt in combination with a fashionable wideshouldered bolero waistcoat held together by a single button over a chiffon blouse open to the waist her cleavage was all too evident and the dark stains of her nipples were like patterns on the pale blue chiffon if it was her intention to distract it certainly worked the espers tried not to be too gauche but found themselves making a point of talking face to face with tzonov which kept their hypnotic implants primed and in a little while trask sensed that siggi was no longer trying to read them but to be absolutely sure he smiled at her and said in a place as unnaturally cold and unfriendly as this im sure your presence must raise the temperature by several degrees at least while this was a genuine compliment his very deliberate afterthought was anything but god what i wouldnt give to fuck your face then still smiling he waited with numbed nerves for her slap but instead she returned his smile inclined her head and said why thank you ben other conversation was sparse during the meal which like the accommodation wasnt exactly the ritz for all that trask suspected that some poor soviet citizens army cook had made a special effort here you could cut the meat despite its cryptic origin and instead of the dubiously debugged bottled spring water to be found in most russian cities these days the cocacola was fresh cool sparkling the quality of our food tzonov commented almost disinterestedly continues to improve with the ecology all thanks due to the west trask thought but to himself pointless to further damage the russians pride the fact was though that without the help of germany france great britain and the usa of course the body of the ussr would be a vast and ugly mutant thing dying of its sores as it was the most dangerous of the reactors had been closed down and mothballed the worst of the industrial pollution was now under control siberian forests and wild life were flourishing once more and even the socalled aral desert was regaining something of its old water table ask anna marie english and shed gladly detail a thousand other small miracles trask finished off only a little of his fairly tasteless pudding and goodly hardly touched his a spoonful at best the russians didnt even make that much effort but finally tzonov yawned and said im for bed tomorrow will be a busy day we should all sleep as best we can myself i find it claustrophobic down here i like to picture myself out in the open in an orchard counting the plums and sleep comes easier you might like to try it goodly looked at him ignored his advice and concentrated on the one word tomorrow behind his grey sunken features the precogs mind was likewise hollow perhaps even more than it should be and his voice felt hollow too as he asked is that when youre letting him come through the head of russian ebranch yawned again but just like the first one it was a lie trask shrugged inside and told himself it was simply tzonovs excuse to be alone with siggi who could blame him anyway but then as the cook came to take away their dishes suddenly trask was unaccustomedly sleepy and he knew in a moment why he hadnt wanted his pudding after that it was an effort to get himself and goodly back to their rooms and onto their beds before the dark flooded in and goodly never did get an answer to his question concerning the visitor about when theyd be letting him through the gate into perchorsk it made no difference for hed known the answer anyway except hed known it just ten seconds too late and so had trask now falling headlong into the great black hole of sleep they both knew it was going to be tonight within the hour as soon as they were out of the way and then they were out of the way ben trask wasnt much of a dreamer at least he didnt often remember his dreams for which he was grateful the ones that stuck were usually nightmares which came to him as a result of his job on occasion he still nightmared about yulian bodescu corrupted in his mothers womb and born into a life of necromancy and vampirism or he might dream that he was back in the greek islands up against janos ferenczy last of an infamous bloodline or he might see the necroscope again as hed seen him that time in the garden of harrys edinburgh home before hed fled into starside through the perchorsk gate and so it can be seen why trask wasnt much of a one for dreaming once the branch had employed its own oneiromancer a man who not only translated other peoples dreams but used his own to gauge his and others destinies he had worked for ebranch for three years and then stopped dreaming and a week later died of a brain tumour time and again it had been shown how the future resisted the tampering of mere men and by exactly the same degree ben trask resisted dreaming he would resist it just as stringently now if he hadnt been weakened by the drugged food but as it was he found himself drawn into the dream and trapped there by a voice but a voice with a difference with an aura an aura that reminded trask of his dreams of harry keogh at first there was only the velvet darkness of deep sleep crisscrossed by the flashes of instantly forgotten thoughts or halfformed visions transient as meteor trails in a night sky but there was nothing really visual about it then the aura was there like cigarette smoke curling in trasks mind acrid with the touch or the taint of the one whod first drawn and then exhaled it or maybe acrid wasnt the right word redolent of him perhaps a curl of smoke but intent sentient probing and as the aura of the other sensed trask and settled like a fog all about him so he felt himself brushed by the eddies of a powerful rushing force tugged and whirled in the mental currents of some weird cyclone of the mind it was a whirlwind a vortex and as it drew trask in so he saw or sensed its composition numbers a numbers vortex it was as if the continuous printout of some colossal computer had spiralled up into the air like a gigantic inverted flypaper burning away until the numbers were left to spin on their own flying free they too burned with an inner fire they glowed like neon as esoteric equations sought to resolve themselves evolving or mutating into metaphysical maths a nodding coneshaped tornado of writhing numbers snatched trask up and hurled him aloft just one more cypher in a rapidly rotating wall of agonized algebraic symbols and coruscating calculi but just as a storm has its calm eye at the centre of the tumult so the numbers vortex obscured and protected its sentient core another mind which trask felt warm against his own as soon as he touched it except it wasnt simply that he felt it but also that he felt he knew it who he said dismissing his posthypnotic mindguard and opening himself to the others probe what a friend came back the answer or one who would be your friend if you will have me and despite that the telepathic voice was warm uncertain and even a little afraid still trask shuddered in his sleep it was as if someone had walked on his grave exactly like that and for the first time in his life he fully appreciated the meaning of that old cliche for this was how it must feel to be dead and have someone talk to you a single word thought idea floated to the surface of trasks mind necroscope for a moment there was a hushed silence then and is that such a dreadful thing to be i can feel it in your voice that you think so even drugged asleep trask knew who he was talking to the only one he could possibly be talking to so that before considering or attempting to curb his reply he found himself answering but your father was a dreadful thing in the end ahhh you knew my father my real father there was hope in the voice eagerness and excitement but all fading away in a moment and i see that you feared him too just jike everyone else in this place in the end we all feared him yes trask repeated but in the beginning he was my friend and you can tell me about him something of hope had returned oh yes i know about him trask answered i know a lot about him more than most men most living men anyway which seemed to say it all ahhh again that strange sad sigh and in another moment well talk again but not now there are mentalists here they watch and listen i see you have a mindguard use it the voice faded away leaving trask to cry out after it wait wait but it was useless the numbers vortex snatched him up again and dragged him into its whirling wall buffeted this way and that in a spiral of mad maths trask was rocked shocked shaken shaken awake easy ben easy lan goodlys worried expression loomed into focus the precog sat on the edge of trasks bed gripped his arms and continued to caution him they think were still out for the count and as long as they continue to believe it we can talk lan trask grasped the others wrists stared up into his pale face i was dreaming nightmaring more like goodly retorted who were you calling after you wouldnt believe me if i told you trask struggled upright gently fingered his brow god headache that mousse or whatever it was supposed to be goodly nodded or rather what was in it he stepped through into his room ran water returned with a fizzing glass good old american knowhow eh trask drank alkaseltzer ah trask looked at him focusing a little easier now so what happened to your precognition nothing it worked fine you knew theyd mickey us trasks jaw fell but not until it was too late after the first spoonful trask tuttutted his disgust and your own faultless talent goodly raised an eyebrow trasks expression changed grew rueful much the same as yours i suppose it came too late he sighed i guessed tzonovs tiredness was a lie but what the hell obviously he wanted to be alone with siggi so i wasnt seeing or thinking straight something was yes i have to admit it distracting me but by the time i was a couple of mouthfuls into that pudding thats when you knew goodly grimaced because by then she was able to relax wed taken the poisoned bait except well we only took a little of it i expect the dose was carefully measured a full portion of that pudding would probably have put us both down for the entire night trask frowned run that by me again about siggi i mean and goodly said thats what she does and its why shes here siggi dams no ordinary telepath ben its my guess she carries as much mindsmog around with her as any of the undead you ever went up against what makes me think so simply that i cant read a damn thing of her future nothing trask stroked his chin mindsmog static she produces it to order thats my bet anyway it throws the talents of other espers out of kilter its why my advance knowledge went into reverse and your instinctive liedetector blew a fuse he nodded and managed to look more mournful yet as if she wasnt a big enough distraction already physically that is trask got up crossed to his washbasin and ran cold water splashed his face with it certainly it would explain why she isnt listed he grunted a new player we know nothing about her telepathy warns her when another esper is near and then she hides behind her mindsmog turkur tzonovs secret weapon we had too much of an edge so he shipped siggi in to blunt us down a bit i knew there was something i should ask myself the first time i saw her namely what the hells a nice girl like her doing in a dump like this keeping tzonov company maybe but shes no bimbo given that she has a mind there have to be ten thousand better places to be squinting in the rooms poor light he glanced at his wristwatch you were out for an hour and forty minutes goodly told him you still would be if i hadnt woken you up myself i was out for half an hour youre resistant i only tasted that stuff again goodlys grimace but you know the bulgarians were expert chemists all of thirty forty years ago designer drugs old hat to them and the opposition anyway i went down fighting it and kept fighting it if i hadnt my drugged sleep might well have merged into normal sleep but i knew what had happened and wanted desperately to be awake i used my mental alarm clock thats a trick of mine to wake myself up at any hour of the day or night before going to sleep i just tell myself when i want to be up which is what i did but as i was coming out of it someone entered the room so i just closed my eyes and mind and lay there whoever it was must have been satisfied after he or they left i tried to wake you but couldnt so i took a look around on my own you did what goodly shrugged why shouldnt i were not prisoners and if tzonov can play dirty tricks why shouldnt we so i went walkabout in the projekt here and there the precogs face wasnt so much gaunt as grim now and trask saw things in his eyes that worried him so what did you find i saw a lot of stuff youre not going to like ben the other told him stuff that you wont like one little bit ill nathan kiklu tell me about it trask sighed his relief as the pounding in his skull receded a little its night now up top goodly told him the very dead of night and down here except for essential duties everyone is asleep also were guests as opposed to interlopers or were supposed to be with no special orders attaching to us and anyway they think thought we were out of the picture so i wasnt interfered with as i did my rounds well not until i descended through the magmass levels to the core thats where i was picked up and escorted back here but before then ben what do we know of this place i mean in connection with harry keogh the last time he was here trask shrugged we had pretty good liaison with the reds at that time they were reds then just waking up to the fact that they were in it up to their necks harry keogh had become a vampire he carried a plague in his blood that could run rampant across the face of the earth and using this thing called the mobius continuum he could travel instantaneously from one place to another like you and i go from room to room he could be and was in the greek islands hong kong nicosia detroit macau and here in perchorsk all in the space of an hour our locators russian and chinese locators too were out of their heads trying to follow his movements trask paused but why am i telling you this you were with the branch and know it as well as i do tell it anyway goodly urged trask struggled into his jacket very well but on our way were going to see tzonov damn right trask growled and to find out what hes up to with his visitor and to himself with my visitor the one i spoke to in a dream or was it just a dream this place is a maze goodly warned how do we know where they are how will we find them wherever the action is where theyre not sleeping thats where well find them trask answered he led the way out into the corridor which was even dimmer now and yet more eerie and headed for the core but you asked me to refresh your memory on perchorsk at the time when harry went through the gate his voice fell to a whisper well we were the ones who told soviet ebranch that the necroscope would probably try it hed already used the romanian route and so was stuck with this one the russians assured us he wouldnt make it forewarned they would be waiting for him with a lot more firepower than he or anyone anything could possibly handle since we couldnt be sure exactly what that signified we were obliged to take their word for it one thing for sure though they really believed they could stop him except they didnt goodly took it up he tried to go through on a motorcycle first through the mobius continuum then through the gate with that poor vampirized girl penny riding pillion he made it but the girl was shaken loose on this side she came down on electrified steel plates under an acid rain a terrible way to go even for a vampire trask nodded eventually the russians told us what had happened they had to for they were scared to death hed come back again after what harry had done to them in earlier times the havoc hed wreaked with their ebranch they wanted to ingratiate themselves it could be they were going to need our help badly and so they told us the whole thing but they also told us about their new failsafe system my god talk about chernobyl but on the other hand who could blame them theyd had more than enough of things coming through that gate the next time anything stuck its ugly face in here they were going to blow its head off and close the gate for good but it was the way they were going to do it two nuclear warheads one timed to explode inside the gate close to the opening into the parallel world of the vampires and the other set to go off just beyond that portal on starside itself it was just typical of russian thinking at the time destroy the invader if possible wreck his lines of resupply devastate his home ground also with any luck the gate itself might be destroyed at the same time when we heard about it and after we asked our scientists what sort of side effects there might be all hell broke loose what set off a nuclear device inside a black hole or a grey one right here on earth right in the earth unthinkable we could be playing with the forces that hold the very universe in place we started negotiations but too late harry had been gone for some time by then and it seems hed been keeping busy on starside what happened here in perchorsk that fateful night no one knows for sure most of the survivors were out of it before the missiles were actually fired but the story they had to tell well it was the work of the necroscope all right it had to be him for who else could return perchorsks dead to life the two had penetrated the upper magmass levels into an area where neither of them had set foot before visible in the distorted mattermelt of walls and floor weird moulds had been scooped from metal plastic and the very rock itself as if by fire or furious acid blowtorch scorching and the discoloration of chemical reaction were apparent everywhere goodly paused his gaze hardening in the poor light with a nod of his head he directed trasks eyes to these inarticulate yet vaguely frightening shapes in the magmass and despite that trasks last words had been a statement of fact as opposed to a question proper still the precog answered them in his fashion by taking up the story again the dead woke up thats what happened the dead of perchorsk in their glass rock or metal cysts the magmass dead fused with machinery tools whatever theyd been working with rotting or mummified semimechanical things whod been melted and sealed up in the original explosion broke out dead men whose warped composite bodies might just fit the twisted shapes of these terrible magmass moulds and they fired the missiles into the open gate trask nodded his voice hushed as he answered according to the russians anyway but it could only have been harry who gave the orders he was dying on starside he even gathered us all together to watch him die that time at ebranch hq in london but his deadspeak voice bridged the gap from another world to this place and called up the dead just one more time in an attempt to close the gate that sort of dead yes he looked again at the magmass moulds then quickly looked away mercifully our scientists were wrong whatever the gate is whatever its made of it was too tough for the soviet nukes it seemed to eat them up no repercussions whatsoever we cant even be sure thatthey went off there was no blowback nothing perhaps they should have anticipated that after all the gate is a oneway ticket goodly took his arm turned this way and that said we must have missed a turning somewhere back there is something you ought to see and anyway i dont think well find tzonov and his visitor along here as they began to retrace their steps trask asked so why did you want to go over all of that again to get it straight in my head the other answered im pretty good with the future but the past sometimes eludes me and anyway you skipped the most interesting part im talking about when chingiz khuv was in charge here and sent jazz simmons through into starside the magmass was behind them now the tunnel ahead looked more than ever like some old london underground with several confusing branching passageways finally they drew level with a recess on the left containing a bulkhead door marked with a radiation hazard sign ah goodly nodded this is it trask glanced at the warning looked again and shook his head a barefaced lie to keep out the incurably curious such as you and me he said but radiation it would suffice for most people certainly and as goodly spun the wheel to free the hatch and pushed it back on squealing hinges what about when jazz went through goodly stepped into darkness turned on the lights trask followed him into a storeroom the place was like a warehouse with other rooms leading off and stacked steel shelving on every hand then trask saw what the shelves contained and goodly said ebranch didnt get much out of jazz simmons when harry junior brought him back cant say i blame him not after what intelligence and the branch had done to him we had to send a man out to zante just to speak to him but he did say that trask cut him off that chingiz khuv had been planning an invasion of starside he looked again at the shelves yes he did say that and now goodly shrugged and joined him in examining the armaments stacked on the shelves a stockpile of small and not so smallarms flamethrowers grenades automatic rifles hand guns and ammunition and what do you think he said if you cant destroy the gate trask answered first secure and defend it and then prepare to invade it who knows what you might find on the other side something to swing the balance in your favour a means of achieving your ambition to even the score and grow big in the world again but is this the russian premiers philosophy or is it just tzonovs is he trying to work this trick on his own do you think i know he was lying when he said that up until nathans arrival his interest in this place was purely academic whichever goodly said i think this visitor from starside has come through at just the right time if he hadnt we wouldnt have seen all of this which might seem to beg a further question trask added who was it who really wanted us in on this turkur tzonov or premier gustav turchin were we invited merely on the whim of the one or on the command of the boss himself so that wed be in on it and just as much to blame if it went wrong probably the latter goodly answered and tzonov has to make the best of it it would explain the lack of security we were supposed to see everything and tzonov darent hide that fact so from the technicians and scientists point of view we appear as free agents but in reality tzonovs keeping us on a leash only letting us see what he wants us to see until now trask growled lets get out of here i dont want to be found in this place and i dont want turkur tzonov to know weve seen it they left the storeroom with no time to spare a technician yawning bespectacled barely awake came into view around the curve of the corridor he must be going on night shift down in the core as they drew level trask stepped in front of him and said er turkur tzonov uh the other looked at them blinked sleep out of his eyes you looking for tzonov he nodded but not here back there er fifty steps passage on right is there but could be dangerous the intruder thanks trask smiled this is a big place we got lost the other shrugged and blinked again is no problem they went their own ways but as soon as they were out of earshot goodly whispered see what i mean there dont appear to be any guards in the place and very little of suspicion in respect of our being here earlier down at the core the scientists were more opposed to tzonovs presence than to ours i think they see him as the intruder they dont want the military or people of tzonovs dubious cloakanddagger character down here at all theyd like to study the visitor their way as scientists not his way whatever that will prove to be it was the way he said it that caused trask to glance at him you said you were picked up at the core trask said did you see anything down there enough goodly answered but darkly enough enough to make me suspect that our man isnt going to have an easy time of it i saw them bring him through his food must have been drugged too when they opened the door his arm flopped out he was unconscious they dragged him through and put him in a cage what a cage like a big birdcage yes the two turned down the indicated passage on the right followed it for fifteen or so paces then turned right again and found themselves outside another steel door but this time it was guarded a young soldier leaned against the wall with a rifle over his shoulder when the espers came into view he stood up and adopted a sloppy position of attention but as trask approached the door he stepped in his way no go he said we were invited trask told him face to face we have to see turkur tzonov the soldier frowned scratched his chin and said no but without malice goodly had stepped to one side of the uniformed man and now made to pass around him but as the soldier moved to intercept him so the door opened tzonov stepped into view and the orbits of his eyes were that much deeper darker no need to inquire what he had been doing or trying to do he saw them at once but his face showed little or no evidence of surprise ah ben lan he said i was going to send for you but it seems youve beaten me to it i hope you have some answers turkur trask told him coldly as the russian stepped aside and ushered them past him into the laboratory beyond the steel door and i hope theyre good ones because if theyre not his voice tailed off as he gazed all about until his eyes found what he was looking for in one corner of the large welllit room a tiled sunken area like a small swimming pool had been cut from the living rock beyond it the walls of the manmade cave rose sheer out of the basin to a high roughly hewn ceiling the cage goodly had mentioned stood central in the tiled depression itself and there were steps leading down to it set in the walls of the sunken area nozzles pointed inwards towards the cage as soon as trask had absorbed this last detail he recognized its function this was not and had never been intended as a swimming pool this was an acid bath there were two scientists in the room both of them young inexperienced definitely cowed by tzonovs presence trask correctly assumed they sat on chairs at the rim of the sunken area with millboards notepaper and pens as yet they didnt seem to be doing too much writing which trask understood readily enough tzonov himself had pinpointed the difficulty here these people were scientists and he was a metaphysician they didnt even believe what he had been trying to do they were a token force of the small scientific community here representatives of their fraternity against the parapsychological or supernatural nature of tzonovs crossing the floor to the sunken area trask told tzonov what you did to us constitutes a serious assault youve introduced harmful foreign agencies drugs into our bodies your lot have always been good at that sort of thing ever since the bulgarians showed you how it was a mistake however for well bring charges the russian tuttutted come now harmful on the contrary they were totally harmless do you feel any ill effects of course not moreover by now your bodies are already voiding the drug and so you could never prove it here and now face to face i accept what you say of course for theres no way i can lie to you but how would that stand up in an international court of law ordinary people dont believe in our talents ben so your threat is meaningless and in any case it was done for your own safety the three paused at the rim of the sunken area where the two englishmen looked their host scornfully in the face especially trask the sharp edge of his talent was never keener he looked saw knew that tzonov had told a halftruth something of it had been for his and goodlys safety but mainly it had been to keep them out of the way tzonov wasnt lying but he wasnt telling the whole truth either we dont have to prove it to take action on it goodly spoke up his face and voice animated for once if courts of law are out there are always other ways you arent the only one with a powerful organization behind you there are things which we too can do that could never be handled by a court of law if you doubt me better go and do a little homework on british ebranch there had been a halfsmile on tzonovs face now it fell away til do what i have to do he said to protect myself and my country from any threat whether it comes from an alien world or an alien ideology and i wont let anyone stand in my way but on this occasion i had you two put out of the way in order to protect you this thing he jerked his head to indicate the cage is the unknown in the past other things which seemed harmless have come through into perchorsk and brought death and madness with them not only a threat to my country but to yours too indeed a threat to the entire world were not complaining about your patriotism turkur trask told him only about your zeal he started down the steps into the sunken area and what would premier turchin say i wonder if he knew you were up to stuff like that as for what you said about alien ideologies tsktsk is democracy so alien to you then and would turchin fall into line with your thoughts on that too i wonder goodly and tzonov followed him down the latter cautioning be careful i know you believe hes just a man harry keoghs son but without his fathers powers and it seems i have to agree with you but we still cant be sure if hes wamphyri that could well be the very last thing you discover about him there was malice in his voice almost a wish perhaps a death wish for trask and goodly in mentioning premier turchin advocate general of russias new democracy trask had obviously touched a raw nerve a chair stood opposite the cage with its backrest facing the steel bars tzonovs chair but trask sat down and crossed his arms on the backrest and rested his chin on his arms and sighing he peered at the man from the other side of the gate trask was no telepath there was no way he could know for sure what the other was thinking but he guessed anyway something of it at least it was written in the visitors slumped posture the way he sat crosslegged dead centre of the cage arms by his sides hands curled beside his feet head down in utter dejection tzonov came and stood on trasks right looking sideways and down on him trask avoided his glance but in any case his hypnotic guard was up and tzonov couldnt read him as long as trask was careful he could think what he liked and know that his thoughts were inviolate until siggi dam came back on the scene anyway then she and tzonov might conceivably work something out between them as for right now trask could hazard a guess at the reason for her absence tzonov didnt want her mindsmog interfering with what hed been doing here so trask said youve had him how long an hour and a half and after you woke him up what then did you sit here looking at him trying to get inside his head talking to him in how many languages and with what result what nothing and is that why you decided to send for us tzonov said weve xrayed him and taken blood urine tissue and other samples a comprehensive range of tests so far hes come through all of them he looks normal human but i repeat this is not conclusive proof he came from the world beyond the gate and could be anything but human now the fact is you know far more about that other world than we do your beloved harry told you all about it well a great deal about it that is one of the reasons why you are here because you might see and recognize something in him that we would miss as for my telepathy useless on this one eye to eye i meet a whirl a swirl a vortex which spins so rapidly that it shines his mind is impenetrable i had thought it might be an effect of his being on the other side of the event horizon but i was wrong now that hes on our side its just the same it seems hes one of those rare individuals who cant be read not so rare among sunsides travellers trask answered many of them are skilled in physical and mental camouflage hunted by vampires its been a matter of survival evolution for them in our world the eskimos have an extra layer of fat to combat the cold so the travellers are resistant to telepathic probes to combat the wamphyri he didnt mention that harry was the same in the end after hed become a vampire in any case what he had said was news to tzonov ah the russian sighed before his tone hardened but couldnt you have mentioned this before its hardly a classic example of cooperation true trask answered but then over the course of the last few hours the pebbles in our wall of trust have suffered no small amount of subsidence indeed you could even say that the wall is teetering tzonov ignored the jibe began to pace to and fro behind trask where he continued to stare at the visitor in his cage so the russian mused this ability of his this talent to deflect my telepathy is a natural thing in which case he will have to learn our language and goodly added or we can learn his that shouldnt be too hard romanian with a smattering of slavonic germanic and true romany a good linguist preferably an empath could pick it up in a week we have just such a man in london oh tzonov paused in his pacing and met goodly face to face and are we gullible as well as incompetent perhaps we should simply give our visitor to you to take back to london with you and perhaps with your help he could also develop his fathers powers eh no mr goodly i think i can choose just such an empath from the members of my own branch goodly smiled wryly so much for first name terms he said it was exactly the sort of diversion trask had been looking for he wasnt a telepath but someone had spoken to him in his dreams now concentrating his mind he thought at the visitor who are you whats your name do you know that youre in danger that the people in this place especially this man will either find a way to use you or keep you imprisoned or even kill you he wasnt hoping for any kind of answer but the man in the cage didnt move his body an inch but his head lifted a fraction and his deep blue eyes looked straight into trasks and dont the answer came back causing trask to start in his chair i understand all of this but say nothing do nothing tzonovs talent is huge what the russian esper spun on his heel away from goodly grasped trasks shoulder and stared at the visitor whose head was back on his chest and again he hissed what was that in his effort of concentration his forehead had creased into a hundred wrinkles eh trask looked up at him his hypnotic shield firmly back in place what was what tzonov released his shoulder took two paces to the bars and grasped them you he spat the word at the visitor did you speak he shook the bars until the man in the cage looked up on your feet tzonov shouted speak to me the visitor sat there looked sad puzzled trask stood up and went to tzonov if he cant understand you wheres the sense in shouting at him tzonov looked at him frustration etched in every line of his face you didnt hear him speak trask shook his head not a word in your mind trask took a pace to the rear and frowned he hoped convincingly are you mad youre the telepath turkur not me the russian breathed deeply regained control of himself then why do i feel that youre getting more out of this than i am perhaps it was a mistake to bring you here i think ill have to talk to a higher authority as you wish trask shrugged but before that why dont you let me try to get through to him i mean here and now in front of you all above board and out in the open as they say the last thing he wanted right now was to be ordered out of the laboratory even out of perchorsk leaving the visitor to tzonovs tender mercies and methods tzonov considered it calmed down more yet finally said it can do no harm he is after all my prisoner and whatever he tells you he tells me trask sighed my how the wall crumbles and turned back to the visitor except this time he didnt dare play with telepathy he must simply hope that the man in the cage was tuned in to all of this can you hear me he inquired in the warmest calmest voice he could muster listen were your friends we only want to find out about you but how can we if you wont respond nothing the visitor sat there as before perhaps i was mistaken tzonov quietly commented after a moments silence but when you were sitting there looking at him stiffening his back and neck the visitor had straightened up a little he was looking at trask and there was something of interest in his eyes and expression in general people are like animals trask said in that same reassuring tone without taking his eyes from the others face they know when theyre up against a friend an enemy someone kind or someone not so kind sunsides travellers are probably highly sensitive in this respect its in the expression the voice and eyes your eyes can be especially frightening turkur they look under a mans skin into his mind his soul he smiled and signalled that the caged man should stand up and the other slowly got to his feet there now trask said and maybe we can take it a step further play jane and tarzan with him placing his right palm flat on his chest he said trask ben trask then pointing at the other he let his expression frame a question mark and nathan said the other hand on chest nathan kiklu more than i got out of him in an hour tzonov rasped then be quiet trask told him but in the same reasoned tone of voice and give me a chance to do a little better he stuck a hand through the bars and heard the russians sharp hiss of apprehension and warning the visitor also heard it and his eyes narrowed as his expression became suspicious trask turned his hand palm up thrust it hard between the bars offered it more forcefully and the other relaxed reached out and grasped trasks wrist as he in turn grasped the visitors it was the szgany handshake as trask remembered it from harry keoghs description of sunsides nomads the contact did a lot for both men it told nathan kiklu that trask was his friend also that he might indeed have been his fathers where else could he have learned this greeting if not from a traveller or someone who knew the customs of sunside and to trask it confirmed what he would quite happily what he might already have bet his life on that the visitor was human entirely human it was in the warmth of his touch the conviction of his friendship the irrefutable evidence of trasks talent that this was the real thing finally they released each other stepped back a little and trask softly said nathan can you understand me do you understand anything of what im saying it was nothing short of a subterfuge a red herring a ploy to gain a little time trask already knew that the other understood a great deal not only of his situation but also of the political intrigue going on around him or if not that at least he recognized the principal players and had determined which side to come down on the other played up to it he shrugged tapped himself on the chest again and said nathan his face was a picture of innocence trask pointed into the palm of his left hand and said hand nathan nodded hanta german goodly said or as good as trask crouched down a little and touched his own foot fusse nathan looked blank bindera goodly said in german legs are die heine trask reached inside his pocket brought out something like the kernel of a large nut he held it out to the man in the cage but tzonov stepped forward to grab his arm whats this the best proof of his humanity that youre ever likely to see trask told him its a clove of garlic nathan was interested he reached through the bars and took the clove held it to his nose and sniffed as if it were some exotic flower and indeed it might seem to hold some rare fragrance for him such was his expression then it was as if memories of old times had misted up his eyes as the previous soulful look returned goodly said garlic knoblauch and nathan said kneblasch trask turned to tzonov so much for your concern about his humanity turkur this ones no vampire im wearing a silver ring but he clasped forearms with me and he treats garlic as if it were his national flower or emblem thats a measure of his respect which i for one understand readily enough maybe you understand more than youre saying the other answered darkly but im grateful to you you have made a start at least one which i can what capitalize upon and now i must ask you to leave leave trask stared at him perhaps he stared too long and hard until his suspicious anxious thoughts were visible but in any case the russian shook his smooth dome of a head no not perchorsk not just yet anyway you have shown a measure of goodwill in this thing despite that you consider my methods draconian and unfair and so im willing to forget our differences for the present at least i meant only that you should leave this laboratory go back to your rooms and get a good nights sleep tomorrow you may continue what you were doing these language lessons meanwhile ill arrange to have someone flown in who knows romanian and the romance languages in general probably an empath goodly spoke up what about nathans rights turkur or being an alien doesnt he have any think how youre treating him why he cant even lie down in this birdcage not in any comfort are you going to keep him here all night do you think it will impress him to take you into his confidence tzonov merely glanced at him then offered an exasperated irritated shrug do you two know how aggressive you are whenever i try to be flexible you reply with criticism but as ive tried to explain these measures this cage and cleansing area are only temporary precautions until we can be sure of him even now we cant relax not with one hundred per cent confidence until the results of our tests are known but acting on your reassurances yes i am willing to ease up a little which is why i require you to leave you see i intend to move him right now tonight to more suitable but nevertheless secure accommodation trask grunted a barely perceptible huh following it with and you dont want us to see where youre putting him right that is part of it the russian answered truthfully but as for the rest nothing has changed its for your own safety you are my guests here think how it would look how i would feel if some harm should befall you they might have argued the point but tzonov was through with talking he called for the soldier on the door and the british espers were escorted back to their rooms left alone they talked for a little while but both men were weary now as trask readied himself for bed goodly stuck his head into the room what about him he said what about who about the visitor nathan kiklu or nathan keogh one things certain this isnt the harry junior who we knew hes much too young and we know that the dweller was a vampire when last harry saw him but according to david chung something of the necroscope has come back so what do you think you saw him didnt you trask got into bed chungs right kiklu may be his name but keogh was his father hes not the dweller no but he is a son of harry keogh i mean he has harry written all over him then theres that earring of his didnt you notice it i noticed it goodly nodded harrys mobius sigil yes interesting times ahead ben interesting times trask was tempted to mention something else that nathan had spoken to him in his waking and dreaming hours alike but spoken to him in his mind when trask wasnt even a telepath he was tempted but kept it to himself a case of what goodly didnt know goodly wouldnt think about and in a place like this what he wouldnt think about couldnt hurt him iv nathan and siggi while trask and goodly prepared for sleep turkur tzonov spoke to siggi dam in her room pacing the floor before her where she lay sprawled on her bed his attitude was far from romantic in any case what had passed before was mainly for show they had been lovers some years ago an affair which terminated when he discovered his rivals or rather how many rivals currently when they were brought together by their work they were still lovers but it was no longer the state of being just the act some progress has been made but not enough he told her tomorrow the british will want to see him again and it would not be prudent to stop them when we have some more of our own people here that will be time enough meanwhile it cant hurt to go through these tediously slow processes after that well only let trask talk to our visitor for an hour or so at a time and always under supervision proving nathans humanity and so far the results of our tests do appear positive in his favour was only the first step discovering why hes here and especially at this time that is now our top priority you dont think its just a coincidence siggi sat up and stretched arms above her head breasts jutting the platinum flow of her hair highlighting her strong jaw looking at her tzonov could almost wish he was free tonight i think it most probably is a coincidence he answered but best to be sure what the son or a son of the necroscope harry keogh here in perchorsk again an outcast from starside oh really or is he something else entirely did he escape here or was he sent and if the latter why and so it goes we need answers to all these questions siggi had been asleep for an hour or two her nightgown was of very flimsy stuff white chiffon shot through with metallic silver lame looking at her again tzonov caught himself wishing that he was free tonight but no he intended to supervise his soldiers his soldiers a handpicked platoon which he had managed to infiltrate into this place over a period of time in the removal and relocation of their arms cache to a secure more discreet armoury on a disused magmass level below the core in another hour or so when only a handful of scientists remained on duty then hed be able to make a start and between times he had calls to make not least to the kremlin to report the occurrences of the day but also to his own ebranch hq on protze prospekt to enlist the skills of an empathlinguist these and several other administrative tasks would keep him amply occupied through the small hours and in any case he was tired and felt the need to conserve his energies in a purely physical sense siggi could be very demanding and there again he had other plans for her it was not usual for sigrid dam to read the minds of her colleagues but on this occasion she was curious about turkur tzonovs mental state normally he would be implacably stable indeed unshakable but occurrences over the last week seemed to have unnerved him in however small a degree siggi was his confidante it could even be said his righthand man in the scheme hed been hatching for several years now to usurp the soviet premier and elevate russia to world domination via the untapped resources of an alien world the timing of the coup was crucial and hinged upon an invasion of the parallel world of sunsidestarside when the time was ripe tzonov would make his move first premier turchins removal by use of some discreetly ephemeral poison by which time tzonovs seat on the demokratik politburo would have been secured then with the esoteric resources of ebranch for backup he would propose himself for premier and almost certainly be elected in the interim his soldiers would have invaded the world beyond the perchorsk gate returning via the romanian gate with firsthand knowledge and even the first fruits of whatever was on offer in that unknown primitive and incredibly dangerous place but tzonov was well aware that he was not the first esper to plot political revitalization and he knew only too well the difficulties his predecessors had come up against the name of one such obstacle had become a curse among the rank and file of soviet ebranch harry keogh but for sixteen years now the man or monster known as the necroscope had been banished from the face of the earth until finally hed become little more than a myth a legend a bad dream old fears that one day he might return fears shared by british ebranch no less than its soviet equivalent had not been realized possibly the necroscope was dead certainly the british thought so or was it that keogh had not been able or simply hadnt desired to return and now this visitor this nathan kiklu a refugee from a vampire world or a spy for monstrous wamphyri masters on starside that remained to be discovered that and whatever else tzonov could learn from him the trick would be to ensure that the british espers didnt learn more it rankled a little that they were here by order of gustav turchin on tzonovs own recommendation but in fact hed believed they would be needed now that they were no longer required he must continue to be their host of sorts and at the same time learn whatever he could from them especially with regard to their previous knowledge of sunsidestarside it was all very delicate complicated fraught with pitfalls but until the visitor had been thoroughly interrogated and dealt with and british ebranch were out of here and the whole seething cauldron had settled down somewhat tzonov must tread warily and hold his greater plans in abeyance many of these things in turkur tzonovs mind were overheard by siggi since she was already aware of their theme in general they made no significant impact but certain thoughts of his had impacted upon her in particular his vague but less than gallant reference to what he would term her promiscuity knowing tzonovs psychological problem his egocentricity the fact that it bordered on egomania siggi was also aware of the paradox that he was jealous and possessive beyond all reasonable bounds it was the reason he changed partners so frequently only let one of his women display the slightest awareness of or interest in another man he would fly into a rage and the affair would be over but siggi also knew that if the day should ever dawn when tzonov came up against a man who was his mental physical and political superior all three then hed be finished so far that day was a long way off but still his nerves showed ragged edges in the presence of men like trask and goodly they may not be his physical equivalent but mentally they were probably a match for him it took some of the shine off his ego tzonov had stopped pacing and was looking at her oh is there something perhaps it was the look on her face she shook her head changed her mind and nodded perhaps there is turkur were agreed that you are the leader and i am a mere follower however high in the ranks and that in some not too distant future my loyalty shall be suitably rewarded not a very novel scenario but still ive gone along with it in every respect so much so that im probably guilty of treason against the state and certainly against its premier he frowned and nodded both of us siggi and ebranch and all of our agents and recruits including certain generals in the socalled citizens army so what are you getting at only this she answered sitting up straighter if im really your secondincommand which is the next best thing to being your partner then i wish youd stop thinking of me as a slut do i he looked surprised you think of me as promiscuous she answered to say the very least you cant even look at me without remembering your rivals but they werent rivals merely lovers and briefly at that if i were to dwell upon all of your conquests in a similar light what would that make you a lech a rake a bloated and diseased roue being male perhaps it would please you to be so considered but im a woman and it doesnt please me his pale eyebrows came together as his frown grew more intense curiosity turning to anger my dear he said his words very precise so as to make their meaning clear and unmistakable promiscuity is not the word that would simply mean that you were indiscriminate in your sexual relations and i would never think of you as a slut which for me describes a common person of very low intelligence whose body is worthless no youve read me wrong you are neither indiscriminate nor common but simply unbalanced what she stood up faced him shrugged into her dressinggown and belted it tightly oh yes he insisted its all in the mind ive known it for a long time and im sure that you have too youre a nymphomaniac siggi that is how i think of you because its what you are men hold this morbid fascination for you almost all men get out she said all the colour had drained from her face in this instance rank has no privileges youre in my room and i want you out of it and i dont ever want to see you in it again of course you dont he smiled thinly until the next time when your needs overcome your disgust of yourself out she said again and made to stride to the door he caught her wrist brought her to a halt and his anger was as great as her own siggi listen this is nothing new but how it always was between us its the reason our relationship failed but there are relationships and relationships and there must be discipline in our working relationship what you said a moment ago is true in the eyes of all the dupes of this great country of ours and its socalled demokratik system we would be traitors if our ties are weakened by sexual conflict thats as it may be but it must not be allowed to interfere with our purpose our goal overall she was calmer now what and am i a fool as well as a slut of course we must continue to work together or fall together but right now i would prefer you out of here i have to dress and as for your thoughts about my personal life in future you can keep them to yourself thats where you have the advantage he told her your thoughts are guarded hidden in mindsmog whereas you can read mine like the pages of an open book it was true she knew telepathy was a twoedged sword if one was curious to look into another mind one must accept its contents tzonov could no more disassociate himself from his thoughts than from his limbs they were a part of him and now he was thinking about this nathan and the instructions which he had previously given to her he was about to issue a caution one which she could read in his mind like the pages of an open book dont worry she told him however grudgingly as she opened the door to let him out til go to nathan and talk to him see if i can worm my way past this freakish talent of his we seem to be two of a type this primitive and i perhaps our shields can be made to cancel each other out if its at all possible ill get into his mind for you good tzonov looked at siggi one last time luring her eyes with his own a wasted effort her static got in the way he could only read her when she desired to be read and at the same time hed left himself wide open there was another instruction a final order in his mindbut he was wise enough to leave it unspoken it concerned siggi and nathan what she must not do when she was with him closing the door in his face she thought fuck you but she made sure she kept the thought to herself in her anger siggi was no less human than any other woman or man and it was only after tzonov had gone that she knew what she should have said to him that the level of sexual activity in any normally healthy body is only as high or low as opportunity will allow how many affairs die stillborn because their wouldbe authors are afraid to voice their feelings but with a telepath when siggi met a man who wanted her she knew it at once as surely as if he had whispered in her ear why sometimes it was as if he had shouted and if he should have that special something that attracted her that indefinable something that sex appeal which is different for all women thereby allowing for relationships between all types what then knowing what was available was she supposed to ignore it but by the same token and once the first flush of sexual excitement had burned itself out she would also know the rest of her lovers thoughts she knew too well the luscious juicy shivering lust that could turn to a weird disgust just as soon as a man had fired himself into her knew also that the moment she read such a thing in a lovers mind the first time he thought of her in such terms in her entirety as a darkly quaking coarsehaired sucking hole then that the affair was over even if the thought was fleeting transient still it signalled the end always but while it was painful siggi had learned to accept it she knew that another lover would come along soon enough and the first flush be reborn ordinary lovers were fortunate in a way because their minds were their own and inviolable because they could not see the truth the various disaffections and dissatisfactions gradually growing up between them they tended to pretend it was always good and unchanging that their sex together would always be like the first time it was a ploy that even worked for some of them and their love lasted a lifetime but only for a few for even the blind are not deaf and dumb too and yet siggi was not without hope somewhere sometime she might meet a man like herself whose mind was unfathomable a secret thing known only to himself and there was an old saying that was never far from her thoughts what the eye doesnt see the mind wont grieve two choices then find a lover who would be satisfied quite simply to jove her in every sense of the word or one with the skill to keep his baser thoughts to himself ah and of course the will to keep from reading her own and so a sex maniac no but a realist an opportunist a desperate searcher and was tzonov himself any different any better siggi knew that he was not but that unlike herself he had not yet come to terms with it nor could he while his ego intruded he had called her a nymphomaniac because his ego demanded it obviously there was a flaw in her psychological makeup for any normal woman couldnt possibly find time for other men not while turkur tzonov was around what were other men anyway compared to him yet in siggis case her taste in all other matters was impeccable wherefore this was not a matter of taste but addiction hence his use of that word which describes a woman addicted to men such were the warped convolutions of tzonovs thinking when facing a problem that challenged his ego and such was siggis assessment of him as she prepared to interrogate in her way this visitor this nathan kiklu as for tzonovs unspoken instruction that she conduct her interrogation on a purely impersonal level she had never intended anything else nathan was from the alien world of sunsidestarside and scientific tests to the contrary who could say what alien things might or might not lurk in his blood his mind was of far greater concern than his body but on the other hand perhaps turkur should be made to understand how siggi despised this sort of interference she was her own person or anyone elses to whom she might care to give herself siggi dressed slowly and thoughtfully and was careful to avoid any sort of uniformed or military appearance she didnt want to seem aloof or in any sense official ascetic clinical she was the scented glove or as the british might have it the soft sell as opposed to the clenched fist and must appear more girl than woman more nurse than inquisitor he wasnt an innocent this man from the gate she had known that much from the first time she saw him on the viewscreens but he was far too young wild and primitive yes as the place hed come from to be too wellversed in the ways and wiles of women especially the sophisticated women of earth so thought sigrid dam who could make mistakes just like any other woman and of any other world when she had finished dressing she examined the result in her rooms less than adequate mirror her choice of earth colours despite that she knew they didnt compliment her own had been deliberate she didnt want to seem too bright or alien to the visitor according to what little the soviet ebranch knew of sunsidestarside it was a dull world dark dreary which the pale browns and yellows of nathans clothes might seem to corroborate a gypsy world peopled by nomadic tribes on one side of barrier mountains and wamphyri on the other all such knowledge what little there was of it had been supplied by the british in that brief period of esper gjasnost following harry keoghs vampiric metamorphism and his escape to starside and siggi well understood tzonovs eagerness to learn more about the world beyond the gate and its inhabitants not only to go one up on what the british already knew but more as an important equation in his preparations of course for this was the world he intended to conquer to make it a new satellite of mother russia unless it conquered first and in that respect she understood something of tzonovs fears too for he had shown her the perchorsk archive tapes of previous visitors she shuddered put those pictures firmly from her mind and examined herself one last time statuesque she could well have stepped off the cover of one of the wests glossy magazines but not out of the fashion section not unless gypsies were back in fashion well that was a contrivance and she mustnt complain this wasnt going to be a night out in paris or an evening of californian chardonnay sexual innuendo and telepathic surveillance at the american embassy in moscow after all but romany yes the clothes at least if not her looks an illmatched combination maybe but on the other hand the visitor didnt look much like a gypsy either he could even be danish a fellow countryman well once upon a time only his clothes looked romany and perhaps his single golden earring but even that didnt signify a great deal they were back in fashion for men here in this world too she wore a tasselled jacket of lightbrown suede over a leafgreen blouse fastened with a jade clasp and a flared cotton skirt patterned with autumn leaves if she were a little less tall brownskinned with black hair and eyes perhaps she could be a woman like the ones he had known and siggi wondered how many hed known and how well but in any case he was little more than a boy and she must become his sister a sympathetic contact in this strange new world stepping into the corridor siggi found her escort waiting for her the young tiredlooking soldier snapped erect saluted and shouldered his rifle it was well past midnight and she could appreciate his weariness apart from essential duties the perchorsk complex was now as quiet and suffocating as a tomb like a vast mausoleum yes and for a moment siggi could even feel the mountain pressing down on her on their way to nathans cell she asked her escort do you have orders only to escort you madame and let you into the prisoners room and to wait outside of course until you have finished and call for me that could be most of the night he shrugged and made no answer she thought about nathan shed been there when they fed him drugged food and brought him through the gate the son or a son of a man theyd known as the necroscope siggi had read the keogh files and found their story what fantastic no much more than that the story of a man who could move himself bodily instantaneously to any spot on earth a teleport yes and the first of his kind also hed talked to the dead and even had the power to call them up from their graves and at the end hed been a vampire indeed wamphyri that was the last time anyone saw him when hed disappeared into the gate riding an american motorcycle but it wasnt the first time keogh had been to starside four years earlier british ebranch had sent him there on a mission to find an agent whod been lost while spying on perchorsk that had been oh twenty or so years ago and now this nathan had come through the gate just twenty or so years old keoghs son it seemed reasonable but it didnt seem to be a case of like father like son for if hed inherited his fathers powers thered be no holding him here or anywhere else for that matter turkur tzonov considered his arrival coincidental to his plans but obviously he had to be sure that in a nutshell was siggis mission find out why hed come was it of his own volition or someone elses if the latter what was the nature of his masters how many of them were there and when would they be following on behind finally if his answers were satisfactory if there was no immediate danger or any requirement for extraordinary action then it would be time to drain him of his knowledge concerning sunsidestarside preparatory to tzonovs invasion they had reached the door to nathans room more properly his cell in the old days doors in perchorsk had all been equipped with locking devices following a number of catastrophic accidents and incidents when too many lives were lost behind locked doors most of them had been replaced by easier mechanisms this cell was one of the few remaining rooms with a door that locked it was also fitted with a small metal panel like a window with a catch on the outside the soldier had a key to let siggi in but as he produced it she said here let me he held his rifle at the ready as she turned the key in the lock and opened the door inside the room nathan halfreclined on his bed clothed and fully awake he saw siggi and the soldier and his eyes narrowed to stare at the gun in the letters capable hands but siggi only smiled at him shook her head and closed the door behind her leaving the soldier outside he at once turned the key in the lock rapped on the hatch and opened it madame will you be all right she looked at his concerned face framed in a small metal square and said im sure that with you out there all will be well now then close the hatch and please dont bother us again however reluctantly he obeyed her and as the observation window closed she turned to face nathan he was on his feet nervous as a cat and blinking his startling blue eyes she kept smiling motioned him to sit down then gave the cell a cursory inspection a bed chair washbasin and chamber pot so much for accommodation it might as well be lubianka in the time of khrushchev then she looked at nathan he was a sixfooter athletic if a little awkward in his movements shylooking and yet not innocent it was what shed noticed in him before when shed seen him on the viewscreens his eyes despite being soulful were also knowing she crossed to the chair took it to where he sat on his bed and sat facing him only a few feet away im siggi she said lowvoiced he frowned siggi she nodded and touched her breast siggi yes he sighed as if to say what that again then answered drily sourly nathan nathan kiklu all right she said smiling tightly now i shall try not to be so boring and then without warning she turned up her full telepathic power and said nathan i know your mind is shielded turkur tzonov couldnt get through to you and so your shield must be very strong well my mind is similar but with me its deliberate now whether your talent is natural or a contrivance is not my concern at this point but if youre not willing to help me i wont be able to help you at the first unspoken word he had started where he sat a small jerk of his shoulders and a tic in the corner of his eye that was all followed immediately by a vain attempt to hide his surprise behind a blank expression but while siggi had not been expecting his reaction still shed seen it and knew what it must mean why his mind was like a wall of bulletproof glass made slippery with a film of oil spinning to create its own centrifugal force and deflect the thoughts of others nothing could penetrate or even stick to it but it didnt stop nathan from looking out through it so much for innocence just why siggi had tried it she didnt know a hunch thats all but it had worked now sighing her wonder and sitting back a little from nathan she was suddenly aware of what she was dealing with here the fact that he was from an alien world and the son of harry keogh and capable of telepathic reception all in one but then what other powers did he have and was he as human as tzonov thought he was youre an alien she couldnt help the thought why you could even be wamphyri he could be yes hiding behind this shy seemingly innocuous facade he just could be suddenly siggi was very cold and trembling she felt the short hairs stiffening at the back of her neck gooseflesh not only on her arms legs and spine but creeping in her mind too this man this thing could be wamphyri she remembered archive film of a wamphyri soldier who had come through the gate perchorsks defenders russian soldiers on our side of the portal had blistered him with their flamethrower and pulped his legs with their automatic rifles until hed been brought to his knees but only figuratively for even when he was down still they hadnt quelled his spirit the film rolled again on the screen of siggis mind hed kneeled there mewling on the gantry in front of the glaring white hell of the gate a crippled man for all to see grey as a corpse and splashed with blood his own and that of those hed slaughtered yet even as it had dawned on him that this must be the end so the thing inside him had denied it he had looked like a man but now his mouth yawned open it opened opened opened oh impossibly wide a forked tongue scarlet lashed in the cave of his throat his jaws elongated visibly making a sound like tearing sailcloth fleshy lips rolled back in a froth of saliva until they split and spurted blood revealing crimson gums and jagged dripping teeth the entire mouth resembled nothing so much as the pulped rabidly yawning muzzle of a wolf but the rest of the face had been as bad if not worse the squat nose had broadened out more yet developing convoluted ridges like the snout of a bat with moist quivering nostrils in dark wrinkled leather the ears previously flat to the head had sprouted coarse hair growing upward and outward to form redveined nervously mobile shapes like fleshy conches and in this respect too the effect was batlike or maybe demoniac for hell was written in those features and limned in the nightmare expression of that face a visage which was part bat part wolf and all horror and still it wasnt over before the eyes had been small piggish and deepsunken now they were grown to gorged leeches i bulging crimson in their sockets and the teeth they gave new meaning to nightmare for growing and curving up through the lacerated ribbons of the creatures gums those bone knives had so torn his mouth that it filled with his own blood as for the rest of his body that had remained mercifully manlike but through all of his metamorphosis his ravaged trunk and legs had taken on a dull leaden gleam and his entire form had vibrated with an incredible palsy then theyd burned him up hosed him down with chemical fire melted him to smoke steam and stench it had been over it was all over dissolving like a shadow in sunlight from the screen of siggis mind except for the one thing which she remembered above all others that at first hed looked just like a man frozen to her chair she couldnt move think speak and nathan was standing up reaching for her he touched her held her shoulder squeezed but gently and now she saw what his whirling shield was composed of numbers nathans secret mind was hidden behind an enormous mutating equation maths astonishing maths in a man from a largely innumerate world all of this was too much she didnt know enough about him didnt know anything she should call out for the soldier in the corridor but there was a lump in her throat his ohsogentle touch she made to shrink back from it but her back was against the back of the steel chair and in any case a moment after he touched her the numbers vortex had disintegrated into a thousand shattered fractions revealing nathans thoughts im not wamphyri he said emphatically the wamphyri are my enemies im here because of them not as their agent this is some kind of unjust punish ment i think for a crime i never committed and dont even understand do you think i want to be here in the helllands beyond the starside gate i want to be back on sunside with my young wife these were the jumbled thoughts he aimed at siggi while behind them she sensed his pain frustration and bewilderment and most of all his loneliness suddenly nathans hand on her shoulder was warm and very human she felt his humanity coming right through her clothing and she wasnt cold any more she breathed deeply controlled herself and said ive come here to question you you come from a terrible place theres a man who wants to be sure of you he wants to know your purpose here he thinks i know what the mentalist turkur tzonov thinks nathan broke in hes and thinks a great many things some of which are correct some incorrect and others which are simply wrong hes a a wouldbe warlord hungry for power he would examine me me to his cause if possible put me to use in his schemes and if he cant then hell kill me through me using my of the world beyond the gate he would invade and not only the wamphyri of starside but also sunsides szgany its travellers but i am szgany and i can promise you this making war with the travellers would be a grave error of and as for going against the wamphyri what knowing as little of them as you do that would be a sure sign of insanity from the moment she heard his first spoken words siggi had scarcely been able to credit nathans fluency in russian her own adopted language and when hed been uncertain of the words there hed filled in by thinking them finally she did believe and her mouth fell open then why have you chosen to remain silent she breathed i mean you can speak our tongue you understand everything her words were so naive as to sound stupid in her own ears he shrugged but not negligently our tongues are not dissimilar and anyway you are a clever mentalist in your own right dont you have a knack with tongues she did it was true but not like this he read her answer in her mind and explained thats because youve come to rely too heavily on your mentalism as a tool of your trade his voice was colder as he went on why trouble yourself with learning a mans tongue mere words when its so much easier to steal his thoughts isnt that why youve come here now to this terrible buried cell to steal my thoughts for turkur tzonov siggi felt the colour rising to her face under nathans steady scrutiny and said weve all underestimated you and immediately she wondered why am i tonguetied why does every word i say to him sound so stupid what am i actually the little sister i was going to pretend to be it would be a clever excuse for the warmth she was starting to feel except siggi knew that it wasnt the warmth of a sister and as that realization dawned so she closed the shutters of her mind and let its mental vapours drift out obscuring her thoughts but no need for nathan had stopped reading them as good as his word he was no mindspy and certainly no voyeur why should he be when he could simply talk to her all of this taking a single second before he told her no you have overestimated me surely you must see i know you can that im not your enemy what only one man and unarmed how could i be i dont mean you any harm none of you all i want right now is to get back to my own world to what was my home before the wamphyri returned then his face and voice hardened but if or when tzonov invades sunside then i shall be his enemy as for my silence it took time to watch listen learn time to study a new tongue in with the minds that think it as he let go of her backed off a short pace and sat down on his bed siggi found herself fascinated anew entirely fascinated nathan was like no man shed ever known of course he was for he came from a universe which ran parallel to the one we know but there was more than that to it a lot more than the fascination of unknown horizons just waiting to be opened in the depths of his mind more even than the physical attraction of his young male body his warmth the way his eyes spoke soulfully of indefinable yearnings a past shadowed under the arching wings of nightmare and an equally uncertain future his shield of numbers was down siggi could go in but no longer wanted to not uninvited and not until he desired it whatever his terms they would be more than acceptable to her he didnt need his telepathy to read it in her eyes well be friends he said offering her a first wan smile despite turkur tzonov we are friends she answered and sighed as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders and to hell with turkur tzonov except she frowned he will expect something out of all this nathan nodded of course hell expect answers and you shall supply them he was suddenly thoughtful withdrawn subdued but i wont tell you him everything not just yet no he wont get all of it until until he brings his machine here v out of perchorsk siggi felt her heart sinking like a stone his machine her voice was a whisper she knew about such a machine banned now throughout the civilized world but turkur hasnt spoken to me about about that nor has he said anything to me nathan answered but he has thought it siggi had asked him what will you tell me about yourself and nathan had answered most of it but i shall leave out anything which would help tzonov it could be argued that anything i tell you will be of some help to him i know but in fact theres a great deal that might frighten him off he would be a fool to ignore the menace of the wamphyri you dont know turkur despite what youve read in his mind shed told him then and you havent seen couldnt possibly imagine the power of the weapons he commands how long will it take you to tell me everything again nathans expressive shrug how long is a lifetime i can only tell it as it happened it would be shorter if i could see it and it wouldnt exhaust you in my mind he had understood her meaning i suppose so but still it will take time most of the night maybe shed thought about it then gone to the door and rapped on the hatch until it opened give me your key shed told the young soldier then go to your bed your duty is over my orders are clear hed answered i am to but ive just changed your orders this is the way we planned it turkur tzonov and i so dont interfere with the plans of your superiors as you can see the prisoner is completely harmless also ive a gun hidden on my person in the morning i shall return the key to turkur personally and thats enough of explanations now give me the key and ill continue with my work and you can go and get a good nights sleep madame i or perhaps youd prefer to explain your disobedience to tzonov himself right now tonight maybe youd like to go and wake him up so that he can validate what i say at which the soldier had handed over the key saluted and excused himself siggis actions had been almost automatic she knew why shed sent him away but would never have admitted it consciously or otherwise not even to herself she was preparing the way securing the ground that was all she didnt want anyone outside the door on the other side of that window it wasnt so much that she wanted nathan not yet but if the night was going to be as long as he thought it was that had been a little less than three and a half hours ago and now the two were asleep in each others arms how it had happened neither of them would ever be sure but as night stretched out and perchorsks energy requirements were reduced so the rooms temperature had fallen by several degrees together with their physical inactivity this hadnt helped matters soon they had felt the cold and eventually theyd sat together on nathans bed finally it had seemed only natural that siggi should recline in his arms and then shed drawn a blanket up to cover their fully clothed bodies but when nathan had reacted to her proximity shed known it at once from which time on their thoughts had gradually turned away from his story to much more intimate things and then siggi had known for sure why she sent the guard away when her curious hand had discovered him hot and pounding nathan had closed his mind warning her but if i love you it will be misha of course for only four or five earthdays ago hed been with his young gypsy wife on sunside not if you love me with your body not your mind and she too had called up her mindsmog to obscure her thoughts even so still youll know it just as you know it now but i wont see her face in your mind and what the eye cant see the mind wont grieve til imagine its me youre pleasuring and in a purely physical sense it will be but you have a need nathan which you can relieve in me and your need she had taken his hand guided it to her hardened nipples my need is to satisfy the need in you this could well be the only chance well ever get and it might be all im able to do for you ever but you do have your own need i want you yes because im different or because youve been ordered to have me there had been a certain bitterness in his voice but hed stroked her breasts in spite of it siggi could hardly be expected to know that she wouldnt be the first woman who had come or been giftwrapped and sent to nathan because you are different probably shed smiled sadly but ordered to love you on the contrary ive been told not to and she had sensed his understanding and knew that he too was his own man im forbidden turkur likes to own things she had told him including people and if he cant own something still hell try to deny its its use to others he would like to own both of us and this will help set you free her fingertips had felt like small flames burning where they brushed again her wry smile hardly that for im in too deep no i cant be free but inside ill be like you my own person theyd been mainly free of their clothing by then and when siggi rolled onto him her breasts were soft scented in his face her womans juices had prepared the way and slipping into her was so easy it came almost as a surprise but as shed tightened herself to control him slow him take charge then nathan had seen how expert she was and then too hed known that she wasnt and never could be misha the first time had been quick for all her control but the second was slower deeper more knowing it was as if he reached for her heart while she in turn tried to swallow him whole then when all too soon it was over and this man from a weird world fell asleep in siggis arms and body she could have cried for at the last shed glimpsed herself in his mind and seen how she glowed there not the dark sweating sucking thing shed come to expect perhaps especially this time but a haven a harbour almost a holy place she could have cried because because he might be the one oh it was too early to know but he might be except he couldnt be not ever because of misha and so nathan had slept in siggis arms as at the house of an old friend then she had wanted to give him something more than her body because it might be her only chance to give him anything ever taking her jade clasp shed placed it in a pocket of his jacket and finally lulled by the steady beat of his heart in a little while she too had slept and slept until turkur tzonov woke them up finished with his work tzonov had caught up on a couple of hours lost sleep until something some dream or other had brought him awake siggis room was only a few doors from his own out of curiosity hed looked in and the rest had seemed obvious what she was still working right through the night ah but theres work and theres work and now coming here wheres the guard his voice was a snarl his eyes huge and furious as he dragged her from the bed his automatic pistol was trained on nathan confused by sleep siggi tried to think what time was it she glanced at her watch which was all she was wearing a little after am in another hour or so perchorsk would be waking up but tzonov was already awake fully awake i asked you he shook her i heard you she shouted i i sent him away tzonov growled low in his throat and nodded yes yes of course you did out there in the corridor he was a a distraction i couldnt work work tzonov looked siggi up and down sneering at her nakedness you couldnt work ha he drew back his hand and slapped her hard a backhander that sent her sprawling r nathan was awake now starting up from the bed his face was white as chalk hands reaching tzonov turned his gun on him and snarled through clenched teeth come on show me how you travellers fight for your sluts give me a reason to blow your guts all over the room nathan held back trembling cold sweat marbling his brow his eyes were rapt on the russians ugly bluedsteel pistol which held him at bay but if tzonov had been unarmed just this minute risen from sleep and still confused for the first time nathans mind was unguarded wide open to turkur tzonov eyetoeye contact the russian read nathans angry thoughts and glanced down at the gun in his hand what this in control again but barely he knew how close he had come to using it is this whats stopping you this and my threat oh no my young friend i want you alive and kicking for now anyway their contact worked in two directions once more nathan saw a monstrous machine in tzonovs mind a mechanical vampire feeding with himself as its victim the thing ate his brain with electrical fire and left his skull an empty shell but nathan wasnt alone for this time siggi saw it too then tzonov blinked and the picture was gone and his mind seemed sheathed in ice he applied the safetycatch on his gun flipped back the lefthand drape of his jacket and drove the weapon home in its underarm holster very well he said lets see what youve got if we dispense with but nathan was already moving and siggi was shouting at him nathan dont too late as nathan came flying from the bed tzonov seemed to back off a pace but coldly efficient even robotic in the precision of his movements at the last moment the russian stepped to the right grasped nathans left wrist twisted and leaned back in midflight but descending nathan found himself flipped forward in an uncontrolled somersault and before releasing him tzonov used his own body as a pivot and centre of gravity to add his weight to his victims impetus nathan hit the vinyltiled floor bounced rolled and slammed fulllength into the metal wall and lay still the fight was over tzonov crossed to him went to one knee and checked his pulse then he grunted and looked at siggi where she was silently cursing and pulling the last of her clothes on glaring back at him she said well and have you killed him he shook his bullet head no i will kill him eventually but for now hes just winded dizzy feeling sick youre the sick one she headed for the open door but tzonov was there first thrusting her out into the corridor so hard that she collided with the opposite wall then while she clung there he took out a duplicate key and secured the door siggi saw the key in his hand and clamped her mind tight shut obscuring its thoughts behind her uniquely misty screen fuck you she thought again she hadnt planned it this way but tzonov had forced the issue and what he intended doing to nathan well it just couldnt be allowed siggi told herself that that was the real reason why while tzonov had been dealing with nathan and shed been so hurriedly breathlessly dressing shed left her key on the rim of nathans washbasin it wasnt just the worm turning the need to take revenge on this grotesque egomaniac bastard and all his cruelties no it was a human act of a kind turkur tzonov would never understand for she knew now that it wasnt nathan who was the enemy the alien here not by any means something a little more than two and a half hours later siggi was in her bed her exhaustion was mostly feigned but not her trembling as she lay there wondering how tzonov would react to his prisoners escape it was unavoidable something which was bound to erupt at any moment now in fact she was surprised it was taking so long unless was it possible that nathan had been in such a bad way that hed just stayed there unconscious on the floor perhaps hed staggered to his bed and collapsed there and so failed to find the key where shed left it but even as that thought occurred hurried footsteps in the corridor a muted curse and a moment later a fist hammering on the door then tzonovs voice demanding that she wake up siggi took her time made sure she looked dishevelled hoped that her makeup had given her black eye a little extra shine and that the smoked glasses she wore didnt hide its bruised lower orbit and belting her dressinggown finally she opened the door tzonov was alone at least that was a mercy she wasnt about to be arrested no that was a stupid thought how could she have feared that he would dare to charge her with anything she knew too much about him and anyway the era of dawn arrests and summary executions was over in the rest of the world at least but this was perchorsk and tzonov had the power here siggi his voice was harsh rasping hes escaped what she turned her face away as if hiding her eye in fact she was hiding both of them making sure that tzonov couldnt see past the double barrier of dark lenses and mindsmog who has escaped did you say nathan of course nathan who else he caught her shoulders forced her to face him and saw the dark blue bruise under the gold rim of her glasses his expression changed at once what glasses something wrong with your eyes no with my eye siggi hissed my left eye where you struck me is your memory so short then she snatched away the glasses but only for a moment ah he looked staggered but i didnt mean to i mean did i strike you so hard she covered her eyes conjured even deeper banks of fog it doesnt matter not any more and it isnt important but nathan escaped how then she let her jaw fall caused her hand to fly to her mouth the key key tzonov tightened his grip on her shoulders and frowned no the door was locked and i had returned my key to the key cabinet do you mean the duplicate but id given that to your guard with orders that she tore herself loose ran to where her clothes of the previous night were hanging frantically searched the jacket pockets i dressed so hurriedly she gasped as he followed after her and stood waiting close by with his fists clenched and the skin over his jaw tight as a drumhead if you hadnt acted like a jealous egotistical fool you had the key tzonov couldnt believe it and a moment later neither could she as he laughed and sjapped his thigh but i thought i thought amazingly his expression was one of relief and suddenly siggi knew exactly what hed thought that nathan had his fathers powers that hed teleported out of his locked room why are you laughing she continued to act it out at me of course i had the key how else was i to let myself out of his cell but while you were busy throwing your weight around she hurled her jacket to the floor stamped on it and burst into tears false tears but enough to fool tzonov she was only a weak woman after all his ego was quite safe and for the same reason she knew now that he never would have believed that she could give the key to nathan but now that she was on fairly safe ground again since then why ive been in such a state that that i havent even thought about that bloody key now tzonov had someone to blame chastise and again his hands tightened on her shoulders siggi youre a sick little idiot you sought to seduce him yet even now youre not sure that he didnt seduce you youre assuming you lost the key but he could well have taken it from you i should have known better than to let you be alone with him again she stamped her foot tore herself free and turned her face away no im not sick whatever i did was for you us our country you wanted information and i got it everything i could anyway and whatever it took ah she had tzonovs attention if only for the moment he told you things a lot good but why didnt you tell me this before what she glared at him and did you give me even half a chance tzonov knew that he hadnt perhaps not but in any case it will have to keep he was fully in control again on the other hand his escape cant keep well lets see hes been loose for some two and a half hours presumably but a cell is one thing and the complex is another entirely theres always a guard on the outer doors and no way out except through those doors so theres every chance hes still in the place where would he go she was off the hook and could afford to relax a little he has no friends here tzonov looked at her sharply the british she acted up to it yes he could speak to them huh tzonov snorted well he could in a fashion yes no she said shaking her head better than that hes a telepath she would have had to tell him eventually before he found out for himself so why not now what its true he spoke to me that way and hes good at it i would have told you before if youd let me before throwing me in here its why its how i knew he wanted me and before tzonov could fly into another rage she continued why nathan even told me about what he saw in your mind turkur a machine and how you planned to use it on him which is something you never told me with her last few words siggi had even dared to let a disapproving tone creep into her voice he avoided her glance i would use it as a last resort yes and leave him brain dead a vegetable and leave us with his knowledge everything onjy as a last resort you did say that youd kill him tzonov was tired of this get dressed and quickly meet me in the control room where are you going she followed him to the door to check the security of this damned place then to talk to trask see if he knows anything about all of this and how much if its nothing all well and good and after that well just have to make sure that those two are the very last to know anything now get dressed i fancy were going to be busy tzonov was right from then on he at least was busy while siggi dressed he organized search parties to work their way through the various levels of the complex each room and laboratory every nook and cranny from the gate itself to the reception area then as the search commenced he spoke to and commended the efforts of the prowlerguard who had checked nathans cell and found something suspicious in the way he lay there so motionless in his bed fetching the key from the control room the guard had found nathans pillows tucked under the blanket in a manner to resemble the human figure but the door had been locked so last nights guard must still be in possession of the duplicate key without checking that last detail the prowlerguard had then reported the mystery to tzonov but with some small trepidation there could be a simple explanation after all what if the prisoner had been moved tzonovs admiration was boundless but then he sent for siggis guard from the previous night and threatened and dressed the man down almost to the point of nervous collapse following which when hed cooled down a little he had despatched a man to check on trask and goodly were they up and about yet what was their itinerary for the day etcetera his way of finding out their physical and mental condition and perhaps discovering if they knew anything and how much they knew but never a mention from his messenger to them with regard to the alien escapee and finally he had spoken to the twoman security guard at the main entrance one at his post inside the massive doors the other outside their reports corresponded precisely between midnight and am no one had either departed from or entered into the complex at least no unauthorized persons had done so but three supply vehicles had gone out about an hour ago two heading east for the mainly derelict barracks and military airport at beresovo and the third to meet a train at ukhta in the west when siggi met tzonov in the control room he was looking sour tossing her a parka he told her put it on the weather isnt too good and were going out where to she pulled on the parka and took snow goggles from one of its pockets to replace her tinted glasses i was hoping you could tell me tzonov growled leading the way from the control room to the entrance bay lets face it you were with him long enough dont you have any clues any idea at all where he might be heading outside the open doors a driver was ticking over the engine of his halftrack vehicle turning the grey morning atmosphere blue with shimmering diesel fumes it was starting to snow she shook her head are you sure hes gone out in this weather and so far north even a trapper or one of the local lumberjacks would find it hard going on foot ive got teams of men searching every level the entire complex tzonov answered the first reports are already in not a trace of him and i dont think theres going to be one no he has to be out here i think he stowed away on a supply truck siggis throat was dry her heart was hammering and she must control it also her breathing but was it really true was nathan off and running she hoped so but if so she had been the instrument of his release turkur must be right she was a madwoman god but she must watch her thoughts and actions carefully now a supply truck surely the guards would have searched it tzonov snorted his breath pluming where he climbed up beside the driver and helped siggi up alongside there were three trucks he answered two for beresovo one for ukhta they left before the escape was discovered as for a search what and security around here as slack as hell even our own people have been bored to tears but no more siggi if we dont find this alien were in real trouble but why and why do you continue to refer to him as an alien nathans as human as you or i a human mind in a human body hes no plaguebearer and anyway we will find him of course we will to him this is the alien world and were the aliens where can he go who will give him shelter even saying these things asking these questions she prayed that she was wrong for her own sake as much as nathans tzonov glanced at her as the halftrack revved up in a cloud of diesel exhaust gasses and started up the pass along the western flank of the ravine he has only two choices if he came as a spy hes now seen as much as he needs to see of perchorsk at least and must try to get back to his own world if he is the great telepath you believe him to be he must know by now that theres a second gate and its location heading for it hell continue to gather information for his wamphyri masters he paused and then went on thats one scenario but if hes an outcast or runaway an illegal immigrant as it were then he cant go back and so must try to hide fit in with the people around him merge into our society or with any other society that he can reach thats the danger siggi and as youre surely aware borders and check posts dont amount to much these days people come and go as they will and we cant simply let him do that we cant just let him go and forget him now tzonovs glance was suspicious have you lost your wits completely are you so easily besotted he is most probably the son of harry keogh the british will find him if we dont and theyll discover and bring on whatever powers lie latent within him for their own use i mean think about it can we afford for our enemies to be in control of another necroscope can we afford that he might lead some british expedition back into his own world ahead of our plans and just at a time when our country under our intellectual and political guidance and funded by the riches of a brand new world is ready to reassert itself in world affairs no of course we cant simply forget him siggi had known about nathans choices of course and even knew which one he had made but she wouldnt tell tzonov anything else the russian wanted to know but not that and in any case nathan hadnt told her everything for which she was glad what the eye cant see the mind wont grieve so why was tzonov heading west or was it just instinct for it would seem that if he was right and nathan had escaped in one of three trucks then the fugitive was likely to be heading east two out of three would seem the better odds but in fact tzonov had probably guessed correctly if nathan had used his telepathy to read the destinations of those vehicles in the minds of their drivers he would have stowed away in the one heading for ukhta ukhta moscow kiev and romania yes and a cold and lonely two thousand miles journey between before reaching the underground river that fed the onceblue danube the dunarea on its way to the black sea of course because for nathan there was no other choice but that he head for the romanian gate his one route back to sunsidestarside and misha the girl hed left there in peril of her very life or death or undeath and now it was time that siggi told something of these things too to tzonov it couldnt hurt not now that he was on the right track anyway and might soon recapture the fugitive but as siggi prepared herself to relate nathans story the trucks are equipped with radios tzonov mused to himself gloomily here in this bloody wilderness they need them the drivers probably wont see another human being all along their routes unless you would describe the local peasants as human beings out of the pass its two hundred and fifty miles to ukhta and forest and snow all the way theyll see a brokendown cart or two a tractor the smoke of a logging camp but if they were to break down and then a storm came up thats why they need the radios siggi looked at him youve contacted them from perchorsk he shook his head siggi this place is the arsehole of the world nothing works here contacted them from the ravine the complex thats a laugh have you seen the radio room my god talk about antiques also theres this weird interference and the snow doesnt help much the operator got through partially to the lead truck heading for beresovo enough that the driver was able to clear himself then stop and check the other vehicle which leaves only one the one that climbed up through this pass an hour and twenty minutes ago he looked up at the wide jagged canyon of light overhead the firs growing dark on the slopes hes got a good start our alien what will you do to him she had to speak up almost shout as the driver dropped a gear to tackle a steep hairpin even so her tone of voice had been unmistakable tzonovs gaze was penetrating but she kept it out oh yes he said nodding thoughtfully but this one really got to you didnt he siggi and before she could answer perhaps youd better tell me all about him and about his world his alien world first i think at least it would keep her mind busy off other things things she really didnt dare think about and as the clatter of the engine and the clanking of linked tracks on the frozen metalled surface of the road died down a little she started to tell it sunside and starside she said the two halves of a world split down the middle by barrier mountains sunside is home to nomadic tribes gypsies travelling folk except they stopped travelling some twenty years ago after harry keogh and his earthborn son called the dweller destroyed the wamphyri lords of starside thats as much as nathan knew about it he wasnt even born then but when he was a child of four a handful of vampires returned to starside he doesnt know how or where from again they were destroyed this time by fires of hell that came roaring out of the helllands gate the other end of the perchorsk gate turkur thats what travellers and the wamphyri alike call that whiteglowing halfburied portal out on the starside plain the helllands gate because their legends say its the gate to hell and the hellfire that spewed out of it almost seventeen years ago one of viktor luchovs tokarev missiles it had to be a nuclear hell yes that was spawned right here in perchorsk that was the end of the wamphyri or so it seemed and nathan grew up on sunside about the travellers wait tzonov stopped her lets see to this first and you can help they were at the top the apex of the saddle which formed the perchorsk pass below them the ravine was misty in urals daylight shaded grey from the steady fall of large soft snowflakes the cloud ceiling was very nearly total where only a stray beam of sunlight found its way through on the far southeastern horizon they were lucky even a moderate wind could easily turn this into a blizzard the driver had brought his vehicle to a clattering halt he assisted them in turning back the tarpaulin on the back of the halftrack and manhandling a norwegianbuilt snowcat down the ramp of the extended tailgate were going crosscountry tzonov explained even with snowchains a truck is limited to twentyfive miles per hour on roads such as these and no snowploughs before kozhva also if my judgement of perchorsks drivers in general is correct this one will be stopping every hour or so for cheese and biscuits black coffee from his thermos and a sip of vodka and thats not all for im reliably informed that on this run they normally take a break in kozhva to chat with the village girls and post letters slack as i believe i may have hinted previously his sarcasm was biting damn everything even in this threatening weather i would have preferred to use the jetcopter but it isnt back from moscow he started up the snowcat and helped siggi mount and beltup then climbed aboard the wide leather saddle in front of her and fixed his own belt the halftrack will wait here for us if were not back by midday the driver will go back down and take a meal then return we have fuel for two hundred miles which is about right for a return trip to kozhva if were low i can refuel there crosscountry its only half the distance the truck will have to cover with luck well get into kozhva half an hour to an hour ahead of our quarry meanwhile theyll be trying to contact the driver by radio are you ready then well get underway and you can continue with your story or rather with his story the snowcats engine was quiet and very efficient its skis cut the snow with a low hiss like the outriggers of a trimaran slicing water where it sped along the narrow white verge of the road down toward the foothills when they were out of the mountains proper tzonov would turn off the road and head northwest for kozhva through the forests along the many miles of ruledline logging tracks the wraparound windshield gave excellent protection siggi was able to continue nathans story without shouting the travellers have very little of science as we know it she took up her description of the people of the world beyond the gate and what they do have is rudimentary sufficient only to their needs but like our own gypsies theyre good at making signs marking forest trails leaving cryptic messages for others who may follow after they might have had the beginnings of a technology at some time in their history but the advent of the wamphyri put paid to that any scientific advances they might have made have been defeated by the constant need to keep moving survival is their priority not science now theyre five hundred to a thousand years behind us in some ways r and before he could question what siggi had told him so far she continued so no physics as such but metaphysics there seems to be a little of the wamphyri in all of them theyre not vampires not even remotely but there are degrees of what we might term what tainted blood so that what the wamphyri have in large measure certain travellers have inherited down the centuries but to a lesser degree occasionally a mentalist or telepath will show up among them or one of them could be a precog like our mr goodly with fleeting visions of the future thus just like earths romany seers stargazers and palmists are not uncommon among them it makes sense that in a world dominated by very real night fears superstition should be so rife but there again and as you and i and all the worlds ebranches are surely aware parapsychology is not superstition and neither are the wamphyri there are degrees of vampire of which the wamphyri isare the ultimate form but in all their shapes and forms they can only exist on starside away from the sunlight from there they raid on sunside during its long nights taking food and captives back across the barrier range into the shadows of the mountains before before the sunrise here siggi lapsed into a reflective silence causing tzonov to inquire well um she gave herself a shake which was more a shudder oh yes well nathan told me a great deal about the wamphyri and also that you wovild be a fool to ignore his warning which is that only a lunatic would attempt to invade wamphyri territory he knows our plans do you see plucked from your mind while you were trying to read his huh tzonov grunted a taint of the wamphyri do you suppose or something he got from his father despite that tzonov wasnt able to see her siggi shook her head nathan knows nothing about that or rather he knew nothing about it not for certain until he read it in trasks mind as far as he was concerned his father was szgany a traveller called hzak kiklu who was fatally wounded by a wamphyri weapon before nathan was born he did have certain suspicions though which our various thoughts have confirmed but it does seem to be a pure coincidence that he is the one who has come through the gate and how did that come about it seems to have been his punishment for something some crime which he couldnt quite specify but a crime against the wamphyri and so he was cast out of his own world into hell into the helllands gate from which no one ever returned well thats true enough tzonov answered except for the other gate in romania its a oneway system so tell me more about the wamphyri why do you hesitate because you cant see in my mind what i saw in his nor will you ever because im not going to jet you into my mind again and if you could see what nathan showed me then you wouldnt want to see it but out loud she only said because its gruesome tell me anyway very well she decided not to elaborate and after a moment the contagious bite of the vampire is rarely fatal on the contrary for after the what transfusion the victims blood mutates and his longevity is assured or it would be if he were left to develop to his full but as a fledgling vampire hes now a thrall in thrall to r whichever monster occasioned the change in him and of course once a man is taken by the plague he cant stay on sunside but must make his way to the safety of starside and the aerie of his master in starside as a thrall his fate could be one of many none of them pleasant his flesh blood even his bones could be required for the provisioning of the aerie drained of all lifesustaining fluids and truly dead his body could be dried out ground down and mixed with coarse grains as an ingedient of the meal which the wamphyri lords feed to their flyers warriors and other creatures on the other hand he might find himself cocooned stored intact and later changed by the metamorphic skills of his lord into just such a flyer or warrior or part of one a creature like the thing which came through the gate that time and destroyed a pair of heavily armed highly sophisticated soviet aircraft before the americans shot it out of their airspace oh yes the wamphyri can work such what miracles or if not miracles horrors certainly for human flesh is like clay to them but lets suppose that our specimen thrall is the right stuff ah but then his prospects could be very different kept as a true thrall he might be trained given the rank of lieutenant injected with more of his masters evil and in time with fifty a hundred or five hundred years of longevity guaranteed why such a one might even aspire to become wamphyri in his own right this could occur in several ways he could inherit his masters egg a weird reproductory seed or selfcontained organism produced in the leechlike body of the vampire lords symbiont or he might even generate his own egg from scratch dont ask me how the system works nathan himself doesnt know i can only tell you that a symbiont egg is the alkahest or catalyst which will transmute a man into a monster which will in fact make him wamphyri she paused to let tzonov concentrate on controlling the snowcat there were scattered rifts in the cloud ceiling now the sky had brightened it had stopped snowing the light was much better they were down into the foothills and tzonov was turning off the road onto a vast snowslope that swept on for a further fifteen miles or more to the darkcanopied forests and socalled pioneer logging camps but the russians thoughts were bitter less than patriotic as he scanned the white desolation ahead weve been pioneering this region for close on a hundred years now this should be our yukon our canada our norway or sweden oldstyle communism was to blame but in the last quarter century weve learned the lessons of history or rather i have learned them but in the past i was only the student and from now on i must be the teacher tzonovs thoughts were so vehement so determined that despite siggis shielded mind she picked them up she heard his thoughts and maybe even felt something of his megalomania then shivering a little perhaps from the cold too she shrouded her mind again taking a sweeping downhill course designed to slice the snowfield in a mighty diagonal to the southwest tzonov wound up the throttle and let the snowcat skim the drifted snow like a surfer on the swell of a timeless wave the miles flew by in a hypnotic hiss of skis the snowcat paralleled an icy blackpulsing river like a vein in the dead white flesh of the land soon they were into the woods and in a clearing beside a pyramid of logs there tzonov brought his machine to a halt and stepped down to stretch his legs siggi dismounted too and lit a cigarette tzonov who didnt smoke cautioned her is that an american brand huh on the one hand were admonished to clean up our act countrywide to depollute and let the world breathe and on the other were encouraged to ruin our lungs now tell me what good is a healthy land without a healthy people well one day in the nottoodistant future all such shit will be banned mark my words a mood was on him his frustrations were starting to spill over another vice of mine that mr perfect has never approved op siggi thought but kept it to herself while out loud i only smoke one or two a day she said as i require them to soothe my nerves we came down the snowslopes in something of a hurry speed has the opposite effect on me he growled its a stimulant its as good for me as sex is for you his words were harsh grating deliberately hurtful she still wasnt off the hook well to hell with it she tossed her head looked away as he took out a flask and sipped brandy she glimpsed the flask in the corner of her eye as tzonov proffered it but shook her head and then quite suddenly she felt his menace anew and stopped wondering why she was out here why hed wanted her to accompany him she knew it was so that he could keep an eye on her in more senses than one no she wasnt off the hook by a long shot not yet and what is it she said still looking away from him look at me he said she did and saw his eyes huge glassy staring as if to cut into her flesh if speed really did work on the russian like a stimulant he was still pretty high on it she saw the bulge in his pants sluggishly mobile there no his voice was deep dark guttural now dont look at me with those goggles on take them off that would be the same as taking her clothes off or much worse for with nathan fresh in siggis mind tzonov would see everything theyd done together he actually wanted to see them together the bastard wanted to watch nathan fuck her to know who had fucked who wanted to be sure they werent both fucking him siggi stepped back a pace in the silence and the solitude of the woods and shook her head i dont want you in my mind any more turkur not ever there are things in there that are mine alone private oh were still in league far too deeply to pull out and go our own ways but from this point on it has to be business pure and simple we have to be partners all the way and no more mr big and miss little his face changed his jaw tightened and his eyes were like mirrors reflecting her mind but in reality they only reflected her snow goggles and the swirling mental fog behind them then he very slowly and very deliberately reached up and removed her goggles and the first thing he saw was her bruise and the flaring anger in her eyes and the next thing he felt was siggis gun in his ribs then taking back her goggles from his momentarily frozen fingers she told him and thats something else turkur you must be sure never to hit me again if you do then believe me ill strike back perhaps with this she aimed her small but spiteful automatic right into his snarling teeth or if not with this then with whatever else i can lay my hands on but be sure i will strike back she put the goggles back on and continued to face tzonov down until gradually he came to terms with it he had to for right now there was nothing not a thing that he could do about it but after they had both calmed down a little and as they mounted the snowcat again siggi was nauseated to catch a last whiff of the russians mind and it was just exactly like that like a bad smell a mental stench for a moment she thought she saw a picture forming in the slime of his mind a picture of a machine of the machine the gleaming metal vampire which nathan had feared and all of its siphons were sucking on the brain of some poor shuddering victim except this time its victim wasnt nathan vi off and running twice they crossed the winding road to kozhva on the first occasion there were faint impressions under the fresh snow but on the next the heavy tyre tracks were black against the white where rubber had stripped packed snow right down to an icesheathed surface and only a few grey flakes had speckled the glassy tarmac tzonov had an out of date map which he stopped briefly to look at and grunting his satisfaction with their progress at least he at once set off again well be in kozhva in about forty minutes he informed siggi over his shoulder from this point on i could just as easily stick with the tracks and catch the truck on the road but if we take one more shortcut to the village we should be there in time to get a bite to eat and something hot to drink while were waiting for the truck to show up meanwhile i think we should put our differences behind us why dont you finish what you were telling me siggi made it as brief as possible but in any case she could only tell tzonov what she herself had been told or shown she knew that nathan hadnt revealed everything not with complete candour because certain scenes from his history had been either very obviously contrived or else deliberately obscured for example hed shown siggi only a glimpse of his mother and the other people hed grown up with and done little more than mention the childhood sweetheart who had become his wife also he had made a number of brief references to a race of nearalien aboriginal desert dwellers with whom he seemed to have spent a deal of time but such was his reticence with regard to their society that the few pictures which siggi had managed to retain were hopelessly confused and without resolution other areas were likewise blank especially with regard to the szgany in their settled period and the communities in which theyd dwelled prior to the return of the wamphyri as for the rest of it there wasnt much to tell she couldnt possibly relive it for tzonov as nathan had done for her nathan grew up on sunside she began he knew a girl there misha and they had plans but when he was eighteen the wamphyri came back yet again his tribe was attacked and scattered and his girl taken as a thrall so he thought anyway he took to wandering became a true traveller spent years in the wilderness moving from tribe to tribe until he too was taken by the wamphyri his vampire lord was fascinated by nathans light skin and colours which are rare among sunsides szgany and so he was kept as a sort of pet and never vampirized eventually he escaped and made his way back to sunside there he discovered his girl alive and well they were married but the wamphyri pursued him when he was retaken his punishment was to be thrown into the starside gate and so he came here over his shoulder tzonov said but didnt you tell me previously that he couldnt understand his punishment isnt there something of an ambiguity here despite that he couldnt see her siggi shrugged if so its nathans ambiguity turkur not mine perhaps there were things he wanted to keep to himself is that so strange dont we all have little secrets which we would prefer to keep private it was going to be a sore point with her for a long time to come tzonov answered with a suspicious grunt and said somehow i cant help thinking that there are far too many little secrets which this nathan would like to keep to himself but i shall discover them soon enough in her own secret mind siggi thought you could be right of course but first youll have to catch him they followed a logging trail right into little kozhvas main street big kozhva was three miles further on and this was a logging camp of the same name which employed sawyers lumberjacks and other workers from the town the road passed right through the centre of camp and according to the people on the street the truck from perchorsk wasnt in yet tzonov put distance between the snowcat and a giant sawmill whose noise was deafening and stopped outside a general store issuing food coffee smells and a blast of warm air from a roaring log fire in the stonebuilt fireplace an area had been set aside for eating the coffee and dogs were of american blends and manufacture of course a handful of customers looked up from their late breakfasts or early lunches as tzonov ordered coffee eggs fried potatoes and onions one of the men a huge bearded lumberjack whistled his appreciation as siggi shrugged out of her parka and sat down with tzonov at a rough wooden table in a frontier place like this she must surely be a sight for sore eyes ignoring the other staring faces all about her siggi glanced witheringly at the whistler and lit a cigarette this time tzonov made no complaint but simply said and now you see what i mean when i talk about such people as subhuman no i dont she answered these are just men and men are the same all over the world but this is a hard place and so these men are grown rough like the timbers they handle i find it much harder to understand intelligent socalled sophisticated men whose bodies may be clean and smooth but whose minds are just as grubby if not worse than these tzonov scarcely felt slighted he would never have allowed it to cross his mind that she might be referring to him their table gave them a view of the dismal street fifteen minutes later the truck arrived and stopped tzonov had thought it might a moment later the driver came in grinning and slapping his hands together and found the head of soviet ebranch waiting for him the driver wasnt one of tzonovs men but he was a soldier hed seen tzonov in perchorsk and knew that he was a powerful highranking official he saluted as a matter of course and tzonov was into him in a moment you whats your name lance corporal ivanovich sir he was young burly flustered under tzonovs cold penetrating glare he wondered what was going on and what it had to do with him tzonov was looking out into the street after noting that the canvas at the tailgate was flapping loose hed only taken his eyes off the truck for a moment out he snapped back to your vehicle did you stop enroute here and let me warn you ivanovich its best not to lie to me no sir of course not sir yes i did stop but only to warm up a little a minute or two thats all sir they stood at the tailgate open her up tzonov issued his curt instruction and as the soldier was letting down the tailgate is your radio on yes sir didnt you hear them hailing you from perchorsk the complex nothing but static since i left the pass i think its the radio to blame its on its last legs sir tzonov looked into the back of the truck a spare tarpaulin coiled ropes a box of wornout parts from the projekts cranky ventilation system what was your cargo just what you see still mystified the other shrugged im on resupply not delivery i wont be full until i start back from the railway depot in ukhta siggi had finished her coffee and joined them she too looked into the back of the truck but she saw more in there than tzonov had seen he needed eye to eye contact before his talent came into play but with siggi sometimes it was a lot more than just telepathy like now why it was almost as if she could smell nathan in there as if she could taste him feel the rush and whirl of his numbers vortex he wasnt here now but he had been certainly and even now he wasnt that far away tzonov looked at her well nothing she lied he turned to the corporal driver ivanovich were looking for a man the prisoner we were holding at perchorsk its possible he escaped in this truck these tailgate lashings were loose were they like that when you left the complex did you see or hear anything suspicious speak up the tarpaulin was ok when i left perchorsk the soldier answered it probably came loose on its own i wasnt carrying anything anyway and so had nothing to lose sir tzonov had been staring straight into the corporals eyes and knew that hed fumbled the lashings in perchorsk at least he knew that the man suspected that hed fumbled them it meant absolutely nothing damn it to hew he snarled and turned to siggi again and now his eyes were hard and bright as marbles was he here no she lied again and her mindsmog swirled dank and impenetrable whirling away from her and heading for the snowcat tzonov only paused to shout back over his shoulder well then are you coming for gods sake lets get out of here my parka she called after him til be a moment the young soldier went back inside with her as he helped siggi on with her parka she asked him where did you stop about halfway here he told her just to warm up as i said and also also just outside of town but very briefly to let some travellers over the crossing travellers the word riveted her gypsies he nodded theyre late this year or early its hard to tell with the travelling folk they just come and go then looking worried he asked her madame am i in trouble siggi only halfheard him after a moments silence she gave herself a mental shake and answered eh trouble no i shouldnt think so and controlling an urge to laugh hysterically she went outside to tzonov and the snowcat standing some two miles to the north of little kozhva a steepsided knoll of volcanic rock the plug of a oncemighty caldera grew up above the forest some hundreds of feet high the snowcat had skirted its thinly wooded base on the approach to the logging camp now as siggi and tzonov headed north for perchorsk she asked him how much power does this thing have enough to climb that knoll if i climb gradually along the contours and make a complete circuit yes did you want to the view from up there must be quite marvellous very well he grunted however grudgingly it will cost us half an hour but are you still worrying about nathan but im sure that by now theyll have found his hidingplace in the complex or discovered him halffrozen trying to climb out of the ravine perhaps youre right he answered by then the clouds were breaking up and wan beams of sunlight were finding their way from the south they werent much but they cheered tzonov up a little at the top of the knoll while tzonov went off behind a rocky outcrop to relieve himself siggi found binoculars in the snowcats panniers and swept the forested country to the southwest this was why shed wanted to come up here to see if she could catch a glimpse of the travelling folk and there they were the real thing just as they had been for a hundred two hundred five hundred years and more romany pariahs and outcasts suppressed persecuted chased from country to country for all that time a race apart yes yet close and closer to their origins than any other race in the whole world a party of gypsies their halfdozen painted caravans jolting and jingling far beyond the range of audibility but clear as bells in siggis mind as she tried to bring them into focus no she couldnt they were too far away three or maybe four miles running from the winter heading south except something the young corporal had said had stuck in siggis memory being mobile and with their knowledge of the seasons why on earth were they still here they were a secretive even esoteric people true enough and wherever possible would keep clear of the worlds more heavily populated regions but even so by now they should be seven hundred miles further south down on the shore of the caspian in astrakhan or baku or perhaps the black sea moldavia romania yet here they were and only now fleeing the rigours of winter siggi looked around her eyes tracing tzonovs tracks in the snow he was nowhere in sight and again she picked out the thin line of caravans on the fringe of a distant forest unlike tzonov her talent didnt require eye to eye contact she could cast her mind like an arrow if she had a target good luck she sent run far and fast nathan and never come back she didnt for a moment believe he would answer or even that he could but a tendril of numbers touched her consciousness and at once fastened to her thoughts siggis skin prickled as if she stood close to a giant dynamo and in her mind goodbye siggi i wont forget you nathans voice and his unique warmth but so powerful and turkur tzonov was receptive to strong telepathic signals nathan heard that too his carrier probe at once disintegrated the mental ether was clear again and just in time for tzonovs voice came ringing what do you see anything interesting the tone of his voice signalled nothing special siggi sighed her relief and called back smoke from the villages and camps a flight of birds geese i think and some furtive creature in the woods a dog perhaps or a wolf its all very cold out there but its all very peaceful too do you think so he went to the snowcat and started it up well my mind is full of vague premonitions so enough of these sidetracks lets get back to perchorsk all the way back siggi was sad for now she must keep her mind caged behind bars of her own making and thinking of nathan she wondered if he was sad too when they arrived back at perchorsk tzonovs vague premonitions quickly assumed tangible form at the crest of the pass his platoon commander was sitting in the halftracks driving seat with the engine already ticking over waiting patiently for the snowcats return staffsergeant bruno krasin was darkskinned wiry longlimbed thirtyish squarejawed and hardeyed the blood of his cossack forefathers still ran strong in him the son of an old hardline communist and kgb officer krasin was one of tzonovs most trusted men indeed he was the man who would one day lead tzonovs expeditionary force through the perchorsk gate into an alien world on the way down to the complex he told tzonov what had transpired in his absence first our search teams have worked their way through the projekt scrupulously theyve scoured it just as you ordered and the visitor isnt here weve discovered nothing of his whereabouts second it had been snowing in the pass but not too heavily so anyone on the run must leave tracks in the fresh snow you would think so yet there was nothing its as if he simply disappeared and again tzonov remembered who was nathans father but siggi had sworn he didnt have his fathers powers and nathan had seemed cowed and even despondent in captivity i take it your men are still out searching krasin nodded ive sent out search parties into all of the neighbouring villages and camps also and despite that we cleared the trucks heading for beresovo ive sent a motorcyclist after them to doublecheck but in my opinion its all a waste of time something that had to be done but a waste all the same i think he had help tzonov shook his head from here perchorsk impossible who the british oh how when theyve been kept little short of prisoners themselves our agents in the embassies have reported increased esper activity in london but not around here and anyway what could they do krasin had worked frequently with soviet ebranch providing the muscle behind some of tzonovs more covert schemes he vastly admired his talented master but knew that while tzonov was a mindspy he would never make an agent on the ground that is to say an espionage agent in the old sense of the word his talent got in the way he relied on it too heavily he couldnt see the wood for the trees the british have known about this place since its early days he answered from space this has to be the most photographed place in the world they know every track and trail from here north to vorkuta and south to sverdlovsk if they could get a message or a map to the visitor he cant even read tzonov exploded but he can see hes not unintelligent you told me there are no tracks tzonovs frustrations were mounting siggi cut in hes szgany from sunside he knows how to cover his tracks he has avoided the wamphyri in the wild it will be like hunting the invisible man the british tzonov growled this morning i sent a man to wake them up but i didnt tell them hed escaped what so that they could look for ways to assist him on his way anyway they werent fit for much of anything probably still feeling the effects of the drug though by now it should have voided itself he frowned shrugged continued apparently they were like zombies and they didnt appear to know anything i left a message for them i have been called away but i shall be at their disposal upon my return but they are talented krasin insisted and you yourself have frequently stated that their organization is second to none also they have seen the visitor spoken to him and if they havent helped him in some way then why were they so eager to leave what theyre out of here the other wasnt cowed they came on the invitation of gustav turchin and they invoked his name to get out they saw projekt direktor vanadze right after you left and he arranged air transport to moscow by then the jetcopter had returned and of course i had personally supervised the unloading of the machine no he held up a hand the british didnt see it vanadze let them go tzonov couldnt believe it how could he prevent it he asked them to wait until your return but they would have none of that they threatened to speak to gustav turchin himself which turned the trick most admirably the premier is like a puppet his policies tie him inextricably to western economics his political survival is entirely dependent upon the usa united germany and the uk he would have ordered the immediate release of the british and in the process would have given everyone else hell they simply flew out of here it was getting worse the other could only shrug yes there was a british airways hawk from moscow to london at about now it will be seeking a window into heathrow but even if youd been here what could you have done they were guests not prisoners they were threequarters of the way to the bottom of the ravine two hundred feet below them the manmade lake of pent water was a sullen leaden grey tiny flyspeck figures in winter white uniforms moved antlike where they searched icy scree slopes as the halftrack slewed onto the ramp to the staging area in front of the projekts massive security doors tzonov calmed down a little youre absolutely sure they didnt see the machine i am positive sir tzonov took a deep breath then we must brazen it out siggi frowned brazen what out in closing her mind to him so completely she had also denied herself access to tzonovs thoughts the whole thing is a mess tzonov snapped and we will be the ones who take the blame unless we turn events to our own advantage for example the british espers have gone home in a hurry why because theyve been up to no good here that will be our story anyway so what have they been up to well we think they may have helped our alien visitor to escape per haps by acting upon him like a catalyst until he developed his fathers powers and damn it all he slapped the flat of his hand against the halftracks steel door that mightnt be so very far from the truth the doors opened and they drove through and as the halftracks uproar faded into silence and they dismounted tzonov continued to paint his picture of deceit ushering krasin and siggi to one side and talking in a lowered tone now he said how then are we to react but how would we act if our story were entirely true we would be outraged furious what having shown the british every courtesy they repay us with this this treachery then as soon as my back is turned they laugh like hyenas and flee to safety perchorsks staff will back us up they have seen nothing extraordinary in my treatment of trask and goodly also they wouldnt dare go against me but we did drug those two siggi reminded maybe that was a mistake no he shook his head i had to get them out of the way i hoped to move my arsenal hide it away also we were bringing our visitor in through the gate i planned to interrogate him oh a good many things and all without their interference huh anyway its their word against ours they have no proof if they dare to bring charges it will only be as an excuse for fleeing from us when in fact theyre running from their own treachery of course they are for their mission is accomplished theyve unleashed an alien creature upon us with powers we dont understand ah but our response will be to issue a warrant on this nathans life to all intelligence agents in the field terminate on sight and as the americans are wont to say with extreme prejudice deep inside siggi dam shuddered for already it was as if tzonov believed his own fictitious but very plausible scenario a corporal came into the entrance bay from the direction of the duties and control room he came to attention in front of krasin saluted tzonov and took out a slim notepad from a black leather briefcase sergeant he said to krasin you ordered me to search the rooms which the british occupied i did so and found this krasin examined the pad blank its the light the corporal explained but there are impressions well done you can leave it with me krasin dismissed the man in tzonovs rooms the three examined the notepad under a powerful lamp the corporal was quite right using a soft lead pencil tzonov crisscrossed the faint marks until they sprang into sharp relief then what he frowned but in another moment his frown faded and was replaced by a look of partial understanding the drawing was a sign a sigil a flat loop with a half twist in the fhjm of a figure of eight nathans earring more than that siggi breathed thats a mobius strip and theres a connection for a moment she could have bitten her tongue but in the next she reconsidered what something as simple as this a notepad perhaps incriminating left lying casually in trasks room where it was certain to be discovered with harry keogh tzonov had caught on to her line of reasoning i remember now the first time keogh is known to have used teleportation he was visiting the tomb of august ferdinand mobius in leipzig the grenz polizei had trapped and surrounded him but he disappeared only to turn up again at the chateau bronnitsy the then ebranch hq and to wreck it he turned to krasin you were right bruno and this doodle tells all trask has given himself away he would employ exactly the same tactics that the british have used before and send the alien to leipzig in the hope that his necroscope fathers greatest talent will be reborn there except it wont be on the contrary it will die there krasin nodded he wasnt au fait with the keogh files and records but tzonovs enthusiasm for this new clue this promising development was infectious and our next step til have to speak to moscow turchin tzonov answered and he will have to give me carte blanche in this matter but i want this nathan who or whatever dead for after all he glanced at siggi weve already extracted a deal of information from him we no longer have any use for him and so its the safest way to conclude the matter moreover it will deny the british any possible use of his services krasin nodded meanwhile well keep searching and in an everwidening circle why wait until he gets to leipzig exactly tzonov slapped his shoulder very well then lets all of us now agree to act accordingly siggi was last out of his room before leaving she took up the notepad and looked again at the simple telltale sketch but in the privacy of her own room she smiled a secret smile and thought well then mr ben trask mr human liedetector but just because your talent is to discover jies that doesnt mean you cant tell one from time to time eh or sketch one and so you would like to fuck my face would you well i can forgive you for that for i know it was only your way of testing me but if youll settle for a kiss and smiling she blew a kiss across the empty room as they passed through customs at heathrow trask and goodly were met by the spotter frank robinson in his early forties still robinson looked no more than twentyeight or nine his freckles gave him a permanent schoolboy look and his hair was blond as ever he would always seem a young sort of person his presence at the airport served a dual purpose one he was meeting the head of ebranch and a colleague off their plane and two he was keeping his eyes and mind open for other mindspies during the last twentyfour hours there had been a lot of unaccustomed esper activity most of it stemming from the russian embassy it had been quite a while since things were as hot as this during the drive to hq trask wasted no time asking how the branch had known he and goodly were coming home he automatically assumed theyd know almost as much as he did but he was interested in the state of play how are we dealing with the opposition diplomatically robinson answered trask knew what he meant applying pressure to diplomatically immune persons could be difficult but would you like to be a little more specific well one of their best telepaths was getting a bit too close for comfort by the time i spotted him cheeky sod hed booked himself into the hotel downstairs and was listening in from pointblank range we told our friends in special branch about him they picked him up on a moving traffic offence and planted er found some very illegal substances hidden in his car tsktsk hes been confined to the embassy while the minister for foreign affairs looks into it and two more of tzonovs people have been driving round throwing a screen of static at us morning noon and night trying to scramble our probes we havent bothered to counter them its good to know where they are and what theyre up to and their efforts have been pretty useless at best also some of our little yellow friends have been showing a lot of interest in us but since peking and moscow arent in cahoots these days weve simply let them get on with it meanwhile were keeping our eyes peeled so to speak huh trask grunted well i know i should be reassured but im not things feel wrong we could be under surveillance right now by gadget if not by ghost it was a branch injoke the espers talked of the two sides of espionage the gadgets of modern day technology and the ghosts of parapsychology except this time trask wasnt joking but stating a fact for well over thirty years now hitech electronic surveillance had been one of the worlds fastest growing industries the car could be bugged certainly robinson shrugged but its something we live with we cant cover ourselves all of the time we can try trask told him and this time its important as never before so tell me no more for now and ill save what ive got until were home and dry as you will robinson nodded but at least let me tell you this much theres a surprise waiting for you at hq good or bad robinson was negotiating a bend and for a moment couldnt answer lan goodly precog was with trask in the back of the car he was looking out of his window saying nothing perhaps he was hiding his face which wore a grin like a cheshire cat finally robinson answered trasks question good or bad you mean your surprise good i think indeed excellent we shall see trask grunted which was the end of their conversation until the scanners hidden in the walls of the elevator at ebranch hq had cleared them for bugs and they were on their way up then trask said whats the surprise robinson grinned i think shed prefer to speak for herself she trask wasnt in the mood for games and was on the point of saying so when the doors hissed open as they stepped out into familiar surroundings he heard voices from his office at the end of the corridor where the door stood ajar one voice was soft and even a little sibilant for all that its owner was a londoner born and bred david chung who was the actinghead of branch in trasks absence and the other was female and not quite unfamiliar then quite clearly chung said theyre here trask and goodly knew that he could only be referring to them but who was he talking to goodly thought he already knew but would wait and see they werent kept waiting and as she stepped out into the corridor goodly saw how right hed been sometimes the future was worth reading after all trask saw her too and his jaw dropped like a trapdoor zek foener across a distance of a dozen paces ben trask and zek foener checked each other out at first there were differences they looked as different as people do with the passage of time but stepping cautiously towards each other and as the distance narrowed down the years and all the changes fell away zek she was still very beautiful no trask made a mental correction forget the still zekintha foener was beauti ful as simple as that she always had been and he guessed she always would be at five feet nine she was just an inch shorter than he himself but a looker she was something else named by her greek mother after zante zek was slim leggy blonde and blueeyed trask would never forget how shed looked that time out in the greek islands towards the end of the janos ferenczy nightmare that day on manolis papastamoss boat when theyd gone looking for the white ship ferenczys lazarus to send her and her vampire crew to hell zek had worn a yellow bikini consisting of very little and leaving nothing at all to the imagination just like now shed scarcely looked her age but was sleek tanned stunning with her eyes blue as the aegean her hair flashing gold and a smile like a white blaze everyone had agreed that she was a distraction it was intended that she should be a trick shed learned from a wamphyri lady on starside that even when mens eyes are wary for other things still its relatively easy for a beautiful woman to turn them aside and not only the eyes of men but sometimes of monsters too and that was something else well worth remembering that quite apart from her wonderful command of telepathy zek foener was probably the worlds greatest living expert on the wamphyri sourceworld she had actually been there had lived there for long weeks and months with both the travellers and the wamphyri and survived the experience on her own until jazz simmons had found her since when theyd never been apart trask returned to the present zek must be some fifty years old now not that youd ever guess it just from looking at her strange but for all that she and siggi dam were miles apart and not alone in their ages he found it difficult not to compare them perhaps it was because siggi was fresh in his mind or maybe it was simply that their colours and shapes were alike but that was a peripheral comparison lying fuzzy on the edge of his awareness while the rest of it seen closeup that was the difference between a fjord and the cote dazure not so simply put siggi dam was flawless and therefore by human standards imperfect while zek foeners small flaws were what made her perfect for example her mouth whose soft naturally moist lips were just a fraction too full and tended to tremble when she was angry and the uneven jut of her jaw also when she was upset which seemed slightly more prominent on the right unlike siggi and for that matter turkur tzonov too the two halves of zek were a long way short of being mirror images but they did accentuate her humanity trask knew which he preferred he also knew that all of these thoughts were his alone that zek wouldnt betray a trust and read him uninvited for while the mindspies of ebranch worked as closely as possible as one body it was important that they retain their own identities and personalities intact inviolate being a powerful telepath in her own right zek would understand that the code of such people made no allowance for casual snooping at the other end of the spectrum however in the event it became necessary in the performance of their duties then it might be possible theoretically at least to linkup as one entity one talent it hadnt happened yet and never would if it meant permanent damage to identity still trask knew how he found zek and couldnt help wondering how she found him time hadnt been too devastating but neither had it been quite so kind to ben trask ben she finally said and again looked him up and down not too much damage eh if he didnt know better but he did she managed a smile it was wan halfhearted perhaps she was tired i was thinking the same thing he answered about myself i mean but you he shrugged its like yesterday liar her smile was still wan but a nice try when did you get in they touched hands hugged however briefly two hours ago an early morning flight from athens on your own trask raised an eyebrow david chung had joined them from trasks office he was trying hard to catch trasks eye across zeks shoulder but too late zek didnt look away didnt even blink jazz died six weeks ago she said softly something hed been fighting a little less than a year trask squeezed his eyes shut and let out his breath in a slow painful sigh oh zek i he wanted to hold her again but she took a small pace to the rear and cut him off with before jazz died he said he wished that wed tidied things up a bit for harrys sake if for no other reason and thats why youre here she nodded also because i thought i might be needed for almost a week now ive felt that something was going on i mean after harry left us i felt sort of switched off drained depressed but this last five or six days ive felt switched on again david here has filled in a few blanks for me but not everything no of course not because i suppose youll want to clear me you want to work with us it was too good to be true again her nod for now anyway jazz would have wanted me to certainly zeks truth registered in trasks mind youre cleared he said and to chung urgently now where is everyone in ops working watching planning waiting for you we only need your sayso to go in and bring him out trask said bring him out only as a last resort guide him out thats different he looked at zek again have you met everyone are you fed and watered has david looked after you i mean i hate to throw you in at the deep end zek but youre right things are on the move the ice was broken now its last few slivers were melting away and zeks smile was that much brighter she laughed and said ive had the vip treatment but i havent met everyone not yet first lan goodly trask introduced them hes a precog lan i want you to meet zekintha foener goodly offered his thin warm hand an incredible asset she is yes trask agreed but goodly only glanced at him and again looked at zek in that occasionally intense disturbing way of his and said no i meant she will be and starting right now delighted to make your acquaintance zek and dont worry youre going to get on famously with everyone she took to goodly immediately and as they started along the corridor towards ops said you read the future when the future allows it he answered and only then when i cant avoid it the gloomy expression was back on his face is it that bad ill try to explain it to you some time he said maybe when youre settled in and trask barely managed to keep from snorting his frustration it was more of a promise than the precog had made him in twenty years well that wasnt quite true but hed never been so ready willing and able about it there again trask wasnt zek foener vii szgany ferengi introductions took fifteen minutes the actuality of ebranch what its members did what they were their various talents wasnt a problem zek simply accepted it at face value and knew it for a fact in the old days at the end of gregor borowitzs term as head of the opposition and again during ivan gerenkos reign of terror she had worked for soviet ebranch better still shed been a close friend of the necroscope and had seen what he could do and knew what he had been before he left for starside which were qualifications enough then it was time to put them all in the picture including lan goodly things had happened in perchorsk which goodly still didnt know about and trask wondered how he would take being told about them on the other hand perhaps he already knew what trask would talk about things which were plain in trasks hindsight might very well have been known to goodly in advance before the event working with espers was hell trask got them all seated and walked up and down in front of them for a moment or two to get his thoughts in order then to david chung whats the chance of the opposition latching on to any of this very small chung answered things have moved too fast for them if theyd managed to sneak a couple of good telepaths into london in the last twentyfour hours maybe then but they havent what talents they do have are small fry and the best of them has been nailed down in their embassy theyre not even trying to eavesdrop just slinging a little mental mud about trask glanced at zek seated in the front row cocked his head on one side inquiringly she put a hand to her brow and closed her eyes and after a moment nodded and said theres a lot of static about but nothing specific its just so much flak they dont know what to aim at i think i would know if someone was listening right said trask briefly then we went to the perchorsk projekt in the urals to check out a man who had come through the gate to find out if he was a man we went because my opposite number turkur tzonov invited us so we thought but it now turns out we were there mainly because gustav turchin had ordered it tzonov made the best of a bad situation and used us to his own advantage his visitor is a man but by no means an ordinary one and so that you can all stop wondering about it right now this isnt the baby we cared for at branch hq that time who later took his mother to starside and became the dweller and a legend there no for he was only one of harry keoghs sons and this visitor from the gate hes another now im not a telepath but nathan thats his name spoke to me like that telepathically on three separate occasions it takes a powerful sort of mind to do that even when the contact is invited as i invited him also its true that as espers we naturally accept the existence of diverse talents and so make ourselves more accessible to them still nathans talent is something to be reckoned with hes as good and even better than our very best what we talked about in our first two conversations isnt important but the last time trask paused and looked at lan goodly who had been listening intently from the first mention of this previously unsuspected contact that was different it was during last night or early this morning nathans telepathic voice came to me in my sleep but i sensed it was much more than any ordinary dream hed been held a prisoner but had freed himself dont ask me how now he was off and running heading for romania and the second gate his one route home to sunside thats all nathans trying to do get back home again to some unfinished business which he didnt specify and he needed help was there any way i could smooth the way for him take out any obstacles in his path well perhaps i could but even so i told him hed never make it if he got as far as what used to be the romanian border tzonovs men would be waiting for him and tzonov was only the beginning for beyond him there is no way nathan could even get into the resurgence without our help i told him we had the place guarded and even a little about the radujevac refuge but at least were in control out there so there might be something of a chance eventually but right now it was out of the question that he might somehow be able to swim or navigate the underground river to the gate quite impossible no one but harry keogh has ever done it and nathan doesnt have his fathers powers not yet anyway how could he have such powers his people are travellers gypsies always on the move to avoid the wamphyri theyve developed no science as such no numbers we know that the necroscopes thing was a mathematical trick he conjured out of his mind it was metaphysical maths mobius maths which has nothing at all to do with multiplication tables and slide rules nathan has no schooling his fathers numbers are in him certainly but they cant find their way out not unless he gets some expert help i told him we might be able to help him that way and he was interested but hes even more interested in his father harry keogh a man he never knew nathans only a young man but all of his life hes had this weird stuff in him which again he couldnt or wouldnt specify though i could make a pretty shrewd guess and hes never known where any of it came from only the feeling of something incredible waiting just around the corner for him if only he can get it all together so i told him a few things about harry not a lot just enough to illustrate how much we all owed him and i said that while harry never got much of a square deal from the living of this world at least the dead had loved him so much that they would even get up out of their graves for him and when nathan heard that how much the great majority had loved his father and some of the things theyd done for him that was when i knew i had him but dont think i take any pride in it and dont get me wrong i havent hooked into him like a fish and i dont intend to play him like one either now that ive met nathan and know him i just think hes entitled to some of the breaks that harry didnt get thats all what im saying is this if we do manage to get him out of there its for him not for us the only satisfaction well get out of it is knowing that tzonov hasnt got him but after that its nathans choice trask let everything hed said so far sink in then continued when i woke up this morning i knew our business was done in perchorsk and the best thing would be to get out of there and see if we could help r nathan from outside and thats what were doing again he looked at goodly but spoke to everyone so you see all of this stuff that passed between nathan and me is news even to lan goodly here because if i had told him about it then thered be another mind to leak it goodly said nodding yes of course i understand right trask said so now lets talk some more about tzonov well lan and i snooped around in the perchorsk projekt and saw some pretty worrying stuff enough that we think tzonov is going to be a real problem and not only to us hes already ticking like a political timebomb in his own country and gustav turchins the only one who doesnt seem to hear him yet or we hope he doesnt but if turchins in on it well so much for all the gjasnost hes been engaging in for the fact is tzonovs got an arsenal at perchorsk and there can only be one reason why lan and i saw the gate and we can tell you that its locked up safer than the doors on the bank of england just like nathan anything that comes through is going to be trapped and dealt with at the discretion of the people at this end so no need to worry about any sort of invasion from starside but maybe we do need to concern ourselves about an invasion in the other direction now heres the problem how to stop it how can we tell turchin what we suspect if hes in on it will he want to stop it or will he consider sunsidestarside a new soviet territory ripe for conquest and exploitation if the latter and he lets tzonov go ahead how will that work out for the rest of us the russians have made some pretty big errors in the past several of which continue to affect the world even today chernobyl and the aral sea are just two examples but to mess with something as dangerous as the gate lost for words trask shook his head pandoras box just isnt in the same league david chung spoke up what will you do trask shrugged pass on all we know to our minister responsible and let him take it from there eventually it should get back to turchin and hopefully hell be able to deal with it if hes not in on it and if he is he wont which means that at some time in the future we might have to deal with it ourselves he hitched himself up on the edge of the briefing podium right thats me done for now there will be a detailed report later which i expect all of you to read and now its your turn what have you lot been up to chung stood up i tracked you to perchorsk just to keep an eye on you and incidentally theres some very heavy opposition static up there in the urals siggi dam trask nodded shell be in my report too but i interrupted you im sorry please go on this talent the latent power you felt in nathan chung continued this weird stuff as you named it it was what i sensed and zek too even before he was through the gate the closer he got to our world the more we felt his presence and thats where we hold an ace card over tzonov namely me chung grinned tzonov doesnt have a firstrate locator one or two secondraters but nothing nearly as good as me and i have my own crystal ball he held up harrys hairbrush now that nathans through the gate its like this thing has come alive if it was a lodestone nathan would be due north i can locate ive been locating him far easier than anything i ever did before trasks sigh of relief was clearly audible but i hope youve been careful he said in a moment god knows we dont want the opposition using you as a carrier beam chung shook his head ive kept my tracking to a minimum a glance at a time but i can go to the map board and show you where he is i mean right now thats what i was talking about when i said we could bring him out under cover of darkness a stealth helicopter a team of sas men and me wed be in and out before the comrades even knew we comrades trask held up a hand and thats what i meant when i said we could guide him out but go in and snatch him the way youre talking anyone would think were at war were not not even a cold war in fact with gustav turchin in the chair we never had it so good which is why we darent go stirring it up now but if we can get nathan closer to the border suddenly trask couldnt resist it shrugging himself down from the podium he headed for the map board and said show me where he is chung beat him to it got there as the huge screen flickered into life he held harry keoghs old hairbrush tightly in his left hand reached up his right hand and placed it flat on the screen in an area to the west of the northern urals then he closed his eyes a smaller screen inset at the bottom right of the wall screen blurred into grey life waiting to indicate a specific region the map overall was sensitive but wouldnt react to chungs entire palm only to a finger and as chungs brow creased into a tight frown and his eyes screwed yet more tightly shut so he drew his fingers together until his hand was raised up and only the index finger touched the screen there he said the inset screen snapped into a clear detailed chart of the indicated area a grid some tenbyten miles trask pressed the hold button chung removed his hand the small magnified area on the inset screen defined nathans location an area of woodland forest trails frozen marshes so hes somewhere in there trask mused his eyes rapt on the screen no not somewhere chung wasnt known for his modesty in matters such as this hes dead centre in the next moment both men became aware of the perfume of a third person close behind them zek foener david she said ben do you remember that time in rhodes harry was in the carpathians and we wondered how he was doing the two men looked at each other then at zek and trask said you want to establish contact why not she was deadly serious you want to guide him out of there dont you and you know that the longer it takes the greater the danger even now his chances are slimming down so if we can reach him and if hes willing trask pulled at his chin the other espers had gathered round were watching intensely do it trask said but if you do get through make it as brief as possible first establish contact then well work out details which you can relay later trask had seen all of this before but it was new to some of the others zek closed her hand over chungs with the hairbrush still in it and he touched the fingertips of his right hand to the centre of the small screen then they closed their eyes breathed deeply and concentrated concentrated and gasped in unison zeks hand flew from chungs both of them staggered back away from the wall screen trask caught their arms steadying them but when zek looked at him he saw her expression change from a look of astonishment to one of wonder and numbers she said he may not know how to use them but theyre part of him anyway certainly he knows how to hide behind them oh yes thats him trask said snatching a breath and it surprised him with all of his experience to discover that hed actually been holding it but he is hiding zek repeated shielding his mind and his shield is very powerful if im to get through i shall need help trask knew what she meant a group effort of concentrated will and as she and chung stepped closer to the screen so the espers clustered to them linked hands and formed a semicircle with zek chung and trask at its centre and now trasks hand too covered those of the telepath zek and the locator chung and once again chung made contact with the screen and with nathan but this time they were ready zek forced her telepathic probe straight into and through the whirling wall of nathans numbers vortex his mind at first surprised then afraid was revealed to her who a friend she sent even as i was your fathers friend my father the necroscope harry keogh for a single moment the vortex was reinforced it whirled that much harder faster and threatened to hurl her out but in the next it collapsed and at its core nathan was a wondering child and zek sighed for to her touch his mind was the image of his fathers in the long ago warm vulnerable innocent but that had always been the paradox and never more than at the end harry keogh vampire and vulnerable a necro scope who talked to dead people yet warm a man with the powers of a destoying angel even an angel of death but innocent he read these things and more and knew that she had known his father but who was she she opened her secret mind and now it was nathans turn to gasp zek his astonishment rang in her mind lardiss helllander friend he still speaks of you you were there with the travellers in sunside you fought alongside the szgany in the battle for the dwellers garden before i was born she formed a picture for him of what it had been like and there was no disguising the fact that she had been there for no one who didnt know the wamphyri could ever attempt so vivid a description or conjure such depths of loathing but then her womans curiosity took over how old are you nathan he told her and now zek could see it all when the dweller returned jazz and myself home when he brought us back here harry stayed behind a while in your world nathan took it up my father hzak kiklu at least he was the one i was always led to believe was my father had been mortally wounded he was dead but my mother zek sensed nathans confusion the wound that was opening in him a feeling of betrayal and was quick off the mark to counter it nona kiklu your mother still alive and well but shes an incredibly brave woman nathan oh yes i remember nona it was the aftermath she was lonely and had suffered a lot but harry had suffered too and in a way hed lost more than anyone so they were two of a kind thrown together by forces beyond their control except jm sure there was a jot more to it than just that zek tried to be as understanding yet as honest as circumstances allowed they must have fajjen in jove she could feel trasks grip tightening on her wrist and heard his whisper in her ear get out of there dont jeopardize him youve jured me nathan was very quiet now almost accusing i have to know everything and you knew i woujd nathan she answered you know trask his mind is an open book he reads truth in men surejy you read the truth in him youjj come to no harm with us we wont use you and from now on wont intrude upon you again unjess you ask me to there was a long pause and then what do you want me to do where must i go ijj get back to you soon zek told him with a glad sigh pjease be ready that night the gypsies made camp in a forest on the edge of a frozen marsh twenty miles east of kozhva in the caravan of their old leathery leader nathan was an honoured guest from the moment hed spotted them from his hiding place in the back of the supply vehicle out of perchorsk nathan had known that these were his people they were almost indistinguishable from the szgany of sunside that had come as a shock to him to find such people here and an even greater shock to hear their spoken language which had more of the sunside tongue in it than the russian he had been learning in perchorsk languages were easy for nathan matching spoken words to mindpictures was a simple device which hed learned from the desertdwelling thyre in their colonies south of sunside thus almost from his first fumbled conversation with the men of the caravans understanding had been mutual and friendship inevitable but he had sensed that meeting up with them was far more than just a matter of good fortune it had seemed almost predestined so that now he asked the old chief how did you know the other cocked his head on one side and winked he was all darkstained leather a glint of gold tooth a plain gold ring in the lobe of his right ear and more gold on his fingers but no silver ah and so you sensed that did you that wed been waiting for you the old man chuckled well thats my secret its why im the chief of course nathan could look inside his head if he wanted to but he wouldnt that was something else hed learned from the thyre that except in circumstances of mutually agreed intercourse between friends or colleagues or in times of extreme danger to the community as a whole the privacy of the individual was ever sacrosanct a glance might be permissible acceptable almost unavoidable but never the wholesale ransacking of a minds contents in a nutshell it was unseemly to steal the private thoughts of others when simple speech would suffice a person must always be given the opportunity to speak his mind it was why nathan had restricted the use of his telepathy to learning the language of these travellers they knew nothing of his mentalism nor would he enlighten them for if he should appear too clever if he knew or understood too much too soon it could well distance them and in the event of their rejection if they were to brand him a thoughtthief eventually he might find himself deprived not only of their friendship but possibly of his liberty too nathan still thought in sunsidestarside terms and probably always would so he said nothing but simply sat and waited and was at last rewarded in some small measure at least when finally the weathered old chief said there are some strange places in the world dont you think i know very little of the world nathan answered after a moments thought in what way strange what places do you mean oh just places the old chief shrugged puffed on his clay pipe and continued to be vague he didnt appear concerned about his guests obvious ignorance his lack of knowledge generally or even his occasionally strange manner of expression im talking about the old places you know the timeless old places places the szgany know some of the szgany anyway and which they visit from time to time places theyve always visited nathan wasnt sure how best to answer that and so returned to studying his surroundings the caravan was similar to vehicles hed seen on sunside four wheels beastdrawn varnished and painted with intricate flowing designs central to the interior a woodburning stove stood on legs which were bolted to the floor a fireblackened flue went up through a metal collar to a cowled chimney in the roof festooned on the outside with all sorts of pots and pans and other implements that jingled and gonged when it moved it had a curving roof of varnished boards in place of the waterproofed hides which nathan was used to other than that and especially here in the forest he might fancy himself back on sunside but no it was far too cold for sunside and these people were only the descendants of true travellers nathan saw that now knew that it must be so and wondered how long since the first of them had accompanied their banished wamphyri masters out of starside and into these helllands then they had been thralls and now were free so what of their old masters im a ferengi did you know the old man grinned nathan gave a small start perhaps his unspoken question had been answered on sunside the name had been a curse since time immemorial of course for among the wamphyri there had always been creatures of that selfsame ilk ferenc ferenczy ferengi in all its forms the name was an evil invocation vladi ferengi aye the chief nodded last of a long long line the very last for my woman was barren or maybe i was he grinned and patted the front of his baggy trousers this firm old friend steamed hot enough in the romp but his issue was cold and dead maybe but what does it matter eh i have no sons and thats the end of it my people will stop going there to the strange places you mean that you wont be here to lead them there nathan was curious now thats right i wont be here to hear the call an idea was beginning to take shape all of this seems to connect up nathan said you are trying to explain something which you yourself dont understand in the hope that i might understand it for you and maybe i do well some of it but first you must tell me are the szgany ferengi an old people how long have you been here my grandfathers greatgreatgrandfather was a ferengi aye the old one answered thats as far back as i care to trace the line but ive no doubt that he would say the same if he were here now how long you ask ive seen the ferengi device carved in the mountains of the khorvaty which is one of the strange places but such a device eh and old as the mountains themselves nathan knew the sigil he referred to hed seen it carved in the timber frame of vladis caravan skilfully disguised in the intricate but flowing designs that were painted there the head of a devil with crimson eyes bifurcate tongue and grinning jaws that dripped gouts of blood he put the picture aside and said the khorvaty do you mean back there that place in the pass perchorsk where i came from eh ah no not there only feelings there nathan and recent ones at that a dozen or two of years at best feelings my son which have spawned nothing i thought that perhaps this time he shrugged but it was only you nathan nodded things continued to connect however dubiously he didnt much care for the connection but must pursue it anyway perhaps he could accelerate the process should i tell you a word a name the chief raised an eyebrow by all means wamphyri it had the desired effect an emissary vladi leaned forward and grasped nathans arm his astonishing speed belying his age you are from them their messenger between the worlds the old ferengi is dead long jive the ferengi now quickly tell me what message does he send and when will he come nathan saw it all now vladi and his people were descended from wamphyri supplicants and suddenly his skin crawled under the old chiefs gaze and touch but he mustnt show it and anyway it wasnt their fault they didnt know couldnt possibly remember after all this time the true nature of the being or beings they still waited to serve as their fathers fathers had served before them forsaking ethics for a moment nathan allowed himself a single glimpse behind the old chiefs eyes and saw the figure of a great man hands on hips toweringly benevolent and all the worlds travellers at his feet under his care prosperous in their gleaming painted caravans and proudly flying his banner the devils head with its crimson eyes forked tongue and spattered gouts of blood but in the light of the latter perhaps vladi and his people werent so innocent after all youre waiting for the ferengi nathan said but very slowly and carefully i can only tell you this that he they would come if only they could be sure of their reception it was true enough he was sure but to himself except they believe this place is hell and i shall never enlighten them ahhh the old man released nathans arm and fell back in his seat against the caravans side but do they think we have forgotten them for a moment his huge black eyes were empty but then they brightened surely the ferengi would not send you here without that they could recall you when and how will you go back from where will you depart to reassure the lords of their glorious reception here before nathan had spoken a halftruth now he must lie outright or at least shape his answer carefully to disguise his real purpose but since hed now associated these supplicant travellers with the wamphyri he shouldnt find too much difficulty in lying there are gates between worlds he said back in perchorsk there was one such but i may not go back that way now tell me where are the other strange places do they wait for you there vladi was excited again he tapped rapidly upon the side of his veined nose producing a hollow drumming sound and said i know them these gates and the strange places which contain them only tell me where you would go and we will take you there ah but my route may be circuitous there is information i must gather along the way before i can go back you must not question me ahhh now we understand each other but do you see why i was cautious these things of which we speak they are not ordinary things nathan relaxed a little so the travelling folk you and your people have waited all these years without number for the wamphyri the ferengi to return and lead you to greatness but what of the old ferengi who brought you here gone the others voice was a sad empty sigh turned to dust in their crumbling castles or stiffened to stones in their unmarked tombs or burned to ashes in the fires of men they are no more men hunted them down perhaps these helllands deserved their name after all hell for the wamphyri at least i wont speak of it vladi shook his head the szgany ferengi remain true when you return you must tell them this that we remember them still and will always be true to their memory while i live at least his ancient voice tapered away and nathan could see that he was tired but before he would let him sleep or sleep himself you still havent told me how you knew the old man reached up and tapped his nose again winked opened the palm of his hand to show its deep etched lines i read things in the lines in flights of birds in the mists of the earth i see things hear things know things which other men can never know i have feehngs voices call to me out of the winds the planets that travel through the skies direct my travels the waters of my ears and brain are lured even as the moon lures the tides and as the ferengis true blood of life was in my father so my fathers blood is in me ah for the blood is the life the old chief stood up turned down the lamp and in the glow from the stove stepped to his bed beside the door nathan went to his own bed a narrow bench at the back of the caravan and curled up there so old vladi was a seer a fortuneteller he read future times but he wasnt a mentalist and nathan knew that he could leave his mind unguarded so that zek could come to him before sleeping vladis whisper reached out to nathan in the dark about your route when will you know which path to follow in the autumn because i sensed that something was happening in the old places i instructed my people to lay in food for men and beasts alike so that we might winter in the caves of the foothills but now its cold out here in the open and we may not stay too long maybe in the morning nathan answered come sunup im sure ill know by then they will speak with you you think someone will yes ahhh and to prove it long after the old chief began to snore nathan lay awake waiting and listening for that someone it was so obvious that ben trask wondered why they hadnt seen it from square one but having wondered hed known the answer to that too that mindspies are not spies in the classic sense uf the word david chung had been pretty close with his suggestion that they go in with a team of specialists but it wasnt until trask got in touch with the minister responsible and he in turn spoke to others on a similar level in the corridors of power that everything came together chungs sort of specialists wouldnt be required a different type of specialist was already in place for fifteen years now the west had been helping sort out russias problems ever since those three momentous days the th th and st of august when as the result of a bungled coup against the then president mikhail gorbachev oldstyle communism had died a wellearned death and signalled the giddy ascent of two hundred and fifty million oppressed people to freedom and a true democracy but while the mailed fist and the apparatus of the old state were mainly absent now the helping hand of the west remained extended and its influence was never more in evidence west of the urals in the chill sparsely populated foothills of the timanskiy kryazh near izhma american geosatellites had detected evidence of oil and gas fields which might well rival those at ukhta in the south exploratory drilling had started two years ago satellite predictions had been confirmed the angloamerican consortium would collect its very reasonable fee and pull out in two to three years time as per the contract leaving other western outfits to complete the pipeline and from then on the russians would pay a royalty or percentage in perpetuity meanwhile the hardhats were still there working in situ and resupplied on a regular basis by jetcopter out of stockholm via helsinki why not from moscow or sverdlovsk or from the longestablished fields east of the urals in beresovo and ustbalyk but if the soviets had retained that sort of technological capacity or knowhow following their industrial economic and ideological collapse then the west would never have been allowed in in the first place part of a western aid programme agreed in the early s the izhma projekt was only one of many hundreds of schemes in progress right across the old ussr from the black sea to the kamchatka peninsula and from novaya zemlya to irkutsk now a small portion of that huge debt in the shape of a wanderer from another world would flow the other way but with any luck the russians would never know of the repayment except maybe our luck just ran out zek said worriedly it was a little after am gmt in london and about am local in the woods west of kozhva where her call had shocked nathan from his sleep shed kept it short told him to head due west for izhma and what to look for then almost too hurriedly shed pulled out now zeks face was drawn and not only from concentration ben trasks voice echoed her concern when he asked what is it zek unless i miss my guess she answered there were other minds out there scanning around looking for nathan and one of them was female and powerful most of the other branch members were present including lan goodly he said that would be siggi dam shes their very best it was hardly reassuring likewise zeks but there was more than just that one and at least one of the others was a locator i think his probe wasnt telepathic anyway the reason they had chosen this hour was a simple matter of human frailty espers need sleep as much as other people and the oppositions agents no less than anyone else at five in the morning people were at a low ebb there was a flaw in that line of reasoning of course namely that turkur tzonov would understand the principle too but it had been a calculated risk trask said do you think they overheard you not overheard as such but they might have sensed my presence just as i sensed theirs trask looked at a blowup of the area superimposed on the large screen terrain he queried of no one in particular fairly flat someone spoke up hard ground and a few woodland trails some moorland and frozen marsh but plenty of cover in bands of dense boreal forest climate cold enough to freeze the antlers off an iron elk but nathan is hardy zek said a traveller in the company of his own kind shed taken that from nathans mind in a blurred rushed sequence but i wonder what on earth were they doing up there those gypsies lets just be thankful they were there said trask and weather frozen snow on the ground the same researcher replied and according to the finn weather station at kotka a lot more of it on the way but just soft steady snow maybe we should also be thankful that its not going to be a blizzard its due to start in two hours time and keep going for a day and a half in any case the supply plane wont leave stockholm until its over oh really trask grunted well in that case ive got some bad news for the pilot the first hint of a break in the weather and hes airborne he glanced at chung and david i want you to get some sleep tomorrow morning youre with me on the first flight to stockholm then obviously i want you on that supply plane to izhma if our man is coming in out of the cold i dont want him getting lost trask looked at the other espers and smothered a yawn as for getting your heads down with the exception of duties the same goes for all of you he stretched his shoulders and eased his neck i dont know about anyone else but im dead on my feet time we called it a day and as they started to disperse thanks for being here everyone in a matter of minutes he and zek were alone and especially you he told her thanks for being here your coffee is dreadful she said but david booked me in at the hotel down below and theirs is quite good we could talk about harry maybe for a while trask looked at her she looked as tired as he felt and this was her first time in england a very capable woman zek but right now she must feel lonely as hell so did he come to think of it but then he had for most of his life sure he nodded a nightcap would be great they drank coffee in zeks hotel room and talked awhile about everything and nothing until zek fell asleep fully clothed on her bed then trask pulled a cover over her put the light off and returned to his easy chair and when she gave him a shake it was morning viii not quite hej and sheer hell in the uncomfortable noisy confines of the jetcopters passenger cabin siggi dam studiously avoided the thoughts of her closest travelling companion and reflected upon the events of the last two days back in perchorsk turkur tzonov had been coldly furious for some thirtyodd hours now in a way this had suited siggi well enough she had been more than satisfied to steer clear of him but even on the few occasions when they had come together accidentally shed not dared to look into his mind for some reason tzonov now demanded the same degree of mental privacy as siggi herself he would know it if she attempted to spy on him and she didnt want to give him any excuse to use similar tactics on her siggi knew how stupid shed been and how incredibly fortunate stupid in what she had done and fortunate in that she hadnt been found out but surely tzonovs failure to discover her treachery meant that he was stupid in his turn or at the very least blind the latter was true she knew his egomania blinded him preventing him from seeing the truth but if the time should ever come when he did see it in the evening following their return from kozhva esper assistance had arrived from moscow in the shape of two lesser telepaths and a locator the latter was a thinfaced effeminate weasel of a man named alexei yefros siggi knew him through their work and disliked him intensely despite his suspect sexual proclivities yefros was a misogynist with an especially ugly sadistic streak fully aware of siggis telepathic range still on those several previous occasions when theyd met he had not once attempted to camouflage thoughts which could only be likened to a cesspool an admirer and close confidant of turkur tzonov he was ruthless ambitious and extremely dangerous since the arrival of the espers tzonov had kept himself closeted with them in his makeshift operations suite just off the control room siggi had not been privy to their conversations but she did know that tzonov had spoken at some length to premier turchin and that hed been given what amounted to a free hand in the matter of nathans pursuit and recapture with one important exception tzonov had wanted authority to bring the fugitive back dead or alive but turchin had insisted that nathan be taken alive it was the human rights issue of course gustav turchin was still cleaning the political mud of a very messy century off russias boots so that the last thing he wanted now was the blood of an innocent on his hands the night after nathans escape siggi had found sleep impossible tossing and turning in her bed for long hours at a stretch only halfsleeping at best finally she had given it up for a bad job rising well before dawn and dressing in her warmest clothing shed ventured out into the greymisted ravine there relieved of perchorsks claustrophobia and satisfied that tzonov and the others were asleep shed extended a tentative telepathic probe across the mountains and beyond kozhva deep into the woodlands where the gypsy caravans had been the faint ethereal dreams of loggers trappers and villagers all were there but she had searched for something else and she had found it like a spiral of mental static from some weird computer mind briefly she believed that she had touched upon nathans sleeping thoughts only to discover that someone else was touching them too a telepathic mind feminine wary clever and benevolent but who british ebranch to siggis knowledge there was only one female telepath in british espionage a spinster called millicent cleary but she was sure that this wasnt her no for this one was a woman entire experienced in every sense of the word all of this from a mere touch it said a lot for siggis talent and even more for the talent of the other for in the selfsame moment that siggi had become aware of the stranger so that one had sensed siggi and not only siggi then made suddenly aware of other talented minds awake and watchful in the night afraid that they might recognize hers siggi had withdrawn her thoughts and returned quickly to her room and lying there in the dark with the weight of the mountain once more pressing down on her shed wondered but if turkur is using these people out of moscow in this way why isnt he using me was it her punishment for defying him temporary exclusion from his schemes or would it be more permanent because he no longer trusted her finally she had slept but her dreams had been strange furtive things in which she was pursued across the ridgy grey landscape of a throbbing gigantic brain by blackwinged inquisitorial thoughts with the piercing eyes talons and beaks of carrion crows and the echoes of their cries were still ringing afar when she started awake so that with tzonov and his espers so close she had wondered was it perhaps more than just a dream the invasion of sleeping minds would be common enough practice among espers such as these and there had been times in siggis past when her own duties were such that that she no longer had the right to complain that morning yesterday tzonov had been up and about at first light and his first act had been to cancel the searchparties scheduled for duty in the regions to the east of the pass but even as hed ordered the jetcopter made ready for a mission to the west of the mountains and sought siggi out to take her with him so it had started to snow and heavily the flight had been cancelled which had served to determine tzonovs mood for the rest of the day as for siggi she had never been happier to see bad weather and the snow had stayed and stayed not a blizzard but a continuous fall that blanketed the sky turned the entire pass white and forbade absolutely any kind of aerial search or reconnaisance which tzonov might otherwise contemplate as the day had progressed so siggis worries about her standing with the head of russias ebranch had receded somewhat with every hour that passed nathan was getting farther away and discovery of her own involvement less likely also and despite premier turchins orders to the contrary she knew that if tzonov did track the fugitive down his men would be just as likely to shoot him as take him prisoner later they would write corroborative reports to show how he had resisted arrest and they had been obliged to use force on the other hand tzonov might decide it was best if nathan disappeared altogether presumed fled to the west in which event his riddled body could be dumped into a deep ravine somewhere and no chance of any blame ever attaching to turkur tzonov anything in order to stop nathan falling into the wrong hands to prevent his return to sunsidestarside or to exact a measure of vengeance in repayment for a bruised ego and a few days of intense embarrassment but a mans life it seemed a lot of repayment to siggi shed tried arguing with herself tried telling herself that she too would benefit from nathans death but damn it to hell shed known him however briefly and been changed by knowing him she would never be able to erase him the innocence of nathans mind from her memory now she wouldnt want to erase it so yesterday had dragged itself relentlessly by the sky had unloaded its burden and siggis depression had returned to deepen like the snow in the pass tzonov had arranged that she have dinner with him and his cronies siggi ate very little kept her thoughts guarded from start to finish sensed their hostility generally and suffered alexei yefross seething deviantly carnal glances especially she could sense the locators rabid weasel mind loathsomely at work behind his glittering black eyes where they stripped away her clothing and she shuddered not so much because he wanted her but for the ways in which he would like to use her finally the meal had been over and siggi could flee back to her room the days events had exhausted her and though she was half afraid of sleep still she had no choice mercifully the previous nights dreams were not recurrent at least not until this morning that was when shed discovered that even wide awake still one may nightmare the nightmare was this that the bad weather was clearing and tzonov anticipated that by pm the jetcopter would be cleared for takeoff he and yefros had a lead on the fugitive and would search for him west of kozhva and siggi would accompany them yefros would attempt to locate him and siggi would home in on yefross probe for a more positive identification this shouldnt prove too difficult for her for as tzonov delighted in reminding her shed already made nathans acquaintance now it was pm and kozhva lay to the east more than fifty miles behind them tzonov was crammed up front with the pilot and copilot and siggi shared the passenger cabin with alexei yefros his were the thoughts she studiously avoided and his the probe she could sense sweeping out from him like ripples on a pool or some personal psychic asdic searching for nathans fugitive identity yefros was good over kozhva suddenly he had come alive and pointed out of a window in a direction a little south of west that way hes there he throws off equations like a smokescreen which only serve to give him away but on sunside and especially in starside in that largely innumerate world of vampires such numbers would have cloaked him admirably the wamphyri home in on fear sweat and blood nathans numbers would appear as a screen of mental static to them a guess still it fell only a little short of the mark but here in this world here its a traitor a scent for the hounds spoor for the hunter tzonov had been studying his smallscale map complaining bitterly about its inaccuracies but in a moment his eyes had narrowed fumbling his way back into the passenger cabin he repeated yefros west and a little south and stabbing a finger at the map you mean the luza river izhma and sizyabsko and after that a lot of frozen marshland are you sure but is he just running wild theres nothing there yefros had glanced at the map then stared at it and his weasel eyes had opened wide izhma hed gasped then izhma the new oil field eh british and american engineers russian workers yefros had continued theyre opening the place up big news a year or two ago it promised riches galore another fine example of eastwest cooperation like the french hydroelectric scheme on the volga hah foreign brains and russian muscle it makes me sick but once a goal is achieved people forget the day is coming when well kick all of these bastards out and then it will all be ours british and amer tzonovs mouth had fallen open and theyre still there about all that is there yefros had told him then tzonovs eyes had bulged as he dug a scrap of paper from his pocket balled it in his fist and tossed it aside and siggi had supposed it was trasks mobius strip sketch confirming her suspicion ahhh trask tzonov had snarled damn the smart bastard a sprat to catch a mackerel or a red herring siggi had kept the thought to herself damn him to hell tzonov had been furious he threw me off the track at least until you and the others got here but do you see the alien isnt heading for leipzig or the romanian gate no hes heading for london england via izhma or at least he thinks he is then hed gone up front to speak to the pilot and siggi had been left alone with yefros but the locators mind was on his job as the jetcopter forged west he probed ahead siggi was able to relax a little and not worry what he was thinking about when his eyes met hers for a while at least fifteen minutes later tzonovs shout had reached back from the cockpit we have another aircraft on our screens on the radio too swedish and the pilot has just requested permission to land at the izhma projekt hes landing there right now siggi had felt things coming to a head tzonov was busy yefros too doing his own thing she grasped the opportunity of the moment and sent her thoughts speeding ahead for after all that was what she was here for what she was supposed to be doing but now she felt that she must confirm or deny tzonovs suspicions if only to relieve her own tension except there was no relief for he was right nathan was dead ahead and not only nathan but also a locator yefros had shouted chung id know that probe of his anywhere theyre converging the alien and this british esper dog turkur youre right that chopper is here to lift our quarry out in the cockpit tzonov had cursed and snapped a command at the pilot vanes tilting forward the jetcopter had raced west but too late the frontier town of izhma had blurred by below and a series of wooden bridges crossing a frozen river then marsh and forest and down in the woods siggi had spied gypsy caravans trundling south but up ahead only two more miles to the izhma projekt its skeletal derricks already clearly visible on the grey horizon and rising up from a smoky huddle of cabins and construction shacks where the black scar of a pipeline sprawled like a dark metal snake in the woods a powerful jetcopter with swedish id rapidly gaining altitude it had been on the ground for no more than ten to fifteen minutes scarcely time to unload anything but more than enough to take on a passenger modern and built for speed the swede would have no trouble outdistancing its dated russian counterpart but in any case what good would it do to chase it finally the recent past caught up with the present to siggi it felt so unreal things had happened so fast it came as a genuine shock to realize that she was here right here and now with tzonov and yefros holding her breath as nathan escaped for the second time she couldnt be mistaken she knew he was aboard the swedish aircraft his numbers vortex felt so close it was almost visible in the eye of her mind swirling like the foreign jetcopters exhaust as its blades retracted into their housing and its thrusters rotated from the vertical to the horizontal then are we armed that was tzonov screaming at the pilot and the pilot looking at him as though he were mad of course they werent armed this was a military machine true but it belonged to ebranch not to the army or airforce its weapon systems had been stripped on handover tzonov must know that surely he did but on this occasion hed actually wanted to be wrong and if they had been armed what then siggi felt sick tzonov wasnt just a radical but radically insane she was sure of that now she looked out through her flexon window and watched the swedish machine picking up speed racing west into a lowering sky and on impulse opening her mind she sent after it good luck nathan if the szgany have a god im sure he will be with you all she got back was a whirling confusion of thoughts no numbers vortex now for nathan had other things to think about in his own world a majority of flying things were creatures to fear and in this one for the moment at least he was no less afraid of the jetcopter she tried again and fired one last deeppenetrating thought its ail right youll be safe now perhaps nathan heard her siggi would never know for sure but feeling a furtive movement behind her and noticing what she really ought to have noticed a moment ago before she sent that final thought the knowledge fell on her like a peal of thunder that someone else had most certainly heard it tzonovs hand closed over hers on the arm of her chair his eyes reflected in the flexon window bored into hers his twisted smile was as mad as any she ever saw as he whispered in her ear and so hell be safe will he well yes i suppose he will but what odds for after all well get what we wanted from him all youve told me so far and all youve yet to tell me but turkur she turned to him ah no he held up a hand tuttutted turned his glistening quivering furiously grinning face away say nothing siggi not now save it for later i just know youre going to have so much more to say later almost convulsively she reached inside her parka but yefros had come over from his side and was jabbing the muzzle of his gun in her ribs under her right breast oh yes please do he told her sibilantly it would give me a great deal of pleasure i assure you even then just for a moment siggi felt undecided she knew that any pleasure it might give yefros the sadist now would probably be far easier to bear and over and done with a lot more quickly than what she might reasonably anticipate from him in tzonovs threatened later but finally releasing her breath in a long sigh she slumped back and shrank down in her seat worse was coming certainly but where theres life well maybe there could be a little hope even now yefross unpleasantly slim hand was cold and threatening and lingering against her flesh as he carefully reached inside her parka searched and took her tiny gun from its secret place between her breasts and the touch of those fingers however inarticulate told far better than words how slim was the element of hope which was all siggi had left from the moment he escaped from perchorsk nathan had been a fugitive but for the last thirtysix hours ever since zek foener contacted him with her instructions hed never been more aware of it for he too had sensed the other intelligences which homedin on her probe hed guessed their source and had known they would come after him the snow had saved him hed seen snow before albeit infrequently on those rare occasions when the barrier mountains turned white and even sunside was bitterly cold through its long dangerous nights twice as a child hed seen it and once as a youth when an avalanche had brought down ten thousand tons of the stuff to strip the mountain naked of trees in a wide swath and fill the gap behind lardiss knoll almost to its brim but even that had been nothing compared to this the snows of this world seemed to go on forever and its cold in these northern regions was far worse than that of starside in the hours before sunup nathan was hardy it was true but without vladi and his travellers he would never have made it for all that their ancestors had been wamphyri supplicants when the parting of the ways had come at last he knew he was in their debt with the last flurry of snow where denselygrown woods offered nathan cover to the west while the route of the travellers would take them far south to the temperate regions they craved he and the gnarled szgany chief had hugged and stood off awhile saying nothing then nathan had felt ill at ease for what small deceptions hed been obliged to work but at the last when vladi reminded him of his vow to carry his message of welcome back to the vampire lords in their own place then thered been nothing else for it but to lie again and say that he would beneath the pines the ground was mainly clear avoiding the occasional drift nathan had headed west until the trees petered out and gave way to frozen marsh by then the spindly derricks of the izhma projekt had been visible and a strange dull thunder in the sky clearly audible he had watched in awe and not a little fear as a flying machine came down through the clouds like some giant mosquito settling towards the huddle of buildings and because his attention was riveted to it nathan had recognized the aircraft as the source of yet another mental probe which while it was not telepathic nevertheless served to confirm his location shortly as he struggled through a deep drift out in the open a snowcat had come skimming and this time the source of the probe was riding pillion david chung had helped nathan up behind him the cat had turned in a circle sending crisp snow flying in something less than two minutes the fugitive found himself bundled aboard the jetcopter which took off without delay that had been a little more than seventyfive minutes and seven hundred miles ago now crossing the finnish border west of lubosalma chung breathed easily for the first time in what felt like oh about three hours refilling his lungs just as gladly he let himself relax a little the passenger cabin was fairly spacious and even more so in that only nathan chung and the threeman crew were aboard trask was waiting in helsinki where hed been seeing to documentation and return travel arrangements to london now as nathan wolfed sandwiches and drank coffee chung thought it might be as well to get a relationship going lighting a cigarette he said zek foener says you wont find it too hard to understand me languages come easy to you i know youve already spoken to ben trask but most of that was telepathic anyway my name is david chung he held out his right hand and when nathan went to clasp his forearm corrected him and showed him a handshake thats how we do it here nathan at once showed him the traveller way and thats how we do it on sunside not a lot of difference is there it stopped chung dead in his tracks and nathan knew it the most the locator had said to him so far had been when he spoke his name as he helped him aboard the snowcat grinning at chungs expression he said zek foener is right as you see i learned a little from trask by matching his words to his mindpictures but right now in your mind theres only a jumble of words most of them seem automatic instinctive and pretty meaningless they dont much match up with anything this is nothing new they are curses shit chung said out loud and then apologized no i am the one who should apologize nathan was still learning after all its unseemly to look into another mans mind unbidden youll do okay in ebranch chung nodded returning his grin in any case you can look all you want theres nothing in there im ashamed of and if it will help you to get it all together i mean to understand it will then be my guest listen youll be debriefed that is my people will ask you plenty of questions in london i mean back home where were going but until we pick up trask en route im at your command any way i can help if theres anything you want to know about us about this world you just fire away i mean by all means ask questions despite nathans talent and intelligence obviously it wasnt going to be plain sailing they had maybe forty minutes to helsinki and nathan put all of them to good use they flew in a sabena jet executiveclass from helsinki to stockholm and transferred to a british airways jumbo for the flight into london nathan was agog at the size of both airplanes especially the latter and at their speed inflight he was fascinated by the food clothing handluggage of the other passengers also by the toilets the motion picture headphones periodic announcements the provision of drinks hot food the view from the windows everything trask had found clothes for him in helsinki so that he didnt look out of place still his natural curiosity was that of a child which would have been out of place but for trasks continuous cautioning finally halfway to london from stockholm he settled down and asked trask to tell him about his father as head of ebranch trask was well equipped for that keeping his voice low and starting at the very beginning he detailed what he knew of harry keoghs boyhood up until the time he joined forces with the branch occasionally nathan would ask a question but when he stopped trask glanced at him out of the corner of his eye and smiled it said a great deal for nathans new friends that he felt he could sleep and safely in their company trask shook him awake just before they landed at heathrow the lights had been on in stockholm when they took off but now it was full night nathan simply couldnt believe the size of the city as seen from the air and as for its illuminations the helllands he murmured half to himself trask heard him and asked do you really think so nathan looked at him wideeyed no he said after a moments pause not with you people for denizens not quite hell anyway suddenly trasks head was full of memories it might have been he said if not for your father then less seriously and maybe it still is save it till youve seen the traffic the minister responsible was there to whisk them through customs nathan was taken to an ebranch safe house in slough whose caretakers were special branch heavies and experts in close protection from now on he would also be in the care of ebranch agents who would live at the house when he was in residence never straying more than a thought away except he shouldnt expect to be spending too much time there the safe house was a bolthole nothing more during this first visit nathan took a bath shaved had his hair tidied up he was equipped with a reasonable wardrobe supplied with money and extra documentation then to give him something of a background at least pictures were taken of him laughing with his arms round a girl hed never met before and would never see again and two small children at his feet the photographs were placed in a leather wallet together with credit cards that wouldnt work and other bits and pieces of false identification and authentication and a waferslim calculator powered by light at ebranch hq the hour was too late for introductions nathan was taken to a room of his own and almost fell into a bed where he could sleep long soundly safely under normal circumstances there would only be one duty officer tonight and for however long it took there would be four and in the hotel down below a trio of special branch plainclothes officers who now had something extra to think about in addition to discreetly tailing and minding zek foener but in ebranch itself while nathan slept the four duty officers continued to work steadily through the night preparing his programme for tomorrow nathan would start school he would learn the branch would learn hopefully both would benefit as trask had already made plain however their aim wasnt to extract information not specifically but to impart it it was for nathan and also for the memory of his father harry keogh only a handful of men had ever known him and even fewer had known him as the necroscope but an entire world was in his debt or even two worlds and in many ways hed had a raw deal in both of them this would be reparation in part at least in the small hours of the night in perchorsk under the urals siggi dam had likewise been called upon to make repayment but in her case turkur tzonov was the one to whom account must be made and siggi was bankrupt moreover this time the aim was most definitely to extract information and permanently siggi had been awakened in the quietest of all hours at am by the squeal of her door opening after a skeleton key had been turned in its lock and still believing that this couldnt possibly be happening that she must be nightmaring she had sat up in her bed and watched tzonov staffsergeant bruno krasin and alexei yefros quickly enter the room and move to her bedside numb and only halfawake blinking her eyes in the sudden light perhaps shed had just enough time to cringe back from them moisten her lips and say what before tzonov covered her mouth and krasin held her motionless while yefros slid a needle into her arm that last had woken her up certainly when but for tzonovs hand clamping her mouth she would have screamed but only for a moment until the drug began to work the effect of that had been to put her back to sleep her body at least following which theyd been in such a hurry that they hadnt even paused to close her eyes and denied all physical command over her limbs thrown across krasins powerful shoulders siggi had seen heard or otherwise sensed the rest as if it were happening under water through the liquid lens of some sickly churning submarine kaleidoscope corridor walls flowing by like waves in the apparently slowmotion jolt ojt jojt of krasins stride curved steel wall panels reflecting the ghastly flicker of faulty or shorting neons an inverted descent through the magmass levels to the core where the usual knot of technicians and scientists was nowhere in evidence for tzonov had either dismissed them or sent them on some clever wildgoose chase another descent down steel ladders in the curved wall of the core and under the white bulge of the sphere gate itself to a place where tzonov opened the cover on a magmass wormhole he and yefros sliding feetfirst into an alien darkness and siggi with a rope round her ankles hauled along behind and gliding in the smooth bore like some slow toboggan krasin bringing up the rear pushing on her shoulders where he followed headfirst this was where tzonov had relocated his arsenal down in these warped nightmare regions where for the sake of human sanity no one ever went these days whole sections had been abandoned ever since the time of the original perchorsk incident they had been opened up briefly following harry keoghs escape to starside now they were closed again and would stay that way to anyone but a madman and his followers dim lighting flickering into being and tzonov and yefros holding siggi erect head lolling until krasin f could take her from them then more jolting motion and hideous magmass cysts molds and other anomalies flpwing past her frozen field of vision until they reached the room the room of the machine it was then that siggi had wished she were dead but only her body was dead and then only temporarily that could easily change of course could easily become permanent it all depended on how much tzonov wanted on how much he intended to leave her if anything her death wish of a moment ago was forgotten as they strapped her to the table she no longer desired to die but to live to live and talk and tell them everything and she would only too gladly without all of this if only they would listen and if only she could speak shes drooling krasin said oddly disgusted trying to talk perhaps this was yefros his voice a trembling excited whisper and now but much too late siggi remembered something else about the sadistic locator that he was an operator one of the few men who was qualified to perform what was euphemistically known as an operation siggi put every ounce of nonexistent strength into one last twitch of effort to follow yefross movements and her head flopped loosely to one side the locator was moving obscene equipment into position donning a surgical gown and pulling on rubber gloves there wouldnt be very much blood but yefros was fastidious in matters such as this siggi screamed but silently of course the merest gurgle then a strong hand took her chin and turned her head the other way and she felt rubbersheathed brackets clamped into position in the hollows of her cheeks to hold her head steady she looked straight up straight into turkur tzonovs magnetic malignant grey eyes which peered into and through hers as if they were empty holes in her head until now everything had seemed what impersonal yes that was the right word so much so that it was almost as if it were happening to someone else on their part impersonal anyway siggi was so helpless they could have done anything to her used her however they would but except for what they planned so far theyd done nothing now however all of that had changed now it came down to siggi and tzonov which made it very personal indeed she wanted to curse him which he knew of course but could only plead she shouted with her mind when all it required was a whisper she offered to tell him everything right now here immediately she was a foolish woman she knew and weak shed wronged him and now promised to put it right from this time forward she would swear eternal faith to tzonov his cause she deserved to be used abused and discarded he could shame her trample her under take all she had been or was now to mould to his own design or ruin forever physical ruin yes but not not not her memories not her mind let her keep that at least for that was what made her siggi dam the dome of tzonovs skull gleamed shiny damp as he shook his head in a negative response droplets of sweat gathered and rolled round the orbits of his eyes to drip from his nose his features so perfectly balanced were scarcely human siggi saw that clearly now and his ego was likewise unstable capable of withstanding a slap it could never take a fullblooded punch and she had delivered a hammerblow since when there had been only one course tzonov could take and now he would take his revenge ah siggi siggi he said shaking his head again and smiling however mockingly trusting you was a mistake and you know how i hate mistakes but in setting nathan free you placed yourself in bondage oh he has escaped to a new world for the moment at least but you how should i deal with you by trusting you again when your treachery is proven or should i let your punishment fit the crime for there would be a wonderful irony in that dont you see nathan goes free an innocent in an alien world and i control the door the gate into just such a place the only difference appears to be that you that you are not innocent not yet but we can change that she saw his meaning and in a moment the numbness of her limbs was matched only by that of her mind her brain froze but not so much that she couldnt feel or at least sense the iciness of the sterile needle probes that slid into her ears through flesh and cartilage then tzonov took a helmet that trailed a multitude of rainbow wires the receiver and let her watch him place it on his head and still smiling his awful smile his face slowly withdrew from her line of vision someones thumbs came into view and closed her eyes as if she were already dead then before the power was switched on she heard yefros say its much like a computer we dont have to delete it all lets start at the beginning her birth and tzonovs answer let her keep it we all need to know we were born its part of the will to survive i want her to have that at least without it shed be nothing but a bag of plasma no she must have something of will for i want her to run hide and to be afraid i want her to be even more afraid than she is now as for her childhood most of that can go but her sexual awakenings she should keep them siggi was good at that it might even keep her alive a while in starside and then scoring her soul like a blunt drill his laugh above all else even if she remembered nothing else siggi knew she would always remember that tzonovs laugh cruel malevolent vindictive it would ring in the achingly empty corridors of her mind forever following which darkness for that was when they switched on the power and began downloading her brain part four the rest of nestors story i nestor necromancer hunting on sunside two years earlier in time and an entire dimension away in parallel space the vampire lord nestors first lieutenant called zahar coaxed all speed from his small and singularly burdened mount and headed for the barrier mountains his mission was of the greatest possible urgency for even now the sun was rising up beyond the goldtipped crags slowly but surely climbing to the highest point in its low but deadly arc deadly to all vampires to the wamphyri themselves and certainly to their lieutenants already sunlight came spilling through several of the high passes glancing from the tallest peaks permeating starsides gloomy upper atmosphere and banishing the stars except those that burned over the icelands far to the north on high even the sinister northstar motionless where it stood at its zenith over wrathstack the last aerie was little more than a glimmer now and when the sun was at its highest shining on wrathspire itself then the northstar would fade entirely from view by then zahar must be on his way back or better still already back safe within suckscars massive walls and halls and labyrinthine ways oh he would come to no harm so long as he kept himself and his mount out of the suns lethal glare but the knowledge itself that spears of sunlight would soon stab through the mists of starside to sear on wrathas turrets and spires was sufficient to speed him on his way for when the sun is risen the wamphyri and theirs are cowards all and if they were not then they would be dead just as the lady carmen would soon be dead but the true death not undeath and so zahar shivered as he landed in a writhing ground mist bundled carmen down from the flyers back tossed her over his shoulder and climbed a screelittered saddle between spurs until at the top he saw the southern rim aglimmer with yellow fire but not yet awash in it and pegging her out on a mound of stony earth hammering in the ironwood pegs lefthanded for his right hand and arm were still painful from the process of metamorphic healing which as yet was far from complete and making fast her wrists and ankles with strips of tough leather he shivered again and even jerked to his feet on two occasions turning in a complete circle and gazing all about for it had seemed to him that while he worked someone had watched a sensation hed known often enough before but only when vasagi the suck was alive vasagi master of mime metamorphism and telepathy alike except the suck was dead now and nestor the new lord of suckscar yet still zahar shivered perhaps he sensed the uneasy vampire spirit of his old master vasagis ghost as it were wandering restlessly abroad in the mountains waiting fearfully for the sun doomed for eternity to steam into mist with each recurrent sunup yet to come finally zahar was done and the undead corpse of carmen all tied down and not a moment to spare golden fire was creeping on the southfacing crags setting the peaks ablaze staining the saddle a poisonous yellow as the sun as yet unseen swung slowly east and zahar knew that if he did see that fiery orb then he would see no more it was time to be gone again the feeling came that someone or something observed him but this time in his haste zahar ignored it and ran back to his flyer a moment more and hed launched a gentle glide down and out over the boulder plains but behind him he could almost hear the suns golden claws scrabbling on the rocks and feel the yellow beasts breath turning the air to acid and his terror of burning was so great that he never once glanced back but sat hunched in the saddle eyes staring straight ahead as he sped like an arrow for wrathstack while behind him between the spurs where the rim of sunlight crept ever closer to carmens feet and the vampire stuff in her finally recognized the peril and brought her starting then screaming awake from undeath to sure death something other than sunlight came creeping like a shadow from the shadows of the crags a thing in a cloak and mask of cloth with holes cut for its yellowflaring eyes a thing that took up a rock and broke the ironwood pegs helped carmen up and led her staggering sobbing from the suns sighing encroachment and up over the dark rim of the saddle the thing led her and down a scree slope into the permanent darkness and safety of a northfacing crevice in the rocks as they went so she cried out what who for as yet she was like a lost child with little or no understanding of her whereabouts and circumstances except that she was a changeling whose change whose very existence had almost been terminated but the one in the cloak and mask merely hushed her and replied quiet now carmen all is not lost as was my ate so is yours yet we have both escaped it we are banished now for the moment and sent out of our rightful places but still were ahve you and i well jive on and grow strong and one day return wej return or our revenge which will be sweet i promise you trust me i know the way and gasping clutching her terrorparched throat fainting in his arms in the darkness of their refuge she knew that it was true that if anyone knew the way it was this one whom she had thought dead and gone oh she had been glad enough then that he was no more that the handsome lord nestor had come to take his place but not as glad as she was now that he was back not when it meant life to her both glad and terrified at one and the same time for despite an awful hideous alteration she could not deny but that this was her old master shed guessed it as soon as she heard his mental voice and now knew it definitely as he took off his mask and tossed it down but his face his mangled maniac ace and then she knew no more for a while at least all of which lay two long years in the past and only part of it known to nestor where he lay healing and dreaming under the bank of the river in sunside and as his metamorphic vampire flesh expelled the last few silver pellets of szgany shot and the last drop of yellow pus and the small wounds knitted over so his dreams switched from the vacant meanderings of subconscious psyche to a more positive theme when he lived again the life hed known in suckscar in his early days as nestor of the wamphyri time had passed since nestors ascension six months then nine and the mighthavebeen lady carmen was all but forgotten but the young lord nestors awful talent which he had discovered through her was not despite that it repulsed him it also fascinated him so that he was driven to experiment for he was a necromancer with the power to question the dead and he was the only one in all wrathstack who could do it it made him equal perhaps even superior to the rest of them but they all had their various quirks and talents if talent may adequately describe wamphyri mutations anomalies and aberrations wran with his rages which gave him the strength of three his brother spiro who constantly practised to achieve his fathers killing eye though with no noticeable success so far gorvi whose guile was such that he would even cheat himself if that were at all possible and of course the lady wratha with her mentalism and mindcloaking technique so that she was able to read the thoughts of the others while yet keeping her own to herself mainly even the doglord with his lycanthropy which made him look even more like some monstrous wolf when he went off hunting on sunside yet nestors talent was different word of it got out and within a year everyone in wrathstack knew that nestor was a necromancer meanwhile canker canison had become a frequent visitor to suckscar and his and nestors friendship had developed useful is it this weird talent of yours canker growled one evening when at last the sun was off the peaks it probably will be nestor answered they were sitting in one of nestors private rooms a place that looked south to the barrier range he liked to sit here at this hour watching the peaks turn from gold to grey he would even sit here in the predawn hours and witness the reverse but on those occasions long before the first true rays came stabbing through then the curtains would be drawn and nestor gone off to other safer places but just exactly how do you use it canker was curious how are you using it now i mean nestor shrugged at present i merely experiment you talk to dead men and did it happen just like that suddenly you could talk to them ah no nestor answered the first time one of the dead talked to me except she was undead since when well the dead would not speak to me at all if they had a choice she was undead you say canker frowned and his red eyebrows crushed together over his snout then how could you be certain of your talent the undead are not truly dead this was a thrall nestor replied she was a mere vampire not yet wamphyri at the time i was inexperienced and had taken too much from her but even so she would only become wamphyri if i allowed it which i did not she had no mentalism as such or should not have had it and yet she spoke to me in my mind she was dead canker but when i touched her she knew me and named me for her murderer in which she was correct of course for i could not suffer her to live and after that i had her destroyed scorched at sunup on the high crags which put an end to her whats more it put an end to what was left in me of pity and it was only then that i became wamphyri in the fullest sense for in our hearts we are cold creatures canker and i was not cold not completely until then were not so cold canker argued indeed we can be hot as a furnace at times but we know how to do what must be done and that without a deal of fuss we are survivors nestor without emotion feeling purpose what use to survive as a piece of stone this is your leech arguing canker coughed it can only be you are playing word games and your parasite directs their course for as you must know by now when the mood is on us we argue just for the sake of it like now but emotionless purposeless the wamphyri is that what youre saying then you dont know the half of it but i believe i do know whats wrong with you my lad why you havent given yourself a chance you think youve seen it all and is that all there is to it you ask to slake my thirst on blood forever and a day and grow no older or wiser but live like some bloated leech in a pool aha but canker has the answer we were talking about necromancy nestor sighed not my malaise malaise aye the doglord barked the very word but you were morbid enough before and now this necromancy what to talk to dead things huh i see no sense in it what can they tell you anyway how to survive no for they failed to survive how to make merry no for they have lost the art of laughter how to love or lust what with parts all rotted away now tell me what do you get from it and if the answer is nothing then i say let the dead alone and instead learn how to live what do i get from it what can they tell you that you dont already know for after all youve outlived them havent you nestor slowly shook his head and said but it isnt like that now listen and ill try to tell you the last time i was on sunside after the raid i sensed the freshly dead trembling where they lay whats more i sensed that the ancient dead who had passed on years before were trembling too and all of them knowing me and going in fear of me but of what do they go in fear canker flapped his great hands in fear of my art to talk to them nestor looked away to torture them eh canker sat up straighter the dead dont talk to me of their own free will nestor explained at last they have to be made to do it you make them talk to you it is my my art yes by torturing them canker goggled ever since that first time yes but dont you see carmen couldnt have talked to me at all if i wasnt a necromancer carmen that was her name one of the girls that the killglance brothers tried to steal away that time surely you remember better for her if they had since when the dead have avoided me but they cant avoid my art canker sprang erect i have to see it for myself on sunside yes in just a few hours time well hunt together and afterwards you can show me how its done i can show you it certainly but not how its done nestor told him eh you wont learn anything from it what i do is not mentalism not as you know it youll be able to hear me talking to them if i ask my questions out loud certainly but youll never hear their answers these are dead minds canker very well the other gave a shrug pretended to understand but at least ill see you at work eh oh nestor looked sideways at him and whos the morbid one now canker morbid never eager for new experiences always except tell me this how may one torture a dead unfeeling man that is my art nestor answered when i touch them they do feel it they hear my words which no one else can hear not even my lieutenants they feel my hands on them the tearing of my nails they know my threats are real and as for what they tell me ah the crux of the matter canker cried well then what do they tell you listen said nestor for theres that which you should know death isnt like that his voice was suddenly faraway dreamy eh not like what not like you think you think that deaths the end but it isnt they go on the dead go on canker gave a snort hell no they go down in the ground or onto a funeral pyre or into the grinders for the provisioning on sunside they even go to waste but thats as far as they go and here in the last aerie theres no waste at all if thats what you meant by going on then i have to agree they go on in the bellies of our beasts to fuel them in the flying and the fighting you are talking about their bodies nestor replied his voice becoming firm again but im talking about their minds their minds go on canker and so for as long as theres something of body left to touch and torture and mind which i may speak to i can communicate with them the grand inquisitor who overcomes death himself canker scowled sniffed like the great red hound he was shook his head but again i say what use to ill tell you what use nestor cut him off what a man did in life he continues to do when hes dead not physically but in his mind the lover loves not with his wasted lich body no but in his mind and he dreams of all the ways he never loved even though its too late to try them and the builder why he continues to build not of stone or stick or sod but airy thoughts and he dreams of excellent houses and cities which can never be built because no one knows whats in his dead mind and what of the thinkers who look outward to the stars and wonder now they have been given a gift of time with nothing to do but study the wheeling of the spheres and dream of other suns and worlds beyond this one then there are the hunters and weaponmakers they hunt still and forge their weapons as of old they devise new traps for the beasts of the wild superior in every way to the ones we use and the weapons in their mental workshops are keener far while ours are often blunt clumsy and turn to rust too quickly nestor paused and in a moment continued and you ask what use very well ill tell you what use whatever a man was or did in life whatever secrets he knew then and anything hes learned since from the teeming dead whatever new thoughts he has thought or ancient schemes hes schemed i can know it all by means of my art canker was astonished whatever hes learned since but how can he learn anything once hes dead i mean from whom may he learn it ah said nestor and that is something else that fascinates me for just as we communicate with each other so do the dead converse they talk to each other in their graves and resting places and their thoughts go out to all the dead without any man ever knowing or even suspecting them except me for i am a necromancer but when they know im near then they fall silent for they fear my art and they stay silent until i touch them nestors voice had sunk so low and turned so cold that canker shivered then gave himself a shake but you must demonstrate tonight on sunside we hunt together agreed as you will answered nestor and so youre loathed by liches eh canker scratched at his toolong jaw which is enough in itself to earn you a name a name but i already have a name pah nestor what is that for a name good for a first name aye but as for your second lichloathe thats it the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe of lichscar no said nestor at once i mean yes to the giving of names but no to changing them for im used to suckscar now let it suffice so be it canker shrugged now i get me down into mangemanse to work on my instrument several hours to go i think before well need to prepare for the raid then its off to sunside where with any luck ill witness this weird wonder that you work except before i go yes earlier you mentioned your malaise canker seemed anxious he was genuinely fond of nestor nestors turn to shrug i played a word game it meant nothing no said canker everything means something now tell me are you getting enough of women there are lovely girl thralls in my manse yes nestor answered and how do you feed yourself the same as you i dont like it red so much except for when i drink on sunside apart from that i have good meat and wine and occasionally a little fruit and blood only on sunside you dont use your thralls but you should nestor you should for what are they after all but vessels and never forget the blood is the life when i sleep then i drink occasionally but carefully eh that carmen incident taught you a lesson it seems perhaps it did said nestor huh the doglord grunted then what is this malaise do you know its source no nestor lied and feeling cankers thoughts nibbling at his own he changed the subject so tell me my friend how goes it with your moon music a whole year gone by and still youre hard at it canker was distracted from his own line of questioning my music my instrument hard at it too true this music is no easy thing but it comes it comes have you not heard me in the sunup when the others are fast asleep surely you recognized the tune you gave me ive heard you nestor nodded wryly and ive no doubt that wratha and the others have too when we should have been asleep as for knowing your tune i knew it vaguely oh hahha canker capered wildly threw back his head and laughed and have i disturbed you then good excellent not so good that i have ruined your sleep no of course not never that but wonderful if ive managed to disturb the rest of them its my image you see for im a madman and mischiefmaker we have to keep up appearances nestor managed a grin well then away with you and practise later well fly out and do a little raiding on sunside but just the two of us for as yet im jealous of this talent of mine and guard it well and later well seek out some old szgany burial place where you shall see what you shall see agreed canker yelped as nestor patted him fondly on his furred and sloping back and then the necromancer saw him out of suckscar accompanying the doglord until at the last he loped out of sight down and around the spiralling stairwell that descended into mangemanse but as soon as canker was gone nestor returned to his brooding to his malaise and indeed he knew its source somewhere in the world far away perhaps but there nevertheless his olden enemy out of sunside lived on that was the source of his disquiet he knew that his enemy was alive just as surely as he recognized the pattern of the numbers vortex swirling in his head that whirlwind rush of metaphysical symbols which was his enemys cloaking device with which he kept his secret mind shielded it rarely bothered nestor in the dark of night when he was up and prowling or hunting on sunside or running suckscar to his own design but during the fearfraught hours of seething sunlight on the barrier mountains when wrathstack slept and the furnace suns bright and lethal rays burned on the lady wrathas highest turrets and towers then he felt it at first it would be in his dreams which in themselves were a swirl of misty unmemory or halfmemory of things he really did not wish to remember but coming awake and as his dreams faded to wraiths still the hated numbers vortex would linger on faint ah faint but real for all that and lying awake in his bed with his sleeping vampire women as the cold sweat beaded his flesh and his nerves jangled with each smallest creak of a baffle or wailing of wind beyond his windows then he would know that his olden enemy lived on moreover he also knew that while for the moment that enemy was far removed one day he would surely return in a way he dreaded that day without knowing why but in another way he longed for it for he would never be free of the numbers vortex until he was free of his enemy who and whatever he was but that was only one source of nestors malaise and the truth of it was that there was another a need a gap a void in his existence which required filling for canker had been partly right to question him about women but there was a certain woman he had not questioned him about because he had not known only nestor himself knew and he was loath to admit it for after all shed made a fool of him once already and yet in his dreams all too frequently she seemed to call to him and he felt her lure even in his waking hours so that occasionally musing he would find himself up there again on wrathspires roof his lips on hers and her breast in his hand a malaise no it was the lingering afterimages of dreams such as these that distracted him the conflict of his desires on the one hand revenge on his enemy and on the other wratha the risen the thought of their steam rising up from a bed made sodden by their juices that same sundown an hour after the suns true setting when the ethereal fan of pink and golden spokes which was its aftermath wheeled in the sky over sunside and melted to an amethyst glow and the night crept in and stars clustered like nuggets of ice frozen in their eternal configurations and the icelands aurora fluttered its banners across all the northern skies then the wamphyri flew to sunside not only nestor lichloathe and canker canison but all of them taking their senior men with them and leaving lesser lieutenants and thralls in charge of their manses they set out from wrathstack to raid on the szgany they left in the space of the same hour but in small parties not en masse the time lay well in the past when they had worked as a single unit under wratha nor were their parties uniform the guiles lot flew south and a little east and was composed of gorvi himself three lieutenants and two small aerial warriors the killglance brothers headed due south and took only their chief lieutenants along with them they would seek their prey in roughly the same area where wran and vasagi the suck had fought their unequal duel and the lady wratha flew westwards with only two of her men and used the glaring helllands gate as her marker where she sped for the soaring spires and plateaus which were her favourite vantage points from which she would choose her target as for canker and nestor they made for the great pass a little to the east of the hemisphere gate a dogleg gorge that split the barrier mountains to their roots passing north to south right through them if they were fortunate enough to recruit a handful of thralls beyond the pass then their victims would find it an easy route to follow home to the last aerie and gliding on a tailwind they conversed as they went an even twoway split canker grunted in nestors mind we work together and share the spoils equally of course the other agreed but with this rider and if there are women we split them equally too split them indeed i will the doglord laughed obscenely for a moment then sobered but yes i understand and im more than pleased with that arrangement damn i have a few too many bitches in mangemanse already and when im away like now all they can do is squabble they fight for my affections nestor nestor doubted it but said nothing more likely cankers women fought to determine who would stay out of his bed but forget mangemanse for the fact of it was that suckscar did go a little short on women and nestor had lieutenants and thralls other than himself to consider for if a man is not happy he will scheme and plot eventually get himself in serious even terminal trouble and so deplete the aerie on the other hand genuine happiness as such is scarcely the province of vampire thralls but at least their loads might be made a little easier to bear this last thought had escaped him and been picked up by canker too true the doglord called through the blustery air slicing it with his bark you have to keep them happy for you can be sure there are those among em wholl be lusting after your women even now aye and lusting after suckscar too there must be else nothing would ever change and no one ever ascend nestor nodded and answered grimly indeed for its the getting there that counts right canker howled and without new blood among the wamphyri i mean wed all stagnate and become doddering old cripples like the lot we left behind in turgosheim you must tell me about them some time nestor answered the full story but for now lets keep the noise down a few more miles and were through the pass so from here on in silence is the order of the day as you will canker fell silent a moment until ah but cant you just smell em from here nestor szgany meat on the hoof sweet blood hot and surging young breasts and buttocks and cunt galore me why ill risk the odd crossbow bolt any old time to fire a few shots from my own weapon your image nestors sarcasm dripped but canker chose to ignore it no lad not this time he answered not my image but my lust i want to be into a fresh untainted woman or several youre a lech said nestor but without malice a satyr not a bit of it canker grinned across at him im wamphyri and so are you the sunside end of the pass was in sight and beyond it a far horizon still stained with strips of dying colour dun orange a pale dirty yellow and amethyst nestor and canker ordered their flyers up up until they rode with a knot of dark clouds scudding south should they be seen from the ground theyd be just two more clouds chasing the fallen sun now the hunt was on for down below was szgany territory and as nestor led the way and sped out with the clouds over the forest so canker inquired and just where do you think youre taking me man these woods are dense and the szgany know them a damn sight better than we do we should stick to the fringes look for their fires and where in hell do we land and having landed from where do we launch mean know youre no novice that youve done all this before but youre listening to the voice of real experience here seventy years of it and i tell you we should shhh nestor hushed him let me think its this way if my memory serves me right aye this way what is this way canker demanded meat on the hoof nestor told him and everything else you mentioned a woman for you neither virginal nor young but untainted certainly and another for me and the blood of a good strong man to boot you can have both the man and his wife and i shall have their daughter jvot the best of thralls be sure but theres always the provisioning you know this for a certainty canker was eager now that these people are here mean but he could tell that indeed nestor knew it for a certainty know it down there maybe four five miles ahead a cabin in the woods all secret and hidden away their fire is out by now but its smoke will linger a while in a minute or two youll sniff it out with that great wolfs snout of yours that is now that you know its there to be sniffed huh canker grunted in nestors mind and complained but the winds in the wrong direction still if theres smoke to be smelled be sure that canker will smell it ahead a river uncoiled from the night like a silver snake glinting in the starlight and nestor remembered a time when he had very nearly drowned in that same river only brad berea had saved him and returned him to life in the warmth and security of his cabin in the woods except brad had been unkind to him too at times and his wife irma was often surly and grudging shed even begrudged nestor his food despite that hed hunted for all of them only glina had truly felt for nestor and they had been lovers a while well theyd shared sex at least but love no for nestor already had a love or would have had if his olden forgotten enemy had not stolen her away but glina would make a good bedwarmer in suckscar be sure and certainly she could teach some of the other women in nestors harem how to relieve a man of his juices there was no pity in nestor now in fact it puzzled him why hed held off all this time knowing where the bereas were and all perhaps it was that for a while he had felt something of pity for glina at least if not for her parents but that was then and this was now and pity and all such emotions were szgany failings not wamphyri smoke canker cried in nestors mind a whiff of it anyway lingering on from the eveningmeal aye and food smells too from the same source nestor weve passed over them know it nestor replied now then search for a knoll or cliff thats where well land and from there go on afoot keen wamphyri eyes scanned the night and canker sent his wolf senses vibrating outwards from him like the unheard locating call of a bat into the darkness and over there to the west he leaned his flyer westwards a knoll mainly bald rising out of the woods it should suit our purpose remember it nestor answered ive hunted there upon a time rabbits and the occasional goat ah but rarer meat tonight canker chuckled and in the next moment he was businesslike again very well lets be at it wamphyri senses guiding them safely down they landed on the knoll in a swirling ground mist and settled to the rounded summit in twin slithers of sliding scree and crushed creepers and leaving their beasts nodding there but with easy access to flight they descended the knoll by its eastern face then a short silent gliding trip through the gloom of the woods nestor moving like a shadow tree to tree and canker loping leaning forwards stepping so light that never a twig was broken a mile and a half and were there nestors mental voice was like a waft of cold air in cankers mind and the doglord thought but to himself how this one has advanced in just one short year before answering where are we where this path it leads from the river to the cabin the cabin of brad berea his wife and daughter but remember glina berea is mine before i was hers this time it will be different shell be mine always in suckscar and unlike the others who suffer me because i am their lord i fancy glina will love me because i am a man and ill give her power in my manse once shes a vampire they followed the path to the cabin of the bereas all shaded under great trees and lost in a tangle of bracken and roots no light showed through the woven shutters on the windows but nestor knew that a small shaded lamp would be burning inside also knew there was a bolthole to the rear a tunnel cut through the roots of an ancient fallen ironwood give me a moment to make my way to the back he told the doglord there is a secret door inside the girl glina has a bed against the back wall behind a curtain she sleeps only a step away from the bolthole but when you go in the front here let her run be sure she wont run far for ill be waiting look for a ladder which climbs to a bed under the roof thats where brad and irma will be they are yours but careful the mans a good shot and keeps a powerful crossbow to hand both day and night thanks for the warning cankers answer was a mental grunt but you need not worry for me i can smell them up there even now and what theyre doing the girl smells a little sweeter true but we have a deal good said nestor and swiftly disappeared into darkness canker gave him a count of twelve then loped to the door put his great shoulder to it and smashed right through torn from leather hinges in a tangle of shattered withes the door fell to the hardpacked floor inside cankers glaring scarlet eyes took in everything at a glance a curtain hanging open a crack at the rear of the cabin frightened eyes peering as the shade was snatched from a lamp then the billowing of the curtains as the girl fled and because his vampire senses were alert as never before he even heard her faint gasp of horror before she bundled herself into the bolthole while from up above the smell of sex had been replaced by the acrid stench of fear brad bereas voice was hoarse calling glina what is it his bearded face eyes wide and staring mouth agape as in a yawn peered down from the platform under the roof nothing much canker snarled at him only me brads face disappeared in a moment he was back swinging his legs down onto the upper rungs of the ladder hanging there as he aimed a crossbow at the spot where canker had been but canker was no longer there instead he had stepped to the foot of the ladder where now he swept his arm like a knife through its brittle wooden legs bringing the whole contraption crashing down and brad came with it as brad smashed down among the ladders ruins canker kicked the crossbow from his nerveless fingers and sent it clattering across the floor and ho cried the doglord and would you shoot a poor old wolf like me shame on you he caught brad under the arm and dragged the dazed man to his feet brad struggled a little then and canker felt his great strength nestor had been right this burly barrel of a man would make a good strong vampire thrall and so before brad could recover further canker bit him sinking elongated ivory fangs deep into his neck brad choked something out a word inarticulate and writhed in cankers grip like a crippled snake until the doglord crashed a fist into his ear and stilled his struggles then brad a shriek went up canker glanced overhead saw a womans terrified face gazing back at him and madame canker bowed grotesquely your husband is mine now and so are you he let brad crumple to the earthen floor crouched down a little leapt high and caught the edge of the platform and dragging himself up he saw irma where she had fallen back onto a pallet bed her hand covered her mouth and her eyes were wide as windows јhe would be thirtyeight or nine but was still in fine fettle especially he noted her breasts in the brief moment before she snatched up a coarse sheet they were large and loose irma bereas breasts and canker liked them ah ah ah she gasped as his hand found his belt and loosened it and his red eyes seemed to drip like candles and ah ahhh she halfpanted halfgasped again as she saw him revealed oh indeed canker gurglingly greedily agreed advancing on her and tearing the blanket away and reaching for her body and as irmas cries tore the silence of the night so the doglord repeated her gasp over and over and over again filling her head and her body with the sound of his panting and with more than just sound ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhh ahhhhhh ii nestors art glina berea crouched low the hair of her head brushed by roots dangling through the soil of the ceiling her fingers occasionally scrabbling at the stonepaved floor of the bolthole tunnel panting as she fled through the fallen ironwoods dead root system to the secret exit out there the deep dark woods which she knew like the back of her hand clouds covering the moon holding back its light an owl hooting sleepily in the distance she could escape flee into the woods to one of the many hiding places she knew there but as glina passed through the disguised outer door and let it swing back on its hinges her thoughts were not so much for herself as for the fate of her mother father and and one other if only shed had time to time to what glina barefoot she skidded to a halt in wet leafmould and saw a shadow grow up beside her out of the gloom but a shadow that knew her name an even darker blot in the dark of the night it flowed upon her towering huge as if to crush her with its awesome power and presence but that voice didnt she know that voice and so you do remember the shadow sighed with its deep dark tantalizing voice and moved closer still and again she thought that voice can it possibly be if so then he had chosen the worst possible time to return and why was he so still so very silent as hoarse shouts and a crashing sound erupted from the cabin and a muted squawking like throttled chickens but in her fathers choked voice and moments later her mothers fearful screaming so glina realized that the worst of her fears had been utterly selfish that she would be left on her own but now if this stranger really was him heart fluttering scarcely breathing she reached out a trembling hand and touched his arm and in that same instant the clouds cleared the moon pallid light struck through overhanging branches down into the small clearing and glina saw that it was indeed nestor he stood there with his eyes halfshuttered handsome as hell dark in a cloak the colour of night and clasping his arm she gasped nestor it is you but come we must run hide the wamphyri are here i know he said in that sepulchral voice which was his and yet not his then he opened his eyes wider and she saw their scarlet glow the convolutions of his vampire nose and the white gleam of his teeth and she knew that it wasnt only his voice which was him and yet not him nestor her jaw fell open and she halfswooned into his arms but ah no he told her gathering her up not simply nestor glina not any more for from now on you must call me lord as his needle teeth struck into the fluttering veins of her neck so she succumbed more fully to her faint glina woke up and thought that she was burning the roaring leaping flames the yellow glare the wall of heat but it was only her home that was burning she saw it through the spread legs of the two who stood there arms akimbo apparently admiring their work then her heart leapt within her breast the cabin my bairn she cried struggling to sit up youre burning my bairn and shrieking like a madwoman which in that moment she was she reached up and clawed at nestors legs but she could only loll there against him too spent to drag herself upright he shook his leg and as her words sank in made to thrust her away from him bairn glina what bairn barn did she say canker scowled at her no barn that but a cabin or it was my my child glina sobbed swaying like a stricken animal on all fours and crawling towards the fire my poor burned child but only halfway there the roof caved in and the flames were fanned outwards threatening to engulf her even so she would have crawled on if nestor had not stepped forward grabbed her up dragged her back from the inferno what child glina his face was an impenetrable almost emotionless mask in the firelight unlike cankers which was still swollen with lust and power you had no child oh but i did her voice was a babble a crazed shriek sixteen sunups ago your child nestor you blackhearted beast hes in there she pointed a madly shaking hand at the blazing cabin hidden in the wall in his crib we prayed that if the wamphyri came they would fail to find him and you did fail but how could i know youd burn the cabin and so its your own son that youve burned you damned vampire i i fathered a son something of life had come into nestors face which didnt look quite so soulless but in the next moment the cold and the dark were back what was done was done despite that it had not been done deliberately still it was done and anyway nestor wanted no bloodsons not yet he released glina who at once fell wailing to the earth at his feet and began beating her fists into the dirt until suddenly she stopped glared up at nestor and spat and my mother and my poor father too did you also burn them alive canker stepped forward and glared at her where she sprawled she was homely at best with brown lustreless hair nose a little too sharp heavy buttocks and breasts too large and pendulous despite her youth canker couldnt see what nestor wanted with her him being so handsome and all you glina he snarled at her your mother and father are alive they lie sleeping in the grass safe from the fire but burning from a different heat now that the fever of my bite courses through their veins rising up before the dawn theyll head for starside to be mine in mangemanse and to nestor does she speak the truth have you known her before well obviously you have else how could you find your way back here but a child your child she speaks the truth nestor answered cant you read it in her mind i read hatred in her mind canker answered at once and a longing for death or better still revenge ah but she has strength this one shes awake well before her time and she squawks too much you want my advice put an end to her and now or if you wish ill do it for you he made as if to grab glinas hair but the other put himself in the way the threat to her child woke her up nestor told him else my bite would have kept her down but she is strong yes and will take command of all my women in suckscar canker shook his great wolfs head my friend youre making a mistake then its my mistake kill me glina cried i dont want to be a vampire i dont want to live in a cold aerie on starside not without my bairn not without our baby nestor the cabin was now a gutted shell a redroaring bonfire like a livid skull whose blackened window eyes gushed smoke and flames nothing was alive in there not possibly but it seemed to glina that she heard a babys crying in every lick of fire and whoosh of falling timbers and when finally she knew that it was over then she sank down again to the earth and cried a little and quickly rocked herself to sleep now my bite works on her nestor said satisfied you should strike em in the ear as i do the doglord grunted swatting the air with his fist knock them down and they stay down and the fever burns that much faster nestor shook his head no for that way youll lose some by breaking their skulls and i prefer thralls not idiots huh the other snorted skulls mend most of them but a mood was on nestor now and it was not the mood for argument have it your own way he muttered and stooping to pick glina up he tossed her over his shoulder and headed for the knoll cant she make her own way like her mother and father canker called after him i have my needs much like you nestor answered without looking back some of which are immediate and may not be kept waiting but i want her awake strange as it may seem to you this girl knew how to satisfy me upon a time and to himself indeed she was my teacher and mistress when i knew nothing behind him canker went down on one knee in the grass and put his hands on the foreheads of his new thralls and come to me he told them in their sleep in mangemanse and if any man or woman shall say to you you are mine then tem him or her that you belong to canker canison for the other vampire lords aye and a certain lady too they are as nothing to me but onjy fail to answer my cajl then be sure im seek you out wherever you have been stolen away and eat your jiving hearts and your seducers too so be it following which he loped swiftly after nestor to catch up with him only an hour or so into sundown and already were three fine thrads better off canker chortled in nestors mind when they had been aloft for some little time and more thrajis to go i fancy the other answered training his concentration on the terrain below as they winged back towards the barrier mountains cant you sense them what canker burst out staring across the gulf at him the air was still now and they flew only a little distance apart so that shouting was unnecessary but the doglord was annoyed his senses were perhaps superior to all others of his ilk what could nestor have sensed that he did not more smoke furtive movement in the night the frightened thoughts of travellers seeking a hiding place till sunup if so then why did canker sense nothing ah but this nestor was a curious one an enigma and canker was fascinated by him i sense thoughts said nestor and i sense whispers hushed cautious words spoken in the dead of night someone hides perhaps a good many someones and they know we are here hah maybe they saw us jimned against the moon said canker at once falling into his mental mode or theyve spied us darting out from the edge of the cloud and then in admiration of his young friend youve come on faster than even i suspected nestor and i have always known that youd be great now then where are these secretive whisperers in the night those three knolls there at the edge of the woods nestor pointed between them a wooded triangle and central a rocky outcrop weathered to a dome i see it canker grew excited down there thats where they are they are somewhere down there but a moment later ah and now they guard their minds theyve sensed me listening in on them canker was puzzled what travellers mentalists among the szgany several of them well and its not unheard of i suppose but together in a bunch nestor was silent too silent now and canker sensed the darkness in him like a shroud for his shrivelled soul but there was something of awe too the sudden recognition or acceptance of knowledge which had been absent just a moment ago what is it nestor still the other was silent listening nestor and at last he snapped out of it they are not theyre not what thought they were not szgany oh yes theyre szgany or they were were canker scowled finally admitted defeat and barked out loud what in all turgosheim and starside together are you talking about give me a clue cant you if he had thought to galvanize nestor he was mistaken for now the other was quieter still and his mind even darker as he guided his flyer into a swooping glide towards the cluster of knolls following him down the doglord demanded well and at last nestor answered him these are the dead of the szgany canker which is why you failed to detect them i realize that now that these are dead men in their graves tattered leather and fretted bone or ashes in small urns all gathered together in one place around that mortuary rock ah cankers mental gasp an ancient traveller graveyard your art you sniffed them out but barely before they sniffed me out for they smell me as the forest creatures smell a fire with vast amaze and fear except its my talent sets fire to their old bones then since they cant run from me they try to shut me out they fall silent and wait for me to go away but this time im not going to not for a little while anyway and you canker you wanted to see me demonstrate my art well nows your chance i cannot contain myself the dogthing admitted what a man who pursues his prey even beyond death youll be a legend yet they landed on the rim of the central outcrop and climbed carefully down at its base uncounted years had weathered the yellow sandstone into a series of shallow cavelets useless as hiding places for living szgany but more than sufficient for their dead which was exactly what they found a mortuary as nestor had guessed or known in all the cavelets niches had been carved in the walls where urn after urn reposed in the echoing rock entire families had been burned and interred here as each member in his turn died but that had been in the years of the old wamphyri who were no more it had been in the merciless years of the vampire when the only safe way was to burn the dead since when thered been some eighteen years of peace broken only once before wratha came with her renegades out of turgosheim and in those eighteen years men had commenced to bury their fellows again returning soil to soil or to wrap them in oilsoaked cloths and deposit them on ledges in dry places where their descendants might visit from time to time and perhaps even talk to them except of course the dead could not talk back not to just anyone this was just such a place in the deepest driest caves ledges had been cut in the walls which housed complete carcasses the mummies of old szgany chiefs none of the corpses was recent and some must have lain here for oh the full eighteen years by nestors reckoning since the earliest days of traveller freedom but he did not want to inquire of one who had been dead too long no he wanted one more recently dead say ten to twelve years because he had a question for him which went back to his own unremembered childhood indeed it concerned one of the few memories he still retained from the olden times before hed been hurt and and before he had forgotten things before he became wamphyri and so he chose a cadaver which had only journeyed midway down the long lingering road of dusty decomposition and went to him where he lay upon his sandstone ledge then as nestor drew near so the old one began to tremble not visibly of course not but in his deadspeak mind he knows me said nestor his voice the merest whisper echoing away and back he knows me for what i am it was blacker than night in the cave but this was of no consequence to wamphyri sight and senses the lords nestor and canker could see as well and indeed better than in broad daylight for daylight is bred of the sun and nothing of the sun is of benefit to the wamphyri except that men live in it canker canison stood to one side of nestor and back a pace watching he saw how nestors hands trembled as he reached out and placed them upon the mummified forehead and sunken chest of the one who was no more and it was hard for canker to believe that anything of sentience remained in the tattered withered husk which nestor touched but do you hear me old chief nestor queried but canker heard nothing not even a whisper for this was not mentalism but deadspeak do you feel my hands upon you i know you do for i can sense your mind damped shut like a trap on a bears leg and though your body cant move still your trembling is like a fever in you and yet i say to you you need not fear me well canker grunted from behind for to the doglords mind it seemed that nothing was happening what now nestor turned his head and looked into cankers wolfish eyes their bloodhued orbs and tiny pinprick pupils yellow as his mistress moon be quiet let me make contact with him for until i do youll hear nothing see nothing then what is this for a demonstration the other seemed affronted how can i know what passes between you if indeed anything passes between you either be quiet nestor snapped or go and leave me on my own here theres that which i need to know from this one huh but the other fell silent i ask you one jast time to speak to me nestor told the cadaver i want to know who you were and want to know what you heard felt saw one morning in that time beore you died when the fleeing clouds glowed red and the billowing belly of one cloud in particular a great white nodding mushroom of a cloud burned crimson over starside do you remember know you do when there was thunder in the air and earth alike and warm unseasonal winds came rushing through the passes from the north and repeat you have nothing to fear from me not if you tell me these things as best you remember them but if you do not thus the monstrous threat was issued in nestors mind conjured there by his own questioning a scene from childhood opened up he knew it of old but never as vivid as this a true memory as if some lesion had finally repaired itself in the damaged whorl of his brain adding colour and definition to previously misty monochrome pictures out of the past and because nestors thoughts were deadspeak the pictures were seen by the extinct szgany chieftain too the barrier mountains as viewed from sunside a thin morning mist drifting through crags which were silvergrey because the sun had not yet discovered them a glade hidden deep in the forest mistdamp all green leaves and dark green shade where the birds had barely commenced their dawn chorus before lapsing into abrupt silence for suddenly the earth underfoot had given itself a mighty slap and a shake and a sheet of pulsing dazzling white light had turned the mountains to a black silhouette then webs of white lightning leaping and coruscating between the clouds over starside clouds which at once fled outwards from a certain spot in the whitepulsing sky and the fleeing clouds all red in their underbellies reflecting unseen fires while bloating like some gigantic loathsome mushroom in the cleared central space a great grey cloud on an upwardsthrusting pillar or stalk of fire and smoke growing up behind the mountains and swaying there its puffball head all roiling and churning from within displaying the madly blazing fires at its red and yellow heart nestor saw these things through the eyes of memory which were also the eyes of a badly frightened fouryearold child namely himself but now as a man he knew for a fact that whatever the memory signified it had happened and also knew that it was important to him he had woken up there in that forest glade and cried out into the dawn something had brought him awake to witness the lightnings the fires in the sky and the roiling mushroom cloud but what whatever it had been it had sent him tottering crying to his mother to be crushed in her arms and comforted and it had caused him to ask her a question which had no apparent source one to which hed received no satisfactory answer is my daddy is he dead but even though he no longer remembered his mother not a single detail he recalled how quiet she had gone and how her heart had fluttered as she held him against her breast all of which was deadspeak and so passed from nestors mind into the mind of the old szgany chief and the old chief was trembling again no less than the necromancers forgotten mother on that morning of mornings but still he said nothing until well nestor asked him again and will you remain silent forever i think not you know what i am the nature of my art for even now you can feel my hands resting oh so lightly upon your dead flesh when i touch you whatever i choose to do to you you will feel it if i were to break off one of your dry and crumbling fingers you would feel the pain of it even as if you were alive and if i were to dig into your wormy chest and squeeze your heart it would be like a second dying except you are already dead and so i could do it over and over again you know i speak the truth and now its your turn to speak the truth you saw the pictures in my mind memories from my childhood yes im sure you did i want to know what they signify and i want you to tell me now he took the skeletal hand of the chief carefully in his own powerful vampire hand and blew the dust of the cave from the crumbling flesh and white bone knuckles and i i may not speak to you the chiefs voice was pitiful in its terror you are forbidden to speak to me nestor stroked the hand and gently eased the fused fingers apart from one another you are a vile necromancer the dead will forsake me to darkness and loneliness forever if i breathe a single word to you but you have already breathed a good many words nestor replied speak up canker rumbled from behind whats all this muttering ah nestor was startled for a moment but then muttering was i then be quiet and ill speak out loud for you it will make no difference now that were in contact myself and this wormy old thing and to the chief so you are unwilling and i am impatient indeed my patience is at an end and with one hand upon the corpses brow he used the other to crumble two of its desiccated fingers into dust behind nestor canker gawped and gasped his delight and now the old chief was no longer unwilling perhaps he had not believed it himself that nestor could hurt him even as if he were alive but now he believed it part of his hand had been crushed into dust and the pain had been real it was the necromancers art that the dead could sense him near hear him when he spoke to them feel him when he touched them or when he did other things to them and in nestors weird mind the dead old man was screaming for hed felt his fingers pulped as beneath a falling boulder they were dust and brittle bones but when nestor had crushed them theyd been as flesh again for a while nestor listened to the old chiefs screaming and to the absolute silence of the rest of the dead where they were scattered about their silence their fear and their hatred it made him feel powerful especially their hatred he was powerful for he was the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri but he was truly impatient now and desired to be up and away away from this dead place and all its dead inhabitants up into the night sky and searching for the living for its blood which is the life not dust now he sighed a false sigh and arched his hand on the old chiefs chest until his blunt powerful fingernails formed a bridge there only give a push his hand would sink through rotten cloth and wormy flesh into the very soul of the one who lay there incapable of movement and if the old chief had not had faith in nestors talent before certainly he believed in it now especially knowing what was in the necromancers mind wait he cried his deadspeak voice broken like an old pot i will speak ill tell you everything you desire to know the meaning of these things which you have remembered how i myself rememember them and what they meant to me indeed i think they may be the reason i died before my time nestor was fascinated say on but first youd best tell me your name for it seems improper to share this mutual event from the past of both our lives without that weve first been introduced and after all you know who i am but ive not yet had the pleasure must i ttell you my nnname the others voice shivered almost as if it would fly into shards oh yes for if you lie to me im sure that your sons and daughters and their children are still abroad in the world of the living so that even when ive finished with you there shall always be other fish to fry if you have lied to me my sons the old man was distraught nestor could almost sense him wringing his hands though of course he lay motionless on his shelf and and their sons the necromancer merely shrugged i am a vampire indeed a lord of vampires wamphyri and prey upon the living but tell me the truth and you and yours are safe ill not bother them i swear it nestors voice was the soul of sarcasm you swear it you and should i believe you do you have a choice nestor smiled with his voice and then stopped smiling enough lets have done with this now should i squeeze your heart until all of the worms that are in it are pulp he pressed down lightly until the nails of his hand cut through the mouldy cloth of the others shroud no no the old chief gasped his deadspeak denial only hold off necromancer and shall tell you all and without further pause he did am i was agon mitrea son of lexandru and like my father before me led the szgany mitrea through fifteen years of wamphyri oppression also through the balmy years of peace until they came again briefly out of the icelands but only to be destroyed at the helllands gate and that is the time and the event which you have remembered from your childhood cannot be mistaken what the destruction of the old wamphyri nestors fascination grew by leaps and bounds indeed the corpse gave a motionless deadspeak nod after that gradually the szgany stopped traveling most of us to make our jives in towns and settled camps but following the fire in the sky the thunder in the earth the doom across the mountains in starside i had only three years left and will tell you about it that morning of which you speak it must be fifteen or sixteen years ago now i witnessed that same awesome wonder exactly as you did though i suspect i was very much closer to its source than you were too close in fact the pulsing white light a great sheet of it that threw the mountains into silhouette and burned like naked fire on the ball of the eye the crack sharp as a stone split by the heat of a furnace followed by a dull rumble of continuous thunder in air and earth alike the webhke lightnings and fleeing clouds all red and flickering in their underbellies and then that monstrous mushroom ball growing taller than the mountains themselves climbing higher and higher with the fires of its guts all spilling out from its heart nestor saw it all in the dead mans mind just as he himself had described it but closer and from a different angle and now he said you say you were closer than i was much too close in fact but where were you exactly and what do you mean too close in those days my people jived only a few miles from this very spot this ancient szgany burial place agon answered at once for he was well under nestors control now we dwelled in a settled camp west of the great pass through the barrier mountains that morning i was out with with my sons but in the next moment realizing what he had said or given away agon paused in shock as if hed suddenly clapped a hand to his mouth nestor smiled and said ah and so you do have sons now i can be sure youll tell me the whole truth but go on you were out that morning with your sons out hhunting with them yyes old agon continued wishing it were possible to die again right now which he would gladly do if only it would put him and his beyond the reach of this fiend we were up before dawn the rabbits come out in the dawn likewise the deer and wild pigs there are good hunting grounds in the eastern foothills beyond the mouth of the pass we had been there and were on our way back loaded down by the weight of good meat all sunside on our left hand a glorious sun just breaking free of the horizon and the mouth of the pass on our right and that was when it happened when the fading stars were blotted out entirely and all the sky over starside turned blinding white we were blinded if only for a moment or seconds at most we staggered and stumbled as the earth trembled and some of us even fell to the ground to hug it ah but they were the lucky ones they were shielded from what came next for even as the clouds burned red and began their panic flight so a hot wind from hell blew through the pass from starside and there was sulphur and stench and burning in it and most likely poison too no i am certain there was poison i smelled it breathed it in felt it burning on my face a wind out of starside but warm i didnt know what to make of it it was the breath of hell or the exhaust of the weapons of hell at least or possibly but i doubt it the awful stench of a vampire wizards experiment which had rebounded and destroyed them all at a stroke and as if he were out of breath agon mitrea at last fell silent until in a little while nestor told him not all of the wamphyri were destroyed the old wamphyri aye but not those who inhabit the last aerie now for far in the east beyond a great red desert wasteland the lands have been ruled by vampire lords from time immemorial until the present day their place is called turgosheim which is the source of of this most recent infestation agon finished it for him his deadspeak voice filled with loathing now it was nestors turn to fall silent a moment and to tilt his head slowly on one side and how his eyes burned red in the darkness of the cave as he gazed down on the corpse of the old chief and repeated his final word out loud infestation what like lice do you mean you are very frank agon mitrea son of lexandru i could not hide my feelings about you and your like even if i tried the other answered bitterly now no not even if you make me pay for it no need for payment nestor told him not yet then what else do you want from me tell me about this poison nestor said for obviously you believe that is what you died of just three years later there were rumours theories wild guesses about it agon mitrea gave a careless deadspeak shrug he was sure the great majority would want nothing more to do with him now not after he had spoken to a necromancer and exiled to eternal darkness denied the comradeship of the teeming dead what good would this monotonous nonexistence of his be to him then the szgany are not without their socalled wise men seers and thinkers he finally continued some had it that the old wamphyri led by shaitan the unborn himself had been wizards who called up one too many demons out of the earth they said that the poisonous mushroom cloud must have been one such demon but as ive told you already i doubt it be that as it may its poison spread like wildfire on starside the stony ground there was said to shine at night and whatever was in that shine it killed off the cavern trogs in their hundreds and produced as many grotesque mutations among them a foxfire nestor was curious now for hed seen just such a plume of shining earth on starside like a finger five miles long pointing north from the glaring helllands gate also there were traces of that same luminescence in the foothills and along the base of the mountains to the west where the trogs dwelled in their dank caverns like a foxfire yes but foxfire is the glow of rottenness and this was the glow of death explain theres nothing much to explain again the old chiefs shrug those men with me in the mouth of the pass by sundown their hair was falling out their gums and fingernails bled their faces turned white where theyd gazed into the hot wind through the pass and none of them fathered children from that day to this several died of which i was one as for the ones who stumbled and fell down in the heather or behind boulders when the earth shook yes and mercifully my sons were among them they suffered very little only a sickness a malaise which wore off in time enough canker barked from behind nestor i cant make head or tail of it oh i believe that you speak to him and he answers you but it makes no sense to me for i hear only you therefore i waste my time here and i fancy you waste yours too now are you coming or do i go on alone and see you later back in wrathstack nestor looked at canker then at the lich of agon mitrea he had no more questions for the old chief and like the doglord he had had enough of corpses for one night he turned to follow canker where already he was loping towards the exit then paused and slowly turned back and but i have not said my farewells he used his deadspeak say nothing but simply go agon shuddered his relief except at the start of their question and answer session the old chief had not been very forthcoming that had been a mistake on his part from which the teeming dead might learn something and later agon had been frank indeed he had been too frank despite nestors recognition of the fact that the louse and the vampire are two of a kind which is to say bloodsuckers still hed not cared for the old mans comparison so that now nestor thought to himself this agon really should be taught a lesson and drawing back his lips from his teeth in a snarl and grasping the corpses elbow and upper arm suddenly and without warning he gave a twist and a wrench and tore the limb free of its rotting shoulder shreds of tattered black flesh hung down from the gaping socket and fat white graveworms wriggled where the dismembered arm flopped to the dusty floor then as agons mind yawned open like an incorporeal mouth to issue a scream of denial so nestor coughed up phlegm and spat it into his empty eyesockets and bayed with laughter as the old chief recoiled from it without moving the merest fraction of an inch following which smiling in his morbid fashion nestor set out after canker and as behind him the violated corpse issued peal after peal of silent resounding shrieks and the teeming dead in their urns and on their ledges cried out for pity finally nestor lichloathe knew that he had earned his name in full and he was glad ill after the hunt nestor and glina a little over three hours later after resting their flyers a while in the foothills of the barrier mountains and having then launched skywards to fly with the clouds once more nestor and cankers vampire senses simultaneously picked up strong szgany vibrations landing at the edge of dense woodlands six miles west of the great pass they found warm embers in a dead fire then going to all fours and sniffing in a wide circle all about like a great hound or the dogthing that he was canker soon picked up the scent and with nestor following on close behind he began tracking his prey along the overgrown forest paths in less than half an hour they had found the traveller group two young men two young women a twelveyearold girl and an infant they had split into two family groups and slept beneath oiled leather awnings roped to the lower branches of trees in a natural clearing and they were bundled up in cured furs on beds of bracken when canker and nestor came upon them now this is more to my liking the doglord coughed in nestors mind where they stood like wraiths wrapped in a mist of their own making looking down on the sleeping faces of the group aye this is the stuff its exactly what i had in mind a man each a woman each this sweet girlchild with her sex unexplored tight as a mouses earhole to open up and fill on the one hand bite into and drain to the dregs on the other and an infant or roasting in the mountains when were feeling peckish before we fly back to starside and come sunup four brand new thralls in our manses in wrathstack this wiji have been a night and a half and time for a jot more business yet hah but we make a good team you and i the infant jives nestor answered of course he does canker agreed for now no he is to remain ajive untouched untainted what but heu be succulent and without these adults with them as thralls in wrathstack what chance does he have anyway plenty of chances in suckscar youll give him to that dumpling glina in place of the one she lost cankers mind was shrewd when he desired it to be aye it sometimes works with wolves without the infant we deprived her of she might hate me and i want her to love me you put a jot of store by that girl is she that good she was good to me upon a time i have my reasons let it be so be it canker shrugged the child jives in which case the young girj is mine will you keep her no but ill be into her and ill drink whats left when im done nestor scowled and said fox dog wolf maybe theres something of the pig in you too shes a mere child canker but in fact he knew that she was only meat or would be soon and anyway he didnt really care one way or the other yet in the back of his mind in the ever shrinking human part of him perhaps something shrieked its abhorrence even now but if so its cries were weak and went unheard as for what nestor had said to the doglord which must surely be seen as an insult nestor could say anything to him even things which would get other men killed usually canker would grunt and turn away to show his disapproval if nestors words had cut him but this time he was satisfied to laugh in his fashion a child you say well i say shes a she and shell be good and tight his laughter died away in nestors mind to be replaced by cold cunning insatiable lust and purest evil then with his eyes blazing like fires as his fangs commenced to lengthen and salivate canker went into a crouch over his intended victims and growled in nestors mind when you are ready ust say the word nestor was ready now he said out loud they had hung their gauntlets from branches to be picked up later when all was done there had seemed little or no requirement for serious weaponry on this occasion now they reached down together gripped the men by their throats and drew them swiftly from their beds cankers was very young the doglord nipped him in the neck delivered a stunning blow to the side of his head tossed him aside and reached greedily for his suddenly screaming woman nestor slammed his man against the bole of the tree and as the wind was knocked out of him and he opened his mouth to cry his shock and terror pinned him there by driving the sixinch blade of his knife through his gasping mouth and right cheek deep into the bark and tough timber core conscious for now the man stood there naked and shivering slopping blood and saliva gurgling where he clung to the tree to keep from falling and ripping his face wide open he tried once to free the knife despite the incredible pain it caused him but only halfawake and weak from shock and horror and nestor having driven the knife home with a vampires enormous strength it was a wasted effort meanwhile nestor reached down again into the bundle of furs but his attack on the man had taken time and given the woman a breathing space she was already on her feet and running after her lad canker cried from where hed tossed his victim facedown across a fallen tree trunk mounted her from the rear and was hammering into her while she howled the agony of her violated flesh ah the thrill of the chase is ah ahh good he panted but the rewards are so much better except you mustnt forget ah ahh ahhh leave the girlchild to me for ill not be ahhh ill not be too long here the girl who had been sleeping a little apart from cankers targeted group was also running her long slim white legs flashed in blue starlight as she sped barefoot into the forest nestor noted which direction the youngster took passed the information to the doglord in a single instantaneous thought then hurried after the woman and quickly caught up with her panting whining deep in her throat like a trapped animal she found her way blocked by thorn bushes spun on her heel and saw nestor coming and rushed straight at him taken by surprise indeed astonished for a moment he stood stock still until he saw the starlight glinting on the knife in her hand and that hand even now arcing towards him ducking to one side he felt the keen blade slicing into his arm cold metal wetted on blood cutting skin muscle metamorphic vampire sinew furious snarling controlling his pain as only a lord of the wamphyri can nestor struck at the womans knife arm and felt it break like a twig and as she cried her agony he clouted her on the head in the manner prescribed by the doglord felled she at once slumped to the forest floor while from some little distance away aha came cankers bark of triumph and a moment later the wail of the waif for the dogthing had pursued and caught the small girl and of course nestor knew what he would do with her but that was the way of it the wamphyri have their needs and cankers needs were often prodigious and after all the blood is the life and young blood is the sweetest briefly curiously nestor found himself wondering whether canker would drink before or after hed used her or during but in any case the girl was as good as ruined she would be a vampire in mangemanse if the doglord left her enough strength to make it through the pass before the dawn the infants extra weight was negligible bundled up at the rear of nestors saddle behind glinas slumped form it cried out once or twice during the blustery ascent on the night thermals but that was all yet its cries were sufficient to cause glina to stir and moan in her vampire sleep sensing that she would soon wake up and again before her time nestor decided to test his theory if glina took to the child and if the merest spark of her old love for him could yet be rekindled then he would carry her to suckscar to be his thrall and warm his bed if not perhaps he would still take her to suckscar there was always the provisioning what now canker called across to him breaking his train of thought what say we settle in the heights and rest awhile and scan for szgany fires and such not me nestor called back til stop while im ahead you carry on if you wish and ill see you back in wrathstack me ive had more than enough for one night my flyers weary ill take a break in the heights aye but then im on my way back canker looked across at him and grinned lewdly shrewdly your minds an open door nestor you never even sniffed that girl back there or touched glina for that matter but now at last your juices are working you want her but youre being coy about it well thats fair enough have it your own way cankers not the one to stay where hes not wanted and anyway youre right enoughs enough for one night i have work aplenty in mangemanse i want to get back early and see what my lads are up to and my lasses and then theres my moon music farewell then nestor told him and canker threw back his head and yipped then sped for a gap between the peaks and was soon lost from sight nestor landed his flyer in the thin soil of a saddle between jutting granite outcrops situated at a slightly higher altitude than the sunside treeline the hollow was thickly clad in purple nightblooming heather which gave the place a cloying sicklysweet smell he lifted glina down from his saddle and saw how cold and trembly she was well and she would soon become accustomed to that only the most extreme subzero temperatures will seriously incapacitate a vampire but for the moment they might as well be comfortable at least and so he took down the infant child wrapped him in his own soft leather jacket and laid him to one side then spread the cured fur in which the child had been bundled and placed glina upon it which was when she woke up what who she struggled to sit up a little way then fell back to lie there wrapped in dark fur pale and dishevelled in the starlight she looked and was a captive thing a thrall not only physically but mentally too or she would be soon which excited him and made him want to use her but he would not take her by force for he wanted her to come to him as she had used to if she wouldnt then he would find another use for her she was only flesh and blood she had been watching him for some time until finally you she said but her voice was dead empty he took the child to her showed her his face my baby suddenly glinas voice was a whisper of hope she couldnt believe it she reached for the child and saw that he was not hers no said nestor shaking his head hes not yours but he can be if you want him he covered the baby again and put him to one side in the heather you burned my baby she said her voice cold again and now you would give me this one some other poor mothers loss i didnt burn your child nestor lied easily for lying is the natural province of vampires it was the doglord canker canison he burned your cabin in any case we didnt know there was an infant in there but my baby burned nevertheless and you nestor what do you care you are a vampire he shrugged it was my destiny to be wamphyri didnt i always tell you i was the lord nestor well and now i am suddenly glina was sobbing deep wracking painful sobs he sat down with her and put an arm round her shuddering shoulders tears change nothing amazingly she snuggled up to him or perhaps not amazingly she was after all his thrall and nestor was her master also he now felt a power in himself a talent which he had not used before because hed not been aware of it had not needed to know it and his eyes were hypnotic and his voice languorous when he said aye we sat together many a time you and i in your fathers cabin when they were abed and sometimes wed go down to the river too conscious of her flesh he opened the furs a little until his hand could steal inside to weigh her breasts just as in that other time and again she softened and snuggled closer and said you dont know how many times ive cried myself to sleep and longed for your return but not like this nestor what will become of me will you make me a vampire too but its done he said with another shrug my mark is on you its the mark of that which governs me and could be no other way as to what will become of you well fly to wrathstack the last aerie if you wish it and the child too and if i do not wish it then you must make your own way for you cant dwell on sunside now then i have no choice you loved me upon a time he said his hands insistent now in their turn her hands found his member standing erect and jerking she lay back sighed threw open her blanket of fur how i have wanted you and even now when i should hate you still i want you it was his vampire stuff in her from time to time she would hate him look back on what shed lost and hate him but when he called to her she would always come and she would never be free from his fascination you were like no other he answered throwing off his clothes because you loved me and gave your all now in suckscar they only give to fill my needs because they desire to please me but it rarely pleases me and he entered her like never before and his metamorphic flesh filled her and brought her shuddering to an instant orgasm and another and another until she cried out for him to stop for she felt that she couldnt stand one more but he gave it to her anyway and because her sex was bruised nestor took her in her mouth and in her exit and was wellreceived in both and for him it was like it had never been in suckscar as for glina shed never in her wildest dreams imagined it could be like this with any man and of course it couldnt for nestor was much more than a man he was wamphyri and what woman will ever go lusting after men once she has had a vampire or after he has had her upon a time glina had seduced him now she in turn was seduced by his voice his eyes his hands his body she was enthralled and she knew that if she couldnt have him have this which he had showed her then she would destroy herself utterly and so she determined that she woujd have it and be his mistress in suckscar but what glina didnt know was this that of all his mistresses she would only be one and what nestor didnt know and never discovered was this that wratha the risen had seen him with glina wrathas raid on sunside had been disastrous plotted in anger and badly executed as a result the outcome had been no better than last time for the previous raid had also been against ruined settlement and it had worked out expensive indeed she had lost one lieutenant dead and another seriously wounded a newlyweened flyer destroyed and a small aerial warrior decoyed brought down deflated and burned as a result of which wrathspire had been depleted and wratha the risen had vowed revenge on the szgany lidesci whose name had become a curse throughout wrathstack in its entirety for wratha wasnt the only one who had been frustrated in her attempts to raid on settlement the other lords were in the same fix try as they might they could never go anywhere near the place with impunity but suffered losses at every turn for the erstwhile inhabitants of settlement a town which wratha and her renegades as theyd termed themselves then had tried to destroy on their very first excursion out of the last aerie had proved a difficult lot to cow indeed difficult wasnt the word for it they were impossible fighters born their leader was a man who seemed as crafty and merciless as the wamphyri themselves his name was lardis lidesci which was also a curse on wrathas lips he set traps for flyers decoys for warriors and had crossbows and devastating explosive weapons which fired lethal silver pellets to penetrate and poison vampire flesh and tonights raid another flyer pierced through its neck with a bolt from a giant crossbow its lieutenant rider knocked out of his saddle and doubtless dealt with by the defenders of that tottering derelict pile the flyer itself shrilling like the wind off the icelands in wrathspires turrets raining its vital fluids finally crashing in the sunside foothills a total loss and never a captive taken nor a single changeling thrall who ever made it out of the region to come shambling and mewling over the boulder plains before sunup and nothing to show for this humiliation except perhaps in wrathas vampire heart her absolute determination that one day shed bring the szgany lidesci lardis included especially him to their knees as for settlement itself the town stood at the base of sunsides foothills some eightyodd miles west of the great pass it had been a thriving community when wratha and the others came fleeing here out of the east from turgosheim beyond the great red waste but flying out from the last aerie on that initial raid theyd first hit twin fords a neighbouring town then settlement and reduced them to so much rubble it should have been total victory followed by utter subjugation of the szgany and eventually a free run of sunside such as that enjoyed by vormulac unsleep and his vampire colleagues in turgosheim it should have been like that but wasnt for during the course of those vicious preemptive strikes wratha and her raiders had themselves been taken by surprise when the humans hit back in turgosheims sunside it had been very different there the szgany were docile cowed supplicant creatures sullenly but without any real objection they had given to the wamphyri and would never dare refuse them or even hint at fighting back so that turgosheims lords had been able to use sunside and its inhabitants like a vast larder to plunder at will and had even operated a tithesystem designed to ensure a fair split of the spoils not only of human spoils but of all good things out of sunside for there in the east even the socalled free men of the szgany spun cloth and forged for their masters they fashioned their clothes and weapons for them they farmed hunted and gathered for them and they bred for them of course but the wamphyri of turgosheim had been greedy destructive masters to a man theyd lived for today without a thought for tomorrow and over the course of hundreds of years wamphyri depredations had cut szgany stock to the bone until the inhabitants of turgosheims sunside had been little more than grubby animals they were human but had been debased almost to extinction as members of that race and if blood is truly the life theirs was a trickle thin as water growing thinner with each new tithe it was just one of several reasons why wratha and the others had fled out of turgosheim in the first place so that they might give free rein to wamphyri passions in pastures new but there were other reasons too there had seemed no future in turgosheim where the upper echelon was so firmly ensconced as to be irremovable while the lower orders were falling into a gradual decline just like the people they victimized but far to the west rumours had told of a vast and sprawling land of plenty of milk and honey and rich red blood and these were rumours which the lady wratha couldnt ignore determined to discover the truth of it for herself also to escape from turgosheims claustrophobic constraints she had drawn together a crew of malcontents much like herself vasagi the suck wran the rage and his brother spiro killglance gorvi the guile and canker canison and all of them had commenced in secret to make flyers and forbidden aerial warriors like none seen before all with stamina enough to carry them and their makers over the great red waste into the west so they had arrived here with their lieutenants some eighteen months ago and had at once begun raiding on sunside to improve their lot in the last aerie of the wamphyri at first they had worked as a team but that hadnt lasted arguments had split them up old scars had started itching anew old scores still required settling that was why wran and vasagi had fought their duel on sunside from which only wran had returned but other feuds were in the offing wratha was sure vasagi had been an ally of sorts and now he was no more and for all that wratha was strong and her manse secure still she knew that she was a woman while the others were all men well men of sorts it had been to strengthen her hand and also to avenge herself that wratha had launched this latest raid on settlement shed needed strong lidesci blood for her men and beasts and a handful of lidesci thralls wouldnt go amiss in wrathspire either failing and finding herself depleted yet again shed ordered her creatures home while she herself rode a high wild wind and raged into the night and anyone who had seen her would know why men were careful in their dealings with the lady wratha except no one had seen her but as wratha had calmed herself and descended from the turbulence of upper air to float on the blustery thermals over the high crags she had seen nestor and glina then using her mentalism to explore nestors mind knowing what he was doing and how he was enjoying it shed barely been able to control a second bout of furious raging nestor was with some chit out of sunside some szgany slut filling her to brimming he was with a mere girl when he could have been with wratha withdrawing from the lurid churning and throbbing of his mind at first she turned her flyers head towards the highest peaks and starside but in another moment gritting her teeth and giving a vicious jerk on the reins she turned back and in the dark and seething quagmire of her undead mind only one thought now this this nestor and despite herself she had to know more about him and the way he was with women landing her flyer some hundred yards away knowing that the winds bluster would cover the slither of scree as the hovering beast touched down wratha dismounted and hurried to the saddle where shed seen them together in the heather and keeping her mind tightly guarded peering through a gap where jagged fangs of rock leaned together she spied upon the the lovers and how many times had she spied on him from her high windows going out upon his flyer to practise and how often had she insinuated herself into his mind watching him at work and at play he had his women of course he did he was wamphyri but he rarely enjoyed them indeed he was with them much as wratha was with her lovethralls utterly bored shed sent out thoughts to lure him when he was asleep shed planted pictures of herself in his mind and she had used her vampire art to beguile and fascinate him to no avail for he was naive not naive as a man no but as a lord of the wamphyri certainly and oh this fine young body this oh so beautiful body all muscle and fire and energy all wasted on such as this wratha could laugh but instead felt like crying and was at once outraged by the very idea what wratha the risen bawling over a man like some sunside peasant girl at her age and with all of her experience no man not one none of them had ever been worth the effort but this one could it be that he was but no he wasnt it was just the way he enjoyed coupling with this slut it was his pleasure it was the tingle she had felt in his blood it was that he wasnt making love to wratha there it was out she fancied him no she actually lusted after him before there had been plenty of time she had known that nestor would come to her eventually following which she would soon tire of him and send him away but now time had run out he had not come to her he had taken a woman who pleased him a dull stupid even plain szgany bitch but she pleased him and wratha felt pangs she had never known before which might be the acid burn of jealousy or possibly the bittersweet sting of love yes perhaps even that but true love was so rare among the wamphyri it was almost unheard of and yet wratha had heard of it had even seen it for herself back in turgosheim the great lord vormulac taintspore called unsleep was still in love despite that his lady had died seventy and more years ago and he had not slept for all of that time such was vormulacs devotion that hed kept his manse melancholy vormspire like a mausoleum to her memory then there had been karl the crags love for wratha which had destroyed him in the end it had to for shed been ambitious then as she was now and with karl in the way could never have ascended into the circle of ladies but instances such as this were rare indeed singular and with all of these thoughts and plenty of others in her head she watched them coupling and with every jerk of nestors buttocks or gasp of joy or sweetest pain from glina her eyes protruded a little more from her head and the figured bone scarp upon her brow burned crimson from their glare wratha saw the ways he took her the sheer inexhaustible power of the need driving him on and knew that no man not even karl the crag had ever taken her like this it was his youth and his passion and his lust and it was every erotic dream he had ever dreamed all of it bursting out of him now amplified by his vampire leech to previously inaccessible undreamed heights and if he is not careful wratha thought he might easily fuck that girl to death wrathas nipples were hard as callouses yet sensitive as open sores where almost unconsciously she squeezed them through her robe and she felt the bud of her sex stiffening to a small finger as her hand stole down to her mass of black ringlets and into the cleft of love and wratha the risen even the lady wratha herself stood trembling panting and masturbating as she watched nestor shudder to a climax the way his seed spurted from the corners of glinas mouth then it was over nestor fell back and lay sprawled on the heather glina took up an infant hugged it to her bruised breasts covered herself and the child with furs and curled up to sleep they were like young animals making love until they were exhausted and then sleeping it off and suddenly the lady wratha was exhausted too she had brought herself to orgasm right along with nestor but all it had left in her was a dull ache by no means the relief which had blossomed like a weird night orchid in his mind and body again wratha felt like crying the furious sting of tears trying to be shed and again she detested herself for it but the reflected blaze of her eyes under their scarp of bone was lacklustre now like a lamp turned low and so before vastly enhanced wamphyri emotions could make a fool of her entirely she backed out of her hidingplace returned to her flyer and launched for wrathstack but even as she climbed aloft and sped for that last lone fang of rock against its backdrop of diamond stars bluesheen horizon and shifting sighing auroral curtain wratha knew in her heart that nothing would be quite the same from this time forward because for the very first time in her toolong life and undeath she was sure that she actually did have a heart after all in suckscar that sundown nestor made glina his first woman but first he waited until the fever had gone out of her and her eyes took on that unmistakable feral look and the fact of it was her vampirism enhanced her not to the fantastic extent of wamphyri enhancement and metamorphism but it did lend her a certain elegance of motion in place of the clumsiness shed displayed before and a sort of sensual intelligence or selfawareness which her master found disconcerting in a girl who had been so dull she was his thrall now a vampire yes but paradoxically there seemed a lot more of the gypsy in her too than was previously apparent his bite which changed other women into bloodlusting creatures none of whom could ever be trusted entirely certainly not in their instincts and thoughts had changed a mainly naive girl more truly into a woman she had been in canker canisons eyes a dumpling she still was but was now more nearly edible conducting her through suckscar and making known to his males the role she would play in the manse nestor fancied that his lieutenants and senior thralls found the swivel of her more than ample hips attractive her glance alluring but it could be that they desired to keep on her good side because she was a favourite of their master and would now control the comings and goings of all the other women finally he introduced her to his female thralls each by name and told them that from now on she would be in charge of their work roster overseeing all of their duties glinas word would be law among them let anyone complain make difficulties or put obstacles in her way she would report that fact to nestor and he would know how to correct the situation but all of his thralls knew him now how he meant what he said and none of them were about to make difficulties then while glina familiarized herself with her new duties he went alone to his senior thralls and lieutenants and warned them off what the doglord had said to him or hinted about the more ambitious of his men lusting after power and position had struck a chord perhaps he had allowed too much freedom in suckscar and the reins must now be tightened his lieutenants were the first to feel his telepathic scrutiny but zahar and grig had learned their lessons well they harboured no real ambitions in respect of suckscar nor did they seek to seduce nestors women what was it likely they would cross a man who could torture them alive then torture them dead no for they knew that nestor was a necromancer as for his lesser male thralls his message to them was simple glina was now the first of his women in suckscar she was his if any man so much as looked at her lustfully nestor would first feed his parts to a warrior then feed him slowly and feet first into the meal grinders and since these were simple thralls he had allowed glina to be in attendance when he instructed them in this fashion so that she took it that indeed he valued her beyond all the other women and her step grew a little lighter by virtue of that fact she was given her own rooms directly beneath nestors in an excavated area under the sweeping stairs to his apartments with a narrow spiral staircase that climbed up to an annexe off his bedchamber and even had an older woman assigned to her to clean her rooms and mind the child so that glinas lot was in every respect superior to any other womans in all suckscar and so she took up her new life and duties and quickly learned all that was required of her at least with regard to her mundane responsibilities within the manse then before the next sundown as she lay in her bed and wondered about nestor where he slept somewhere overhead suddenly she heard his call or felt it and knew that he wanted her and climbing the spiral staircase to his chambers she entered his bedroom only to discover that two others were there before her nestor saw the look on her face and quickly cautioned her say nothing do not offend me or mine these girls are here to be instructed by you for although they are beautiful they have forgotten the part which made them innocent and beguiling women for there is innocence even in sex but there is no satisfaction in sex with such as these whose nature it is to be promiscuous that is why you are here to teach them the art of innocence naivety she was bewildered but i dont have that art but you do for you satisfy me and when they have learned it from you then part of my life at least shall be complete you want me to show them how to yes he cut her short i want you to show them everything glina while you still can for as yet youre more woman than vampire and i have been bored in my bed for far too long my needs are not well served here now at last she saw her true position in suckscar but she was his thrall and must obey and she did and so the last flickering spark which yet remained in glina berea which might even have been rekindled into love of sorts however dark and strange died in her that time for she knew that whatever course her life took from this point forward she would never forget the events which had befallen her the fact that she was now a vampire the similar fate of her mother and father residents now in mangemanse the monstrous burning of her child probably the time would never come when she might take her revenge but if it ever did then she woujd take it iv wrathas vow gorvis proposition in the heights of wrathspire wratha the risen brooded like a great black cloud she brooded roiling and rumbling and constantly threatening rain except the lady wrathas rain burned like acid six months and more she had been this way while her thralls went in fear of their lives plainly she was distracted and they had learned to leave her that way only break into her train of thoughts and draw her back to reality however briefly all hell would break loose she would fly into a rage hurl abuse and other things and rush through the manse like a lunatic storm bowling everything over in her passing and issuing the direst threats left right and centre at all and sundry for wratha had a great many things on her mind which demanded her utmost concentration and mental coordination or so she was given to excuse herself which in itself was strange for as a lady of the wamphyri she scarcely required to make excuse for anything but it was obvious that in fact her coordination was in tatters and her concentration nonexistent something it seemed was stretching the ladys nerves to breaking she had lost all interest in the administration of wrathspire so that her lieutenants had never known such freedom in the running of the place no domestic problem or dispute could be permitted to disturb her no slightest whisper or unaccustomed jangle of sound no unexpected footfall she fell behind in her selfallotted duties and the ordersgroup meetings which had always been such a regular feature of life in wrathspire became fewer and fewer until they ceased entirely her males almost all of them from the lowliest novice to the most senior lieutenant began to take advantage likewise her vampire women lustful affairs which wratha had kept to a minimum for all that she knew her thralls must amuse themselves as best they could swiftly gathered impetus schedules suffered as a direct result wratha scarcely noticed her love thralls could not satisfy her when the best of them failed her she murdered him in her bed and the others grew thin the aerie quickly went to pieces grotesque siphoneers in their discreetly curtained niches developed sores and parasitic infestations and the water they drew up from guilesumps wells became less than pure because their wayward keeper serviced a woman instead of the flaccidly insensate creatures in his keep foetal warriors waxing in their vats went untended and one of them even slumped expired and eventually stank because no one saw fit to drain the huge corpse of its corruptible wastes and morbid fluids cooks in their kitchens made do with what little was available but the manses fare was less than satisfactory pantries and coldstorage rooms stood empty likewise the granaries flyers went mewling hungry and in the raids on sunside were wont to grow weary and unreliable and through all of this apparently unaware wratha merely brooded but during the long days when the rest of the stack slept then she would sit up and send her thoughts down into suckscar to worm their way into nestors dreaming mind before this had been little more than an amusement it had titillated wratha to read his sleeping thoughts but now it was no longer an amusement but an agony and the szgany girl glina was the source of wrathas pain for she had known nestor as a man while wratha had not she was an artless shad at best this glina yet apparently there was one art which she had mastered the pleasuring of the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri mastered it to such an extent that suckscars new lord even required her to instruct his other women in order that they too might satisfy him except they were mainly incapable of instruction for they had long since lost what glina retained that very artlessness which wratha so despised it was that she was naive or pretended to be because it pleased him her sex was always fresh quivering halfafraid yet full of longing she was a woman but continued to play the girl the innocent so that her lord would need no other for when he was with her he was the untried youth again jerking erect as he stroked her teats or bruised them in his passion it was as if he remembered a time when love human love szgany love had been something other than lust and was trying to recapture it or perhaps it was that he remembered some other lover not this glina and was trying to recapture her and as soon as that thought came to wratha then she knew she was on the right track for it made sense out of a paradox how nestor could fancy and continue to fancy this merely homely creature when he was surrounded by girls of vasagi the sucks choice for vasagi had installed most of the women who dwelled now in suckscar and for all that hed been a monster in his own right the suck had had an eye for beauty but the difference was this that glina had actually loved nestor upon a time and for all that she had been a novice herself still she had taught him all he knew now he knew other things but still he remembered how it had been with glina while his brain may have forgotten much of his past his body continued to remember and not only glina but someone before her oh wratha knew their history well enough shed stolen it right out of their minds she knew that glina had been nestors sunside lover for she had seen pictures from his past replayed a dozen times in the eye of his mind but more than this she knew there was a fury in him when he made love to glina which he would rather expend on this unknown other some unrequited love out of his unremembered past it could only be whoever she was this other it seemed to wratha she was worthy of serious consideration for if nestor lichloathe had found and brought back glina out of sunside and out of his more recent past then one day he might also find and bring back the other too from a yet more distant period and what then all of wrathas plans gone up in smoke no not at all for by then nestor would belong to wratha as for this glina what was she simple she was nothing what this ungainly szgany peasant she was a flame that would soon flicker and die a piece of tarnished property a tool to be used blunted and eventually discarded ah but if or when wratha should ever set eyes on this other be sure she would know how best to deal with her and she would deal with her most certainly it was her vow in that same sixmonth period of twentysix sunups nestors fame or infamy as a necromancer had spread through all of the stack in every manse from guilesump to wrathspire his talent was the subject of gossip and speculation the former among the lieutenants of the wamphyri and lesser thralls and the latter among the vampire lords themselves canker canison was mainly to blame for spreading the word pleased to call himself nestors friend he was proud of the comparative newcomer and desired to see him elevated among his peers for the doglord had the dubious gift of scrying future times and he had foreseen that nestors talent would make him very powerful a force to be reckoned with in the last aerie and canker was right late one sundown after a full nights raiding on sunside when the lady and all the lords were safely returned to their various manses the lieutenant grig lichloathe made report to nestor in the quiet room where he rested from his bloody work there the lord of suckscar stretched out in a huge wickerwork chair sipped coarse szgany wine and watched the grey glimmer of a false dawn creeping on the distant crags nestor was reluctant to go to his bed because for months his dreams had been made wretched by recurrent erotic visions mainly of wratha the risen over and over he would revisit wrathspires roof to play out that scene where wratha had fallen into his arms but only to escape from him when she felt his surging ardour and when he started awake from dreams such as this all drenched in sweat and whining his frustration and with the soft curve of wrathas breast still warm in his tingling palm then nestor would put aside all thoughts of his other women glina included as if they were nothing for he knew now what he wanted if not how to get it also he was prideful wratha had made a fool of him once and nestor wasnt about to let it happen again the trouble with wratha the risen was this she liked to toy with her men and all the men of wrathstack knew it still wran killglance would have her if he could and gorvi the guile if he thought it would strengthen his hand as for canker canison the dogthing had openly admitted that he would swap half of the whelps in mangemanse even his own flesh and blood for just one good ride on wratha but there was her reputation to consider which was that of a certain spider the sort that lures a male with her sex before she devours him how may one mate with a maneater with a great deal of care the lord of suckscar was sure these were some of the necromancers thoughts as his man grig lichloathe approached bowed and shuffled his feet until he had his masters attention and finally what is it nestor spoke softly as was now his wont a flyer has landed in the main bay lord grig answered turgis gorvisman is here with a message from his master from gorvi nestor lifted an eyebrow and have you left the lieutenant waiting yes lord nestor stood up then take me to him lets see whats on the lord of guilesumps mind in a walled staging area over the landingbay turgis gorvisman prowled to and fro three paces this way and three back between six of nestors senior thralls they were armed and he was not it would not have been seemly indeed it would not have been allowed to bring a gauntlet into anothers manse a huge man as most lieutenants were turgiss message was brief and his voice a fair imitation of the rumbling growl of a sunside bear as he said lord nestor of suckscar my master gorvi the guile proposes a meeting with you he would discuss business a matter of mutual interest which might possibly lead to huge profits for both of you indeed nestor answered inclining his head and the nature of this business the other shrugged and growled wryly hah that will be the night when gorvi the guile shares his thoughts with lieutenants or lesser persons but this much i know my master has heard it rumoured that you are a necromancer with the power to talk to dead men nestor nodded he wishes to avail himself of my talent then and where will this meeting take place in guilesump naturally but ah no nestor shook his head and smiled a slow knowing smile if at all it will take place here in suckscar i very much doubt it said the other for the guile seldom leaves his manse except to raid on sunside or when he inspects his creatures where they prowl abroad near the foot of the stack he prefers accustomed places in order to maintain a measure of control he takes no chances in this we are not dissimilar nestor replied now go back and tell your master that ill meet him an hour from now out on the boulder plains due north of wrathstack and just a mile from its foot in fact well meet in the shadow of the stack itself at sunup the lieutenants gaze went out over the wall and across the mighty gulf of air high over starside to the barrier mountains the sun never shines on the boulder plains fool nestor retorted but quietly anyway well be meeting in the shadow of the stack as i said i heard and understood you the other answered but i also know that gorvi hates to be abroad when the sun rises over sunside it is his nature nestor turned away it is the nature of each and every one of us to fear the sun he said also its our nature to argue and to have our own way gorvi desires to talk business with me very well ive named the place and time just the two of us no gauntlets lieutenants or warriors if this is satisfactory hell be there if not he made to go back inside i can only tell him what you have said turgis nodded and started down a ladder to the landingbay who knows he might even agree nestor paused and glanced over his shoulder and stared into turgiss eyes before he disappeared from view those are the arrangements he said if gorvi doesnt like them he can wait a sixmonth before approaching me again time is in short supply i can think of better ways to waste it than in arguing meeting places with gorvi the guile so be it the others answer came back to him and in a little while turgis gorvisman launched out and down from suckscar gorvi was there nestor had watched from a northfacing window and had seen the guile speed out upon a flyer only gorvi could look like that a great evil scarecrow of a man hunched in the saddle his cloak flapping like the wings of a huge black bat the other lords were sinister naturally but gorvi the guile was sinister and with certain reservations nestor had sped after him for of course gorvi had been the one who would have made trouble for nestor when first he came here out of sunside and it was gorvi who had suggested a trial period following which nestor would either be accepted or dropped probably from a very great height well it hadnt come to that but neither had nestor forgotten and now the guile wanted something from him all well and good but nothing for nothing be sure nestor landed his flyer on a shale hillock some seventy yards from where gorvi stood beside his own beast dismounting he glanced all about and turned his eyes on wrathstack a mile away possibly they had been seen flying out and were even now spied upon he felt the shields go up in gorvis mind and applied his own their thoughts were now guarded and striding out towards each other they and their long shadows soon came together in the greater shadow of the last aerie they looked at each other a moment or two gorvi tall slender with the dome of his skullhead shaven except for a single central lock with a knot hanging to the rear dressed in black as always so that the contrast of his sallow flesh made him look freshrisen from death and his eyes so deeply sunken they were little more than crimson jewel glimmers in their black orbits yet shifty for all that and nestor not quite so tall but well fleshedout and handsome as hell and open as a door left banging in the wind or open by wamphyri standards at least then well said nestor and do you have business with me or is it that youve decided i didnt quite get there after all and now youd like to throw me out to fend for myself in the stumps of the fallen stacks and scramble for a living in the scree and the rubble of starside and he laughed a quiet humourless laugh ah but that will be the day gorvi thats all over and done with gorvis voice was oily as ever as he held up a slender but wickedly taloned hand in a gesture intended as placatory forgotten by you perhaps nestor answered in his quiet fashion gorvi threw up his hands i came out here against my best instincts to meet you as a friend a colleague even a partner now tell me how may i make known to you the details of the the matter in hand if you insist on scowling carping and mulling over ancient bestforgotten scores anyway what are you complaining about you did get there in the end didnt you what and if i had not set a limit on your ascension can you honestly believe that the others would not have done so nestor smiled his slow cold smile and said dont waste my time gorvi why dont you get to the point what is it you want from me who do you want me to examine the guile tried not to look too surprised but nestor saw how his eyes narrowed and eventually carefully gorvi said but youve been talking to my man turgis isnt that why you sent him to me nestor raised an eyebrow perhaps you should have cut his tongue out and sent him to me dumb turgis told me nothing except that you were interested in my necromancy that was enough huh gorvi snorted and they call me the guile but in a little while very well i do have a man or the body of a man who has or did have secrets and yes it would be in my interest to know the things he knew indeed i would give a lot to know them even so much as half of the profits an even split gorvi nodded but of what knowledge flesh and blood red revenge women for your bed and sly taunting laughter on our lips when the others see what weve achieved all of these things and more gorvi grinned to show his needle teeth and crimson gums well what do you say i say youve told me nothing as yet very well said gorvi now hear my story almost two years ago when first wratha led us here out of the east our first raids on sunside were against a pair of szgany townships named twin fords and settlement and that was when we first learned that there are szgany and szgany in turgosheims sunside for over a hundred years our prey had given us no real trouble but here they fought back we lost flyers and men that night which we could scarcely afford indeed we lost almost all of our lieutenants and we vowed revenge the first of our losses happened in twin fords and we lords were lucky that we werent among them the men of twin fords some of them at least knew what they were doing theyd had dealings with vampires before they had crossbows which had been forbidden in the east since turgo zoltes time tipped with silver and steeped in kneblasch their bolts were of ironwood also they wore long knives in their belts and were equipped with sharp wooden stakes vasagi the suck took a bolt in the side but to him it was little more than a scratch and in any case vasagi was a master of metamorphism he would quickly shed the poisoned flesh and replenish himself the fact that hed been shot at all however had come as something of a shock and as i said the rest of us were lucky we were lucky aye but as for our lads the majority of our lieutenants went down and stayed down ah but didnt we make them pay for it you can be sure we did we wrecked their town ordered our warriors down onto their houses to crush them flat made as many changeling vampire thralls as we could and instructed them to report to us with all their goods in starside before the dawn canker canison ravaged with a vengeance the killglance twins raged like the madmen they are naturally and the lady wratha well she was wrathful as for the town wed turned it to a shambles and it was the beginning of the end for twin fords but it hadnt even started yet for settlement that first town was serious work it had been necessary to recruit thralls and lieutenants have them fill our manses with all the good things out of sunside and set them to work for us in wrathstack the last aerie to make it liveable and despite our losses in the main wed been successful szgany losses were far greater and what are a few lieutenants after all still it had been serious work but settlement would be for fun so we thought it was wrathas idea she must have thought now that my dogs have done their work maybe its time i let them off the leash a little for we were wrathas renegades then do you see and we might have been even now if she wasnt such a thief but that woman for every four we recruited she stole one away thats what broke us up and thats the way weve stayed oh each of us has a part to play in the mainten ance of the stack huh and some play a greater part than others too but as for the rest of it were on our own but there ive strayed a little from my story so wratha rewarded us by turning us loose on the second szgany town this veritable fortress of a place called settlement well she and the others were straight into it no warning and no quarter given but as for myself right from the start i hadnt liked the look of it especially not after the trouble wed had in twin fords now settlement stands in the midwest directly below the foothills at the edge of the forest the entire town is housed within a massive timber stockade with watchtowers and four huge gates and giant crossbows mounted on the battlements gorvi paused and frowned but why do i concern myself to tell you all of this surely you must know something of settlement from your szgany days a moment more and he snapped his thin fingers ah no i remember now you have no memory before the time of wran and vasagis duel a pity for if you had perhaps you would also have the answers to my questions without that you must torture the dead for them nestor shrugged i still dont know what your questions are til get to it gorvi told him and after a moment that first night after twin fords i let the others go ahead and raid on settlement while i settled for smaller prey there was a house on a knoll in the foothills overlooking the town i had seen its lights however briefly from on high but as we stationed our aerial warriors windward of the town behind a jut of crags landed our flyers in the hills and called up a mist so the lights were extinguished it made me suspect that just like the people of twin fords these settlement folk had also had dealings with vampires all the more reason to steer clear of the town well ill cut a long story short while wratha and the others fell on the town i made straight for the place on the knoll and without pause i landed my flyer on top of the house and crushed it then looked for survivors in the rubble there was no one there but scanning all about i discovered a woman hiding in a stand of trees behind the broken house she knew i had spotted her made a run for it and ran right into me she was mature goodlooking and had a fine body on her i would have struck her down at once there and then taken her for my thrall and taken her too if not for an interruption a youth no older than you yourself nestor had come up from the town he was the womans son surely and he attacked me one man or callow youth and he dared to attack gorvi the guile it was astonishing ah but he had a knife the blade of his weapon was coated with deadly silver which burned me where it glanced off my ribs and sliced my forearm and meanwhile the woman had found a hatchet somehow i had been unarmed my gauntlet had slipped from my bloodied forearm and these people how they could fight the one with a knife and the other with her axe suddenly i was in trouble and so called out to my flyer roll on them crush them the clumsy beast made to obey me thrusting itself out of the shambles of the house it struck the woman with a wing tip and knocked her over the rim of the knoll in its steepest part she disappeared with a cry into darkness that left the youth and a single clout stunned him but i was wounded and that concerned me cut with silver my ribs and arm would take a while in the healing the hunt was over where i was concerned i drank from the lad only a little but enough bundled him into my flyers pouch and launched for starside and guilesump so my captive became a common thrall and went about his menial tasks for a month or two in the basement levels of the last aerie but later when it became clear how extraordinary were these settlement folk like thorns in wamphyri flesh then i considered him again the trouble with the szgany lidesci is this they have a superb leader a man called lardis thralls taken from other towns and camps have informed us that lardis was a young chief in the old days in the time of the old wamphyri now he is an old chief and so much wiser no one knows our ways better than he does and no one is better trained and equipped to kill us indeed thats his vow to destroy the wamphyri utterly every last one of us but he wont because he cant and even if he could we would destroy him first but how may we go about it what are his weaknesses apparently he has none and his strengths well to start with he has settlement yes its still there however much we tried to destroy the town during those early nights in the long days that followed lardis would build it up again except the houses are now traps for flyers and sometimes warriors and there are twice as many crossbows on the stockade wall so now settlement exists solely as a lure for unwary vampires and you could be forgiven for asking why dont we simply avoid it but to know that there are men there and probably women too through the long dark nights is in itself a lure it is as if lardis were flaunting himself saying come and get me and oh we would dearly love to for theres good rich fighting blood in these lidescis nestor good lieutenants in the making good strong women for the loving good flesh for the fashioning and apart from all that theres revenge for do you know while we got thralls out of twin fords that first night we got nothing out of settlement but a bad taste in our mouths well our get amounted to a handful at best and of course there was this jason which i took from the house on the knoll but damn few thralls out of settlement and thats how it stands to this day this lardis lidesci he hunts changelings down with a will and burns them before they can make it across the barrier mountains so that now hes as much a legend as we are gorvi paused again and glanced sideways at nestors face in an attempt to gauge his thoughts then looked again more sharply and is something the matter gorvi queried for a peculiar faraway look had come over nestors face and hed turned his head and eyes to gaze towards the southwest in the direction of settlement in fact jason did you say nestors voice had also undergone a change it was uncertain faltering blinking his scarlet eyes he stroked his temples and issued a small moan as if he felt a pain this one you took from the house on the knoll jason aye gorvi nodded frowning now what of it and again the look of pain on nestors face but not truly a physical pain merely that of remembering then it came to him in a flash and jason lidesci he said lardis lidescis son that house you destroyed on the knoll it was the old lidescis place you had your greatest enemys son in the palm of your hand and you didnt even know it what gorvis mouth gaped open are you sure how can you be sure because because i knew him nestor answered jason the house on the knoll the town everything as you described it so i remembered it some of it i think but already the dazed look had crept back onto his face he groaned clenched his teeth and slammed a fist like a rock into the palm of his hand then cursed and turned away it comes and it goes one minute i see things and the next theyre forgotten our greatest enemys son gorvi clapped a hand to his pallid forehead i might have known it he was trouble from the very start surly difficult and defiant and when i sent for him to question him about the szgany lidesci that is after they had become important to us then he tried to make his escape from guilesump and set out over the boulder plains for sunside which would have been the end of him of course for the sun would have done for him except it didnt come to that i have warriors who guard the stack from ground attack they drove him back and my lieutenants went to pick him up no such luck he dodged them came back to wrathstack and commenced to climb it by an exterior route it was the worst possible move on the approach to madmanse the climb peters out and the face leans into an overhang but why did he climb to what end he would either fall or be retaken by a flyer and he would be mine dead or alive well i was soon to learn why he made for the heights it was because he intended to kill himself such is the fighting spirit of these people rather than divulge the secrets of the szgany lidesci this jason lardiss son you say would climb up to a high place and throw himself down and thats exactly what he did moreover he had a sliver of ironwood with him which he held against his heart when he crashed down it was driven into him and that was the end for after all even a vampire is only flesh and blood he had fallen some one hundred and eighty feet onto a wide ledge and was dead in the instant he hit i left him there as a warning to others but as you know starsides air is sharp and desiccating things rarely rot here but shrivel and mummify as we are wont to say dead men stiffen to stones there are no carrioneating birds here and there was no way up to the body for my bulky earthbound warriors which might otherwise devour it so i left him there until a few hours ago for recently i have heard it rumoured that you have the skills of a necromancer and torture dead men for their secrets and thats why ive come here against my better instincts out onto the boulder plains at sunup to talk to you i want you to talk to him and discover the secrets of the szgany lidesci nestor was almost himself again what secrets exactly why is it not obvious gorvi raised his eyebrows now listen the reason this lardis and his people are such a nuisance to us is simple by daylight theyre up and about setting traps and such in settlement and the regions around and then by night they vanish into their hiding places which we havent yet found what i want to know or rather what we you and i need to know is this where do they go to and where and when are they at their most vulnerable as soon as we discover these things then we shall raid on them with as much force as we can muster and make them ours for once theyre scattered then theyre finished we can pick them off at our leisure it would appear to make sense nestor nodded but tell me just where would you have me perform my examination of this jason lidesci in his weird and damaged mind all memories of settlement in a previous time had faded away again but he felt the place had strong connections with his old unknown enemy with him and with someone nestor had loved very dearly who had betrayed him in favour of that same old adversary but settlement had his betrayal and the damage to his mind which had robbed him of his past had it really happened there so far in his raiding on sunside nestor had avoided settlement hed told himself it was out of respect for those same fierce travellers which gorvi had mentioned the lidescis and indeed their name seemed far too familiar on his tongue only speak it visions would pass like the streaks of shooting stars across his mind not memories as such but monochrome scenes bursts of white light and black silhouette burning like afterimages on his scarlet retinas of mighty stockade walls and towers with foothills looming on the one hand and dark forests on the other but then there would be pain in his brain his very mind and the scenes would shatter into fragments like a piece of slate broken against a boulder these uneasy thoughts of nestors had taken but a moment by which time gorvi had answered where will you examine him why in guilesump where else for thats where jasons body is i have his body and you have the talent nestor looked at him youd have me enter your manse of my own free will ah no i prefer a neutral place gorvi scowled where then nestor thought about it in the glare of the helllands gate in the first hour of the next sundown he paused and thought again no better than that well wait until all of the others have gone off raiding on sunside then youll fly to the gate alone well with a dead man for company and i shall follow on behind and well see what well see gorvi shook his head looked puzzled but finally agreed so be it following which there was nothing else to say or do and shortly thereafter in the sky over starside twin manta shapes pulsed and scudded with the clouds for wrathstack in fact it was three hours after true sundown before the rest of the inhabitants of the last aerie had departed wrathstack to go raiding on sunside but gorvi was patient and nestor had all the time in the world for if the truth were known the necromancer was not sure he wanted to know jason lidescis secrets after all he was perhaps afraid that he would learn too much but gorvi flew out as prearranged and nestor followed on and just within the glare of the helllands gate they gentled their flyers to earth and gorvi got down the long blanket roll from his beasts side opening it he beckoned nestor closer as the guile had forewarned the lich was a broken shrivelled thing its contorted face told nestor nothing it could be anyones face it had been badly battered in the fall from guilesump and had dried like a papery wasps nest all crumbling and flaky and the body and limbs were no better most of the bones were broken and some protruded like white kindling as from the makings of a fire how long had he laid there on that ledge nestor inquired two years the other shrugged but not uselessly whenever i had a difficult thrall it happens occasionally i would take him to a high window and let him look down on this one and ask him if he could walk upon the air like the wamphyri for as you must know we lords can fly when we must but common thralls and lieutenants cant the sight of this jason all crumpled there would usually bring them to their senses and if not there were always other ways two years nestor repeated him you must be right the air of starside is sterile bloodless its as if weve sucked the life right out of the place not us but the barrier mountains again gorvis shrug where theres no light theres little or no life but theres always undeath this is a mummy said nestor he gazed down on the shattered body though as yet he had not touched it are you saying you cant do it the guile stared hard at him then at the crumbling corpse is he too far gone nestor looked at him blinked and smiled a very terrible smile no not at all he answered if he were ashes in an urn still i could talk to him indeed hes listening to me even now his voice had fallen to a whisper a dry throaty rustling eh gorvis jaw dropped oh yes nestor uttered a strange sad sigh and cant you see hes trembling too the guile took a pace back from the necromancer who might just be a madman trembling but i see nothing the other went down on his knees and seeing he said is not the art ah but to feel him trembling and to know it for a fact that is the true art and smiling again he reached out his hands to the shuddering corpse of jason lidesci v conversation with a corpse nestor and wratha the assignation gorvi the guile was suddenly aware of a change in the psychic aether the atmosphere the very aura of the place starside in the vicinity of the gate was a strange region what with the blindly vacant glare of the dazzling white hemisphere portal like an immense eye in its crater socket lighting up the sterile soil blackened boulders and fused slag all about and the riddled condition of the blasted earth and rock around the crater itself as if a nest of giant worms had burrowed there and that weird plume of softly pulsating luminescence reaching out from the gate to point north like some dumbly accusing foxfire finger all of these things plus the reason for his being here had given gorvi an unaccustomed feeling of foreboding but he suspected that this new sensation this tingle of awareness on the periphery of his vampire senses was something other greater than any chance combination of location and circumstance more sensitive to sinister influences than canker canison the guile sensed the flow of something between nestor and the lich and as the necromancers hands came down on the corpses crushed brow and shrunken chest so that unknown something increased tenfold in that same instant gorvi came to believe in nestors talent he was satisfied that the youth could actually converse with one who was no more and perhaps hoping to eavesdrop on what passed between them the living and the dead alike he moved a little closer but nestors words were deadspeak which the living cannot hear as he said jason lidesci badly broken though you are unrecognizable and forgotten by me as all of my past with the szgany is forgotten still i know who you are and i know that upon a time i knew you as you were now i want to know you again the other said nothing but nestor felt him exerting his will and strengthening his resolve to continue to say nothing ah but that wont work i know how strong you are gorvi has told me how you hurled yourself down from guilesump before you would talk to him because you thought you could only die once wejj that was true enough then but through me you can feel the pain of death over and over again as often or as seldom as you yourself will it or as often as i will it but even though nestor let the pause stretch itself into a monstrous threat all he felt was a further strengthening of the others will and he found it amazing that for one who was dead this jason could be so strong well strong for the moment but for how much longer in fact it wasnt so much jasons strength that nestor sensed but his strong inclination to disbelieve for like certain others of the teeming dead when the necromancer first spoke to them he also doubted this vampire lords talent after all jason had neither seen felt touched nor tasted anything since the moment hed launched himself on his fatal dive from guilesumps mistslick wall he had not even been aware of the grit and pebbles which had hammered themselves into his broken skull and limbs when he struck home or the winds bluster about his ledge or the tiny bats which flitted close to inspect his desiccated body then flew off chittering into the gloom only the eternal darkness and loneliness had touched him and the only taste hed known was the bitter bile of frustration that he was dead while such as nestor gorvi and the rest of the wamphyri lived on to plague his people so why should he now believe that nestor lichloathe could touch him hurt him cause him pain what was pain anyway but the shrieking of tortured nerves or ligaments or the bubbling up of morbid fluids in a sick body and how may one even begin to feel it in nerves and muscles and veins which have cast off life and stiffened to knots of leathery gristle or in fluids leeched off by the sucking winds turned to vapour and blown away but on the other hand jason had died a vampire but knowing how he had died and why the dead had come to accept him while his other senses were sadly defunct at least he could hear the great majority when they talked to him but only them until now and from them hed heard a good many things oh he knew that the teeming dead believed in nestors powers for hed heard them time and again whispering in their graves terrified that sooner or later the monster would come for them why there were even those among them who swore that theyd already suffered at his hands but jason found it hard to credit except what of nestors deadspeak which jason heard as plain as the voices of the great majority it was one thing for the dead to use that metaphysical medium but a jiving creature and that was the reason why he feared nestor and hated the sound of his deadspeak voice for the vampire lord was not dead but very much alive he had a leech he was wamphyri yet he too was gifted with deadspeak and if he had that what else did he have it was this which made jason tremble all of these thoughts were his which he fought hard to keep to himself but finally nestor smiled his terrible smile for concentrating on jasons corpse directing all of his necromancers powers at the lich at last hed broken in on his victims thoughts and heard or sensed that last fearful query and knowing that the dead man would hear him he repeated his question out loud what else do i have is that what you want to know well perhaps its time i showed you without further pause he took his hand from jasons forehead caught a papery eyelid between finger and thumb and tore it free as easily as tearing the fragile wing of a moth it was nothing oh a dreadful act certainly to defile a corpse but nothing that required any real effort to have done it to a living man would have been something else that would involve a measure of resistance and a guaranteed response but not from a dead man surely for the dead dont feel pain do they well and now nestors victim knew the folly in that line of reasoning for nestor was a necromancer and jason did feel it felt the blood spurt the red ruin of his face the impossible agony of that previously insensitive but now highly sensitized part torn away like a piece of bread from a loaf felt it and screamed screamed screamed and ah nestor sighed so you have a voice after all i was beginning to think you were dumb but no youre merely stupid gradually jasons sobbing shrieks subsided became gasps of shock horror and finally petered out now it was as if he were a man holding his breath and hiding in the dark but one who knew that his adversary could see in the dark and knew his every move yet still he was reticent and nestor felt not only pain but defiance in him must i hurt you again no the others gasp of terror was as real as from a living throat you are right i am that jason you knew in settlement i was taken on the night of the first raid and it seems that you were too but you submitted obviously and i didnt well as a child you always played at being wamphyri its possible that some might even believe youre the fortunate one as for me i dont think so even dead and miserable still i prefer it to the living death which is vampirism for me there is no hell except the one which you vampires have created to inhabit well said nestor nodded you have a way with words for all that a great many of them are wasted and others illadvised as for hell theres a hell for every man be sure didnt i just show you a small corner of yours but let it be i think i would prefer it if you simply answered my questions rather than spouting your defiance and loathing do you agree if not there are other parts you can lose he tugged tentatively at the tattered web of what had been jasons left ear again the others gasp and no no only ask your questions and if i know the answers i will tell you all of the answers as much as i know but still there was an edge of sullen defiance in jasons deadspeak voice nestor shrugged he would see what he would see and so you knew me in settlement very well tell me my history the other was puzzled what i should tell you what you already know no only what i have forgotten for you see i have no memory prior to this well some few fragments of memory of being wounded a neardrowning a life in a cabin in the forest finally of becoming wamphyri but of my childhood and my youth nothing you are now my memory or will be but first tell me this when i spoke to you you knew who i was without that i first told you how because there was only one creature you could possibly be jason answered for you are one of a kind you are of the living a sort of life anyway yet speak the language of the dead and they fear you for both your voice and for your touch learned your name from them the teeming dead only to discover that i had known it long before that for you are the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri once nestor kiklu of the szgany lidesci and we grew up together in settlement better if we had died together too it was more or less as nestor had expected except we grew up together he frowned i have no recollection of that but in fact in the back of his mind a far faint scene was already glowing a little brighter a picture of forest paths and glades and children three of them laughing at their play two boys and a girl they were perhaps ten or eleven years old but the scene was viewed through the eyes of a fourth child which nestor supposed could only be himself out of focus the picture jogged nestors memory a little but not enough also because of the current damage to the corpse of jason lidesci nestor had not managed to identify him as a member of the small group and so let me see you as you were he demanded of the trembling lich and at once despite that jason did his best to stop it a reflex picture of himself as a child was mirrored in the eye of his mind which nestor saw of course and now he knew that indeed jason had been one of the children in the forest scene but the other two did you see those children in my mind yes what were their names what and have you also forgotten them but they were your closest nestor sighed a false sigh and grasped the others lolling bottom jaw he twisted it just a little until brittle flesh at the righthand corner of the corpses mouth began to tear like paper which was more than enough for jason lidesci for to him it seemed that something was ripping his face apart ah no my ace he relapsed into racking sobs the other two misha jason screamed aloud the girl was misha zanesti and sobbing brokenly gasping his deadspeak agony he hurriedly went on as for the boy he was he was nathan but do what you will to me nestor i cant believe youve forgotten him misha her name was misha nestors voice was suddenly changed previously a whisper now it was harsh choked and with his eyes bulging as his lips quivered back from fanglike teeth he snatched away his hands from the dead man just how often had the necromancer woken up from angry fretful fading dreams with this very name on his lips without knowing the meaning of it often enough aye but now he believed he did know and slow as flabby bubbles in a swamp gurgling up from his damaged memory another picture formed a wooded river bank and the children as before except they seemed a little older now and this time there were just the two of them nathan and misha and nestor a silent stunned observer now just as he had been then the children at a bend in the river where the rippling shallows had formed a beach of yellow sand and white shingle nathan sitting on a rock with the woods as a backdrop misha swimming laughing taunting the boy on the bank she stood there naked and posturing beckoning daring him to join her in the river sunlight shimmered on her brown pixie body highlighting her barely formed breasts glinting on jewel droplets of river water in the thin black cobweb of her pubic triangle not quite a child misha but not yet a woman she was all innocence where she showed herself to this nathan and nestor felt about her now as he had felt then that he wanted her yet at the same time despised her for her naivety that shed never recognized his feelings in those early days he would not have known what to do with her anyway but still hed wanted her even though her heart belonged to someone else he knew it from a tearing inside as if someone had squeezed his guts that misha had belonged to nathan and he wondered is this really the one the child girl woman who later betrayed me was it misha who spurned his love in that time when hed been capable of true love but pointless to merely wonder for he knew and he also knew with whom she had betrayed him for nathan was ankle deep in water now throwing off his clothes laughing as he roughandtumbled her in the shallows their bodies touching not yet intimately more like siblings but nestor knew that the intimacy would come later even years later by which time it would be too late for him and so it was this nathan who was his olden enemy but an adversary of longstanding who it now appeared had even been nestors rival in a mainly unremembered childhood his face nestor rasped as the scene in his mind faded to a misty shimmer then vanished entirely you jason show me what he looked like the last time you saw him that was the night of the raid the other brokenly replied knowing that he was beaten and how useless and painful it would be to speak anything other than the truth all three of us had been to starside with my father on his annual trek and we were just home it was the last time i saw nathan and the last time i saw you indeed it was the jast time i saw anyone from settlement or anyone else entirely human ever again nestors patience was running thin he had asked for one clearly denned thing and had been fobbed off with something else entirely obviously this jason was exactly as gorvi had reported him surly difficult defiant even now whats more it could be his screams had been louder than warranted by the amount of pain inflicted in any case nestor had had enough it seems to me youre deliberately slowing this down he snarled reaching out again and grasping the corpses dangling almost weightless arm wherefore ill say this only one more time show me his face yes yes jason was terrified and real terror now leaving no further doubt in nestors black heart but that at last he would get the truth but just to be absolutely certain he tugged on the arm until it almost came loose at the elbow which was the absolute end of jasons reticence if there had actually been any in the first place there are screams and there are screams jason lidescis silent deadspeak screams that hideous night reached out in all directions they echoed across the barren boulder plains reverberated in the passes flowed up and over the mountains into sunside the dead in all their many places heard him and knew what was his torment and could not offer a word of comfort in case nestor heard them and came to investigate filled with the most awful impossible agony as he felt his flesh tear and his bones come loose at the joint jasons screams were such as to wake the dead except they dared not wake for a necromancer was among them his face nestor demanded yet again and twisted the arm one last time without giving his victim a chance to recover and when at last jasons shrieking and sobbing subsided finally nestors order was obeyed a face nathans face nestors olden enemys face his great enemys face came floating up from the pulsing red and black pit of pain which was jasons mind and firmed into being where the necromancer could see it and he knew it blond hair blue eyes and pale as can be handsome in a sad shy sort of way szgany and yet not szgany and suddenly nestor remembered how sometimes hed been ashamed to call nathan his to call him his his his his mind went blank numb rigid as the rock of the mountains themselves but jasons mind apart from his unspeakable agony or perhaps because of it was suddenly crystal clear for looking in on nestors deadspeak thoughts he knew what the necromancer had searched for and also the mindwarping shock of what hed discovered and oh yes he sobbed in nestors mind you are correct and while you championed him as a boy later there were times when you wouldnt even accept him now you know why i couldnt believe you had forgotten him for indeed that face i showed you was the face of nathan kijdu a far better man than you nestor for all that he was your twin brother nestor jerked to his feet recoiled from the truth of it like a startled deer he who had been the torturer was now in turn tormented his great enemy was his brother not identical no but nathan and nestor kiklu the same flesh from the same womb they had been szgany together nestor misha nathan and jason as children theyd played laughed and cried together and indeed in those childhood days nestor had played at being a vampire lord but that was before he became lord nestor of the wamphyri and so for the very briefest of moments nestor was reunited with his past until his vampire saw the danger in it and worked to erase the error the metamorphic synapses which had welded in that moment of memory came apart again and nestor came apart too from what human impulses had started to galvanize him his thoughts were deadspeak and jason lidesci had known them for a moment i saw you again nestor he said the real you ah but youre wamphyri now and the real you no longer exists or if it does then its only to serve the beast in you nestor pointed a trembling hand at the corpse and said to gorvi take that away do what you will with it destroy it what gorvi was astonished silent until now hed been patient and seen this pantomime out to its end nestor speaking to a corpse and emptiness for answers oh thered been an atmosphere of sorts something in the air but nothing of any real substance and now this the socalled necromancer trembling like a girl apparently afraid of a dead man but youve learned nothing ive learned enough nestor turned on him perhaps too much old hatreds are awakened a mischief i had thought was forgotten returns to plague me memories come and go which i am better off without i think but what of the szgany lidesci gorvi was outraged we had a deal his face was suddenly twisted with suspicion or perhaps youve reneged learned what it suits you to know and keep to yourself and youre now backing down fool nestor spat at him the szgany lidesci settlement but when i go raiding on sunside its a habit of mine to land on the crags over the foothills and look down on that battered fortress of a town and when i do i know the place i remember it however briefly but attack it attack them the szgany lidesci no never or at least not yet not until he returns he gorvi was mystified an old adversary my great enemy he stole something which was mine nestor hesitated a moment frowned stroked his aching brow then continued i think i think he stole a woman from me szgany a girl of settlement and ran away if she lives there still with the lidescis im sure that one day shell lure him back as the moon lures canker canison but only let her die in some illconceived raid where our losses may be greater than those of the szgany and then hell have no reason to return and i could lose him forever aye and my red revenge gone with him a woman gorvi was tired of this now it wasnt going his way at all and that was too bad are you letting some szgany slut eat at you is that what this is all about some ancient rivalry but the past is the past nestor we live for today and for tomorrow and for as long as we live the past is dead and gone but the undead go on forever or as long as blood allows enough nestor growled i have a course to run the doglord has told me that its a devious thing to read the future for while events are set the manner of their occurring is not well i fancy that for me theres a certain danger in reading the past if i was meant to know it i wouldnt have forgotten it in the first place when the time is right then ill know how it was this lich this jason lidesci is a link with things which could change me and i prefer to remain as i am for now at least so do what you will but im finished here ill call my men zahar and grig who are waiting to go hunting on sunside we had a deal gorvi stormed again and now its broken nestor snarled challenge me if you will to a duel on sunside dont tempt me pup gorvi shrank back but nestor read the treachery in his heart and also his secret mind the guile had taken no chances there were men of his here even now they came from behind the glaring hemisphere of the gate a pair of bulky leatherclad lieutenants against gorvi alone nestor had a chance but against the three of them he glanced towards his flyer but gorvis lads were already putting themselves in the way they wore gauntlets and one of them tossed a third gauntlet to his evilly grinning master nestor said so and this was how it would be i was to rob this lich of his secrets so that you could murder me and take them for your own you were against me from the first gorvi took a sly flowing pace forward and his voice was oily dangerous as he said what and did you think they named me the guile for nothing before they could close in on him nestor turned and ran but only for a moment for suddenly there came the dull heavy throbbing of propulsors as a blackpulsing shadow flowed over the boulder plains an aerial warrior one of nestors creatures performed a slow low circle while in the sky directly overhead a pair of flyers formed their wings into airtraps and settled towards a landing in their saddles gazing down grig and zahar lichloathe looked fair set to fight now nestor turned to face gorvi calling out to him in a low voice i know exactly why they call you the guile because you are sly devious and secretive thats why i too came prepared and do you still want to fight now that the odds are on my side then go right ahead but think on this if you lose your life it wont be the end for well meet again in suckscar and you wont be so secretive then guarantee it gorvi called off his men and waved them back to their flyers where they were hidden away to the rear of the helllands gate and as he climbed into his own saddle we are no longer friends lichloathe he called out nestor snorted and answered we never were what should i have you for a friend when many a trustworthy scorpion goes wanting back to your dungeons gorvi and scheme some better schemes and to his lieutenants stay aloft we head for sunside in the forest just a mile south of twin fords theres a szgany hiding place ive sensed it beore sometimes they use it others they dont welj and if theyre in tonight well have them as for his warrior you creature go home back to your pen on my return thereu be a tidbit or two and as the loathsome construct turned and fired its propulsors for wrathstack so the necromancer mounted up and in a little while was airborne with his lieutenants then wheeling their beasts in a starspattered sky all three set course for the great pass and the sweet red fruits of sunside except the night was anything but fruitful those vibrations which nestor had sensed during previous hunting trips turned out to be the lure for an as yet untried szgany ambush routine and he and his lieutenants almost became its first victims landing at a suitable site in the forest and heading for the source of the vibrations the fading smell of cooking the scent of szgany flesh and blood the bodyheat of humanity and their dreams and the night whispers of those who were awake and stood guard the first nestor was aware of the trap was when grig took a bolt in his shoulder too close to his heart which knocked him off his feet and robbed him of most of his strength and zahar yelled a warning that would awaken the entire forest following which the szgany were everywhere obviously this was one traveller group which had learned from the example of lardis lidesci and his people nestor and zahar were fortunate indeed kneblaschsoaked silvertipped crossbow bolts came within an inch a great tree sawn through at its base and held in place with guyropes came crashing down its loppedoff branches sharpened to stakes that hammered into the forest loam nets weighted with silver hissed down out of the treetops and a fine mist of reeking kneblasch oil fell like a poisonous rain from on high then an ambusher fired the underbrush catching at the greasy shrubbery flames leapt rapidly from branch to branch a ring of fire was formed which trapped the three turned night into day and robbed them of their nightvision advantage dragging grig behind them and slicing through a tangle of nets with their gauntlets nestor and zahar fled and grig was lucky too because another lord might well have left him to his fate but nestor had only the two lieutenants and could scarcely afford to lose one of them it was as simple as that and nothing of loyalty in it a vampire especially a lord of the wamphyri worries about his own life first indeed thats aji he worries about all three were scorched sickened by the kneblasch humiliated by the outcome to have been routed by a handful of men for nestor it was maddening infuriating and worse to come when they got back to their flyers grigs mount was finished flopping like a crippled moth on its underbelly where more than half of its thrusting limbs had been sliced through with machetes the creature made sounds like a mewling infant blinded by burning far with its manta wings still smouldering where the same substance had made great black holes in them it lolled there cried its bewilderment nodded its scorched and blackened head nestors flyer had also suffered stabbed several times in the neck before it had rolled on its attacker to crush him it leaked its fluids and was barely airworthy if he could fly it back to suckscar in one piece the beast would heal in time but it was a big if only zahars creature was one hundred percent fit for it had learned from the trials of the others and had rolled on its two attackers before they could do any real damage their crushed bodies were a mess beneath the creature where gore and guts had erupted from gaping mouths and other orifices less than an hour ago nestor and his men had landed on a gently sloping wooded hillside which would normally make a good easy launching site now angry confused and in haste they made a lessthangraceful exit zahar had taken grig up behind him on his good flyer while nestor rode alone on his weakened beast but their sliding slithering bonejolting launch was much less than satisfactory and they left a wide swath of flattened bushes in their wake all of which served to fuel nestors fury no sooner were they safely aloft than he ordered zahar home and followed on awhile before landing on a southfacing plateau in the barrier mountains there he rubbed spittle into his flyers wounds to hasten the healing then let the beast rest and settle down while he stood on the rim gazed down on sunside and considered the events of the last few hours and as his anger cooled he recognized the truth of it that they had been disastrous events all of them first the loss of a useful flyer not easy to replace second his man grig was badly wounded and wouldnt be good for anything for several sundowns and third gorvi the guile was now his sworn enemy and without doubt would try to make trouble for him but as for the rest a great deal lost for no gain whatsoever nestors frustration was vast and not only as a result of tonights shambles for in the back of his mind but ready to surface at a moments notice there was his frustration in respect of the lady wratha she was here she had heard his thoughts she was smiling at him in his mind her superior mentalism he had let himself be seen for what he was a lovesick child except he could see now how easy it would have been for her to put it there to insert such a vision into his inexperienced mind but if she had wanted him to think of her that way then perhaps she had wanted him inexperienced aye she said stepping out from behind a teetering boulder that you are while i have all the experience of a hundred years so dont feel too badly about it my handsome lord nestor for i tell you this if i had tormented the others in the same way why they would have fallen into my arms in a day and a night why are you here he felt stupid and naive even asking it she was here to taunt him of course because she knew now that she had him or was she here to claim her prize neither one she shook her head the prize is yours nestor to claim at sunup in wrathspire when i go to my bed or in suckscar if thats how you will have it nor do i wish to have you but that we shall have each other perhaps you would have come to me before or me to you except you brought a mistress out of sunside and are you satisfied has she been enough ah i doubt it for a little while maybe but you are wamphyri now nestor and yet you are a strange one too for there are things in your past which cling even now and you still remember the true art the true art he even felt like a child in front of her of love for the wamphyri feel only lust including yourself you can only have what i have to give she moved closer and like a fool he stepped back a pace and said but you offered it before and then refused think back she said i made no offer since when is a kiss a licence to rape you would have taken me by force which no man ever did for all that i wanted you that was something i couldnt allow he frowned but if you dont know this true art as you call it if you cant experience szgany love as they know it now and as i seem to remember it what difference will our being together make you have asked am i nestor satisfied but i ask can i be satisfied is it any longer possible for as youve pointed out i am wamphyri why dont we find out and she took another flowing pace towards him but this time he stood still she was clad in leather splashed with blood but wore no gauntlet suddenly he thought again about her being here and wondered is she ajone while out loud again he asked her just why did you come here i am alone yes she answered we had a good raid for once and recruited seven thralls and as many again will trek for starside before the sun is risen but flying back to wrathspire i saw you here and sensed your thoughts easy because i am used to them and because i felt your pain anger and frustration i knew it was time so i ordered my people on and came to you for while ive waited i have also watched you nestor in some ways you found the metamorphosis from man to wamphyri easy while in others it was difficult but if you think your trials have been hard then what of mine i have known frustration too and my manse has suffered as a result all needs putting to rights and i must see to it i have heard the odd whisper circulating about the quality of my water and other conditions in my manse which have caused certain lords to chuckle behind my back and i too shall whisper and chuckle when i call for him whose duty it was to see to my siphoneers and as for those who keep watch over my warbeasts waxing in their vats they have waxed enough time that they waned a little moreover there have been affairs in wrathspire which i never sanctioned oh a good many of my manses affairs require resolution but not before my own needs are served for such as they are they allow me no peace of mind her eyes gazed into his a moment searchingly before she repeated my needs aye and yours he closed with her reached for her and she placed a hand upon his chest holding him back but seeing the angry thought which instantly flashed across his mind ah no my handsome young lord she smiled ive learned my lesson and will not torment you again for the last time cost me too much time but dont be impatient and try to remember i am the lady wratha this is neither the time nor the place for love or for lust when then and where his throat was so tight it very nearly choked him so that his words came out a husky gasp we are neighbours she answered her own voice falling to a whisper a promise only climb to wrathspire in the hour before sunup neither man nor creature shall bar the way i want you he said and yet again felt foolish then come to me she told him and as she walked away pausing only once to look back and smile nestor found himself trembling like a young boy following which from time to time until the next sunup he would tremble a great deal and feel that accustomed tingle in his palm but he would also know that wratha had not put it there she had no need to not any longer when canker canison returned out of sunside nestor went down into mangemanse to ask him about wratha previously hed heard a good many things about her but now wanted it in more detail or from a source which was trustworthy the doglord told him her story what he knew of it but paused before finishing and said ah you would go to her a liaison i have seen through your inquiry what but you are fortunate you have so much to learn and wratha has so very much to teach you now tell me when will you see her between you and me of course the other barked do you think id betray you i am excited thats all and in spirit ill be with you ah but if only i could be with you in bed that wratha nestor rubbed his chin to keep from grinning for the delight which canker showed for him was both genuine and infectious in the hour before sunup he said then i climb to wrathspire cankers long bottom jaw fell open and his mood changed in a moment the hour before sunup nestor nodded something amiss no no the other shook his head looked worried then changed his mind and nodded yes yes something could be very much amiss its all in the nature of wrathas ascension well say on she murdered karl the crag again a pause must i drag it out of you now listen to me canker growled low in his throat in wrathspire at sunup the sun shines through several windows or it would if they werent kept heavily draped so it is the pattern i dont like for it was the same upon a time in cragspire in turgosheim where karl the crag was master and he would be to this day if not for wratha how did she murder him nestor tried to be patient its hearsay of course will you tell me or wont you the necromancers patience was all used up she got him drunk canker barked she exhausted him with her sex bound him to a bed and opened the curtains she let the sun shine directly in upon him she decked the walls with bronze shields burnished to mirror brightness all concentrating the sunlight on karl in his stupor while she stood safe in the shadows it didnt take too long karl fried and his leech deserted him but in the brilliant light it too was finished and as karls parasite blackened and smoked so wratha closed the curtains the leech issued its egg one last chance for continuity a final throw at reproduction and wratha made it welcome she had been a vampire thrall karls mistress and now was mistress of cragspire soon to be wrathspire so she ascended a pattern you said nestor was thoughtful but if she planned any such fate for me what would she gain from it that time in turgosheim it was her ascension but here she is risen also forewarned is forearmed shell not get me drunk so very easily believe it and ill make sure to stay well away from any southfacing windows canker was astonished still youll go despite what ive told you nestor looked at him looked away shrugged and finally ive been wamphyri for something less than two years now he said but before that i was szgany and of the lidesci clan at that they are a hotblooded people as you know and my parasite has turned up the heat tenfold will i go you ask now tell me my friend would you nostrils gaping suspiciously canker sniffed the air his great furry wolfs ears with their dangling lobes fretted into a sicklemoon sigil twitched this way and that as if intent on distant sounds or thoughts finally he fell to all fours threw back his head and howled and his ribbed throat throbbed as its eerie ululations echoed through all of mangemanse but as they died away a trickle of saliva dribbled from the corner of the doglords panting soft leathery mouth and looking up at nestor he whined and said lord lichloathe my lad but how could i possibly resist it vi nestor and wratha their joining when nestor got back up into suckscar he found zahar waiting for him with a surprise wratha had sent him down a present of three szgany males from the nights raid there was a youth a grown man and a greypate for all his pride nestor was hardly the one to refuse them not now that the get out of sunside had grown so small he did note however that they were all males which wratha must surely prefer to keep but on the other hand and in the current circumstances he could see why she wouldnt want to send him women fresh out of sunside as for sending him any token of her esteem at all especially one of precious flesh and blood that was completely unheard of and zahar was at a loss to understand it is the lady in your debt lord he finally found courage to inquire and indeed in respect of wrathas spying on nestor her interference with his dreams and what all perhaps she could be said to be in his debt at that whether or no he looked zahar square in the eye and answered she could be eventually and on afterthought lets just say that she and i have business together but the truth of it was that he fancied he might end up in her debt if he had gauged the situation correctly canker had told him how much she could teach him again nestor must put his pride aside and allow himself to be taught if he could match her even part of the way there might yet be revelations on both sides his vampire women in suckscar had already shown him more than most men learn in a lifetime but then of course there was the doglords warning too which if he was right might well prove lethally dangerous and in that case this gift was simply a clever garnish hiding the poison on the meat underneath but being offered food and actually eating it are two different things entirely nestor must simply wait and see how hungry he would get and meanwhile using his virulent bite taking sustenance from his new thralls and at the same time imparting to them nestor indoctrinated both of the younger men into his household they were his now he sent the youngest to attend grig he was to care for the wounded lieutenant and when he was fully recovered become his apprentice there would be plenty of work for the more mature man tunnels to be dug quarters enlarged and pens to be cleaned he would go onto suckscars work roster as for the greypate nestor didnt even give him a second thought he was for suckscars provisioning meat for the communal dining tables of the common thralls and crushed bone for flyer and warriormeal both were hard to come by and getting harder sooner or later there must be a reckoning a reassessment there had to be easier ways to collect the fruits of sunside than by raiding perhaps he would speak to wratha about it later for if she could afford to send him thralls out of her own get it must be that she was doing better than him so it was possible hed have business with her after all the administration of suckscar claimed nestors atten tion well into starsides long night before he knew it there were only a few hours left to sunup instructing zahar to wake him when the peaks of the barrier mountains turned from ashgrey to a leaden glimmer he went to his bed but three hours before the dawn when zahar was still about his duties he came awake of his own accord for once he had not dreamed but he had tossed and turned and sweated a cold vampire sweat it was his leech his parasite knew his emotions and sensed the danger in them it caused him to see all sorts of perils in the course which hed set for himself but as the time drew closer nestor saw only one thing and he drove all niggling doubts from his mind for what he had said to canker was undeniably true wratha was risen she occupied the grandest manse in the entire stack she had little or nothing to gain from seducing him only to murder him wherefore it must be that she fancied him as simple as that and for his own part nestor could scarcely imagine anything more delicious than to go with her to her bed whether or not the excitement would last remained to be seen but as in each and every love affair the excitement itself was enough for now rising up he bathed thoroughly and breakfasted it was hardly the hour for it but he felt he should fuel himself on a little something at least sunside honey coarse bread fresh milk from his udderlings and just a morsel of meat sweet rabbit from suckscars farm he still had no real appreciation of manflesh except in the liquid which is the life blood then he threw off his robe and got dressed in his finest softest leathers following which there was little more than an hour left to wait prowling his rooms to and fro he knew what an ardent young lover he must seem to anyone who saw him like this but no one did see him except glina she had come up through her spiral staircase and stood in a curtained archway watching him and nestor had been so lost in his own thoughts that he had not noticed her but now yes what is it and he was surprised to recognize an edge in his voice as if he were hiding something as if he lord nestor lichloathe should require to hide anything from a common vampire thrall such as glina i i thought i heard you call me she answered and he knew it was a lie you came to spy on me his voice was quiet which signalled danger on you nestor shed been familiar with him right from the start when they were together in his bed he even demanded it why would i spy all there is to know about you i already know except why you went to your bed so early and why youre up already and dressed perhaps you have an appointment do you question me he frowned do you dare his voice was still low but harsher now who have you been speaking to zahar i have not seen zahar for a day and a half is something wrong her voice was full of a genuine concern nestors frown lifted but slowly finally he sighed and shook his head nothing is wrong go now you do not want me not now later possibly she looked a little sad hung her head and nodded so be it and drawing the curtains behind her she descended her spiral stairwell but strangely nestor felt a lump enter his throat causing him to call out how fares the little one the footsteps paused and her answer came back he is as well as can be would you see him should i bring him to you not now he said again perhaps later but in truth he had no interest in the child and occasionally wondered what is this human baby doing in suckscar anyway it were better if hed taken canker canisons advice that time killed her out of hand and let the doglord breakfast on the infant except glina had had her uses then and perhaps she would again she was as good and better in his bed than any of the others anyway by the time he had thought these thoughts she was gone but when he went up by a narrow cobwebbed disused route into wrathspire she was watching him from a shadowy niche and she knew there was only one place he could be going and so glina continued to know all there was to know about nestor lichloathe wratha had promised the way would be easy but nestor couldnt believe how easy neither common thrall lieutenant nor warrior guarded the route from suckscar to wrathspire from the pens in the rear of wrathas landing bays he heard the subdued mewling of flyers in the level above he was aware of a distant clamour and the frantic clanking of chains as if some creature knew of an intruder and hurled itself about in a pointless frenzy in the next level a shadow was glimpsed just the once which silently discreetly retreated and vanished it was that easy true nestor had kept well away from the main passageways and staircases so that his route had been circuitous also a fact that as dawn approached wrathspires vampire inhabitants would be taking to their beds all except for a skeleton staff and watch but apart from the aforementioned and entirely acceptable exceptions the mewling flyers the distant protests of some fearsome guardian and the fleeting presence of a very discreet shadow hed neither seen nor heard anything to inspire fear or flight then as he approached the penultimate level he was met by a beautiful vampire girl who bowed and told him she was wrathas handmaiden here to escort him to her mistress her dress was thin and deepcut between her pointed breasts which showed in all their ripeness when she bowed she was very shapely as comely and desirable perhaps even more desirable as any of his own women nestor thought and as he followed her she glanced back at him coyly and said my lady trusts you met with no obstacle on your way up none he shook his head i came by an indirect route i am discreet i know my lady would appreciate that she answered but had you chosen even the most direct route it would make little or no difference wratha makes you welcome here as for discretion my lady gives orders which are obeyed when she instructs her thralls in this or that hour you will all be in your beds nothing will stir i am not to be disturbed then the only indiscretion would be to disobey her i see nestor answered he followed her up a narrow staircase a steeply rising tunnel hewn through solid rock the light was dim but it made no difference their vampire eyes saw clear as day and since she led the way and her dress was short he saw her nakedness beneath at the top of the stairs was a landing and a niche where chains hung empty from the rear wall normally a guardian warrior would be stationed here they entered a narrow tunnel and where the way was narrowest she flattened herself to the wall you may pass she told him smiling in her eerie fashion at the end of the passage youll enter a junction with several tunnels leading off one of which is marked with my ladys sigil he made to pass her fronttofront and her hand at once fell to his member to stroke and clutch it fixed there astonished he watched as she used her free hand to part her dress so that her breasts lolled free then what and is this your idea of discretion he husked brushing by her at last what would your mistress say to this i wonder but for all that his words were a threat still he was tempted his blood was up and his member jumped and jerked in her hand even through his leathers his eyes were drawn to her breasts too which looked delicious so that it was hard not to reach for them but before he could move to do so the girl released him laughed and repeated my only indiscretion would have been to disobey her for if you had come to her with anything less than passion it would not be enough many men would be unmanned by the prospect of entering anothers manse unarmed and entirely vulnerable after all the way is dark and dire and you could have met with monsters your ardour might have suffered as a result in which case i would ask you to turn back here and now go away and wait for a better time ah but it is obvious that the lord nestor is no such faintheart indeed you are what ready and so is my lady wratha following which she put her breasts away turned her back on him and ran back the way theyd come leaving nestor to wonder what was all of that about more garnish for the poisoned meat in any case too late now but to carry on and taste it as nestor entered wrathas private chambers it was at once apparent that these were a ladys quarters he knew they were of course but even if hed been ignorant of that fact there were mirrors here for a start plates of gold hammered flat and polished to a high sheen which gave warmth and life to his reflected features even though they were cold and lacked the spark that sets common humanity apart he would have known from the mirrors alone that this was a ladys manse for only an extremely vain lord would adorn his walls with such as these and even then given the greatest possible vanity it could never compensate for the awareness of lack of soul which was the true message that wrathas mirrors imparted no mirrors were an abomination which since time immemorial had been used by the szgany of sunside to reflect lethal sunlight into the faces of their starside enemies but apparently wratha had risen above such things she was pleased to see herself as she really was however she was well and now nestor too could look upon his own face again examining it in full for the first time since leaving since he became wamphyri and what he saw was a tall and handsome lord albeit a lord who wondered at his own temerity that hed come here of his own free will where wiser men than he might fear to tread but as he looked at himself it seemed he saw something else and for all that he knew he was host to a vampire leech still he did not like the corrugations which made his skin reptilian and the cobras hood which suddenly shielded his brow and eyes these things were illusion he knew and engendered of his own mind but still he preferred the looks of the man to that of the thing which governed him turning abruptly from the mirror he took in at a glance this anteroom which hed entered through a narrow archway hung with batfur drapes it would appear to be wrathas dressingroom where she tended her looks in private there was a stone washbasin carved ironwood shelves for powders perfumes and oils and several niches cut back into the walls where various garments were kept on bone hangers the lady wratha did not go wanting for clothes her undergarments were of best quality szgany lace outer clothing was generally of soft leathers and skins dresses were batfur or the soft white hide of young albino bears wrathas boots were of good shadleather handtooled by szgany craftsmen the soles of her slippers were of flexible white cartilage fitted with leather thongs a number of curved intricately carved scarps of bone had been fashioned to be ornamental rather than functional there were earrings bangles and anklets pendants and brooches mostly in common gold nestor saw all of these things and the thought occurred but with so many items here what can she be wearing now nothing came back the answer and her low unmistakable laughter tinkling in his mind why dont you come through do you find my clothes so fascinating then if so then what of my nakedness apart from the tunnel or passageway by which hed entered there was only one exit and holding his breath nestor passed through more ropes of batfur into wrathas bedchamber and there he found her clad as foretold in nothing but foam and water she was in her bath but as you see theres plenty of room for two wratha smiled and nestor had never seen anything more seductive his fate was now entirely in her hands right now without delay she could call her lieutenants or guardian warriors and that would be the end of the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri he knew it and she knew it but they both knew that this was not her purpose and could never be so long as the one big question remained unanswered for there was something else they must know which knowledge would be carnal the culmination of that consuming attraction which had been growing between them since the morning wran the rage gave nestor vasagis egg and brought him out of sunside he took a pace towards her huge bath at least six and a half feet square where it had been cut into the floor and finished at the rim with glazed szgany tiles and behind him as he paused his leather jacket fell to the coarsewoven carpet wratha was a mass of milky bubbles opaque they hid her loveliness from view another pace and his shirt was left behind she lifted up her milkwhite arms to him and nestors breathing went hoarse and ragged as the upper halves of her breasts bobbed on the water and dripped foam can you do this she said her eyes scarlet just a moment ago were dark now and gypsyish metamorphism she told him it is draining but sometimes worth it worth it here and now for i know theres still a lot of szgany in you you want innocence nestor and as you will see wratha can be innocent if needs be he took a third pace towards her and now he was as naked as the lady herself but you dont know that she taunted again reading his mind perhaps beneath the foam im wearing some gauzy shift she laughed again stared pointedly at his throbbing jerking manliness and licked her scarlet lips and her eyes were full of him then ill go through it he husked as if he were driving the words through the crusts of his dry throat you are dry she said but see theres a measure of good szgany wine here reaching out she touched a stone jug and golden goblets where they stood on the tiled rim he was at the edge and saw a step just under the surface where wrathas wavelets disturbed the water swallowing hard he answered i know what i want to drink and from which dark well and now the ladys voice was as husky and drunk with lust as nestors own as she told him i know your come will be as sweet as your fine firm body and so well drink together as he stepped down into the bath and reached for her the water and foam swirled round his rubbery knees but wratha held back breathless as she instructed him bathe me and i shall bathe you to touch is allowed but nothing more for now well make all parts clean as never before before we dirty them i want you now his voice was a growl dont spoil it nestor she shook her head in times to come well fuck in this bath a hundred times i know it but as for now my bed is waiting what and would you drink froth and bubbles along with my juices but when weve bathed youll be so much harder and i shall be so much softer they bathed each other and nestor thought it was probably the cleanest hed ever been she lingered over him and he over her and nothing to interfere with or stay their hands except the soft water and honeyed soap so that when at last she kissed his swaying burning tip but briefly stood up and wrapped herself in a towel he knew that shed been right his rod had never been so hard and she had never been so open to any man towelling themselves dry and barely able to keep from continuing their fondling they moved to her bed high and wide built of great heavy slates with the top layer hollowed in the middle to take a furstuffed mattress it was massive wooden steps led up on one side which wratha climbed to turn back a soft bearskin blanket and dropping her towel she turned and showed herself to him where he followed after that it was delirium human beings can never experience the full unfettered violence and animal sex of the wamphyri and live but wratha and nestor were no longer human they were wamphyri and so for five long hours they did all and more to each other than ever man and woman had done before except maybe for one other affair long long ago or in the depths of drugged and frenzied fever dreams or the dungeons of torturers so that at last nestor was satisfied and perhaps surprisingly to her surprise at least so was the lady wratha later they talked was i innocent enough for you wratha lay spreadeagled beneath the bearskin blanket one lovely leg protruding her jet black hair damp and gleaming releasing coils of scented vapour from her heat look at you nestor smiled a wry drained smile with that wanton sprawl of yours and those knowing eyes even when you made your eyes dark they were scarcely innocent have you ever been innocent wratha i know your story i heard it from the doglord who is my friend well she shrugged and cankers right no ive known nothing of innocence not ever i would have liked to but life as a szgany girl in turgosheims sunside one hundred years ago was not the best environment in which to learn it we were slaves to the wamphyri from birth but at least i kept myself to myself until they took me even so it wasnt so much that i was innocent but clever and ive stayed clever she propped herself on one elbow very well so i was not the sweet and shuddering untried gypsy flesh you so admire or lust after but i tried to be if i had not known he told her truthfully then you would have fooled me when you tightened on me you could have been a young girl certainly and when you cried out it was as if you were a virgin but you exude womanhood you are hot and exciting there is no disguising that so i was not everything you wanted you are the most beautiful creature in wrathstack he told her if you are not everything i could want then where can i find it no you are everything you were everything i wont be able to go to my bed again in suckscar without wishing i were here with you he touched her breasts and her nipples instantly hardened between his fingers it wasnt metamorphism simply her natural reaction to his caress and when her slender hand fell on him nestor too reacted despite that hed thought he was drained til tell you something she said looking deep into his eyes and this is the whole truth i never gave myself to any man before not even karl the crag who was my master oh he took me aye and believed that i enjoyed it indeed he knew that i loved him but in fact i loathed him following which i suffered the sleep but worse than any gone before i was buried alive nestor and no one was ever more frightened i still start awake cold and clammy in my bed as if it were the rock tomb in which i became a vampire since when ive had men be sure but i never gave myself to one not as ive given myself to you oh i tried a lord or two in turgosheim the bravest of a sorry bunch but only to discover that the sap had gone out of them maybe theyll get it back one day but not until they pursue me out of that pesthole gorge and return to the true life not until they learn how to live again and lust and drown themselves in blood thats what i wanted and its why i fled to return to the old ways and turn this western sunside into a vast and sprawling charnelhouse and make my men and warriors strong i would have had it too if this gang of grumbling renegades who inhabit my stack hadnt turned on me you stole their thralls nestor pointed out even from the first raid on twin fords you were a thief i took what was rightfully mine she cried drawing back from him a little i was their leader and a good one but wran and spiro they are madmen who have no reason and so wont listen to it as for gorvi his instincts are so inbred he cannot think except in evertightening spirals to plot and scheme and work to his own devious designs vasagi the suck however ugly was the only clever one among them i had hoped he would kill wran so that i could draw the others back into one body but it was not to be vasagi is no more and we are still divided as for canker canison what can i say his father went baying mad and it seems to me that the doglord follows a like pattern that damned bone thing that instrument he plays whose socalled music blares out even here to lure his silver mistress down from the moon indeed bah it was a mismatched batch i chose to bring with me out of turgosheim she paused and in a moment but there it seems ive strayed a little from my theme which was innocence and was i innocent he asked her you want me to say no she told him but in fact you were not naive but innocent aye because you have not had a woman before me a szgany girl or girls maybe and a handful of vampire thralls but never a woman and anyway there is no other woman like wratha no not like you he kept the thought to himself but one i wanted who was what stolen from me one day iji teach her all ive learned even what ive learned from you it may kill her with pleasure or pain whatever but at least i shall know her at last and shell know what shes missed that she could have been my lady in suckscar and a fleeting picture of a girl standing in a rivers shallows sunsplashed and dripping water crossed briefly over his mind but all hidden from wratha are we unique then he asked out loud vampires and yet true lovers are we forever for each other or is this a fleeting thing it will last as long as it lasts she answered i ask only one thing that im faithful but how im wamphyri no not that she shook her head but that if we part or when then that we go our separate ways with honour neither bitterness nor treachery of any sort when its done its done and that is all agreed and until then that were lovers and allies we are lovers he answered but allies against what to what end the hunting goes badly for you too and yet you sent me three good ones well two good ones and a third for my manses provisioning it was my token my promise i gave to you so that you would know you could give to me safely without fear and you have and i appreciate it i didnt know how much i needed a strong man by my side and in my bed but indeed the get out of sunside grows smaller if we can work together as lovers then surely we can work together against the szgany i had intended speaking to you on that very theme he answered in her conchlike ear for wratha had crept back into his arms something must be done for the stack suffers we all suffer alike but the others are incapable of helping themselves she nodded because theyre stupid and selfish and cant see past their own noses theyre like szgany fishermen who quarrel over a stretch of river one man cant handle the nets alone and so all lose out but the two of us working together as a team we can grow strong for there are plenty of fish in sunside nestor its just that as individuals were inefficient and so i say it again we can do it together you and i the three of us nestor held her closer let his hand reach down the curve of her back to the valley of her buttocks three canker is strong and cleverer than you think forget his music and his moon madness that is only one thing and anyway hes not so mad ive learned a lot from him its true he makes good monsters she took his stirring male cluster in the palm of her hand gently revolving and jiggling his parts will he be amenable he loves me like a son nestor answered lowering his head to draw a stiffened nipple into his mouth then withdrawing he frowned and said but on the other hand gorvi hates me he hates all of us she answered and sighed ah what it is to be young eh your rod is pulsing again i cant believe it he chuckled darkly oh its my body wratha but its my vampires lust and the wamphyri are inexhaustible and reaching down between her coarse dark curls he found her bud and triggered it her leg went over him at once drawing him closer but as if to deny her resurgent need she said urgently its important we talk and now therell be time enough to satisfy our other needs later and in a voice on the edge of trembling as if we hadnt already done so one mouth says one thing nestor husked and the other denies it the mouth in your face is wise and speaks prudently but the one between your thighs is greedy and mindless of all but pleasure when they speak together as now all is confusion a szgany saying probably then heres another a stiff prick has no conscience and a soft wet cunt is deep as a swamp and just as hard to escape from another moment and he would be in her again she pulled apart from him and shook her head we must talk he sighed and rolled over onto his back very well say on but work my meat a moment the throbbing is delicious you are insatiable she laughed grasping him not me my vampire was his excuse now listen she said if we three work together then wran spiro and gorvi will doubtless join forces too and that is all to the good how so because they will then put aside their differences and ready themselves for what theyll see as inevitable battle i want them to be prepared for i have seen what they have not that eventually vormulac and the others will come bursting out of turgosheim to wage war against me wrathstack the last aerie for in turgosheims sunside the blood grows thin while here its still hot and red vormulac knows thats why i came here in the first place to better myself to grow strong he doesnt know if im successful but he darent take the chance that im not and so he must come eventually unless hes even weaker than my estimate he must for hell fear that im building an army to return and attack him and so when war comes it wont be between us renegades but two great armies vormulacs and wrathas oh gorvi wran and spiro will know which side to take for theyd get short shrift from the invaders nestor was thoughtful canker has been a mine of information hes told me a lot about turgosheim there are so many lords and what if they all come together im sure they will then how can we win because this is home territory and by then well be an army in our own right far easier to defend than attack nestor and remember theyll be exhausted from their long flight but well be fresh and our familiar bats will bring us warning well in advance indeed even now and ever since i first settled here i have had my creatures stationed in the eastern ranges of the barrier mountains watching and waiting but if we in wrathstack are positively divided so that we cant even work together in peace how will we make out in war wratha shrugged were not so divided we three you me and canker have the top levels of the stack while gorvi and the brothers killglance have the bottom if wran denies me gas from his beasts i deny him water from my siphoneers insofar as the proper maintenance of the stack is concerned thats how it works we need each other this much at least have you talked to the others about this invasion youre sure will come in the early days often and they listened to me then since when theyve grown lax we all have for various reasons there were easy pickings at first until this lardis found his feet and the other tribes started to follow suit aye the living was easy and we lost something of our impetus then how will you get it back oh i know the way when you me and the doglord start working together and when the others see our get then theyll unite as stated and when they see our new monsters our aerial warriors and fighting creatures and when we make gas chambers and fashion our own beasts and when we double and redouble the numbers of our lieutenants hah theyll do the same we shall cause them to gear themselves for war we shall be their inspiration nestor nodded the entire stack will benefit and be that much stronger exactly even as you are strong she got down in the bed and trapped him between her breasts gentling his bruised jerking shaft then took him in her mouth and entered his tip with the sharp points of her split tongue wait nestor groaned inverting himself and burying his face in her core and together she whispered in his mind feeling his imminent explosion and her own as she drew him into her throat together he answered sucking on her elongated clitoris like a calf on an udder so that in a very little while they both drew milk and revelling in each others juices the thought occurred to both of them together that if the blood was the life then surely the milk was its spice they slept long and long but wratha was first to come awake then stroking him where he lay on his back listening to his heartbeat his breathing and feeling the slow rise and fall of his massive chest she wondered again love was it possible between vampires between mem bers of the wamphyri she knew it had happened to others yes but to wratha what if the feelings she felt now deep inside were merely fleeting insubstantial things well so be it ah but what if nestors feelings were the same one thing for the lady wratha to reject a lover but to be rejected he was moaning in his sleep tossing and turning a little perhaps beginning to come awake she had never stayed with him before in his mind to the point of waking previously shed entered and inserted her erotic pictures dreams of herself the two of them together as now they had been together and departed or on occasion shed spied on his own lustful dreaming to discover his preferences but now what was it that disturbed him she glanced into his mind but too late he was coming awake right now and all she got was a single word a name but a name that glowed in his mind like an iron in a fire misha a girls name and wratha wondered is this the unknown other nestors unrequited love out of sunside but no need to wonder for she knew it was he yawned and sat up wratha he looked at her reached for her but she was up and out of bed slipping into a robe wratha is something wrong he was sleepy but perhaps hed glimpsed her eyes wrong she almost ran into her dressingroom why no what could be wrong but in her mirrors the lady saw what was wrong and fitting a curved bone scarp to her brow turquoise earrings in the lobes of her conch ears and sapphire discs to her cheeks she sought to disguise the evidence of her wrath the way her eyes bulged and their crimson hellfire glare misha it took all of five minutes to lock the name out of her head and another five to cool the incredible fires racing in her vampire blood and love she wondered again but kept the thought to herself or shoujd it be hate or was the dividing line between the two too narrow but she knew the name of that dividing line well enough it was jealousy vii wrathas new raiders that the doglord canker canison was crazy in his fashion and deranged as any feral creature who falls under the influence of the full and hurtling moon was not to be denied but as nestor had pointed out to his vampire lover in her bed at other times and in other ways canker was sane as could be and might even be considered wise as now for instance for when it came to a choice of allies the lord of mangemanse had neither time nor kind words for wran and spiro killglance his closest neighbours and he was equally disdainful of gorvi the guile down in the aeries shadowy sump but sane or crazy the overriding factor in his decision was this that the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe had seen fit to join up with wratha in her scheming and if it was good enough for him it was good enough for canker such was the doglords affection for his young friend let nestor merely suggest something it was done at a meeting in wrathspire the three devised a strategy tactics of a sort against the szgany and in the next sundown taking their warriors lieutenants and even aspirant lieutenants with them they put it into practice and went raiding en masse on sunside and it was a raid to remember wratha had no knowledge of warfare and neither canker nor nestor was any better equipped and so their plan was simple one party to flush the szgany out one to form a gantlet like a net wide at the entrance and narrowing to a tight neck and a third lying in ambush to block any escape and turn the prey back into the killing zone how it worked the three and their forces crossed the barrier mountains just an hour after the true sundown their crossing point lay midway between the helllands gate on starside and settlement on sunside which is to say some forty miles west of the starside mouth of the great pass then while canker and his pack landed rested up and waited in the higher sunside foothills nestor wratha and theirs split into two groups and headed out across the sunside forest belt wratha angled west while nestor skewed east so that when they straightened out to fly parallel they were perhaps two miles apart and staying well below the clouds they knew they would be amply visible and the rumble and sputter of their warriors plainly audible to szgany on the ground any traveller groups directly beneath the two aerial parties would go to earth freeze suffer the gutwrenching stench of warrior exhaust gasses settling from the night sky and wait for the terror on high to pass but as soon as they thought it was safe to move then theyd break cover split up seek safer hiding places some would be lucky and relocate themselves outside the entrapment zone but others less fortunate would run inwards and right into it along the route south as the twin clouds of illomen which were wratha nestor and their parties pulsed like a twopronged pestilence in the sky they ordered down warriors or the occasional flyer and rider to occupy vantage points in the forest and find themselves good relaunching sites thus forming a gantlet and so the net extended itself south four or five miles out over the forest the two parties performed an aerial pincer movement and joined up in one body then except for nestor and wratha themselves and their first lieutenants the remaining flyers landed their riders without touching down and lifted off with empty saddles and while on high the lord and lady turned their mounts aboutface and flew north down the centre of the gantlet so their thralls on the ground began forging through the woods for the barrier mountains ensuring that they made as much noise as possible along the way within the gantlet panicking szgany groups were driven in the same direction by the bellowing of vampire thralls to the rear and the hissing of monsters on the flanks the night seemed filled with menace nodding flyers and belching amorphous armourplated warriors were everywhere and strutting lieutenants were wont to loom large out of the darkness meanwhile canker and his pack had come down from the foothills to set up their ambush in the bottleneck among boulders and rocky outcrops where some ancient upheaval had shattered the forests floor and while he waited so the doglord conjured a thin vampire mist from his own body and called up a ground mist out of the earth to swirl all about and give his forces cover while returning out of the south wratha and nestor performing low lazy northdrifting circles overhead used their mentalism to order men and monsters in from the flanks tightening the net the trapped szgany parties fled north began to meet up with each other and shoal like panicked fish colliding they milled left and right met up with nightmares in both directions and so continued to run ragged and panting along the one safeseeming route but after four and a half miles of forest they were on their last legs they saw flyers descending out of the night sky and were terrified the flyers had no riders but the trapped travellers couldnt know that warriors trampled hissed and roared in the undergrowth the black shadows of manta shapes flowed silently over starlit glades vampire voices shouted orders while from on high wratha sent to canker now and nestor to the small encircling force of thralls and lieutenants on the ground now then as the carnage commenced so he and wratha descended landed their beasts and joined in the freeforall but it was a shortlived affair something less than forty travellers men women and children had been caught in the vampire net seeing there was no way out a handful of them tried to fight back the men had crossbows silvertipped kneblaschsoaked bolts zipped in the dark most of them uselessly razorhoned machetes flashed in starlight but the arms which wielded them contained neither strength nor hope ironwood stakes sharpened to needle points were grasped in slippery trembling fists against powerful vampire thralls leatherclad lieutenants the wamphyri themselves against gauntlets nightseeing eyes and metamorphic flesh they were as nothing the szgany were utterly exhausted the lingering stench of warriors sickened them their aim was off cankers thralls his hounds rounded them up loping among them like one of their own wolves they scarcely saw the doglord himself until they felt his bite in arm or thigh or he reared up to snarl and spray saliva and smash his fist stunningly into the side of a victims head anyone seen to be carrying a crossbow was a dead man cankers nestors and wrathas gauntlets seemed painted scarlet women and children were herded to one side but men were knocked down and vampirized at once two minutes three and it was all over eight men one woman and two thralls had died in the fray both of the latter with bolts dead centre in their hearts one of wrathas senior lieutenants had suffered machete slashes to his chest and shoulder his leathers had protected him he was on his feet and would survive two of the doglords hounds had been stabbed with ironwood stakes but not deeply of the twentyseven szgany survivors thirteen were men or boys and three of these were greypates since the old men had little or no value except as meat wratha ordered their immediate execution their bodies along with the other dead went to fuel the warriors the rest of the males those who had not yet been recruited in the accustomed fashion were now bled wratha and the lords claimed the first of these bloody fruits naturally followed by their lieutenants and thralls most of the men thus infected fell at once into their vampire sleep those who did not were ordered into the mountains to cross into starside before sunup then it was the turn of the fourteen women and girls these had been split into three fairly balanced groups two fives and a four the lady wratha took the smallest share of the get in females and turned her senior and junior lieutenants loose on the shivering ragged quartet theres more than one way to vampirize a woman and her men had done exceedingly well this night it was wrathas idea of a small reward watching the mass rape the swift and merciless shredding of garments the naked cringing girlflesh the twining spastically jerking limbs and thrusting of tightly knotted buttocks and all the mauling gasping and sobbing nestor had to admire wrathas style her men would remember and be grateful learning from it he set his own lads loose on his get of five and stood close to wratha where each of them recognized the others excitement and looking forward to their time together they knew how good it was going to be in wrathas bed at sunup as for canker where women were concerned no mere thrall came before him he took each of his five in turn and rapidly but saved himself for the last one a girl of no more than fifteen years who he took from the rear like the dog he was and finishing with each he tossed them to his men howling dont let them go wanting lads let them know what is their lot in mangemanse in a little while it was over the worst of the raping at least then cankers lieutenants built a fire and the two sweetest youngest children were butchered for roasting it was by way of a celebration shortly the vampire thralls sat around in redflickering light and ate smoking flesh while those of them who still had the urge and the wherewithal dragged halfstunned women away into the bushes to shag them then to the final count when it was calculated that the total remaining get was twentytwo five of which were already en route across the mountains for starside and the last aerie most of the females would go on the backs of flyers and the rest would follow on foot all of them should make it wratha would claim eight all told and seven each to nestor and canker it had been an excellent raid and as yet only seven or eight hours into sundown what now nestor asked wratha where she sat by the fire her scarlet eyes made golden by its glow now she looked up at him and her gaze might almost be vacant but then in a moment the glow beneath her scarp blazed up brighter and her voice more animated as she answered now we unload this lot in our manses and then we come back for more what tonight why not weve been asleep for far too long all of us and if my plan to galvanize the stack is to work then we need to show gorvi wran and spiro that we mean business cant you just see their eyes popping when they see this lot theyll be over here as quick as it takes to tell trying their damnedest to catch up with us and i want them to if i cant make them work with me then let them think theyre working against me just as long as its to the same end for youd better believe me nestor time is running out i feel it in the wind out of the east turgosheim is stirring and it wont be long now in which case he took her hand and helped her up if weve armies to make then wed best be at it they broke camp mounted up and launched into the night and sated for the moment they headed for starside and the last aerie four hours later they struck again this time five miles east of the great pass and on the edge of the forest belt and this time too a different tactic leaving nestor in the foothills canker and wratha used their parties to form an arc two miles across and cutting a mile deep into the forest dropping down from their flyers but leaving them airborne along with the warriors they then tightened the arc in the direction of nestor the warriors flew to and fro over the catchment area filling it with their gasses and destroying the will of any travellers caught in the trap and it worked driven north as the vampire net closed the szgany fled straight into the arms of nestor and his party the catch was smaller than before but still considerable six males four women and five children two elders crippled with rheumatism were killed out of hand and divided between the warriors the four youngest were put to death and taken for meat the remaining get was split three ways to be flown back to the last aerie and at that wratha called it a night back in wrathspire they met to talk and count coup and canker was jubilant ten i cant believe it in my vats ive a warrior waxing which i intended to terminate for lack of stuff but now i can bring him along there are fresh women for my pups several of whom have gone without i was even thinning down my manses workforce in order to satisfy the requirements of the kitchens and the provisioning but now my rosters are filled again and even muscle to spare what a night weve done well wratha nodded she had changed into lounging clothes a thin sheath that fitted her gorgeous body like a glove slippers a jewelled scarp upon her brow every inch a beautiful girl it was hard to believe that she had survived a hundred years and more the blood is the life they were in wrathspires great hall gathered round a blazing fire and sipping wine it should have been a celebration but nestor was frowning he had something on his mind which caused him to display his irritation and frustration out with it wratha said after a while and he looked up in something of surprise is it that obvious your dissatisfaction canker barked aye it is then ill explain nestor nodded and to wratha you see lady you are not the only one who can think and plot for the future i also have a mind very well so tonight we were successful to an extent weve replenished our manses with blood and meat and good strong working muscle no doubt about that but an aerie needs more than that canker has explained to me that in turgosheim the wamphyri were excessive in their requirements depleting their sunside prey to the point of decimation why you almost committed the ultimate folly to wipe out the szgany whose blood was your source of life that was the main reason why you fled here in the first place to find the makings for expansion which were lacking in turgosheim all true wratha agreed and yet now here in the west we pursue the same course as before canker snorted hah but impossible to deplete this sunside to that extent there are thousands of them out there not impossible nestor shook a finger at him and anyway thats not the point then what is the point wratha was genuinely curious for it was quite obvious that this was not just nestor being argumentative in the manner of the wamphyri he leaned back in his chair away from the fire and said now tell me how many of our western szgany tribes are supplicant oh in turgosheims sunside all of them i know but how many here one canker answered it for him they are two hundred and eighty strong and live in a town fifteen miles east of the great pass between the foothills and the forest they work in metals and are good at making and mending gauntlets but they are few in number as stated and so we take only their goods not their lives their fathers and grandfathers were supplicant in the old times before we came here and it appears the weakness was bred into them they supply us with honey grain nuts and fruits beasts and preserved meat wine and materials for our clothes and metal tools for our thralls exactly said nestor one small township and we lords and lady take a regular tithe of them and divide it five ways between guilesump madmanse mangemanse suckscar and wrathspire except i dont know if youve noticed but each time we collect the takings are that much smaller honey grows scarce and the granaries are close to empty our flyers go hungry so tonight we fed our warriors ah yes but when was the last time they had it red to simply exist is not enough wratha said nothing she was beginning to see his point he looked at her again now wratha youve said we must build an army good i agree but of what why we barely have the means to satisfy our individual needs as they are without that we feed entire armies what we need are more supplicant szgany tribes if all of sunside were in our grasp to use as we desire then we would be unconquerable as for vormulac and the rest of your friends in the east let em come she stood up put her hands behind her back walked this way and that before the fire you are right and we could do it too bring all of the szgany tribes to heel as in turgosheim but for one thing oh lardis lidesci the name fell from her lips like acid i know what you mean said nestor and did you know i was a lidesci upon a time not related by blood no but of that tribe and i dwelled in settlement huh she snarled settlement and how may we quell the szgany herd them pen them put them to work milk them when this lardis sets such an example hes clever as a fox he controls superior killing weapons and his territory yes his territory damn his rancid gypsy heart is one enormous trap for the wamphyri indeed the only difference between him and us is this we must fly out from starside into sunside to kill while he stays home and does it kills us or would if he got the chance and certainly he has killed our lieutenants warriors flyers and what all moreover the rest of the szgany are following suit lardis has given them heart he shows them the way why its even dangerous to go anywhere near him too furious to go on she fell silent canker scratched his long bottom jaw and said then all seems simple to me well the solution if not the means of execution we have to raid on settlement find this man and do away with him we have to crush his people their will and of all the szgany bring them to heel first following which any other resistance will soon collapse agreed said wratha but how wait nestor got to his feet and faced her across the hearth are you now considering a raid on settlement the lidescis he had to turn her from it if misha was there among the szgany lidesci then he must wait until his olden enemy his great enemy his brother returned to claim her but these were thoughts which he guarded closely and kept to himself ive always considered it wratha answered her girlish face twisting into something else entirely and ive tried it with disastrous results now i want revenge for all they have destroyed which was mine and for all of my frustration and youll have it he said but not now shortly but not now when then when were strong enough when were so strong that all the traps and lures shotguns and giant crossbows silver and kneblasch and everything else they can throw at us just wont be enough thats when and when nathan returns to be with the one he stole from me cankers turn to be curious shotguns nestor blinked frowned shook his head and closed his eyes for a moment a a memory i think from my past my time among them shotguns aye their weapons which fire pellets of silver weapons out of another world but i i cant remember more than that let it be his furrowed forehead cleared wratha waited until she was sure he was himself again then asked and how do you suggest we go about making more supplicant tribes these people were settled when first we came here town dwellers in the main but now theyre travellers as in the old days or like this lardis lidesci and his lot they inhabit crumbling old towns by day and sneak into their hidyholes at night nestor nodded this is how i see it he said we send our metalworking friends as messengers out into the woods and along the old szgany trails to carry our promise abroad good will and long life to any szgany tribe or group who will work for us on sunside they will be required to pay us a tithe in all of their good things in return for which well spare them even as we spare the metalworkers in their new security they can then settle down again in permanent camps and towns they shall hunt gather farm for us as in turgosheim except we shall stick to our promise and not take flesh and blood but any who dont see fit to work for us he shrugged they are fair game fine canker growled and just suppose we do manage to set up a system of tithepaying szgany camps how do we protect them from wran and the others theyll set up their own nestor answered if they hit our supplicants we hit theirs its as simple as that as for following lardiss example he is in the west while our metalworkers dwell in the east it seems unlikely that the methods of the lidescis have spread so far abroad it might work at that wratha mused and in any case anything is better than inactivity very well well try it the night is still young what say we attend to our new recruits get a little rest then fly out to see our supplicant gantletmakers and give them our instructions canker didnt seem too happy with this arrangement but very well he growled but will it take all of us ive not yet had the chance to properly explore the nights get my new females interest me i have my needs as well you know were all in the same position nestor told him all of our new people require proper indoctrination and you how much time do you need for the rutting anyway canker grinned and damn you nestor he said but without malice you read me as well as you read one of your dead people were in this together wratha said and so we must see it through together six hours before dawn we set out just we three and a couple of lads apiece and a warrior each to act as guard dogs as they prepared to go their separate ways canker said i cant wait to see wrans face when he hears of our success this night and wratha told him he has already heard it she smiled a wicked smile then tilted her chin and looked demure surely you know i have spies in all the manses well no longer in suckscar and mangemanse not now that were colleagues but in guilesump and madmanse certainly i instructed certain persons in my employ to watch our movements very closely and to report them to their supposed masters spies are not only useful for picking up information but also for spreading it abroad wran and spiro know what weve done tonight aye and so does gorvi the guile and its my guess theyre together even now making plans of their own to bring them up to par except we have the lead and so they must work hard at it canker and nestor grinned and made for an exit and wratha called after them until later but in nestors mind not too much later see to your new thrajjs and return ill have a hot bath waiting and something even hotter she knew it was a promise he couldnt resist for the next four months all went as planned or as nearly as possible supplicant camps proved hard to get started and at first were made up of very small szgany groups but once they were established and uneasy contact with the vampire lords and lady had been made when the first tithes were taken and no blood spilled the idea caught on for the szgany east of the pass were tired of running they knew that the cowardly metalworking wamphyri supplicants lived comparatively easy lives and like them they were now prepared to pay for protection so long as the tithe was of goods not flesh and blood it was hardly a satisfactory existence but at least it was bearable and a life of sorts it had to be better than living in constant fear of vampire raids of being eaten or enslaved and dragged into sunside as meat on the hoof gorvi and the killglance brothers had been quick to take up the challenge that was how they saw wrathas new alliance with nestor and canker as a challenge of course despite that the lady claimed her groups activities were purely defensive which well they might be for the possibility of an invasion out of turgosheim was by no means negligible still this fullspeed buildup of muscle was very worrying to them what if no outside threat materialized how then would wratha and her allies use their warriors and men at arms to annex the rest of the stack possibly but while gorvi wran and spiro joined forces they drew the line at setting up tithecamps of their own it was easier and faster to concentrate their existing forces in mass attacks on sunside as wratha had done at first to fill their manses with lieutenants thralls warriors and flyers and generally bring themselves to battleworthiness and because the ladys forces were for the moment superior the ulterior triad must grit its teeth and hold off from raiding on her new supplicant camps but the toll they took on the rest of the travellers especially in the regions west of the pass was massive and so the last aerie was filled with life of sorts and wratha was satisfied to a point but there remained several thorns in her side which she could neither salve nor remove the sharpest of these was nestor lichloathes refusal to raid on settlement wratha had guessed the reason but without knowing nestors real motive that he was waiting for his great enemy to return out of far places to claim her in his own right then he would make his move and claim both of them when they were not raiding collecting tithe seeing to the administration of their manses nestor and wratha spent most of their time together it was a mutual fascination and one that waxed rather than waned when she was on her own wratha found herself thinking of nestor always since he was now accessible shed mainly given up her mental invasions of his privacy but she could never give up her consuming preoccupation with the thought of him his beautiful young body his sexual energy and his determination which rivalled her own to be a leader among men even among the wamphyri that might become a problem one day for there can only be one leader of leaders but that day was still a long way off a joint bonethrone maybe in which case obviously wrathas lovethralls would have to go except they already had where wrathspire was concerned they were less than drones now why she hadnt taken a man any kind of man since that first time with nestor shed not needed to for she was satisfied in that respect as never before and of course he would have to give up his vampire women but there again it appeared hed already chosen that course for himself he no longer so much as looked at his female thralls even his old flame out of sunside glina with her supposed innocent sex had been unable to tempt him on those few occasions when wratha had spied on him out of habit she had seen that he now kept to himself except for herself so she no longer had any rivals here in the last aerie but in sunside towards the end of that same fourmonth period of great activity and productivity one sunup in the twilight hours before night nestor and wratha had taken a meal together in the ladys apartments theyd shared common but satisfying fare suckling pig roasted on a spit over glowing ironwood embers and sliced sunside fruits in aromatic szgany brandy all washed down with a peppery wine then theyd made love and slept wrapped in each others arms awhile and had woken up to find themselves making love again afterwards wratha had made a last attempt to bring nestor round to her way of thinking and convince him that they and canker should now launch a massive joint attack on settlement ostensibly to bring down lardis lidesci being nestor of course hed once again refused to be swayed now while she felt frustrated within herself paradoxically the lady felt nothing of anger towards nestor how could she possibly be angry with him her lover the young and handsome lord nestor lichloathe of suckscar so that she issued a wry silent snort and wondered ah but then again how can a lady of the wamphyri possibly feel so so what so soft so hurt so much like some common szgany slut on sunside so jealous but jealous of what an unknown girj out of his past even out of his mind some figment of his impaired memory why for a i know this misha is a hag or dead even or someone nestor would find unworthy now that he is wamphyri but for all her attempts to apply cold logic to her confused emotions still the lady paced the floor of her bedroom to and fro while her lover lay sleeping in her great bed and glancing sideways at him from time to time she considered her options or rather her her what her plight that she was in love with him was it love she wondered yet again for maybe the hundredth time certainly something was wrong with her it wasnt simply that he was always on her mind no for more than just a thought nestor was in her eyes her nostrils her ears and mouth and wratha knew that she could never have enough of him in her body when they were apart she could taste him on the sensitive buds of her forked tongue she could smell him the pungent odour of his body sweat parts like the scent of some weird sunside orchid she could feel him driving into her core and see his face above her face how his mouth fell open and his eyes closed the perspiration forming on his brow in the instant that he fired his juices into her and she could feel the hot splash of those juices too laving her insides the way his sperm lived in her tens of thousands of mindless minuscule lives until her parasite leech released its own juices like an acid to burn these tiny intruders of course that last didnt have to be she could will it otherwise if she so desired she could still her leech and let nestors seed live and bring forth a child but for what she required no bloodsons to grow up into men who would covet her manse and position and yet it would be an experience to produce a child out of nestors seed and her egg her human egg of course hah but wasnt that just the trouble thinking of nestor she even thought like a woman like the common szgany women of sunside like this misha and had she wanted his children too that last thought increased wrathas frustration fourfold and even made her feel angry towards him she whirled towards her great raised bed and saw that he was stirring she had thought he was asleep but what if hed been merely drowsing had he been listening in on her thoughts was he even now she shielded them at once her pride nestor must never know how deeply he the strength of he must never know for such knowledge would make him strong and wratha weak he groaned and raised himself up a little on one elbow and she forced a smile and said oh awake at last are you and nothing stirring well that makes a change if i didnt know you were wamphyri i might suppose you were merely human after all but see ive brought a little wine she poured smoky szgany wine from a jug into a goblet and took it to him and at the top of the wooden steps she kneeled beside him where he lay naked and spreadeagled as he took the goblet and slaked his thirst she tilted her head on one side smiled again and said look at you nestor all sated and sprawled there defenceless as a child why i could have poisoned that wine with grains of silver while you were sleeping i could have anointed you with oil of kneblasch or plunged a silver dagger into your heart even now i could call one of my guardian creatures to slurp your soft flesh is it that youve no fear or simply that you love and trust me it could be all three of those things he answered with a grin or none of them but mainly its that i cant get up off my backside and only halfmockingly he added what and do you intend to kill me then as you killed karl the crag in your bed in cragspire if so then do it now while im happy karl was my master she answered frowning or thought he was but he was not my lover ive never had a lover until you she reached out and gentled his flaccid lifeless parts they were bruised but what is that to a vampire lord then still frowning she said but happy did you say happy she found it odd that he would use such a word for vampires were rarely if ever happy happiness just wasnt part of their landscape wratha must put it down to the fact that he wasnt long wamphyri and still occasionally thought in szgany terms oh the wamphyri knew well enough how to enjoy how to revel in scarlet extravagance and glut themselves with their excesses how to laugh and roister thrill and exult usually at the expense and the pain of their victims certainly they understood pleasure the gratification of their enhanced appetites and lusts in feasting drinking and fornication but again and always at the expense of others indeed that was their only happiness the outrage and agony of common humanity but wratha suspected that nestor had meant the true happiness which astonished her so that again she asked him and are you happy nestor i think so he clasped her to him i have all that a man needs and in you more than any man could ever need what more is there unless theres some special delight which you havent yet shown me holding her like that with his chin over her shoulder nestors face was hidden wratha suspected that he hid it deliberately also his feelings his true thoughts that indeed there was something more but not something which she could give him and scanning his mind and meeting with a blank wall her suspicion seemed confirmed turning her face away so as not to show her disappointment she pushed him away hurried down the steps and passed through into her dressingroom dressing she heard him call out wratha is there something whats more she felt his querying probe in her mind and immediately brought down mental shutters to close him out no nothing she called back to him but night falls fast and weve business to attend to what she really meant was that she had business to attend to on sunside killing business viii wrathas rout glinas end wrathas orders were simple put the women to death all of them not ravish them or stun them and drink from the scarlet streams of their hearts or by any other means molest and vampirize them but simply kill them out of hand dead all of the women the girls even the smallest infant females of the szgany lidesci wherever they were found and not just for the duration of this raid but in all future raids too for if there were no women wratha told herself contrarily then eventually there would be no children and without children the troublesome lidescis would fade away and vanish in a single generation which is not a long time to one who has lived as long and remained as young as wratha the risen or at least young in appearance it was her way of making logical an entirely illogical command for if the same rules were applied in all of sunside then nestors prognosis would come true and it would be turgosheim all over again but the truth of it was that her order would only apply here in lidesci territory and her reason for issuing it was likewise simple pure jealousy with perhaps a jot of vengeance thrown in for good measure to cover her previous losses mainly the lady was jealous of a past in which she had no part and of a supposed love which she could not even begin to understand for she had never known love not as a common woman until nestor and feared that she might never know it again savagely territorial the wamphyri do not give up their possessions easily and lord nestor of suckscar now belonged to wratha the risen though not as much as wratha belonged to him rivalry for nestors love his lust not in wrathstack not any longer for he was well and truly seduced and wratha even more so indeed completely besotted but in sunside possibly or impossibly when her will was done and with regard to the lady wrathas will and to orders there was one other command which she issued if any man should discover a misha among the szgany lidescis women he was to bring her at once unharmed in any way to wratha then she would be harmed be sure but not before the lady had examined her most minutely to discover nestors preferences in women generally and that which he most fancied in misha specifically following whichwratha would eat her living smoking heart and feed the rest of her to the frenzied warriors which was the circuitous route by which the ladys lieutenants finally came to understand that it was an unknown girl a mysterious misha who was the real reason why their lady mustered her men and monstersatarms in the early twilight and waited impatiently for the last golden streak to fade from the peaks of the barrier mountains before launching them south for sunside settlement and infamous lidesci territory and all of this while most of the stacks inhabitants lay asleep but not all of them nestor stood alone with his thoughts gazing from a window in his southfacing room of repose as usual his eyes rested on the grey peaks of the craggy barrier mountains way beyond the distantly pulsating glowworm of the helllands gate there in the southwest beyond the high scarps and plateaus and across the foothills at the edge of the forest lay the oncebustling township of settlement and somewhere in the wilderness around that battered pile of a place in the dark woods or cavernriddled cliffs or in the hollow roots of the mountains themselves the szgany lidesci had their hiding places to which they retreated at fall of night but of all the wamphyri in the last aerie nestor was the only one who actually knew the location of their principal refuge it had come to him in wrathas bed as she had tried to convince him to raid on settlement a fleeting vision out of the past from his forgotten childhood and youth of a great hollow boulder almost a small mountain in its own right in the sunside foothills and its name was sanctuary rock a fleeting vision aye but one which nestor had wanted to retain which hed assigned to his currently perfect memory before closing his thoughts on it to keep it safe in his secret mind this was the essence of the secrecy which wratha had sensed in him not thoughts of misha but of sanctuary rock in the foothills that honeycombed boulder that maze of caves burrows pitfalls and gantlets where it backed up massively into the roots of the barrier mountains the future refuge of his great enemy when at last he returned but only let wratha discover it first and all dreams of vengeance were flown right out the window even as wratha herself was now flown nestor gave a start stared then glared southwest it was wratha aye and her entire entourage wrathspires not inconsiderable army even now on their way to sunside but without him without canker what was she up to wratha her six lieutenants twice as many apprentices and four warriors two of them only recently waxed all spurting or pulsing south under throbbing gasbladders and vibrating manta wings and all attired for battle even from here nestor could clearly see the sheen of starlight on bluegreen armoured scales and partsheathed claws the bright gleam of gauntlets and polished black leather jerkins and he knew of course where she was going but he didnt know why he could only suppose it was to bring down lardis and destroy the szgany lidesci wrathas stubborn pride aye since nestor had seen fit to deny her his aid at this time shed do the job herself and put him to shame but if by chance she were successful and struck devastating blows against lardis and settlement and perhaps went on to find sanctuary rock what of misha then much more importantly what of nestors olden enemy his great enemy his treacherous brother would he ever return if the szgany lidesci were no more from somewhere came the wail of a child glinas adopted brat which nestor had brought out of sunside glina hah canker had been right it had been a mistake to bring her into suckscar fair and considerate in her managing of the rosters she had grown too strong all of the women liked her and since she controlled them and their duties nestors lieutenants and thralls liked her too she could match them up and cater for their affairs to order or for favours he had given her too much power and that child that entirely human toddler in suckscar what of him for all that he was sweet meat fair game and pure and innocent as only a child can be the bloodlusting vampires of the manse handled him as if he were of their masters flesh nestors own son his bloodson was that glinas idea that one day this brat would get her masters egg and become a lord in his own right well if that was what she thought she could think again suckscar was only the beginning and after that all of wrathstack soon to be lichspire then sunside in its entirety and all of starside too including the blackened exploded stumps of the fallen aeries those that were still habitable and and then what turgosheim in the east why not but with wratha at his side well shed be at his side to start with anyway but there was only one real destiny for the necromancer lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri unopposed emperor of a sprawling vampire dynasty not only here in the west but across the great red waste too and further still in whatever lands might be discovered except his revenge on his great enemy must come first but not if wratha ruined it by destroying the szgany lidesci he must stop her nestor turned from the window in haste and saw the doglord watching him from the doorway and no need to stop her canker barked having read nestors last thought right out of his head which was not difficult for it had been a forceful projection not unless youd save her from disaster myself i think it were better wratha learns her lesson here and now that together were strong and divided we fall he loped to nestors side looked out of the window saw what nestor had seen canker had been escorted here by zahar which was scarcely necessary everyone in suckscar and mangemanse too was aware of nestors and cankers friendship it was simply a custom of the aerie that any and all visitors should be escorted even when they were expected nestor caught zahars eye go alert your colleagues we ride out within the hour but prepare my flyer at once for i might go on ahead and after zahar had gone nestor turned to canker disaster for wratha what do you mean i scry on future times the doglord answered a dodgy business at best but sometimes when i dream i cant help the things i see wratha isnt going to have an easy time of it on sunside she goes against the lidescis am i correct i thought so and theyre waiting for her be sure thats why i came to see you to warn you against accompanying her you saw me in your dream nestor knew that the others scrying was true in many small ways hed had the proof of it often enough neither you nor myself canker answered but i came up anyway in order to be sure will she be hurt only her pride but shell suffer losses aye how would you have stopped her anyway i would first try to reach her mind from an outside balcony maybe and if that failed fly after her to catch her in the heights over settlement and realizing his error or if not there wherever she makes pause to breathe her mist he quickly covered up no canker shook his head sending his red hair flying no wherever settlement will do fine but tell me this are you also a viewer of times and since when did you also read the future in a dream and see the troubles waiting for wratha at the end of her flight why would you want to stop her for our sake because shes an ally for your own sake because you are into her and would miss it if she were slain or was it for some other reason ah but you never have raided on settlement have you the doglord wasnt smiling he was missing something here and knew it but what something important he reached out an instinctive mental probe to brush up against nestors mind would you steal my thoughts the necromancer snapped canker backed off shrugged whined a little habit nestor forgive me i dont want any harm to come to her nestor said well not yet not until shes united the stack for if there really is a threat from the east we may well need the lady wratha and her dubious qualities certainly well need her menatarms and warriors but after that there are other women in the world at which he finally recognized the truth that his lust was all but burned out of him and he did not love the lady after all a fullfledged lord of the wamphyri he didnt love or need anyone especially a liar like wratha for the fact of it was that she was a great liar in her body if not her tongue nestor had mistaken experience for truth had been willing to believe that what she gave him was new and true but it wasnt it was old and false even as old and false as wratha herself a hag was lurking there under the sweet girlflesh he knew it for certain now he always had known it from their first encounter on the roof how could she expect love why wratha had sucked men to death with both mouths and as for sex nestor was right on that point too there were plenty of other women in the world and one especially in sunside hiding in some hole in the ground with the lidescis but all of this unspoken and locked in his secret mind so that canker couldnt hear it too late now in any case the dogthing barked shes well away something has angered her and shell take it out on the lidescis if she can well and good luck to her for shell need it be sure i saw thunder and lightning nestor explosions red green and orange aye and i heard the deathscreams of men flyers and warriors alike vampire screams which are different from those of common men for while a mans screams dont last too long those of a vampire go on and on and on nestor was calmer now thoughtful and yet you say shell suffer no harm not personally no losses among her lads and creatures certainly then let it be youre probably right a lesson learned after this perhaps shell leave the szgany lidesci alone what is it with you and them something old nestor looked away an old scar still itching yes say no more you are my brother i understand and canker put an arm round the others shoulder lets see how it works out for her nestor said what was it we had scheduled for tonight anyway tithecollecting east of the pass well our lieutenants are capable lads they can tend to that what say you and i go spy on wratha eh see what shes up to and what befalls her we can observe her and her works from the foothills over but this time canker was quicker off the mark over settlement aye he nodded very well i go to prepare and canker had been right less than an hour and a half later he and nestor landed their flyers in the foothills over settlement and down there it was much as the doglord had said it would be wratha had called up a mist to send rolling in through the battered gates and shattered stockade fence of the ruined town then shed surrounded the place as best she might with her lieutenants and thralls probably three men to a side outside the gates to deal with any fleeing humans overhead no more than midges at this distance the lady herself and her six remaining menatarms rode their flyers and commanded the warriors her two mature fighting creatures were already down inside the fortress walls battling in the mist in the still of the night however with their enhanced wamphyri senses nestor and canker were not at pains to hear the sounds of battle the snapping of timbers and crashing of collapsing houses a thrumming and whistling as of huge projectiles in flight the awesome belching and growling of furious warriors at work and in a little while they more than heard it but wheres the thunder and lightning nestor had voiced his query just a moment ago so that it still hung in the air like some weird invocation when the answer came from below and but there ah there is the thunder i promised you the doglord whined and panted and both of them started massively at the new sights and sounds from besieged embattled settlement a ball of fire green at first but expanding through yellow and orange to a red glare bloomed like a giants torch in the centre of the town something writhed in the heat and the smoke as the mist was thrown back a warrior coiling like a crippled snake as it burned then the bellowing and belching was drowned out by the blast of a terrific explosion whose echoes bounced up into the mountains to ricochet between the peaks then down again to the dumbstruck vampire lords where they gazed in astonishment on the scene below amplified in the vacuum left by the explosion the challenging battlecries of an uninjured warrior continued unabated while those of its stricken twin had turned to shrieks of purest agony down there in the ruddy night someone or ones must be throwing oil on the thing in its death throes fires blazed up sporadically all around the area of the original explosion the gigantic writhing continued but frenziedly now battle was truly joined and no stopping it and as the ladys flyers descended towards the town black motes against the flickering illumination of various fires where they broke out upon the ground so the sky over settlement came bursting alive with sputtering brilliant blue and emeraldgreen trails of fire like shooting stars fired from the walls of the town and there is my lightning said canker a flyer was hit became a green and yellow fireball full of black tumbling debris other flyers panicked skewing this way and that and even colliding the amazed outraged cries of stunned lieutenants came echoing up on the stench and turbulence of furious explosions and sulphur thermals a faulty shrilly whistling madly cartwheeling projectile exploded as it struck another flyer in the root of a manta wing causing the blazing mewling beast to go spirallng down to a fiery doom its lieutenant rider went with it burning and screaming all the way shes being blown out of the sky nestor whispered to no one in particular just as i foresaw it canker nodded grimly we all knew that this lardis was testing new weapons we saw evidence of it while raiding on the borders of his territories incredible thunderclaps and flying fires but this is simply fantastic nestor finished it for him and a moment later look shes finished it was true wrathas pride had taken another beating but even she knew when it was time to call it a night her flyers were rising up through a fusilade of searing fireballs and on the ground a partblazing warrior seemed hard put to get aloft finally it succeeded and the speed of its rumbling ascent put out the fires in its flanks but at least one of its flotation bladders exploded as it listed into the sky as for the other less fortunate creature it was nothing but a mass of shuddering steaming meat gouting fire smoke and sickening stench now and outside the walls rising from the woods and the lower slopes of the foothills more flyers made hastily erratically aloft swerving to avoid the bolts of giant crossbows and the rockets of jubilant defenders it was a rout so much for raiding on lidesci territory canker growled low in his throat nestor nodded and to himself in force openly a dangerous game aye but covertly at the right time and in the right place sanctuary rock for instance if she comes this way shell see us canker was nervous let her nestor spat into the scree let her know that we know what a fool shes made of herself ah said canker but you havent seen wratha in a fury have you then its time i did might i suggest some other time why not now because she has warriors with her some of which remain whole and fighting fit and we dont be advised nestor do not taunt her now oh shed probably miss you later but much too late for nestor lichloathe and canker canison me i say we launch and make ourselves scarce nestor was reluctant but just this once canker had it his way when nestors and cankers lieutenants were returned from the tithegathering nestor sent for zahar and asked him how did it go well lord honey grain meat and wine and you flesh nestor shook his head that wasnt our purpose and dont ask me what our purpose was as to why ive called you here i have work for you only instruct me lord what is it you wish its glina i want her replaced both in her quarters and in her duties zahar was taken aback but tried not to show it he shrugged and said glina has worked well now she reaps her reward you will reward her lord with an easier routine perhaps so that she may devote more time to the babe nestor sighed you are devious zahar all of you are devious no i will not reward her she goes on the work roster choose a woman the most attractive of my women to replace her im weary of glina climbing the spiral stairs i have not had her in my bed for oh a long time nor will i have her there again from now on she works with the rest of them and just as hard as for the child ive no use for a human child in suckscar see to it zahar couldnt suppress a gasp he fought to maintain something of his equilibrium you mean return him to sunside the choice is yours nestor told him coldly sunside or the provisioning i have no interest in the matter go to glina now and tell her and by sunup let it be as i have ordered it you wont tell her yourself this was brave of zahar are you saying i fear her nestor looked at him raised a sardonic eyebrow no im simply sick of her and of all men and creatures who question me perhaps you fear her eh or do you simply fear the change when you wont find it so easy to conduct your affairs my affairs lord your own and the affairs of all the others too nestors voice was very quiet very dangerous now do you think i dont know how she arranges things for you and now zahar was very brave but all to suckscars benefit lord there is only one creature in my manse which is entirely to suckscars benefit nestor told him in little more than a whisper and i am it but while i cannot be replaced all else can and will be if i see fit now go and be sure you carry out my orders yes lord and only too glad to be out of his masters presence zahar retreated it was the same sundown wratha had been back from her disastrous raid on settlement for some time but never a word out of wrathspire doubtless she licked her wounds while down in suckscar nestor was now wamphyri in the fullest sense of the word he was enormously powerful the lord of a mighty manse a necromancer who read the minds of men dead in their graves and also wrathas lover as to that last things could change for as the lady herself would be the first to admit she was after all only a woman no matter how high she had risen ambitious oh she was that all right but what of nestors own ambitions he supposed they must clash eventually it seemed unavoidable meanwhile well he would make the best of it it wouldnt be too hard certainly wratha knew how to satisfy his lust but theres lust and theres lust which in a man is not always for the body of a woman nestors lust for revenge was powerful revenge on his great enemy and on the girl who had betrayed him that must come first but afterwards he considered the rest of the stack canker first the dogthing was not a problem it was as if he followed nestor to heel like a tame wolf he would make a fine trustworthy lieutenant when the time came then he gave thought to wran and spiro they too might be brought to heel wratha had done it upon a time oh they had slipped their leashes eventually but that was because in bringing them here she had freed them from the tyrannous restrictions of turgosheim they had seen no point in trading one tyranny for another one ruthless leader for a yet more ruthless priestess the killglance brothers were lords after all and wratha only a lady but spiro nestor had heard how he continued to practise his killing eye and with some success at last on sunside during a raid the brothers had got in trouble ambushed by desperate travellers theyd been obliged to fight hand to hand spiro had got his gauntlet stuck in the skull of a man so that it was wrenched from his hand then as another human attacked him with a machete hed tried to use his killing eye and at last his fathers talent was seen to have been passed down to him the metaphysical blast from his evil vampire eyes had been sufficient to burst his victims heart rupture all of his vital organs stop him dead literally so that now while wran had his rages his brother had the killing eye of eygor killglance but of course men were only weak and the wamphyri were strong nestor did not for a moment believe that spiros murderous glance could affect him or any of the stacks vampires for that matter still the weird talent of spiro killglance would be worth watching out for finally gorvi the guile would not be difficult to sway not when all of the others were seen to toe the line but nestor knew that he would always have to watch him gorvi must never be placed in a position of trust indeed it were better if he occupied no position at all except perhaps a very deep hole somewhere out on the boulder plains nestor had got so far with his thoughts his plans for the future when grig came to him with a message from the lady wratha it was a simple thing come grig delivered it and stood grinning usually nestor would laugh along with him for his lieutenants knew well enough what this kind of invitation from wratha signified but tonight he scowled and grig quickly changed his expression lord is her messenger still here in the upper corridor where it leads to her landing bays i left him there watched over by a guardian go to him nestor said and tell him to tell her no grig gawped simply that nestor shrugged she asked for me with a single word and thats how i choose to deny her grig backed away turned to go and nestor stopped him with another single word wait yes lord from now on never smile in my presence unless i smile do not grin unless i grin and dont laugh ever no lord and dont forget nestor warned for if you do its difficult to smile without lips grig fled the night passed however slowly there were no more commands from wratha that nestor attend her though on two occasions he sensed her mental groping at the edge of his awareness he was strong now and knew how to shut her out he did so the aerie was unusually quiet not only suckscar but the entire stack top to bottom like the quiet on sunside before a storm nestor sensed his colony of giant bats stirring in their cavern niches and felt ill at ease without knowing the source of his disquiet he saw to the manses administration then prepared for bed he did not see glina or hear the customary wailing of her adopted child obviously zahar had been diligent in carrying out his orders nestor felt lonely he called for a girl took her to his bed she tried hard to please her master but was cold no not cold but after wratha there was no real fire in her nestor sent her away he slept and dreamed of the numbers vortex of that and of other things nestors dreams were usually scarlet as are the dreams of all the wamphyri but this time there was no blood instead he dreamed of a bloodless war of a battle with the dead and nestor lichloathe the only living creature on all the battlefield he fought alone with neither men nor monsters to support him but only his clogged stinking gauntlet against a teeming legion of the dead whose crumbling rotting bodies stood erect again as quickly as he cut them down and despite that it was a hopeless task still he willed himself to fight through them to get to that which they protected the thing which commanded them his great enemy from times all but forgotten except in brief flashes of tantalizing memory finally when he stood panting from his exertions upon a mound of soulheaving corruption human debris whose pieces yet clutched and clawed at him to pull him down at last the mindrefuge of nestors hated opponent materialized a rearing nodding cone jike a tornado of rapidly mutating equations the numbers vortex and within the rush and swirl of the tornado half hidden in the uproar of mad mathematical eruptions nestor saw the infinitely sad face of a yellowhaired blueeyed giant made sad perhaps by the almost sacrificial mutilation and slaughter of his teeming dead army but not by that alone for it was as if nestor saw behind those plaintive sapphire eyes right into his enemys soul and strangely inexplicably he knew that the giant felt for him knew that his great enemy was sorry for his brother nestor lichloathe at which a hand fell on his shoulder and he came starting awake and it was sunup zahar was there backing away as nestor shot bolt upright in his tumbled bed and the lord of suckscar was damp with cold sweat panting for air as he adjusted to being awake then what is it he demanded as finally he knew his whereabouts and took a grip on himself it is glina lord zahars face was pale even for a vampire what of her i told her your intentions your orders with regard to herself and the child she set to making her quarters clean and asked me to return in an hour but when i went back she was not there neither glina nor the baby fled but how nestor got up got dressed zahar shook his head sadly nestor thought no not fled in hiding waiting for sunup explain i searched the manse but couldnt find her she couldnt go up into wrathspire or down into mangemanse and so must be here but suckscar is vast as well you know and glina is familiar with every nook and cranny also a good many of your people owe her favours lord perhaps someone had hidden glina away just for a few hours i hesitate to suggest it but that is how it how it begins to and he paused with the accusation only halfspoken go on nestor told him i know what you would say that glina has friends difficult between vampires yes and yet i too have one friend at least zahar nodded eagerly and said two lord if youll only include me and he quickly continued i knew she must reveal herself eventually knew she must come out if only to eat or to feed the child well and finally she has come out but as you see not until the sun is up where is she she has climbed by an external route up onto the southfacing wall of wrathspire and the child he is with her suicide it could only be and the infant far better to let him die now swiftly surely and too young to know that hed even lived than take a chance he might go to the provisioning so thought glina and nestor knew shed thought it take me to where i can see her talk to her yes lord but youve slept long and long the sun is well up i fear well be too late in any case they went and on their way what is it you would say to her lord zahar was curious is it that youll try to bring her down nestor glanced at him once only with eyes that blazed up in his face like hells own fires and no he answered let her stay there and wait for the sun to strike i have only one thing to say to glina and its this goodbye and from then to wrathas landingbays silence accompanied them the rest of the way wratha was there too with several of her lieutenants some of her men would climb up after glina but the lady stopped them no lets wait and see what this silly woman will do for its hard to believe shed deliberately burn herself not for the love of any man and she glanced sideways at nestor and moving closer to him smiling yet hissing like some venomous snake in his mind she asked why did you not come to me seeing wratha again seemingly demure and recovered from the ravages of her settlement battle gorgeous in a revealing gown and utterly edible and knowing he could be in her even now nestors lust flooded his veins to heat his blood as hotly as ever because i had things to do he lied such as removing this one from office and sending her away from me then she is here because of you yes he answered mainly out of wamphyri vanity and also because i woujd send her adopted brat back to sunside or to the provisioning oh but i had heard rumours that he was your adopted son too so much for rumours nestor answered they might have conversed further but at that point a sigh went up from zahar and the other lieutenants and thralls where they craned their necks to look up at the soaring southfacing wall of wrathspire their viewpoint was from a walled natural promontory or broad balcony over wrathas main landingbay whose elevation was some sixty feet short of the bleachedwhite upper levels up there along a line so regular it might even be a fault in the aeries rock face the natural features of fissured chimneys and ledges and vampire constructed buttresses windows and cartilage catwalks turned abruptly from a weathered grey colour to an almost crystalline white and the very rock itself seemed calcined with fire and indeed it had been for this was the suns demarcation line above which the uppermost levels of the last aerie had been bleached white through centuries and even millennia of purifying sunlight for when the solar furnace rose to its highest point over sunside and blazed through the high peaks and passes this was where its brilliant rays alighted like a false halo to blister the corrupt head of the stack up there on a ledge to which shed scrambled from a cartilage catwalk where it petered out glina hugged a small bundle to her breast and crouched in the shade of a shallow niche but it was too shallow that niche and would not save her when the sun crept beyond the peaks and its rays swept from east to west across the face of wrathstack which was why zahar and the others had issued their massed sigh for even now the eastern corners of the upper spires were turning to glowing blinding gold as a seething vertical tide inched across the stone towards glina in her crevice she saw it too and knew it was her time then she stepped out upon the ledge and lowered her feral eyes upon wratha nestor zahar and the rest but mainly glina gazed at nestor with eyes yellow as the brightening light they reflected so that he could feel them burning on him and wratha frowned delicately and said she hates you to which he replied she has good reason but his voice was cracked and dry at which juncture a strange thing for suddenly nestor wanted to cry out to warn glina of the suns approach command her to come down find a window creep in out of danger he had thought that compassion and all such feeble human emotions were dead in him and flown forever but now seemed unsure a certain poignancy a gnawing frustration chewed at his insides guilt in a lord of the wamphyri ridiculous and yet what was glina after all but a harmless creature hed stolen out of sunside what had she done to deserve an end such as this but if shed done nothing it was because she was nothing just a stupid szgany bitch a snap of the fingers so why should he worry over her fate wratha had heard him exactly shes nothing why concern yourself because she was your first but think wratha is your last and is there any comparison between me and any traveller shad if so then go to some others bed when your work is done but be sure if you do that i wont call for you again a threat of sorts but he sensed an edge of desperation in it whatever they had had together wratha clung to it still it gave nestor power over her which he would test eventually but for the moment he made no answer mainly because he was watching glina also watching the sun or rather its seething sighing cleansing ray lighting up the face of wrathspire as it drew close to the woman on her ledge but much too late to do anything now she was doomed another sigh went up from the assembled vampires it was strange a sigh of horror from such as these but this would be their doom too if ever the sun should find them out as a life nears its end time speeds up nestor couldnt remember who had said that an old man he believed on sunside probably just another fragment from his forgotten past fitting itself into place but as for what it meant a mans youth lasts forever or seems to but as he gets older so the years get shorter and his last few hours they must fly like seconds the same goes for women of course as for glina she was already down to those seconds five four three two one and then no more at the end the sun scythed across her in a rush she felt its deadly light on her face in her eyes her shoulders had been slumped as in defeat but now she snapped erect on her ledge and as the first tendril of smoke puffed up in her hair she looked one last time down on nestor and hurled the baby towards him it fell short and went without a cry fluttering into the abyss it seemed to drift on the air but in fact fell like a stone and was gone then glina cried out but just the once she lifted up her arms to embrace the sun her face blackened in a moment and her shift billowed up from the steam and stench rising beneath it her hair burst into flames and her shift followed suit yellow fire almost invisible in the sunlight enveloped her for a moment more she stood there like a human torch a sacrifice to the sun then crumpled to her knees and toppled forward into eternity gone said wratha with some satisfaction and silently to herself an old flame blazing to the end finally consumed by its own fire and all her innocence gone with her she turned to nestor but he was no longer there instead she saw him descending from the promontory to the landingbay heading for suckscar with zahar nestor she called after him later he answered without looking back for he knew he had power over her but he also had power over the dead and now there was one among them who he must speak to he had her burned blackened broken body brought up and in the privacy of his room of repose he approached her but before he could even touch her you arecursed nestor she told him in a totally emotionless deadspeak voice freed now from all the agony of death but remembering it well enough you are all cursed of course but you especially he held back and said when i brought you up here from the rubble and the scree my only thought was to comfort you oddly it was the truth but even nestor could see the cynicism in it now she laughed a laugh empty as space not so nestor it was to beg my forgiveness except you are wamphyri and dont know how and anyway i do not will not cannot forgive you will you make me oh i know you have the power but though i may say the words you know ill recant them in the very moment they are spoken and what difference would it make you are cursed not by me alone but by all the dead at which the vampire in him rose up so be it what and should i fear the dead on the contrary they fear me hah but after a moment she told him for now perhaps but in the end you should never forget nestor that all things have a beginning and an end and as for the teeming dead i think you should fear them yesss he suspected it would be the last thing she ever said to him and felt a momentary panic explain yourself but she was silent then he called for zahar and told him in the twilight before sundown bury her in the starside foothills above the helllands gate find a crevice in the rocks and wall her up but dont tell me where you put her for shes forgotten now and should stay that way and to himself in a fashion similar to wrathas short and cynical eulogy forgotten aye and ajj her curses with her but do curses die as easily as women even vampire women in the right circumstances and even the wamphyri when their time is come somehow nestor doubted it ix return of the enemy nestors revenge cankers moonmistress gradually achingly nestor came awake but not to his soft bed and the comforts of some vampire girls breasts and buttocks in suckscar and yet his first thought was this my life as a lord has made me soft which was a contradiction in itself for as a lord of the wamphyri nestor was hard as never before both physically and mentally hard with little or nothing of human emotion left in him and certainly nothing of the frailty of human flesh but even the metamorphic flesh of a vampire has its weaknesses such as sunlight silver kneblasch and the sharp and splintery point of a hardwood stake and of course a certain disease a destroyer of the flesh itself that causes it to slough away in lifeless pieces which men have named leprosy and vampires avoid as surely as sunlight for where the latter may be mercifully swift the former is tortuously slow irrevocable and utterly merciless the hundred year death nestor came more surely awake and at first was surprised by a discomfort so great it was pain then he remembered where he was and the damp grit in the corner of his mouth the small pebbles pressed into his face and the earthy smell of a riverside cave confirmed it his location and predicament both he broke fragile scabs in the corners of his eyes as he forced them painfully shrinkingly open ready for the bright and deadly dazzle which might await them even now but no he was safe his sleep had been a long one of exhaustion recuperation replenishment from which the setting sun and his vampire nature had finally called him awake for outside beyond the low frowning mouth of his refuge the gurgling river was a leaden grey and showed nothing of reflected sparkle it was the twilight before sundown which in a few more hours would turn to night his time he sat up but too swiftly abruptly which caused him yet more pain indeed it seemed there were several small hurts in his body unremembered from this morning which only now made themselves apparent a lump inside the knob of his left shoulder where hed broken his collarbone in the crash lower ribs which were bruised aching and possibly broken massive bruising covering all the left side of his body hip and thigh ah but that had been a tumble as for his face and eyes they were healing and rapidly and nestor knew it was the swift metamorphic reconstruction or revitalization of damaged parts which hurt him so his vampire flesh had expelled those pellets of silver which the lepers in their colony had missed his cracked and broken bones were fusing even now so that soon theyd be stronger than the original material the ravaged flesh of his face was sealing itself with scar tissue which eventually he could keep or shed to suit himself the lidescis the name was like bile in nestors mouth perhaps it would have been better after all to let wratha talk him into a massed raid upon them himself the doglord wratha and all their forces if he had not been so stubborn if hed told his colleagues his secret showed them sanctuary rock and led them in the battle to take it things wouldnt have come to such a pass but as it was what of this nathan his great enemy the master of the numbers vortex his unknown brother now and what of the bitch misha who had betrayed nestor in a world largely forgotten for those two were the real cause of his current fix and the hell of it was that even now he didnt know the outcome of his plan to trap and dispose of them whether it had worked in whole or in part or whether it had been a total failure only nestors lieutenant zahar lichloathe once sucksthrall could tell him that and zahar was in suckscar if he lived at all but however things had gone from nestors current point of view theyd gone disastrously wrong yet on the other hand perhaps it wasnt so terrible after all for as he put out tentative vampire probes into the evening all about and as he employed enhanced wamphyri senses to listen and smel and feel the mental aether nowhere could he detect the numbers vortex or even a trace of it for the first time in as long as nestor could remember his mind seemed completely clear of it as he gingerly fingered his torn but mending face brushed tiny pebbles and grit from his hair and prepared to go out into the lengthening shadows of twilight where the birds of the forest were hushed as they settled for night nestor thought back on the recent events leading to this present moment after glina had cursed him and following immediately upon her subsequent suicide though he had resisted temptation until threequarters of the way through sunup eventually the lure of wrathas vampire body had sufficed to draw nestor up into her manse even as the water from gorvis wells was drawn by her siphoneers and despairing of what he had seen as a human failing and weakness still hed gone to her but it had not been the same for wratha it may have been but not for nestor for hed felt his dominance and had known that wratha loved him or that her feelings for him were a vampires equivalent of love and the knowledge of her weakness in this respect had become his strength afterwards when they had slept then hed dreamed again of the numbers vortex of course and the one who hid in its heart his hated brother nathan but finally starting awake nestor had known that this dream had been different from any other for even when he was fully conscious something of it had stayed with him niggling there at the back of his changeling mind that maddening meaningless swirl of mutating numbers oh it was faint in the sighing of the fading sunlight on the mountains yes but it emanated from sunside and lidesci territory nevertheless and it was real no longer a memory but a fact absent for so long and only now returned but actually returned returned the thought of that of his great enemy returned had made nestors vampire flesh tingle and misha his stolen love was she too out there even now together with him were they lovers again plotting against nestor anew as once before they had plotted in an earlier existence and he had known that the answer to all of these inwarddirected questions was yes and he had also known what he must do about it back down in suckscar hearing canker canison singing to a pale sunlit moon from some northfacing balcony in mangemanse nestor had sought him out for his advice and the oneiromantist doglord had read his dream for him and looked into his future but not without a warning that the future is a devious thing the danger lies not so much in reading what will be canker had told him but in trying to alter it the future is no less inviolable than the past what has been is fixed that way forever and what will be will be still nestor had wanted to know and for me for answer falling to all fours canker had tilted back his head and howled his misery then springing upright again he had clutched nestor to him and in the next moment his growl had been very deep and far too ominous as he said perhaps it would be best if you took me with you my friend took you with me to sunside in the twilight where youll do your best to scratch this itchy old scar of yours for it seems to me youll be staying there a while whether you want to or not and a day on sunside is death as well you know then the doglord had brightened yes thats it ill go with you for thats the way i saw it that you were not alone i never intended to be nestor had answered shaking his head but ill not jeopardize you for it isnt your problem no ill take zahar along and that way this future youve seen wont be changed except i dont yet know what you saw i saw trouble fire pain and torment canker answered i saw brothers twins and yet not twins one of them hurt damaged perhaps permanently and the other sent far far away only dont ask me which brother was which and as for changing the future dont trouble yourself for as i told you it may not be changed nor will it be denied and canker had stood there whining perhaps even crying in his way as nestor returned thoughtfully to suckscar then almost too soon it had been the twilight before sundown and the grey peaks of the barrier mountains had beckoned nestor as never before he had felt lured by them where they turned to blue ash under a hurtling moon and icechip stars lured by the peaks and by the numbers vortex both for instead of fading as of old now the vortex had waxed in nestors head to a living power whirling like a dustdevil in his enhanced wamphyri mind so that he had been doubly sure that his great enemy was back and before the rest of the aerie was fully awake nestor and zahar had saddled mantawinged mounts and flown to sunside so that by the time canker had changed his mind about changing the future and rushed up from mangemanse to restrain nestor and before wratha had yawned three times frowned and sent out a vampire probe to seek him out and discover the reason for his absence from her bed it was already too late resting a while in the barrier mountains nestor and zahar had gazed down on sunside and by virtue of the numbers vortex nestor had known that his great enemy was down there even now except this time he could find him by following that trail of alien numbers which rushed faster and faster ever more maddeningly through his head at long last he would track the maelstrom to its source and destroy it destroy him forever and misha if she was with him she would be stolen away into starside to be nestors thrall in suckscar all of which had been explained to zahar so that nestor need only caution him if aught befalls me my enemy must not go free no for i cant bear the thought of that if im destined for hell i want to know that he got there before me or that hes following close behind these are my instructions he is mine and you shall take the girl if all goes well we head home at once but if i come to grief my order is this drop the girl and take him do you understand zahar had understood and also nestors next instruction that his enemy was to be tossed alive into the helllands gate on starside then they had mounted up and nestor had told zahar now follow close behind and ill take you to them and he had up until which time all had gone as planned but from then on all had gone astray oddly enough nestor remembered very little of it other than that hed followed the numbers vortex to its source and discovered his prey heading west for sanctuary rock the two of them together of course after that it should have been the very simplest thing a lord of the wamphyri and his lieutenant both of them mounted upon flyers against a pair of szgany lovers wandering in the twilight like lost waifs he had seen them from on high and could not fail to note the travois which they hauled behind them weighted with their few worldly goods and hed known what that travois signified that they were recently wed and were even now returning from their nuptials well what odds nathan had had misha before nestor was sure and it made little or no difference now but it infuriated him nevertheless and worse it distracted him he saw man and mate but failed to see the other who was there their possible salvation that other who carried a shotgun which nestor remembered as being a weapon out of another world then as the hunters descended through a thin mist under vibrating membranous manta wings arched into air traps the pair on the ground had seen them leaving the travois behind theyd split up and scrambled in opposite directions acting on nestors instructions zahar had gone after the girl while his master pursued nathan but in the milky swirl of a deepening mist still nestor had failed to appreciate the presence of a third traveller until twin flashes of light matched by a doublebarrelled blast of sound by which time it had been too late nestors flyer was hit in the face indeed half of its face had been blown away and the wonder was that the beast had managed to stay aloft but that hadnt been the end of it thered been more gunfire this time directed at nestor himself the agony of those tiny poisonous silver pellets chewing deep into his metamorphic flesh almost unseated somehow nestor had managed to hang on and reeling sightless in the saddle his face a raw red mess and consciousness slipping as he fought to command his crippled flyer up away and back to starside again hed remembered glinas curse and cankers warning following which he remembered very little a long low glide and his inability to impress himself on his mounts mind the gradually declining beat of the flyers manta wings its agonized mewling the way it tilted first to the left then to the right its balance upset by the silver shot in its tiny brain unable to find the strength to climb disorientated dying the beast had headed out over the sunside forest and crashed there the crash the whiplash as he was hurled from the flyers back his body somersaulting smashing against the bole of a great tree falling through branches which snapped under his weight down to the forests floor and the darkness then ministering hands kindness ointments and bandages to assist in the healing process which nestors leech had already commenced and brief bouts of consciousness and the occasional wishful thought that perhaps wratha had found him crashed and brought him back to the last aerie but she hadnt no for the lepers had found him his hagridden blundering halfblind escape from their colony in the predawn light and the knowledge etched in acid on his vampire mind that he had been in their hands in their care and breathing their air for the greater part of a long sunside night lepers leprosy the great bane of the wamphyri nestor snapped out of it and found himself stripped naked scrubbing himself in the river scrubbing the feel the smell the taint and even the knowledge of leprosy out his body his brain his very existence except the knowledge was there forever and he knew it what had been could not be altered shivering he went to the riverbank and dressed himself in his soiled clothes and thought it is contagious but not inevitable also im aware of the danger and so is my leech within him he knew that his parasite was working to discover and destroy anything of leprosy anything alien at all which it might find in his body and blood but he knew too that it had already tasked itself to produce an antidote to the poison of the silver shot also that it worked hard to replace the tissues damaged by the shotgun blast and his crash both in short he knew that his leech was overburdened but he must put it out of his mind a man might live with lepers for years and remain free of the taint and he had been with them for one night only damn it to heji nestor gritted his teeth shook his head furiously gazed north through bloodshot bloodred eyes and glimpsed the first stars of night glittering over the barrier mountains and high over the last aerie the northstar like some frozen blue jewel calling to him as once before it had called but the icechip stars were blurred twinimaged and his damaged eyes filled with tears of pain and frustration as he tried in vain to fix those celestial gems in their orbits all to no avail it was useless the healing could not be hastened but must take its own time he must rely on his darker vampire senses to see him through the woods and across the mountains well and that was something which nestor had done before too with nothing to rely upon but the damaged mind and memory of a dull szgany youth and when all he had known was what he wanted to be and now that he was it should be easy so he set off north and gradually his aches and pains settled to a dull background throbbing and his at first cautious tread took on pace rhythm and the easy flow of the vampire to eat up the miles as before the northstar was his pharos it guided him along the shortest route though naturally he fol lowed trails old and new where they were available just so long as they pointed in roughly the right direction and in the deepening night nestor was in no great hurry for the night was his friend and he was wamphyri and inexhaustible and hungry in a little while he knew his whereabouts the woods some three miles south and one east of settlement upon a time hed played here as a child and hunted here as a youth the memory came and went insubstantial as a tendril of ground mist evaporating in his mind his childhood and youth were forgotten in a moment but instinctively still he knew where he was four miles and hed be into the foothills and all the long sunside night spread before him through which hed climb the barrier mountains to safety long before the sun was up except he knew now that wamphyri inexhaustibility was a fable his travails had taken it out of him despite his long sleep he was beginning to tire and he was still hungry in a hundred years time ah but it would have been so easy to find a point of elevation spread his stretchy wamphyri flesh into an airfoil fly and glide home to starside but lord though he was in that respect nestor was still immature he had progressed yes but not yet to that point not yet to the extent of that incredible skill or art indeed as of yet hed not seen a one of the lords of wrathstack in actual physical unassisted flight though canker had sworn that they all could do it if or when necessary but flight just think of it to launch oneself and drift aloft on the night winds nestor inclined his head and glanced longingly at the starshot sky and saw manta shapes gliding up there at first his thoughts were chaotic what a searchparty had zahar or wratha organized lieutenants and thralls to come across the mountains and look for him well wratha perhaps but zahar it seemed unlikely despite that nestor had sworn hed be back his man zahar must see this as his chance for ascendancy just how he would manage it was hard to say zahar had no egg and he wasnt long a vampire himself but it was a chance certainly wratha then nestor sent a probe skyward and saw that it wasnt wratha indeed the riders on high were the last people he had wanted to see and certainly they were the last hed want to discover him here the killglance brothers wran and spiro they and a small party of hunters were circling overhead gradually descending but even as he watched the descent became a swoop like the plummet of hawks stooping to their prey nestors vampire senses had been sharpened by the presence of danger on high now from the northwest he heard the crashing of underbrush even at this distance the hoarse panting of fleeing szgany was plainly audible the brothers had found a party of travellers and very shortly the night would turn to rack and ruin fire and blood nestors heartbeat picked up and his own blood surged at the thought of it he had been lucky if the marauders werent so intent upon the hunt they must surely have sensed his probe and he could be fairly sure how the lords of madmanse would have dealt with him not necessarily a quick death but one from which thered be no returning the sword the stake the cleansing fire of course for who would there be to witness it and who later to accuse none but the brothers themselves and their thralls and nestor was without a doubt their enemy who sided with wratha and the doglord to make wrathstacks upper half a fortress in its own right and leave the others to their fate get rid of him and wratha would be that much weaker and the brothers that much stronger yes hed been lucky and his luck was holding someone a traveller obviously from his crashing stumbling blundering flight was heading his way flushed out by the madmanse twins sweet salty sustenance was on its way rushing straight into nestors waiting arms he melted into the cover of treecast shadows breathed a vampire mist let his dark wamphyri senses drift out from him to meet and explore whoever it was that fled in his direction and there were two of them a man and a woman sufficient for ajj of his needs nestor let them come and now their approach was that much more cautious not because of him no for they had no knowledge of him because of the sounds from the deep forest at their backs the hoarse desperate shouting of fearful men shrill feminine cries of terror and the coarse pitiless laughter of their pursuers and tormentors but all from some distance away and this pair thought that theyd escaped it so that now they crept in the night like mice and tried as best they might to still the thudding of their hearts to quiet the panting of their ragged breath but nestor heard everything and waited and eventually they came then he stepped out of his own mist and confronted them the shock was so great that the woman no she was only a girl simply fainted away as for the youth his jaw fell open and he lifted an arm and hand perhaps defensively except his hand contained a crossbow nestor leaned to one side as a bolt whirred too close to his ear and he struck at the others extended wrist with the flat of a hand as hard and as heavy as wood the youths wrist broke but he made no sound for nestors free fist had already crashed into his face his jaw disintegrated and his teeth collapsed inwards driven into the back of his throat by nestors thorny knuckles gagging he flew backwards and slumped against the bole of a tree nestor followed up and drove his right fist into the others chest crushing his fluttering heart nipping its pipes tearing it from his body while still it palpitated in his hand thus it was done and all so silently and holding the stillshuddering corpse of his victim upright against the tree nestor slaked his thirst and satisfied his hunger there and then or one of his hungers at least in a little while the girl stirred and uttered a low moan and when her eyes flickered open nestor was there kneeling beside her looking into her face her mouth flew open in what started as a scream but quickly gurgled into silence for his hand was at her throat tightening and the look on his deeply scarred savagely lustful vampire face was a warning in itself dont then she looked beyond him up through the canopy of the trees to see clouds scudding against a backdrop of cold blueglittering stars she was seated with her back to the leaning bole of a tree and she was naked to the waist where her upper clothing had been torn from her in strips like rind dangling from a ripe fruit in that same moment she knew that this wasnt just a bad dream she remembered where she was who shed been with and what had happened her eyes opened wide glancing this way and that in the starlight until they found her lover slumped close beside her at the bole of the same tree slumped almost crumpled there and bloody as a freshly slaughtered beast then she turned her searing accusing gaze on nestor again saw the look on his face and knew what it meant that he wanted her and would have her similarly he knew what her look meant that she would kill him if she could or cause him to be killed and never mind the consequences he knew shed scream her lungs out if he gave her the chance and also how easy it would be to squeeze a little harder and finish it except he wanted her conscious or conscious at first at least from the darkness of the neardistant forest the sounds of wran and spiros raiding party about their business had settled down to a chorus of sobbing pleading female voices the occasional shriek of agony or infrequent burst of guttural laughter knowing what these sounds signified that by now the killglance brothers and their lieutenants were enjoying the women they had captured nestors vampire passions were inflamed and his blood sang in his veins as he felt his own need growing by leaps and bounds he would do the same right here and now immediately but knew that if the girl cried out she would surely be heard if she cried out coming slowly to his feet but never for a moment relaxing his grip on her throat he looked down on her gazing up at him despite that her face was grimy streaked with tears and bore the bruises and scratches of her panic flight through the night forest still she was beautiful or would be in the right circumstances as he continued to straighten his legs and stand up nestor released his rigid rod from his trousers and let it stroke upwards through the central indentation of her rib cage then between her firm quivering breasts her beautiful breasts her shivering shoulders gleaming like marble in the night her pulsing throat the depth of her throat but her face was turning blue from the pressure of his iron fingers and gradually as she began to choke so he released his grip on her windpipe instantly her mouth gaped open and she drew massively on the night air nestor knew that when she expelled that breath it would be in the form of a piercing shriek which was something he simply couldnt allow ramming himself forward into her mouth he reached down to trap her hands where they flew to his vulnerable parts and concentrating on his metamorphic flesh as it surged into her throat he filled her as so often hed filled the lady wratha except wratha was wamphyri and had wanted it and could take it in his awful ecstasy nestors metamorphism was that of a lord fullfledged he extended into his unknown victim like lava in a volcanic subterranean sump filling every available space sex was his purpose but his leechs need was sustenance a direct flow into nestors own stream to supplement the nutrition hed had from the young man within the girls writhing body nestors flesh put out small hooks to hold itself in position and needlelike siphons to pierce her innermost veins and arteries drawing off her lifeforce while yet it remained but it didnt remain for long as her hands went limp in his nestor released them and reached for her breasts and squeezed them as if to force her juices and his own to flow that much faster except the flow was already ebbing as she gave up the unequal struggle the knowledge that she was dying that he had devoured her life incensed nestor even further moaning the sweet agony of his relief shuddering head to toe crushing the girls upper body to the tree he reached climax and ejaculated in a series of long bursts then it was over and in a little while he began to shrink back into himself and withdraw after that nestor would have skirted the hunting party out of madmanse and continued his trek without delay but there was a matter of great importance which he must see to first his male victim was most certainly dead and the true death at that nestor had ruined his face and ripped out his heart but the girl was whole shed been depleted but her body was intact and quite incorruptible for as well as taking nestor had given far too much of himself in short she was undead a vampire and with copious amounts of nestors seed in her she could very well become wamphyri or she might have become wamphyri nestor took up the youths crossbow found a second bolt beneath the tiller and discovered a third in a narrow sheath sewn into the dead mans jacket along the seam of the forearm both of which he sent plunging into the girls heart at pointblank range pinning her to the tree now she would not wake up from her undead sleep but simply rot here unless travellers found her first and burned her long before then however the sun would be up when anything of the vampire left alive in her would likewise die and without another moments thought for her or a word said over her nestor set out north again and skirted the continuing sounds of savage celebration where they echoed in the depths of the violated forest once through the trees he saw the flickering yellow flames of a campfire dancing in a clearing and several nodding grey ghost shapes which could only be the silhouettes of flyers but striding out and stronger now he soon left all of that far behind without further incident nestor came at last to the foothills and commenced climbing and onethird of the way through sunsides threeday night found himself almost up into the hard rock outcrops screecovered saddles and sheer cliff faces of the barrier mountains themselves now the going was harder but nestor was undeterred with something over forty hours to go before sunup he would be up into the peaks safely through the high passes and down into the shadows of starside before the searing sunlight could discover and devour him he slept once briefly in a cleft in the base of a cliff and woke up thinking that hed overslept and the sun was already up but it wasnt though the evilly glittering northstar was hidden now by the wall of the mountains the rest of the stars shone cold and bright as ever overhead and the long night was only halfway through twice as he climbed he saw signs of wamphyri activity on the first occasion a handful of heavily burdened manta shapes pulsed wearily overhead on a course for starside this would be the killglance brothers having slept off their orgy of bloodletting and red rape theyd be on their way back to madmanse the second time it was a mist that drew nestors attention a vampire mist rolling like a soft shallow white lake through the once thronging thoroughfares in the deserted ruins of twin fords far below it could be gorvi the guile down there or the doglord even the lady wratha herself but nestor made no inquiry up here in the heights he was vulnerable and wanted no enemy coming to investigate his presence but if it was gorvi down there hunting on his own for once and separate from the killglance brothers perhaps thered been a falling out between them nestor hoped so even as he looked down a fire sprang into being in the old towns centre where a house went up in flames doubtless a celebration was in progress so twin fords hadnt been deserted after all not tonight at least but tomorrow it would be most certainly with the first flush of a false dawn staining the southern horizon nestor made his way wearily through a high pass to cross the dividing line between sunside and starside an invisible demarcation it was the halfway point where sunside disappeared from view even the horizon and in the stygian shadows of the starside peaks at last he felt safe so he returned into starside and emerged from the pass to gaze down on the barren boulder plains in the northeast way beyond the helllands gate the last aerie of the wamphyri was alive even now from here it was invisible except perhaps as a series of faintly twinkling lights in the duskyblue distance as for the glaring hemisphere gate that lay in the foothills around the curve of the mountains which kept it hidden from view nestor found a flattopped boulder and sat himself down he was tired and would rest a while perhaps even sleep but first he must at least attempt to make contact in wrathstack the lords lady and all their lieutenants and thralls would be making ready for the long day wratha would be drawing her batfur curtains in the higher towers and turrets and southfacing windows of wrathspire canker would be out on a mangemanse balcony somewhere singing a last sad song to the blind uncaring moon down in suckscar zahar would be wondering what was become of his master those without duties would be taking to their beds while the shiftworkers and watchmen would be up and about seeing to the maintenance and security of the five great manses despite that nestors eyelids weighed as heavy as lead he stared into the northeast at that perhaps imaginary twinkle of lights projected his wamphyri thoughts at a mental picture of zahar in suckscar and was immediately rewarded as his probe found not one but three receptive targets zahar wratha and canker all of them at various windows in their various levels all gazing into the southwest and thinking of nestor zahars emotions were mixed his thoughts confused as his mind met that of his master he couldnt send without nestors aid but was his masters true thrall and received his thoughts well enough and when nestors probe touched him it was as if nestor himself stood there saying you zahar come to me nestor zahar whispered the lord nestor to you now come at once to the barrier mountains and bring an extra flyer but youre back and didnt i say i would be now hurry for im ready for the comforts of suckscar and zahar yes lord my great enemy is he on his way to hell lord aye zahar was in command of himself once more or perhaps hes there already for it has been a while now good now get out here with that flyer and i shall guide you to where i wait and nestor but where are you the barrier mountains perhaps a mije or two east of twin fords but on our side of the range an hour and a hajf maybe two hours and zahar will pick me up ill be back in the last aerie before the peaks turn from grey to gold but in one piece yes well almost im coming too canker yelped in his mind and nestor are you hurt he let her wait a while then replied nothing that wont mend damn you what youve put us through and all for for a woman ah and so you have spied upon my mind nestor accused but you are wrong wratha no it wasnt for a woman but revenge i dont want the girl just as long as he doesnt have her he him who do you mean thats my business or it was now its finished but wratha listen to me ill make it up to you from now on any time you want to raid on lidesci territory you me and canker im with you for you see it really doesnt matter now nothing matters now and indeed it was as if a mighty weight had been lifted from his shoulders after a while she said i shall expect to see you soon in wrathspire to which he answered expectations are fine and sometimes they even come true then he lay on his back in a patch of crumbly desiccated heather and in a minute or two was asleep nestor slept for well over an hour he only woke up when he felt the presence of other minds searching for him and closing with his location then using wamphyri mentalism to guide his rescuers in issuing topographic directions and an occasional correction to their course he watched them come gliding diagonally across the foothills and pulsing into the heights until they drew level with him spied him in the rocky saddle where he waited and sought safe landing sites close by zahar and a riderless flyer were first down with canker following behind when they were safely down and dismounted nestor went to them well done he told zahar cursorily before turning to canker the doglord bayed like the great hound that he was gathered nestor up in his arms and growled but i have worried over you his scarlet eyes with their yellow pupils narrowed as they inspected nestors facial ravages not without cause it seems nestor held him off and shrugged a few scars they are nothing i may even wear them as a trophy aye for it seems ive won canker it seems ive won and sharply to zahar youre sure about your enemy nestors lieutenant snapped alert i brought him awake in the moment before i tossed him into the gate oh he knew where he was going all right to hell huh canker growled as nestor relaxed and smiled a grim smile well perhaps one day youll tell me what this was all about meanwhile what are we doing here for if youll take a look back there their eyes turned in the direction of his pointing hand behind them rising up from the unseen valleys and forests in a haze of golden dust motes dawn proclaimed itself it was daubed pink and yellow on the underbellies of sunsides drifting clouds and painted amethyst on the curving southern rim of the starshot blueblack atmosphere it was given voice in the startled songs of mountain birds and echoed in a soughing wind as thermals commenced to rise and draw cold air out of the dark vault of starside they mounted up and launched into the dawn wind set their course east and a little to the north to take them home to the last aerie but in something less than an hour as they glided down across the starside foothills and passed low over the helllands gate a diversion what nestor and the doglord issued their mental questionexclamations almost in unison while zahar said nothing but simply stared down in astonishment and fascination at the glaring white dome of the gate and at the figure which even now stepped down from its crater rim to go stumbling and teetering out across the boulder plain a woman nestor hissed but human here and canker gawping some traveller woman do you think taken on sunside in the night in thrall to gorvi or the kijlglance brothers and left to find her own way home to the jast aerie but would they really leave a creature as beautiful as this to the perils of beasts and mountain passes it seems scarcely possible hauling on their reins they brought their flyers round in a tight semicircle and commanded them to sideslip this way and that settling to the sterile boulder plain like flat pebbles to the bottom of a pool and glancing at canker as they landed nestor saw that the doglord was transfixed his long jaw hanging loose as his eyes soaked up the sight of the girl from the gate a creature as beautiful as this canker had said and indeed she was beautiful and her colours totally alien nestor couldnt say if hed seen such colours before or even if theyd existed in a woman but in a man what of his great enemy nathan gone now into another world hadnt his colours been much the same and hadnt he always dreamed of a place where they would fit where he would be accepted somehow nestor knew that he had maybe they were all the same in that far strange world that alien hell even as the szgany were the same in sunside or perhaps this was just some weird and wonderful coincidence for the woman from the gate was a statuesque unheardof silvery blonde and her eyes were blue as the skys vault on a clear day her skin was pale unblemished perfect likewise her features longlimbed her flesh was firm beneath undergarments of sheer silk which were clearly visible under the swirl and waft of a gown wispy as butterfly wings less than opaque the garment floated as if fashioned of shimmery silver cobwebs she had seen them falling out of the sky landing and dismounting now she ran from them and a wailing cry like that of a frightened infant came back to them canker immediately went to all fours and was after her in a series of leaps and bounds but catching up with her strangely he held back the doglord and alien woman faced each other she put up hands formed into claws with sharp scarlet nails and snarled at him he stood there upright stalled and astonished jaw lolling open the tableau remained frozen until nestor and zahar came on the scene then keep back canker growled whirling on the pair as they approached and nestor had never heard so clear a threat in any voice but from the doglord he couldnt believe it yet cankers muzzle dripped saliva his fangs were sharp as bone knives where the soft shiny black leather of his mouth was drawn back and wrinkled and his eyes glared a savagery completely out of character at least where nestor was concerned what is it my friend nestors own voice was as calm and hushed as ever which was as well for it brought the other to his senses eh canker shook his head as if to clear it glanced at nestor and zahar and returned his gaze to the girl she looked into the cores of his piercing animal eyes shrank from him and hissed like a wild creature spitting her terror but as canker took a step towards her and loomed close she knew his overwhelming power and submitted to it she stood up straight arms by her sides trembling in all her limbs then her eyes rolled up and she would have crumpled to the hard earth except the doglord swept her up but oh so gentjy into his great arms and turning to nestor eh he said again but isnt it obvious what who she is no nestor shook his head stared hard at the girl in the others arms not at all obvious for ive never seen anything like her but i have canker barked often in my dreams didnt i describe her well enough i know i did only turn your eyes to the sky nestor if you would know her heavenly origin up there the hurtling moon for she is my silver moonmistress nestor glanced at the sky the tumbling moon then stared his amaze at canker your aye at last the doglord was triumphant i called part five discovering harry her down with my moon music and goddess that she is of her own free will she came through hell itself to be by my side in mangemanse i harrys room revisited nathan keogh was far from innumerate not any longer but he was illiterate the szgany of sunside had been good at making signs but not at writing indeed they had no writing as such which was why he frowned at the menu which ben trask had handed him just a moment ago and shook his head apologetically til have whatever youre having he told his mentorinchief simply yet the look which he gave the older man was anything but simple if anything it was an accusation but not in connection with ordering lunch in an indian restaurant in london trask hadnt intended to embarrass his protege ah im sorry he held up his hands a moment then let them fall despondently and smiling wryly he said i wasnt thinking yes you were the other nodded you were thinking how strange i am untutored often gauche by your standards at least and rather primitive yet at the same time a potential superman a fantastic weapon and thats how youd like to use me as tzonov would have used me before you as a weapon but i wasnt trask the human liedetector started to deny it and stopped looking into nathans eyes even without looking into them he knew that the other spoke the truth he had been thinking it if only for a moment but not quite the way nathan had believed not like tzonov would have used you no he said oh if you were going to read my mind anyway you might have at least followed through trask told him its like reading the first pages of a book or a chapter out of the middle you didnt get the whole story and what is the whole story you woujd make a fantastic weapon yes trask nodded i was thinking that and i would use you if thats the way you choose to see it not for myself nathan but to save an entire world or both of our worlds if it should come to that he sat back in his chair very well you want to read my mind i have no problem with that go right ahead and welcome to it see if im telling you the truth trasks hypnotic implant was still in place but he wasnt using it he hadnt used it since perchorsk five days ago nathan looked into trasks eyes a moment and felt tempted to scan his mind again however briefly then his face coloured up and he looked away trask thought he knew what the red flush signified shame the espers didnt spy on each other and nathan knew it but he also knew that trask had told him the truth and that in any case the way trask would or would not use him had nothing to do with his problem nathans problem was not that he didnt trust trask or his team of mindspies hed checked them all out and knew that he could with his life but simply that things werent moving fast enough for him it was his mounting frustration the novelty had worn off and in just a few days he was heartily sick of what seemed to him an entirely sick world all he wanted now and right now was to get back to sunside but trask had told him it just couldnt be trask knew there was a problem too nathan hadnt spoken about it as yet but it was there trask could play a guessing game with him he supposed and when he hit the right question read the truth of nathans answer in his expression but that wasnt trasks way anyway he believed he already knew what nathans trouble was youre homesick he said and youre taking it out on your friends trask had used a new word but its meaning was perfectly obvious oh nathan answered and wouldnt you be what homesick in a strange world dressed in strange clothes eating strange food and putting your trust your entire life in the hands of strangers a world you always thought of as a sort of hell and the more you get to know about it the more likely it seems you were right a world where you own nothing except whats been given to you where you dont know anything except what youre told and where you cant go anywhere unless youre taken this world of yours has so many wonders and so many horrors why you people dont even understand its ailments yourselves it astonishes me that madness isnt rife and ive only seen a small part of it homesick yes i am i have a wife on sunside maybe but sunside is a whole world away and i dont even know if she lived through the attack by now she could be in thrall to some vampire lord in starside but he didnt say that the lord would probably be his own brother a vampire in his own right homesick for a vampire world trask said trying hard to understand oh he understood the loneliness but not the rest of it instead of feeling well alone yes but safe like a refugee nathan felt like an outcast and despite the living nightmares which dwelled in starside and called themselves wamphyri still he wanted to go home i cant help reading you nathan said looking directly into trasks eyes not when youre coming across so clear yes i still want to go home homesick i suppose so but thats not all it is im not sure what it is except that somehow i might have the answer i think its in me the answer to all of this the final destruction of the wamphyri a weapon yes possibly but in order to destroy the enemy you have to take your weapons to him you cant hide from him in alien worlds that had been pretty eloquent trask thought from someone who just one short week ago didnt understand a word of english he tried to think of something to say that wouldnt sound trite and was saved by the approach of a small waddling gaptoothed waiter are you ready to order sir onion bhaji starters for two trask told him and a main course of chicken biriani also for two oh and two beers they were in a place just off oxford street it was a downtoearth place hardly haute cuisine but trask didnt eat high class not if he could avoid it it just wasnt his thing collages in brightly coloured soup raw vegetables and halfcooked fish didnt turn him on and he didnt think nathan would respond to it either but youre doing so well he said youve been with us what four days just four days he nodded and already you fit right in and youre learning nathan were teaching you all we can and learning from me nathan was disarmingly frank trask nodded yes of course we are how you feel about sunside is how we feel about our world and narrowing it down a little its how we feel about our different cultures east and west just as you have enemies in starside so we have potential enemies in the east you know one of them nathan and you discovered his intentions to infiltrate your world as an aggressor but if he succeeds your world is only the first next comes our world which hell overthrow using whatever resources he wins in sunsidestarside so you see its as simple as that we need to know about your world in order to counter his aggression if it should ever come to that nathan nodded i think i understand all of that but now you have to understand one of the first things they showed me in your headquarters was film of your history it was very condensed yes but it was very graphic too and i keep thinking about it your wars have been devastating and one of the worst things about them is that you dont just fight them on your own and your enemys territory but on neutral ground too and you leave the scars of your battles behind as your weapons got better the scars they left got bigger dont forget ben that ive seen the result of one of your weapons used on starside it was bad enough there but if it had been sunside he shook his head not one of ours trask told him theirs does it really matter trask thought about it a moment but there was only one truth and he knew it if tzonov investigates invades tries to plunder your world well do our damnedest to stop him oh well try to stop him here first thwart his plans as best we can but if we cant hes not the only one with a gateway into sunside starside nathans face was suddenly very pale sad so despite all my arguments and everything you told me that you only wanted to help me still you will take your weapons and men who can use them an army however small into sunside against tzonov if its necessary that we go against him yes trask wasnt going to lie even if he did nathan would know it sooner or later and he wouldnt forgive him for it then you are as mad as he is not mad dedicated and is tzonov dedicated too but to himself trask nodded to his own ideals while our dedication is to freedom your freedom not the freedom of the travellers the freedom of all men nathan if this thing starts and when its all over your world can still be yours but without your help it might not be you might lose it to turkur tzonov and others just like him possibly nathan looked doubtful worried but on the other hand i see a very different what scenario and i wonder have you even considered that sunside starside might end up belonging to the wamphyri in its entirety just for a moment the expression on nathans face was so like his fathers had used to be innocent bemused and lonely yet paradoxically cold knowing enigmatic that trask actually saw harry keogh sitting there but only for a moment for in the next his laughter was forced harsh even sardonic until he was through and quietly said i tell you one more time you your people turkur tzonov anyone of this world who would venture into mine knowing so little about it you are all mad the wamphyri will eat you i mean they will simply literally eat you he was still trying out new words yes literally and very definitely again he reminded trask of his father his conviction was that concentrated his warning that clear harry keogh yes as keenan gormley had first known him before the necroscope developed his powers to their full but trask must be slipping here nathan had presented him with yet another opportunity to learn more about the wamphyri and hed almost let it go youve seen film of our weapons of war which make lardis lidescis shotguns look like toys and yet you still think the wamphyri can triumph outside the plateglass window a tourist bus passed slowly in heavy midday traffic do you see that vehicle nathan indicated the bus in turgosheim i saw one of vormulacs aerial warriors a creature freshly waxed in his vats twice the size of that vehicle armoured like one of your tanks and weaponed tiptotail go crashing into the gorge it was a training flight and the warrior had design faults but when this monster hit the bottom the force of the crash was such that it tore chunks of stone out of the turrets of a lesser manse and even the chunks were as big as that vehicle trask shrugged but not carelessly youve seen our tanks then and their firepower now tell me do you really think a warrior creature could stand up to a machine such as that no nathan shook his head not even the most ferocious of them for even they are only flesh and blood i dont think so and i didnt say so but now you tell me something if you cant get me through this romanian gate how can you possibly hope to get a tank through trask grinned but again without malice and said you havent seen all of our films then nathan weve got tankkilling weapons that can be fired by single soldiers as easily as you fire a crossbow one good shot can take out an entire tank and as for a warrior theyd just blow it in half and these are weapons which we can take through but not me not yet why not trask sighed i thought id explained something of that in perchorsk and again on your first day at ebranch hq we havent even seen the romanian gate yet nathan oh we know its there your father used it once to enter into starside but so far hes the only human being who ever did you did explain it to me yes nathan answered maybe i wasnt paying too much attention there was a lot going on please tell me again their food arrived while trask talked nathan tried his starter course found it delicious ate with gusto his beer was also good but he sipped cautiously trask had warned him of its potency nathan wanted to keep a clear head the gate is up an underground river which empties into the danube trask began shortly after your father discovered it romania overthrew its government and opened its borders communism was on the point of collapse conditions in that country were dreadful many of the people lived like animals all as a result of political corruption he paused are you getting all of this yes nathan nodded i hope you dont mind but youre matching my thoughts to my words if its permitted it is i dont have anything to hide then go on trask went on the western world was asked to help not only in romania but in all of the old ussrs satellite countries the west had the power the knowhow the wealth which our democratic systems had created while the ussr and friends were bankrupt not only of ideologies but also of hard cash that is to say they were incapable of further expansion or interference in the affairs of lesser states they were no longer a threat they had nothing with which to bargain they could only beg if the boot had been on the other foot doubtless theyd have rolled over us but its as ive been telling you here in the west we believe in the freedom of all men so we helped them out and weve been doing so ever since the children of romania had suffered especially badly so we built a refuge for them i mean we ebranch with our governments blessing of course and we built it over the mouth of the romanian tributary using the force of the resurgent water to drive our turbines it was a place of safety a hospital a school and a trap a filter a dragnet the water coming out of that underground river was all channelled through a screening system which would isolate any solids it was our way of ensuring that we werent going to have any more visitors from your world nathan for you see that romanian river had been the source of vampirism in this world for as long as men can remember but from now on nothing bigger than a small fish would ever get out into the danube so what we had was this two gates one under the urals in perchorsk and one buried deep underground in romania you know about perchorsk through personal experience and now you know about the other gate the russians looked after the one kept it secure took precautions against any wamphyri contamination which might come out of starside and we looked after the place in romania the only difference was this that they had access to their gate while ours was beyond our reach so how did harry keogh your father reach it well this much i know nathan cut him off and now he did the talking while trask ate it was in tzonovs mind in perchorsk something my father could do which tzonov feared and he wondered if i had it too also it has been in the mind of almost all of your mentalists your espers including you ben something called the mobius continuum my father used it as a means of of going to places trask paused with a forkful of food halfway to his mouth and said he could use it to go almost anywhere in this universe certainly in this world but sunside starside is another universe expanding parallel to this one and harry didnt know how to use the mobius continuum to bridge the gap mobius himself didnt know that only one man did your brother called the dweller in your world harry keogh told us that much when finally he returned to us but about the dweller himself we really dont know very much except that in the end both he and harry were wamphyri and maybe the dweller still is yes nathan thought and now i have another brother who is also wamphyri but the thought was entirely his own while out loud no he shook his head the dweller is no more and my fathers dead too i remember lardis talking about it it was a weapon out of perchorsk that killed them a breath of hell it also killed off the rest of the old wamphyri as they were at that time but the new wamphyri they are different how different theyre clever nathan thought of maglore of rune manse and automatically touched the golden sigil in his ear theyre more devious more devilish they pretend civilization sophistication but that only makes them worse i know what you mean trask nodded in this world some years ago we had a man called hitler he was civilized sophisticated too as were his ideologies his machines of destruction and the genocide which he would have turned loose on the majority of the human race what happened to him we killed him and his army but his ideas are taking a little longer we are winning though in this world anyway and we can win in yours too not if you cant reach it give us a chance now that we know turkur tzonovs plans or believe we do were working on it were working hard doing what before we built the refuge and while we were building it we tried to get up the river harry had done it in stages making what he called mobius jumps from point to point also he had help from a dead friend or two romanian potholers who had tried it before him and failed so we brought in some experts of our own and equipped them with the best possible gear potholers trask explained and finished oh yes there are people in this world who explore caves for pleasure as for the people we used it was strictly business nathan gave a grunt huh in sunside they do it to hide and to live our people tried to reach the gate much as your father had done trask continued by moving up the underground river in stages except they were handicapped they didnt have harrys special talents deadspeak and the mobius continuum they only had aqualungs powerful lights propdriven towing torps again he must pause to explain for while nathan had read the pictures in his mind still the technology was way beyond him since then trask went on there have been a good many developments the design of exploratory equipment has improved but up until now we felt we no longer needed it after the refuge had been built we felt safer the whole world was safer nothing was going to come out of that subterranean river without us knowing about it and how to deal with it anything that got itself caught up in the sumps under the refuge was either harmless or or it was dead or soon would be our systems are at least as good as those in perchorsk if not better so the russians had their gate closed off and we were in control in romania we no longer had any requirement to reach the gate itself everything would be fine as long as we and the opposition were able to guarantee that nothing was going to escape into our world and society except now something has escaped nathan nodded me you are not what i meant i know so whats next i promised you wed help you and we will but whats it been four days trask shrugged however ruefully well im afraid youre going to have to put up with your frustrations a little longer than that nathan maybe for as long as four months four months nathan made a conversion sixteen sunups but if your equipment is that much better now why delay it again trasks shrug its a combination of knowhow and opportunity that river is subject to flash floods even without them its a tricky enough proposition else wed have been in there long ago but any sudden increase in the pressure or the depth of the water would spell disaster four months from now it will be spring going on summer and again he had to pause to explain the seasons and our weather forecasting will be that much more reliable as soon as we know it isnt going to rain well send a team up then depending on their report youll send me thats a promise meanwhile we learn a little from you and you learn a lot from us four months nathan said again his voice very small and all that time i wont know whats going on back home i wont know whats happening to lardis the travellers misha wont even know if she survived trask felt helpless he shrugged again sighed and said son i dont like saying this but youd better get used to the idea it will take as long as it takes and i repeat in between times you give us a little help and well give you a lot it has to be the easiest route the other way means sullen silence solitude and sheer boredom for you oh well still get you back to your own place eventually if thats at all possible but youll miss out on a lot of good friends you could have made along the way nathan had finished with his food looking thoughtful he sat back and toyed with a small jade green clasp turning it in his fingers it caught trasks eye ive seen you playing with that before a keepsake out of sunside nathan shook his head no out of perchorsk for a moment he looked wistful it belonged to siggi his words hit trask like a slap in the face but he kept it hidden this was something new the first time nathan had mentioned siggis name to anyone siggi dam did you say trask was alert now he reached out and was handed the clasp and as he examined it he asked er why did she give it to you nathan glanced away shrugged a keepsake as you said and does david chung know about this keepsake nathan looked puzzled why should he trask nodded and smiled however tightly well he should thats all he gave the trinket back and finished the rest of his meal in silence it could all be perfectly innocent of course but on the other hand chung wasnt the only locator in the world and as long as nathan persisted in carrying that clasp around with him did turkur tzonov know where nathan was his exact location even now but if that was the case why hadnt he picked him up west of the urals trask let it go for now and finished his meal they had talked pretty much in circles and trask couldnt be sure if anything had been resolved but he hoped so finally he pushed his plate away and watched nathan drain the dregs of his beer then he said you were telling me about the new wamphyri out of turgosheim nathan looked at him turgosheim lies in the east beyond the great red waste they live there now but very soon theyll move west and there are a great many of them the lady wratha and the others who have already fled west theyre only a handful then pausing to reflect upon his own words he gave a rueful snort only a handful yes but theyve devastated sunside only lardis lidesci has the measure of them but for how long i suppose he knows theyll get him in the end and hell pay for his defiance and the damage hes caused them in hell trask was eager for all of this he knew that the men who were debriefing nathan probably had it on tape but he hadnt had time to listen to it in detail and anyway it came better from nathan himself wratha and these others theyve established themselves in the territories of the old wamphyri but i thought that harry keogh and the dweller had destroyed all of the old aeries nathan nodded destroyed them yes all except one and thats where they live in the last aerie of the old wamphyri called karenstack upon a time trask snapped his fingers ah yes i remember harry let that one stand because in the last battle karen sided with him and the dweller and his people nathan shrugged tiredly the last battle not quite there have been others since and there will be more but i know what you mean anyway youd know more about that than i do for it was before i was born trask knew even more than nathan thought he did looking back on it he remembered harrys debriefing the dweller had let karenstack alone for his own reasons but his father the necroscope had a different reason entirely the lady karen was wamphyri as was the dweller if harry could find a cure for her he might eventually free his son from the curse of vampirism hed tried it it didnt work karen died and the dweller had known what harry had done then because he feared that his father might try a similar cure on him he took away his metaphysical powers and returned him to his own world and that had been the beginning of the end for harry keogh nathan read all of this in his mind the dweller was that powerful standing up to take out his wallet trask answered yes he was he knew stuff his father couldnt even begin to understand how to get from here to sunside starside for example without using a gate he paid for their meal a powerful weapon they headed for the exit i wont lie to you trask answered you too are a son of harry keogh its possible you have the same kind of potential we had hoped to give you the clues to open it up we still have hopes that youll join us see this thing through with us against tzonov maybe even stay with us and help us to build a better world here i mean when all of this is over misha is in sunside and thats where i belong too passing out into the noisy street trasks look was intent urgent as he turned to nathan and said then make sunside safe for her for yourself for all of the szgany and at the same time make this world safe too then seeing the others reticence his uncertainty he turned away and hailed a taxi now he must leave it to nathan to make up his own mind but in the taxi on the way back to ebranch hq nathan told him very well ben ill give it a try turn me into a weapon if you can but ill warn you now there will have to be a very good reason before ill let you use me against ordinary people against the wamphyri that is something else but not against ordinary people trask sighed his relief nodded and answered judge us as you find us nathan and if we dont measure up you can always wave us farewell as you enter the gate but i think youll discover that ours is a worthy cause in the long ago sir keenan gormley had just as much trouble recruiting your father but it was worth it in the end nathan looked at him to you maybe but what about harry was it worth it to him trask remembered the necroscope as he had last seen him and couldnt repress a shudder however slight but the fact of it was he knew that harry wouldnt have had it any other way and so he answered i think it was yes anyway thats the way it was and no one can change it now fate nathan was quiet thoughtful destiny something like that your father had a saying what will be has been and we have another like father like son nathan thought about that last thought about himself and about nestor and said nothing there was nothing to say for trasks maxim held true on both counts back at hq trask had a word with david chung and chung broke into nathans session with a maths instructor to ask him about siggi dams clasp the session came to a halt as chung examined the clasp and felt for its aura strange because there wasnt one he asked nathan if he could borrow the trinket he would return it undamaged of course it could be that the clasp was a sort of locating device and dangerous as such mystified nathan let him take it and returned to his basic maths lesson ten minutes later chung burst into trasks office without knocking to tell him ben this is weird he tossed the clasp onto trasks desk you were right to put me onto it first this piece is entirely free of psychic probes its not being used to locate nathan next i tried using it to locate siggi dam now i know shes good and has this psychic mindsmog but with a locator mindsmog works two ways if i wasnt able to find her still id find the smog except i cant she isnt there what trask had been busy with paperwork and his mind was only just beginning to focus on what chung was saying she isnt where but thats what im trying to tell you chung threw his arms wide she isnt anywhere its as if its like jazz simmons all over again i mean siggi dam is one of two things either dead or disappeared and you know what im thinking ben this thing feels just like jazz and like harry that kind of disappeared what now trask was all of a hundred per cent with him disappeared into the perchorsk gate is that what youre saying he got to his feet came round the desk chung picked up the clasp thats how it feels yes not that shes dead though she could be i havent enough experience of her to be sure but rather that shes gone trask found himself wondering about nathan and siggi about what else had passed between them other than her clasp and remembering what he knew about turkur tzonovs psychological profile he couldnt help but wonder how the telepath would repay that sort of treachery taking chungs arm he said david not a word of this to nathan not yet but it could be our ace card we have to be careful how we play it thats all they were still like that facing each other wondering what had happened what was happening even now in perchorsk when suddenly a babble of excited voices reached them from the corridor the door stood ajar just as chung had left it trask threw it open and both men looked out halfway down the corridor lan goodly and a group of espers had gathered in a huddle they were crowded round a door to one of the rooms looking in others were running to join them trask glanced at chung and queried harrys room i had the nameplate taken down when nathan starts reading it might have proved a distraction but as trask and chung started down the corridor the espers at the door of harrys room backed off then seemed almost thrown back by some force from within and in the next moment the corridor was filled with a white light that flooded out of the room the precog goodly came reeling rubbing at his eyes as the light faded to a hazy white glow trask grabbed him by the arm said lan what the hell but goodly was still too staggered to answer next down the corridor was nathans maths teacher not an esper or member of ebranch hed been vetted and sworn to the official secrets act before they had let him in a small man of about thirty thirtyfive with receding mousy hair and wearing heavy thicklensed spectacles he was whitefaced and panting trask grabbed him and said what is it after the chinese gentleman interrupted the lesson the man began to answer we couldnt settle down again i i went to get coffee and nathan took the opportunity to stretch his legs he said there was something he wanted to see in one of the rooms trask went to brush past him but lan goodly back in control of himself got in his way ben there was no warning he gasped suddenly i knew something was going to happen and where it would happen i was in my office but headed straight for harrys room thats nathan in there at the computer console the soft white light had vanished now trask and chung ran down the corridor avoiding espers where they stumbled about or leaned against the walls rubbing at their eyes but as the two men reached harrys room they skidded to a halt and cautiously looked in beyond the open door nathan was seated at the computer wheyfaced openmouthed he looked up saw them indicated that they should enter but trask and chung were looking beyond him at the computer screen itself and they both knew that theyd seen this before the screen was unnaturally brilliant it was the source of the soft white glow which still surrounded the entire console but the pastelcoloured moving pictures on the screen were brilliant too sharpimaged computer graphics which told a story out of the past trask and chung said nothing stunned they merely watched and remembered remembered a squally february night some sixteen years ago when every available esper had felt the call to ebranch hq and had gathered here to witness the death of the necroscope harry keogh taking place in another world another time even another dimension it had happened in the ops room and now it was duplicated on the screen in these jerky angular but accurate computer graphics a figure human male in the shape of a cross tumbling slowly end over end down a tunnel of thin neon bars or ribbons of blue green and red light motion simulated by breaks in the ribbons as if each streamer were a series of dashes expanding towards the viewer like multicoloured ackack fire closing on an airplane and each dash blinking out of existence as it touched the surface of the screen from within giving the impression of falling the figure was falling tumbling in space and time towards some indeterminate destiny or origin that last was trasks thought though where it had come from he couldnt say perhaps it was his talent defining the truth of what he witnessed the cadaverous goodly had joined them in harrys room he stood between and behind trask and chung touching their arms and now he husked the falling rotating figure grew smaller receding as the coloured threads hit the screen that much faster it became a mote a speck finally disappeared but where it had been a bright yellow bombburst a sunburst of golden light expanding silently hugely awesomely and not only inwards but outwards too as if to break free of the very computer screen an amazing threedimensional effect so that the four observers nathan trask chung and goodly gasped and felt the urge to duck turn their faces away but they didnt because they were fascinated and must know and it was exactly the same as before and yet more than before those myriad golden splinters speeding outwards from the sunburst angling this way and that sentient seeking disappearing into as many unknown places those pieces o the necroscope harry keogh all that remained of him or of his metaphysical mind and what of the dart which had escaped into this world into our world the screen held the answer suddenly it wiped itself clean and in the next moment a new scene leapt vividly into view of a building or the top floor of one shown in plan with rooms and laboratories all clearly delineated a very familiar layout and so it should be trask and his two most senior agents recognized it at once the plan shown on the screen was ebranch hq and there was the golden dart materializing in the ops room lancing out into the corridor speeding in a series of rapidly mobile stops and starts as if searching until finally it paused in front of a certain room and that certain room was this one harrys room the golden dart passed inside became motionless shrank to a point of light and blinked out and even as trask and the others watched the screen cleared itself off and immediately filled up again with numbers in the astonished silence nathans gasp was clearly audible as he leaned forward in his swivel chair until his face was only fifteen inches away from the screen where the other observers were concerned this largely obscured the view but they saw enough to know that this wasnt their scene and so did nathans maths instructor who had joined them from the corridor now what on earth the others heard his gasped query but didnt look up and for ten twenty seconds the mathematical symbols and figures flowed and swirled in a hypnotic sentientseeming manner forming rapidly mutating calculi apparently at random on the screen then abruptly they dispersed and left the screen blank and the computer switched itself off trask picked up a loose electrical lead in numb fingers and looked at it the set hadnt been plugged in the others saw the lead in his hand and understood the expression on his face it must be pretty much like the expression on their own faces chung spoke first and that that splinter dart whatever it was has been waiting here ever since but for what trasks voice was hoarse for this goodly answered waiting for nathan to pass on its message harrys message trask knew that he was right nathan looked up and his face was paler than ever a message from my father but what was it no one could answer him but in trasks mind it seemed he heard mrs wills again her voice telling him something which her dead husband had told her arrys room well yerd best look after it meg me love i mean yer never knows when hejj be needin ter use it again now does yer ii nathans conversion the occurrences in harrys room had been almost sufficient in themselves to finally hook nathan and tie him in with his new friends as to his previous reticence it hadnt been so much that hed doubted their friendship or even their motives but mainly that hed seen himself as being used now however he was beginning to see how he could use them their superior knowledge of maths and science in general for what hed seen on the computer screen that final sequence of rapidly mutating formulae was nothing less than what hed been seeing in his own mind for as long as he could remember the seemingly unfathomable numbers vortex as recreated by a machine or some incredibly tenacious revenant of his father and if the vortex had been real and worked for harry keogh necroscope then given the resources of this computergeared world in which nathan was stranded he might also be able to make it work for him and not only in this world but in sunside too so that now and as opposed to the selfless motivations of trask and ebranch nathans own motives were mainly selfish since the only way home was to assist his new friends he would assist them all he could and in the process attempt to discover his fathers greatest secret the control of the metaphysical mobius continuum for to know quite definitely that harry keogh had been here worked here been one of them was all the spur nathan had needed if trask and his parapsychological organization had been good enough for harry then they were good enough for him from now on for the time being at least he would play it trasks way a game of give and take right now it was nathans turn to give and no holding back but on certain matters nathan had taken vows and there would always be things he could never tell or if he did it wouldnt hurt to obscure the facts a little since bringing nathan to london trask had cleared most of his more mundane workload that is if anything of the head of ebranchs work could ever be thought of as mundane now he could afford to apply himself more diligently to nathans case and the rest of the day would be spent hearing out the story of his life and adventures on sunside because nathan had decided to make harrys room his own that was where the session took place chung and trask too had heard something of the story from nathan himself or read of it in the first debrief reports but now they wanted a far more detailed account now too nathan was much less reluctant as first he outlined then filled in a history of the life hed lived on sunside and in turgosheims dark and hagridden starside for in fact it was something he was getting used to this constant retelling of his story first to the brown and spindly thyre supposed nomads of sunsides furnace deserts then to maglore of the wamphyri in runemanse and again to lardis lidesci during nathans brief return and sojourn with his own people but this time was different nathan had been given sketch pads pens and coloured felttips and as he talked so he would pause every now and then to draw maps of the regions he named so that now for the first time sunsidestarside was delineated and took on shape and substance here in an alien world zek foener had been brought in on the session zek trask chung and goodly and nathan of course touching oh so gently upon their minds he knew their excitement and was filled with his own mixed emotions by the knowledge that these people had actually known and worked with his father indeed zek foener had been the last person to talk to harry before hed left or been chased into starside nathan still had to uncover the full story of that and was spurred by anticipation but in fact there were other maps of the vampire world zek herself had long ago drawn several crude sketches mainly as an aidememoire which she had brought with her out of her greek island home to give to trask but zek couldnt possibly have known the place as well as nathan its rivers forests and deserts its lowland swamps and high mountain passes the great red waste beyond the eastern extremes of the barrier range and beyond that sombre and sinister turgosheim itself nathan even mapped a starchart showing sunsidestarsides principal blue glittering icechip stars as viewed overhead from settlement in the middle hours of the long sunside night as for szgany townships in zeks time there had been no towns just the travellers themselves ever on the run from the old wamphyri under shaithis and the rest of the vampire lords so in the course of telling his story nathan drew his maps which matched up however loosely with zeks until under the fascinated gaze of trask and his colleagues sunsidestarside became real as never before and its people began to live and breathe as nestors life was recorded and his world revealed its secrets or some of them the story was much as hed told it to maglore that time in turgosheim when the mage and mentalist had taken him into his manse unchanged unvampirized a man among monsters except this time it included his stay in runemanse and his escape on the back of karz biteri a man changed by maglores metamorphism to a leatheryskinned flyer but still a man for all that he told it all of his flight back into sunside how karz had left him there in the foothills and flown off into the sun on his own to end his misery how lardis lidescis watchmen had seen nathan land recognized him and took him to their leader and how lardis had reunited him with his mother nana kiklu and the sweetheart of his childhood dreams misha zanesti finally he told of a lord of the wamphyri and his lieutenant who came in the first hours of darkness to snatch him from his rediscovered love and dispose of him in the whiteglaring maw of the helllands gate on starside of the rest well they already knew that his imprisonment in perchorsk his escape their own part in the story as for the things he didnt tell or at best obscured he told of his travels with the thyre from west to east across the furnace deserts but left out their intelligence their telepathy their subterranean society and civilization for these were things which hed sworn never to reveal to any man he told of maglore and runemanse but made no mention of the seerlords beautiful human thrall orlea his time with orlea was for him alone he spoke of settlement but left out details of sanctuary rock for the rock was the last refuge of the szgany lidesci and with regard to hjs escape from perchorsk during an interrogation by siggi dam he had stolen her key to his cell it was as simple as that but of the four who heard his story to the end two at least knew that this last was a lie albeit a white one just looking at ben trask it was easy to forget as nathan had forgotten his talent the fact that you couldnt lie to him for trask would know it at once and as for zek foener the fact that nathan had conjured his own esoteric form of mindsmog the numbers vortex to obscure those several vague areas in his story had been evidence enough of his deception but as for the degree of that deception zek was as wise as she was beautiful she knew that there are things we would all conceal not necessarily out of shame but also trust and so she too trusted then there were the maps nathan had been as accurate as knowledge and memory allowed with regard to the barrier mountains the great pass fertile margins swamps burning deserts starside the helllands gate the fallen wamphyri stacks and karenstack itself which was the name of the last aerie as he had always known it but again hed omitted the places of the thyre the location of sanctuary rock and several major traveller trails through the deep woods if the time should ever come when men of ebranch or in the branchs employ passed through into his world and if they should ever fall into the hands of the wamphyri nathan would not want them to know these things finally he was done by his reckoning but in trasks eyes he hadnt told enough and despite that it was late in the day trask pressed him nathan about your escape from perchorsk and about siggi dam yes and he couldnt keep the colour from creeping into his pale face but trask found that he couldnt ask his question and so covered by saying we think shes in trouble nathan had been looking tired but came awake in a moment siggi in trouble chung quickly explained and nathan answered this michael simmons jazz he must be the helllander im sorry i mean the agent that lardis always talked about michael jazz simmons he paused to look at zek foener whose sad eyes were full of memories until she glanced away lardis was fond of jazz why he even named his son after him jason lidesci i would have liked to have met him and now you tell me you think that siggi its the same thing exactly chung told him quietly we have siggis clasp but she isnt on the other end of it one of two things trask spoke up siggi could be dead or shes gone through the perchorsk gate nathan shook his head the gate not after what i told her about the other side what woman would willingly go he let his question taper off unspoken we er trask stumbled over his words then let them go in a rush we dont think she went willingly nathan their guest looked from face to face frowning his flush gradually receding as trasks meaning got through to him you mean turkur tzonov might have sent her through as some kind of punishment trask looked right into his eyes possibly it all depends on what he was punishing her for bens right zek cut in nathan the wamphyri arent the only ones who punish people it was a different man who sent me through that time but he was just as bad as tzonov i suppose i was lucky the lady karen found me and she seemed to like me in much the same way as this maglore liked you at the mention of maglores name nathan touched the golden sigil in his left ear just a touch as he brushed his hair back into place david chung noticed the instinctive reaction but it made no impression on him nathan hadnt told them that maglore had given him the earring not that hed been hiding the fact but to him it had seemed unimportant but the earring was one thing and siggi dams clasp and her inexplicable absence which it had revealed was another perhaps it was time nathan told the whole truth about his brief relationship with siggi he made to do so opened his mouth to speak but zek was here nathan looked at her and it was her turn to blush except she blushed for him for she had her own suspicions being zek however she offered nathan an out tzonov and others like him will use any method to obtain information make people tell them what they want to know torture isnt the only way dont feel that you cant talk on my account nathan but if youd like me to leave she made to stand up nathan reached out quickly and took her hand drawing her down again it wasnt like that he shook his head or maybe it was but it didnt work out that way lan goodly saw it coming and said nathan you dont have to tell us anything about that well just one thing did you actually steal the key to your cell or did she give it to you if she gave it to you then we can probably reckon that tzonov has sent her through the gate nathan nodded lowered his head she gave it to me tzonov found us together he struck me and dragged her out of there i found the key after she had gone also her clasp but the key wasnt a mistake she hadnt lost it im sure that she left it for me he looked up and his eyes were harder now likewise the edge to his voice you people ebranch on the one hand tzonov and his people on the other are like two rival szgany tribes but you are all people human or i thought you were what he has done if he has done it trask said it changes things doesnt it nathan nodded if its true yes finally i will know i mean ill be sure that im in the right camp on the right side trask nodded well you are but we still might have some difficulty proving it on the other hand there just might be a way to discover whats happened to siggi if thats the proof you need and if youre the man i think you are then its all up to you nathan looked at him up to me to find out what happened to siggi trask nodded the last time we had this problem with jazz simmons we asked your father to help us out he had the necessary skills he was the necroscope but in everything that youve told us so far theres an allimportant thing which you havent mentioned nathan when you spoke to me telepathically in my sleep in perchorsk i got the impression that you knew what harry keogh could do where all of his powers sprang from but theres only one way you could know and thats if you can do it too do you know what im talking about again their eyes met and after a long pause nathan nodded yes and i can do it i can talk to the great majority to the teeming dead in their graves rather i coujd do it if only they would talk back to me but they wont not in my world anyway seated around him the others sighed in unison and zek said i knew it your minds the same as harrys or it comes so close i could scarcely tell the difference not as cold as his no but the patterns are all the same trask nodded thats what i felt the first time i saw you nathan there was no doubt in my mind but that you were harrys son and that youd been modelled on him and when you spoke to me telepathically well while youre very much alive still i felt that this was what it must be like talking to someone who was dead goodly said nothing but merely gave a small shudder which trask sensed as a trembling in his elbow where the precog sat beside him glancing at goodly he said well and so it starts goodly answered looking more cadaverous than ever my god but its gathering now ben what is all of this why the future is shifting even now were not changing it for what will be will be but it knows and chung said the future is sentient when it comes to protecting itself yes goodly answered youd think so anyway you should never try to read it nathan shook his head and zek agreed with him for its a devious thing for a moment they were all silent until trask cleared his throat and said i know someone a dead someone who will speak to you nathan at least i think he will and after that maybe the rest of them will follow suit trask wasted no time but ordered up two branch cars and his party was driven at once to a crematorium a garden of repose in kensington it was a chilly evening and already dark when they got there but the gates were open this was a place which was never closed to mourners trask led the group to sir keenan gormleys tiny plot a granite slab two feet square and some nine inches high with a stainless steel plaque which carried his dates and an epitaph reading much loved and missed but gone now into a better place requiescat in pace his family trask explained if it had been the branch well it could be wed have done something different something esoteric in keeping with his life maybe this is for the best at least it doesnt attract attention at least he can rest in peace his ashes were scattered here but this is his place he is here this is where harry keogh spoke to him when the inscription was read out to him and the last line translated nathan shook his head they dont you know for theyre restless most of them they think remember talk a lot to each other but its a lonely place there in the dark and its certainly not a better one and they miss much more than theyre missed but as the last sentence fell from his lips so he reeled and trask caught his arm to steady him nathan for a moment he didnt answer because a gonging shout was still ringing in his mind harry and it had been so forceful so brimming with life that for a moment he looked to see whose mouth had issued it around him the espers stood silent astonished they had seen his jaw fall open the shocked expression on his face but in the next moment he knew and shook off trasks hand as he went to one knee in the gravel beside the granite slab and with his trembling hand resting upon the plaque using his deadspeak he said no not harry but nathan my name is nath its harry the other cut him off why id know you anywhere your warmth your voice your presence dont try to foo an old friend harry but tell me where youve been for so jong tell us what hes saying zeks real voice so urgent in nathans ear and her hand falling on his shoulder caused him to start she knew he was speaking to someone but it was deadspeak which was beyond her capabilities he thinks im he thinks that im my father not harry gormleys voice was filled with astonishment disappointment his son my god has it been that long didnt you know nathan spoke out loud which made little or no difference the presence of the necroscope was sufficient in itself the dead man his ashes heard nathans spoken words as clearly as his thoughts i mean about the passage of time have none of the others mentioned it possibly time is of little importance here without you or rather without harry its been of no importance whatsoever youve simply lain there nathan knew that the thyre were not idle in their graves so that this seemed to him a terrible waste but what about the things you did in life your interests in the corporeal world ahhh gormleys sigh but little use for such skills here you see i was a spotter i knew when i stood close to exceptionally talented people indeed i was the one who recruited your father harry keogh into ebranch there had been certain great injustices and only he could put things right i know nathan told him for they your people in the branch have told me and now there are more injustices and i have been recruited in my turn so their conversation went with trask and the others hearing only nathans side of it and making what they could of it but finally the introductions and brief histories were out of the way and at last gormley asked now tell me what can i do for you tell you your fathers story but i know so little of it im sure the new people could tell you much more than me oh i want to have harrys whole story from beginning to end eventually nathan nodded but right now there are more important things on my way here ben trask told me one or two things about you and he was right your talent alerted you to my presence and my likeness to my father fooled you into contacting me but would you have spoken to me if youd believed i was someone else not harry ah gormley answered after a moment and perhaps not and ill tell you why no let me tell you there are things which even the dead fear am i right and someone who talks to the great majority well he just might be one of those things do you understand me the one thing trask hadnt told nathan was how sir keenan gormley had died at the hands of just such a thing a necromancer called dragosani in the employ of the then ussrs own ebranch and one other thing nathan didnt know that harry keogh had used his necroscope powers to kill dragosani going on to pare the soviet organization down to the bone but now nathan felt gormleys unbodied shudder and knew that he understood only too well and i am the victim of just such a monster the dead man told him a necromancer who tore my corpse to pieces in order to get at my secrets and yes you are right these days the teeming dead are careful who they talk to which is my problem exactly nathan told him and sensed gormleys deadspeak gasp the dead wont speak to you nathans silence was his answer but have you tried in my own world time and time again ever since i was a child there it was the legacy and the fault of my necroscope father for in the end he was wamphyri and not to be trusted and so the szgany dead travellers gypsies my own kind would have nothing to do with me only the dead of the thyre nomads of the deserts would let me into their minds i benefited from it and so did they here in this world oh ive heard the dead whispering in their graves but youre the first who heard me and certainly youre the first who was willing to talk to me gormley was silent a moment then said theres nothing to fear in you you shine in the darkness the same as harry in his innocence and your presence is like a warm blanket over my grave you do have your fathers warmth or whatever it was he had for sometimes harry could be cold too very cold he snapped out of it so thats why youre here you require introductions there are others among the great majority who you would like to contact except you think theyll be wary of you and your purpose my father was the necroscope nathan answered which is to say he could talk to dead people and it appears they loved him but he had powers other than that ive been told that you were the key to the greatest of those powers gormley understood but now nathan sensed the shake of an incorporeal head no the key was already in place the part i played was to show it to him and it was a key nathan a key to many doors it was this nathan knew the symbol at once why he even wore it in his ear his exclamation his gasp of recognition was automatic my fathers sigil yes in a way harry keoghs emblem of power but what does it mean im no mathematician nathan gormley shrugged in his deadspeak fashion but i can try to tell you something about it it would appear to defy logic by reducing three dimensions to two and two to one dimensions the planes of existence in which we live it reduces all places to one place or makes nothing of the gap between and when harry used it it even reduced time down to now he could go wherever he wanted to go without covering the distance in between and as a bodiless wraith he even travelled in time the ultimate traveller nathan sighed and he smiled sadly he was szgany after all gormley chuckled if you want to put it that way you called it a key to many doors nathan was serious in a moment for now he recalled what thikkoul a dead thyre stargazer had said of his future as glimpsed in the stars through nathans living eyes i see doors like the doors on a hundred szgany caravans but liquid drawn on water formed of ripples and behind each one of them a piece of your future doors nathan said again as thikkoul faded into memory what did you mean again gormleys deadspeak shrug space and time of course there are doors but we cant see them harry could and pass through them you said i have what he had nathan was eager now well its true i do but not all that he had i want access to the mobius continuum i want to be able to use these doors who do i speak to why who better than mobius himself gormley answered for it was his what metaphysics his lateral thinking that brought the mobius strip into being in the first place and i do know this that your father was with mobius this brilliant longdead mathematician the first time he conjured one of his doors then ill go and try to speak to mobius except i may need an introduction it was nathans turn to shrug its the way of things pausing at last he remembered his other reason for being here oh and theres something else you can do for me that is if im not asking too much too much my one contact with the living breathing world and youre worried you might be asking too much ask away and nathan believe me when i tell you ill help you if can for youre not the only one with problems if we can solve yours then and only then you may be able to help me solve mine and not only mine but a problem facing all of the great majority but that would be to put the cart before the horse first the teeming dead must learn to trust you and speak to you so for now youd better tell me whats troubling you a woman has well it seems shes disappeared nathan told him shes very important not only to ebranch but also to me her name is siggi dam she was a member of the opposition last known location perchorsk in the ural mountains we cant be sure if shes dead or if something else has happened to her only the great majority would know for certain do you think you could ask after her find out if siggis joined the ranks of the teeming dead she was a telepath in life and if she is dead should be easy to contact a telepath but in that case wouldnt she have contacted you after all you are the necroscope still i need to be sure let me work on it said gormley and ill get back to you think of me now and again aim your thoughts in this direction and as soon as i have something his deadspeak began to fade into a background hiss of mental static and meanwhile you must work on your maths instinctive mathematician that your father was still he had a hard time of it so i cant see that it will be any easier for you the static took over completely but coming right through it not speaking to nathan directly but simply thinking her own most passionate thoughts most fervent desires out loud zek foeners telepathic voice nathan could talk to jazz tell him all the things which at the end i was too late to say he could actually talk to him standing up and turning to her he said one day i would be glad to if its what you want you can count on it before i go home to sunside she smiled her wan smile sighed and took his arm and arm in arm as they walked back down the windblown aisles of the garden of repose to the gates and through them to the parked cars trask goodly and chung followed on behind the men of ebranch wondered but said nothing this was a good place to be quiet and keep the peace but as trask got into the first of the cars with zek and nathan he was eager to ask the necroscope well and was i right i know you spoke to sir keenan but was it worth it yes nathan answered him and went on to reveal what had passed between them sir keenan said hed make inquiries for me and get back to me as soon as he has something get back to you if i open my mind to him and seek him out hell converse with me at a distance apparently thats not too hard not now that weve been introduced and meanwhile im to continue studying improving my maths which isnt the exciting thing i thought it would be nathan shrugged and pulled a wry face it seems that in harry numbers were instinctive but not in me on the contrary perhaps because i carry them with me always without knowing their meaning they weigh on me and tire me out were all tired trask nodded a good nights sleep is what we all need tomorrow youll go back to basic numbers in harrys case it was an instinctive art yes but even he required a final push before he made his quantum leap in his case it was do or die and so he did with you its not so urgent in three or four months well be ready to send you back through the romanian gate if we can do it and meanwhile youll be well protected my advice give all of your attention to your instructors and if keenan gormley comes up with a shortcut well that will be all the better the cars sped back to ebranch hq harrys room was now nathans room after eating with trask and zek at the hotel restaurant downstairs he retired there with his thoughts he had been aware through dinner of two men seated at a nearby table whose flinty eyes in blank expressionless faces would occasionally turn and stare in his direction trask seeing him looking at them had warned dont pay them too much attention theyre not ebranch not those two but special branch and theyre your minders his minders they were like chameleons everchanging he had met several but they came and went sometimes an ebranch agent would be with them other times theyd be on their own they guarded him against the vengeance of turkur tzonov but if tzonov really has sent siggi through the gate nathan thought where he sat in an easy chair beside his bed then hes the one who will need guarding from me it was his vow ah but where vows were concerned well hed made them before and so far theyd come to nothing outside in the corridor he heard soft padding footsteps his minders again the duty officer almost unwittingly he put out a telepathic probe and met with the mind of david chung chung stood right outside his door with his fist poised to knock come in nathan anticipated him chung entered shrugged im on duty i was just passing by really but you paused outside my door i thought it was one of my minders well in a way i am we all are nathan pulled a face im not sure i like being minded so well then he looked at chung more squarely where the other leaned back against the computer console and i think you were more than just passing by whats on your mind my talent is on my mind and this room and that earring of yours every now and then you touch it sort of thoughtfully like a moment ago as soon as i mentioned it we asked you about siggi dams clasp but not about that earring can you free it i mean would you mind if i held it for a moment and would you also mind telling me where you got it nathan freed the golden sigil from his ear and handed it over im surprised no one else has asked me about it he said but theres been so little time chung answered i think youll find theyve all assumed it came from your mother something harry might have given her nathan grunted and his look turned sour in a moment to my knowledge the only thing she got from my father was me and my brother nestor as soon as it was out he could have bitten his tongue hed wanted to leave nestor out of this though why he couldnt say nestor nathan waved a hand dismissively you can forget him nestor he died some years ago the wamphyri yes oh yes yes indeed wamphyri chung had been examining the golden earring holding it in his hands crushing it between his palms almost in an attitude of prayer now he gave it back nothing he said what did you expect nathan asked him its not of this world it was given me by maglore of runemanse in turgosheim chung shrugged it was an experiment you were wearing it when you came through the perchorsk gate i wondered if i could make a mindbridge to your vampire world thats all i should have known that i couldnt it was the same with jazz simmons when he went through the gate all contact was lost then he frowned so maglore gave it to you eh another sign of his affection actually its a strange story nathan answered for you see the loop with the halftwist is maglores sigil too hes something of a mage a mentalist as i told you and on the night the opposition sent their awesome weapon through the perchorsk gate he dreamed of the necroscopes mobius blazon from which time forward he took it for his own he paused a moment giving chung the chance to say blazon it surprises me you know that word why nathan raised an eyebrow its a szgany word many of our words are more or less the same and when chung made no answer he continued anyway my father died that night perhaps something went out from him in addition to the images which you saw here and the fragment that entered the computer maybe his sign had the power to impress itself into the minds of all manner of sensitive dreamers and mentalists such as maglore of runemanse but as for me id known it even as a babe in arms though that was probably coincidental when we were babies my mother had given my brother and me leather straps to wear on our wrists so that she could tell us apart in the night my strap had the mobius halftwist oh said chung smiling coincidence and your father was the necroscope harry keogh well perhaps his smile gradually faded as he watched nathan fixing the earring back in place then id better get back to my station he said but as he reached the door and opened it nathan chung glanced back at the other do me a favour will you if i can when you get back to sunside or even before you get back get rid of that earring maglore this wamphyri mentalist of yours he might have intended it as more than just a gift i mean you know what my talent is how it works i locate things people as often as not and it helps if i can lock onto something such as siggi dams clasp or an earring like the one in your ear nathan nodded he understood chungs warning you think maglore has the same sort of talent that he might have been using me to spy on sunside its just a hunch but yes again nathans nod as his thoughts flew back once more to his own world this time to a man called lozel kotys once in maglores employ and thanks he said til keep it in mind before the dawn while nathan dreamed sir keenan gormley got back to him siggi dam wasnt among the great majority and if she was no longer in this world there was only one other place she could be in his sleep nathan sweated tossed and turned ground his teeth his conversion to ebranch and his newfound friends was now complete but gormley had other news for him too and as nathans resolve hardened so his plans must be altered mobius was no longer in his grave in leipzig only his bones were there now the stillbrilliant mind had moved on gone elsewhere there were other worlds beyond it wasnt quite a dead end however hope hadnt blinked out in its entirety along with mobius there were other incorporeal minds to contact other mathematicians whose work in life had been just as enigmatic just as metaphysical gormley had a whole list of them maybe nathan should look some of them up instead except the old problem might still be there the dead continued to shun living persons who could speak to them it was the legacy of nathans father for he had opened the way for them taught them to seek each other out in their loneliness only to betray them in the end the betrayal had worked both ways it was true but in that respect the dead could be forgiven they didnt share the freedom of the living they were immobile they couldnt flee before the advance of a necromancer but must lie still and suffer his tortures they were terrified by the thought that such as dragosani and in the end harry keogh might return by the thought that indeed one such might already have returned in the shape of this man from another world for they knew that nathan was here and as yet they feared him and so as nathans resolve hardened more yet his sleeping form grew still and calm again calm resentful and cold perhaps even as cold as his necroscope father ill the nightmare zone in his early days with ebranch the daily twentyfour hour round of life itself was probably nathans greatest physical and mental distraction in his own world where around fifty sunsidestarside cycles were equal to an entire year earthtime a day was the equivalent of four to five of this worlds entire daynight cycles and yet the traveller physiology had clung to its preholocaust rhythms as developed through szgany evolution on the vampire world prior to the advent of the socalled white sun and the typical traveller would sleep as often as three times five or six hours a time during the course of one long sunside night here when it grew dark one slept and only one sleep which would normally only be broken to answer calls of nature or duty then woke up with the dawn as for the impossibly short days it seemed astonishing that these people had ever found time to achieve anything yet what they had achieved was itself amazing nathan could scarcely begin to consider the extent of their science without his mind reeling from the sheer scope of it in fact he was suffering a form of transdimensional jetlag where his body was desperately trying to adjust to timescales and differentials far beyond the experience of any sunside traveller since time immemorial but that wasnt the worst of it something else he must get used to was the foul weather the seasons on sunside had varied only marginally over fouryear periods when the climatic changes were so slow and slight as to be almost unnoticeable here in the socalled helllands however especially london in the winter the weather was hell not as bad as perchorsk and the lands around but bad enough by any standards at least in perchorsk the temperature had been more or less constant and the mountain ravines natural as opposed to the manmade canyons of the city nathan had never had a cold in his life until now his nostrils had never before clogged up until he breathed the fumes rising out of the underground stations the efficiency of his digestive system his bowels and the solid consistency of their contents had never been in question until he ate with ben trask at various chinese and indian restaurants all in all life was uncomfortable here it wasnt at all the world hed envisioned as a stuttering loner in settlement when all hed wanted was to escape into his own worlds of fantasy but at the same time it wasnt quite hell and when the drizzly dreary nights came down he didnt have to hide from monsters unless they were monsters out of his own past his own memory nathans most recent monster was turkur tzonov but at least he wasnt wamphyri separated from tzonov by many thousands of miles nathan couldnt hit at the man personally but he could do his best to damage his organization ruin his planned conquest of sunsidestarside if not in this world then certainly in his own but to do that and also to avenge if not save siggi dam he must first get back to his own world and take with him all the weapons he could muster nathans best weapon trask had assured him would be nathan himself but a nathan trusted by the teeming dead and one who commanded the metaphysical mobius continuum as his father before him with this in mind he applied himself yet more diligently to his studies specifically the elusive and seemingly meaningless science of mathematics and as the first ten days flew by his progress was such that he could be proud of it as his instructor explained to ben trask on the morning of the eleventh day he seems to have a natural talent for it an intuitive grasp of maths at first i couldnt be sure he was reluctant easily sidetracked but now well it could be youll soon have to replace me my knowledge goes only so far trask looked at the other across his desk james bryant was perhaps the perfect stereotype small and slender studious in grey slacks and dark polonecked pullover blinking owlishly behind thicklensed spectacles he just had to teach something or other preferably maths the minister responsible had pulled him in from one of the universities where his term of office had just run out but bryants mind wasnt onetrack it wasnt bound by his subject he had known from the start even without the official secrets act that ebranch was no ordinary government department and nathan no ordinary student and this morning for some reason or other he appeared to have reached the end of his tether just how far does your knowledge go trask asked him i mean weve scarcely had time to talk to each other let alone get to know one another i know you were at where oxford our minister wouldnt have recommended you for the job if you werent worth your salt bryant nodded do you know what maths is mr trask its definition roughly its the logical study of quantity or magnitude it uses rigorously defined concepts and selfconsistent symbols in such a way as to disclose the properties and relations of quantities and magnitudes within its own parameters it can be applied or abstract can make connections or remain purely theoretical do you follow trask nodded then shook his head im no mathematician mr bryant i follow you but i dont follow you if you follow me yes i know einsteins famous equation but thats not to say i understand it why dont you just tell me whats on your mind whats troubling you teaching nathan is whats troubling me because i cant teach him what he wants to know because maths wont cover it may i explain go ahead lets look at that definition of maths again the first word we come across is logical nathans application is hardly logical he wants to be able to conjure doors he believes that if he can frame or control a certain equation or series of equations then these doors will appear the physical out of the abstract taking a deep breath trask shook his head not the physical but the metaphysical certainly and surely metaphysical and abstract arent incompatible exactly said bryant except im not dealing with metaphysics though it strikes me that you are and remembering some of the things hed seen in this place during the past fortnight he glanced around the office but men cant think doors into existence mr trask or for that matter anything else trask wanted to say nathans father coujd but somehow managed to keep his peace men can think thoughts into existence he said without meaning to be clever but i take your point so do go on zek foener came to trasks office door looked inside and made to turn away trask called out to her zek its ok come in and to bryant please carry on this is interesting bryant looked at zek shrugged and said good morning i was just explaining to mr trask why i cant go on working with nathan she smiled and said id like to hear that any insight has to be better than none most have been favourable but all opinions count my opinion is that hes a nice lad bryant told her it isnt that i dont like him only that i cant work with him he turned back to trask back to the definition rigorously defined concepts and selfconsistent symbols mathematics doesnt mutate it grows certainly gets more complex the deeper we delve but even to a computer a plus is a plus and a minus is a minus nathan wants to bend maths if rules dont say what he wants them to say he bends them isnt that what rules are for zek frowned i mean didnt we once believe that the shortest distance between two points was a straight line and wasnt it maths that showed us we were wrong wasnt it maths that bent the line and threw us a curve and trask thought but here in ebranch we know that the shortest distance between two points is in act a mobius door and i personally have seen harry keogh disappear through just such a door while out loud he said is it such a bad thing that nathan is trying to create his own system with its own rules why shouldnt he look at numbers from all directions as zek said isnt that what rules are for anyway so that people who are clever enough can bend them not the rules of mathematics no bryant disagreed and quickly went on look lets get to the point the deeper i go with nathan the less certain i am of my ground soon i wont know if hes playing fair with me or if hes well bending the rules if he is he wont learn anything not from me anyway so theres little point in my trying to teach him then maybe you should try learning from him is that what youre trying to say that hes outstripping you bryant shook his head his frustration beginning to show im not jealous of him not yet anyway maybe we should get another instructor then someone who knows it all no one knows it all mr trask it just gets more complex thats all my suggestion from now on let him do his own thing without outside help or hindrance that way as soon as he discovers that numbers simply are that they dont govern anything except themselves hell stop fooling with them then with his well i can only call it intuition hell probably go on to make a very capable mathematician trask took a chance you know of course that we want him to find his doors i guessed as much yes bryant answered also that you are dealing with some pretty weird stuff around here metaphysics you as good as admitted it just a moment ago there was a mildly scornful something in his tone that trask despite that he was sympathetic didnt much care for and pick a number trask said any number between one and a million a trick a demonstration bryant sighed and said i have it and trask glanced at zek the merest glance but she knew what he wanted and smiling she said all the nines bryant frowned said how i bent the rules she told him the ones that guarantee the privacy of your own mind im a telepath which is only one of the rules that get bent around here bryant looked at her and at trask ebranch espbranch in one trask told him and another demonstration tell me something about yourself anything at all out of your past but among all the true things you tell me make sure you stick at least one lie in there what bryant looked mystified do it bryant shrugged and said i was born at about two in the morning on the nd december in a lie trask cut in you werent born in the other blinked his eyes rapidly and zek told him ben is a human lie detector you cant lie to him anything false he sees hears smells tastes and eels it right away we all have our talents mr bryant nathan too except his is buried deep inside we had hoped you could help us dig it out thats all lan goodlys gaunt frame loomed in the open door he must have heard something of the conversation for now he entered and said mr bryant is right he cant help nathans maths has achieved such a level that he can now be left to develop on his own mr bryant will be out of here by this afternoon and anyway nathan has work to do its coming ben its nz time a week at most and well be dealing with that again only trask knew what he meant zek hadnt been here long enough and as yet bryant wasnt entirely convinced that this place was part of the real world but nz was their code for the nightmare zone which was a place right here in london the small hairs on the back of trasks neck were suddenly erect despite the comfortable temperature of the airconditioned room he visibly shuddered as his gaze transferred from bryant to goodly and he asked youve seen it coming yes goodly was like a ghost standing there features painted on his skull and his eyes sunk deep in their sockets his voice a highpitched nervous warble when within a week i didnt try to narrow it down but its going to be bad it almost scared the shit out of me it wasnt usual for lan goodly to use that sort of term so that trask knew that he had more on his hands than any problem presented by bryants quitting in any case the precog had foreseen that so it was going to happen and so mr bryant youre out of it trask told him and you may believe me youre better off for it you can do whatever is necessary to finish up your work here you will be paid for the full term of your contract of course but i would remind you youre sworn to secrecy always bryant nodded said er goodbye then and when he was out of the office a meeting trask was back in action the way he liked it ten minutes he rasped the ops room whoever you can muster from those in the building oh and nathan of course for this time there was no question about it this time they were going to need the necroscope those gathered in the ops room were frank robinson a spotter paul garvey a fullblown telepath ben trask zek foener lan goodly nathan and the empath geoff smart who was just back from a stint in glasgows barlinnie prison and a study of its psychopaths this had been a ministry of health job a feasibility study in treatment and rehabilitation but something less than healthy for smart after three months of close contact with the worst inmates of barlinnie smart looked as if he could use some help himself if i draw nz hed whispered to goodly where they gathered in the ops room it will be peaceful by comparison but in actual fact the mere thought of the nightmare zone made the flesh of each and every one of them crawl with the exception of the duty officer all of the above the entire onduty staff of ebranch hq excluding nathans minders who werent espers were present as trask took the podium and leaning on the lectern he told them lan goodly has forecast trouble in the nightmare zone within the week he says its going to be bad now some of you have done this duty before and others have been lucky the same goes for a couple of agents who arent here right now out on field duty or resting at home but when its nz time all the names go into the hat in fact it wasnt a hat but a deck of cards trask took the deck out from under the lecterns lid and shuffled it in full view of the assembled agents telling them anyone who already did the job more than once can cry off no one will blame him or her anyone else who doesnt fancy it can speak up now and well try not to blame him he looked from face to face but no one so much as twitched zek trask went on youre sort of honorary here and so you dont have a card nathan youre in on this job like it or not ill explain in a little while and then youll understand why everyone is so quiet so that leaves three to choose who has the tally sheet lan goodly said i have it the sheet matched up names to cards the first three names out of the deck were it trask stopped shuffling and turned up the top card three of hearts he said goodly shook his head seven of diamonds the same reaction from goodly jack of clubs ah it was trasks card he had only done the job once before and anyway he wouldnt have wanted to shirk his duty thats me ok two to go he went back to turning cards and the next one up was the queen of hearts it drew a blank and ace of clubs thats me paul garvey wore an emotionless expression always with his remodelled face the nerves not quite matching smiles and frowns alike came out as grotesque grimaces trask drew two more blanks and then the four of spades thats anna marie english goodly said but i know for a fact that shes already done it twice trask looked again at the faces of his espers im sending anna marie out to romania and soon to take charge of the refuge so i vote we draw again no one objected and seven cards later the ace of hearts brought a small groan from geoff smart trask looked at goodly who nodded its smart he said and to smart himself how many times have you done it geoff just the once smart answered which is three times as often as i wanted to smart was fiveten blockily built redhaired and crewcut he looked like a pugilist but in fact was mildmannered what he lacked in looks was made up for by what trask called his withness his empathy an intense ability to relate he didnt just feel for a person but became him experienced his emotions pains passions it was something he could switch on and off like a light which was as well there were minds in barlinnie no one would want to relate to for too long well thats the four of us he now said and the offduties dont even know how lucky theyve been i suppose were confined to this place until a hunchman says its time right from the podium trask nodded you me paul and nathan were it and when we get the signal from either lan goodly or guy teale hopefully with just a little time to play with then we enter the nightmare zone teale will have to be called in if hes not already on his way and lan youll need to be on hand as the time narrows down i want as much warning as possible and as goodly opened his mouth to make his usual comment yes i know the future isnt reliable but it is your precinct so work on it and now for the first time nathan spoke up just what is this nightmare zone and why do you all fear it trask took a deep breath said this is for you and zek for you because youll be in it and for zek because she has no experience of it but occasionally something happens that stops even people like us something so weird so extraordinary as to defy all explanations so really i dont have any explanation for it except that it happens thats what ebranch has been about right from the start the inexplicable the outre the macabre in the beginning we were mindspies we still are to an extent and possibly more so in the immediate future but in between weve sidetracked into all sorts of fields all sorts of minefields too gadgets and ghosts thats us and always has been but sometimes our ghosts do more than just rattle chains nathan youre the necroscope so maybe it wont be so hard for you to understand or believe zek you know some of the things weve had to deal with in the past its possible youd accept this too without letting it get to you mercifully youre not involved as for the people who have had to deal with it afterwards when its all over they really do nightmare maybe thats why we call it the nightmare zone and now ill tell you how it started john scofield was one of our agents he was the son of a psychic medium just like harry keogh and john radiated his esp like a lighthouse beacon on a dark night our spotters could feel him coming a mile away he had that much power well we thought maybe we had a necroscope here but we were wrong the power we felt in him wasnt what supernatural i suppose thats what most people would call messages from beyond the grave no his real talent was more properly parapsychological in fact he was telekinetic a mover not a nice mover but someone who could shift things with his mind think about that maybe eventually hed be able to shift himself do teleportation with his mind like harry with his mobius doors as for johns deadspeak i still believe it was in him but i dont think it would ever have amounted to very much not while he was alive anyway we had him for a year and put a lot into him hoping that eventually wed get a lot out we didnt take our work lightly on the contrary we knew what an awesome weapon we would have if it all worked out whats more we knew that old adage about absolute power but more about his deadspeak john believed that the dead talked to him usually in his sleep now we know from the keogh files that this is possible in the case of a necroscope and nathan has affirmed that its so but when we put our best espers on johns case they came up with nothing or at best the very faintest echoes his talents were less than obvious when he was asleep and we had to ask ourselves is his deadspeak real or is he simply dreaming fantasizing remember his mother had been a psychic medium a fake it would appear but she had thought she was real was her sons delusion if thats what it was something which had come down to him from her or did he have deadspeak but in an as yet undeveloped form which would grow with time now the other side of him his telekinesis john was one of the luckiest men alive within certain parameters and here im talking about londons casinos when it came down to dice or roulette wheels let it suffice to say that he got himself banned from most of the casinos by the time he was twentyone years old and he was lucky with the onearmed bandits too enough that he made a living from his gambling but an honest days work john scofield never did one in his life im not moralizing just stating a fact john didnt get it right every time but when he was on form it was devastating ive seen him roll ten pairs of sixes in a row just for practice and ive watched the little white ball drop into fifteen consecutive red slots before his concentration failed him perhaps the best trick he ever performed for me was to move a sheet of paper across a desk or to close a door slowly quietly just by looking at it but all these examples were mainly harmless things while he was alive i know i keep saying that but youll see why in a little while so he came to us we spotted and recruited him three years ago this coming april and we had him for a year until it happened john had a wife and child hed married his sweetheart at nineteen and had a little boy eight years old i met his family on several occasions and lynn was stunning the kid too was a jewel of a boy and i never knew a man more in love with his wife than john scofield they lived in north london the highbury area one morning after a stint as duty officer john went home and found the house broken into his wife and child dead it looked like the kid had tried to protect his mother and someone had kicked his head in as for lynn shed been stripped tortured raped and after a lot of suffering her killer had choked her with her own underclothes which hed stuffed with a madmans strength down her throat and of course john came to us for help not immediately for there was help other than ours which he needed first the psychiatric sort no question about it he was out of his mind for oh a long time six months at least but eventually he got it together again or so we thought and then he came to us along with some cash lynns jewellery had been taken a few good pieces had been stolen and some lesser stuff but the thiefs mistake was that he left any of it behind it had all belonged to lynn and even the lesser or worthless pieces carried her aura we gave some of it to david chung which was akin to putting a piece of soiled clothing under the nose of a bloodhound when chung came up with a location we checked it out and ended up with the name of a fence with a track record as long as your arm after that our part of the job was complete and we handed the case over to the police gave it to them on a plate but what we didnt know was that wed also given it to john on a plate we had thought hed straightened out but he hadnt he wanted the murderer of his wife and child john wanted him personally it was a close run thing the police grilled the fence wed given them he still had items of lynns jewellery and finally coughed when they went to pick up the perp from his place in finsbury park john was right behind them he followed them to a police station in the same area and was immediately behind them when they took their man in for questioning the perp was as nasty a piece of work as you could wish to find on the streets of london or any other place for that matter his name was tod prentiss and he had lots of previous convictions armed robbery gbh burglary a rape on a young kid that hed so far got away with also the police had found a couple of pieces of lynns junk jewellery in his flat inside the police station john saw the evidence knew that this was his man and cracked hed taken a cutthroat razor with him and went for prentiss to kill him the desk officer had a gun he made to produce it but prentiss beat him to it started shooting he wounded two officers who got between him and scofield before a plainclothes man with a handgun of his own came on the scene in the shootout that followed prentiss was hit in the heart and died on the spot and if john scofiejd had been a little bit crazy before now he really went over the top god only knows what was in his mind at that moment but we all know whats been in it ever since and whats in it right now because that was when he took his cutthroat razor and put it to his own throat and sliced as deep as he could go without actually sawing his own head off why did he do it well weve thought about that you see whether we believed in john or not in his deadspeak i mean he believed in it just like his mother had believed before him also hed read the keogh files and knew there are worlds beyond now thats a concept which its still very hard for us to accept despite that we knew harry and now have his son right here in our midst it still feels very strange to us that death isnt the end that whatever a man was and did in life he continues to be and do in his afterlife the reason its hard for us is that were still very much alive who knows maybe the closer we get to it the more well be willing to believe but as i said john scofield did believe in fact john knew that tod prentiss had got off too lightly too quickly and easily and that his evil incorporeal mind was still thinking its evil incorporeal thoughts among all the generally clean thoughts of the great majority he knew that prentiss would be thinking of the girls hed raped and one in particular who hed murdered getting his mental rocks off on thoughts of lynns sweet body before he soiled it and stilled the air in its lungs and the blood in its veins but worse than all that john knew that lynn was there she was there in prentisss dead world where even now the evil bastard might be whispering to her in the endless night of the tomb telling her how good it had been for him and reminding her of the hell hed put her through and thats why john had cracked for while tod prentiss had been put beyond johns reach in this world he was still very much alive and perhaps even available in the next and what was there left for john here not even revenge not now but down among the teeming dead his cutthroat razor had been johns visa into a world where he would continue to pursue what hed pursued here in this world he had practised his deadspeak perhaps with some small measure of success weve no way of knowing now but hed also used telekinesis maybe that too would have its incorporeal uses the ability to move things with the power of the mind alone and since mind would be all john had left there would be nothing to distract him from his main pursuit that of a man called tod prentiss at the rear of the police station where the final act in this drama or what ought to have been the final act had taken place stood a morgue in fact the morgue joined the police station to an old brickbuilt victorian hospital and served both institutions or facilities equally well as the mess got sorted out both scofields and prentisss bodies were put in cold storage there and by that simple act the placing in close proximity of these two dead bodies the police brought into being the nightmare zone that night the duties consisted of a desk sergeant and his radio op assistant a twoman standby patrol and a car on prowler duty it wasnt one of the big stations some old downandout a drunk with nowhere better to go was snoring in one corner of the inquiries room all in all it was quiet and not a lot was happening nothing odd about that for after all it was a wintry wednesday night and the streets were empty all admin attended to the sergeant joined his standby crew in a threehanded game of cards behind the desk and the time crept round to midnight which was when things began to happen first of all it grew cold that was hard to understand despite that it was bitter outside the station was centrally heated and the heating turned up full but the cold came seeping from the rear of the station out of the wide tiled celllined corridor that led like a tunnel to the morgue back there was a door to that silent grisly place and on the other side of the morgue another door to the basement of the hospital of course at this time of night both doors were locked and they would stay locked until the morning unless there should be business to attend to in the interim well it was possible that something had gone wrong with the refrigeration units which might have started to leak their frozen air into the corridor but before the desk sergeant and standby crew could investigate they saw their first real signs that something was very very wrong and not only with the morgues refrigeration and they began to hear the sounds the signs came first the walls of the place seemed to vibrate like a fleet of articulated trucks had gone by causing wanted posters and other notices to come loose and flutter to the floor documents on the desk danced in their trays and the cards on the small folding table shuffled themselves this way and that across the green baize venetian blinds at the windows went jerkily up and down up and down like some idiot was playing with the cords and couldnt get it right so maybe it was an earthquake yes and maybe the faint dull grunting the moaning howjing and crashing that was coming from behind the locked doors of that morgue was only the wind in the old brick chimneys or the agonized echoing cries of incurable patients in the old hospital finding their way down here from above but it all added up to too many maybes and finally the sergeant took the keys and went to investigate on his own now ive read the reports over and over again so that im pretty sure i know what broke the sergeants nerve put him in mental care finally got him discharged from the force the reports speak of hooliganism vandalism and ghoulish activity but the standby crew only saw what was left after the sounds from the morgue had reached a crescendo and stopped and after the sergeants weak shrill girlish little titters had started then theyd walked slowly and carefully down the tiled tunnel between the empty cells and through the open door to find him stumbling about among all the debris drooling like an infant pointing to the mess in the morgue and muttering over and over again what amounted to a confession of madness and all around him chaos most of the refrigerated drawers were open their contents lying spilled on the cold tiled floor in grotesque attitudes of disarray it was as if some lunatic had been looking for someone a dead someone and in his frenzied searching had ripped open the rows of temporary coffins tumbling the bodies out onto the floor but those bodies their positions there were eight of them all told and six of the eight were where youd expect to find them in those circumstances close to the drawers which theyd occupied but the other two werent where youd expect to find them and their coffins werent in any condition youd expect to find them in for it was john scofield who had kicked open the bottom of his drawer slithered out and gone on the rampage in the morgue and it had been tod prentiss he was looking for still looking for even in death whats more prentiss had known he was coming for his drawer had been forced from the inside and the lid almost torn from its hinges as the dead rapist and murderer had tried to get away from his pursuer and their bodies they were discovered well away from the other six in a corner lined with toppled filing cabinets where finally john had trapped his prey there they lay frozen again in the paralysis of death one with his throat sliced open and the other with a hole through his heart and scofields cold hands wrapped around prentisss throat as if to choke the life out of him and the desk sergeant well obviously hed walked right into it hed actually seen these two corpses what fighting each other well whatever name youd give to their zombie struggle hed seen it and known what he was looking at and couldnt accept it even here in ebranch knowing what we know having seen what weve seen it would be hard enough and as if all of this wasnt bad enough in itself then there were the looks on their faces john with his lips drawn back in a snarl cording the ligaments of his neck and prentiss with his tongue lolling eyes bulging scared to death of the madman who was killing him a second time the same man who couldnt lie still but would return to kill him again and again presumably forever or at least until we can discover a way to bring peace again to that dreadful place that place we call the nightmare zone iv to soothe the dead looking down at the drawn fascinated faces of his espers ben trask stood up straighter straightened his shoulders towards the end of his story his eyes had seemed glazed almost vacant now they focused again and he coughed clearing his throat before continuing almost done he said these things ive been talking about happened some two years ago just the way ive told them to you when ebranch agent john scofield took his revenge from beyond the grave but as i also told you or hinted he hasnt let it go at that but keeps right on taking his revenge which gets worse all the time six times now hes been back and each manifestation has been worse than the one before the police station has gone or rather its just an old dilapidated shell of a place now its area of responsibility absorbed into the larger police hq at new finsbury park the morgues no longer a morgue just a damp and disused basement even the hospital has closed down eaten up in the green health plan and moved out into the countryside but these places didnt just close down they had to close down because as john scofield practises his telekinesis in the next world so he gets better at it and the nightmare zone gets bigger thats how it all works out you see deadspeak or whatever power it is that johns got on the other side plus his telekinesis and a dash of sheer incorporeal malice or revenge if you want to call it that equals bad dreams poltergeist activity fear and loathing and a hell of a lot of dirty work for us on this side and the thing is john probably doesnt even know hes doing it oh he knows hes doing it to prentiss but he cant possibly know what effect its having here in the world of the living you see he wasnt like that john wouldnt be giving us all this trouble if he knew except he cant know because living people cant talk to the dead trask paused and looked straight at nathan or maybe we can now we damn well have to try anyway after another long pause zek spoke up you havent told us whats been happening she said i mean how is the nightmare zone getting bigger trask nodded tiredly and seemed to slump down into himself once more at first it was local he said that first time it only affected the police station and the morgue but since then its been spreading four months later it was halfway up the seven sisters road moving down towards highbury and into stroud green another four months and it reached crouch hill moved over into newington encroached upon stamford hill last time it was as far out as islington upper clapton and hornsey at the rate its growing its only a matter of time before the whole of inner london falls inside its perimeter can you imagine that all london the heart of the nightmare zone as for what happens what john scofields talents cause to happen that has to be seen to be believed inanimate objects move of their own volition graveyards send out foulsmelling fogs in the middle of summer pet dogs set up a frenzy of howling for no apparent reason fires start by what appears to be spontaneous combustion and go out again just as mysteriously street lights dim and only come up again when its over rats pour out of the sewers and roaches desert infested houses in their droves dead things i mean people or the leftovers of people zombies corpses cadavers are seen moving walking crumbling in the weirdest places private gardens behind the plateglass windows of locked stores along disused railway lines and in underground stations even time is affected there are inexplicable distortions events which should take hours are contracted down into minutes while others of short duration extend themselves apparently indefinitely and these are just a few of the socalled poltergeist activities but the morning after never a sign that anything is out of place and everything back in working order except that for the people who saw felt dreamed or experienced something anything of it nothing will ever again be quite the same for them and theyre all mortally afraid the dreamers are the ones who suffer most dreamers this was nathan again dreamers yes trask nodded it happens at midnight when most of the city is asleep but there are dreamers and there are dreamers nathan sensitive people know when its coming and not just inside the nightmare zone psychics the world over are wont to nightmare when john scofield goes on the rampage tracking down and killing tod prentiss again and again and again a thousand men women and children have dreamed it john scofield after his prey with a razor an axe or a blowlamp or tod prentiss with his face burned off or with his belly slit open and his entrails uncoiling or with his eyes dislodged and flopping on his cheeks john snarling his loathing while prentiss screams and runs and tries to protect himself uselessly it all takes place in the very heart of the nightmare zone of course but its psychic echoes are spreading and its physical manifestations are getting stronger all the time zek was bewildered and no one has wondered about it i mean among the ordinary population oh yes trask told her psychiatrists the governors of mental institutions the police who get called out to so many bogus sightings all sorts of people they all wonder about it but theyve no answer to it for they dont know the cause only we know that for were the people who have to contain it were the ones who have to fight it except were losing the fight how do you fight it nathan was curious where where else trask looked at him down there in that old basement behind what used to be a cop shop in old finsbury park dead centre of the nightmare zone they died there those two and thats where john scofield continues to chase his prey back into this world once in a fourmonth so that he can kill him all over again and you want me to help youre the only one who can but so far keenan gormley is the only one who will speak to me so use him tell him what youre doing ask for his help keep up the pressure you know nathan your father used to say that the dead know just about everything there is to know make friends with the great majority and you can consider any other problem at least halfway solved and if john scofield simply wont talk to me trask got down from the podium approached nathan and put a hand on his shoulder well if you cant make him listen to your deadspeak beforehand then it will just have to be on the night the night when you meet john face to face and put yourself in his way when he goes after tod prentiss to rekill him and risk your very sanity trying to keep the two of them apart down there in the nightmare zone and nathans voice was unaccustomedly hoarse as he asked when will that be but trasks was hoarser as he answered as of now were not sure but itll be soon son too damn soon by far for the next two days geoff smart was nathans constant companion trask would have preferred to put aside his administrative work entirely and devote all his time to nathan but there were important matters which must be dealt with arising out of what nathan had told ebranch about turkur tzonov and what the head of branch had seen with his own eyes in perchorsk that was why smart was temporarily standing in for trask as nathans mentor to give his boss time to attend to such items as had come up for fifteen years now britain france germany the usa and half a dozen other interested countries had had influential men call them advisers in the variously titled united soviet states the free soviet alignment or simply the ussr as some world authorities still insisted on designating their tired old enemy these men were not engaged in espionage as such but did keep their eyes on things in a country as vast and sprawling and still as volatile as the no longer entirely united uss the wests vastly superior communication systems famine relief organizations nuclear proliferation and pollution control elements and a witchs dozen of other aid programmes ensured that the presence of such men was appreciated certainly by those people in charge premier gustav turchin was one such authority despite the devolution of almost all of the countries and ethnic territories within the old borders turchin was a central pivot even a father figure whose principal purpose was to keep his many squabbling children in order and so prevent the collapse of his great ungovernable estate into further chaos and since many of these awkward children were nuclear powers in their own right his was a very important position but premier hardly that not in the sense of khrushchev brezhnev andropov gorbachev and others before and since them they had been premiers and up to gorbachevs time at least had been allpowerful from their seats in moscows kremlin turchin wasnt in the same league his power was that vested in him by the people of many neighbouring but separate states covering a vast tract of land which was formerly the soviet union and it could be removed from him just as easily turchin was literally the popular choice wherefore he must try to make popular decisions on behalf of all of these frequently opposed states or find himself out of a job in a way he might even be seen as the easts answer to the secretary general of the united nations except the nations turchin spoke for were weak and mainly divided by poverty petty jealousies and old feuds while the west was stronger than ever before in short the premier could and must advise if only to avoid chaos and anarchy but he could never command on the other hand he did have power of a sort for while his people could be rid of him if and whenever they so desired they still had need of a representative on the world stage and gustav turchin made an imposing figurehead he had the charisma of a world leader if not the financial or physical energy and while his own people might occasionally threaten his socalled position of power no threat of theirs could ever carry the weight of his to simply quit and because he was mainly responsible for his nations cohesion and security he did have a measure of control over certain elements left over from former times for instance a much impoverished kgb and the opposition of course moscows own espagency the soviet equivalent of ebranch this made him turkur tzonovs direct superior and who better for the west to talk to about tzonovs indiscretions the minister responsible for ebranch had been given a full briefing by trask and had passed on the salient points of that briefing to a british representative in moscow an economic adviser who had the ear of premier gustav turchin thereafter there had been much toing and froing by trask and the minister responsible between ebranch hq and whitehall and the ministers scrambler telephone had been hot with messages sent down it to moscow the salient points had been these that turkur tzonov had built up a small arsenal of weapons in the subterranean complex known as perchorsk under the urals that we the west had reason to believe that tzonov might be planning a limited invasion of the parallel world of vampires known to lie beyond the perchorsk gate that it was possible he would use the spoils of such an invasion to further his own causes whatever they might be that tzonov had illegal control of a sophisticated machine whose like had been banned for sixty years since world war ii when the nazis had been known to be interested in just such a device a brainwashing machine which could empty its victims of all knowledge and intelligence and in fact reduce them to vegetables and then to corpses that tzonov had planned to use this forbidden machine on a man who had come through the gate from the other side in order to obtain advance knowledge of his intended conquests and that he had only been thwarted by the escape of the alleged alien that this refugee not only from a cruel world but also from turkur tzonovs cruelties had flown to the west and provided british ebranch with much of the above information and last but not least that one siggi dam a telepath in tzonovs employ who might have been partly responsible for the escape of the alien from perchorsk seemed now to have disappeared off the face of the earth it was quite possible that tzonov had taken his own punitive measures against her and disposed of her in such a way that she could never trouble him again not in this world anyway these items in brief plus a reminder that it was gustav turchin himself who had requested the branchs assistance at perchorsk comprised the contents of the coded scrambled messages which had gone out to our man in moscow and from him to the premier during several private meetings since the preparation of these messages had been left to trask hed had more than enough to keep him busy and on his toes but in the early afternoon of the third day following goodlys nz warning as the secure channels to moscow cooled a little and trask waited on the results of his reporting geoff smart came knocking on his office door to talk about nathan hows it going with him trask wanted to know the empath shrugged then said nathans a difficult one to read no thats an understatement at first he was impossible i got a sort of whirlpool or maybe a tornado and yet it wasnt emotional in fact it covered his emotions and obscured them and probably his thoughts too the numbers vortex trask nodded we know about that its the stuff thats in him which we want to draw out youre right it covers his thoughts like a blanket blocks out telepathic probes were fairly certain its something come down to him from his father and weve been looking for ways to improve upon it then youre probably wasting your time smart told him come again trask couldnt tell if it was good news or bad once he got used to me accepted me saw that i wasnt a telepath or voyeur in the common sense of the word his shield went down then i really did get to him and i have to tell you that boy has emotions passions fears angers hatreds the full spectrum but intense if hes typical of his world it must be one hell of a place you havent read up on sunsidestarside trasks voice was sharpedged his orders had been very clear i have yes but it still reads like fiction thats what im trying to tell you that nathan has brought it all home to me its real now only a real place could do that to someone hes a mess so would you be if youd been through all that hes been through trask answered what else and what makes you think were wasting our time because youre looking to enlarge him give him something expose something youre trying to widen his potential but his nature aura everything about him is already mature hes at his peak oh you can teach him he can still learn things but from now on thats cosmetic i mean hes already equipped he has everything he needs thats the feeling i get that hes like a baby whos about to become a toddler one day he stands up takes a first wobbly tentative step and walks and before you know it hes climbing trees nathans a newly hatched moorhen at the edge of its nest over the water the hen only needs to give her chick a push and he swims do you follow me i mean i know what im talking about because im an empath but i cant be sure imgetting through to you i do know what you mean yes trask answered there was a time when all his father needed was a push too what youre saying is hes got the machinery but he hasnt plugged it in yet when i stand beside him smart said its like standing between a couple of giant electrodes i mean its frightening i think jesus thank god the powers off why hes like some kind of small nightmare zone in his own right and trask saw him give a small involuntary shiver but his words were like an invocation for a moment later lan goodly and guy teale were shoulder to shoulder at the door just glancing at their faces trask knew what it was he indicated that they should enter and said tonight the cadaverous goodly nodded and said has to be ben we can feel it building even now john scofield has refuelled his batteries and is about to give it hell or give you hell as it works out and i hate to say it but better you than me the sooner they got to it the better then as the thing began to build through the afternoon and evening they would feel it and know its strength driving out to old finsbury park trask suggested to paul garvey their driver it mightnt be a bad idea to stop somewhere and eat do you really feel like eating garvey glanced at him in the front passenger seat no but what with getting our act together and all that we seem to have missed lunch a couple more hours well miss dinner too i for one dont fancy doing this on an empty stomach by tonight well really be hungry now that would be the wrong time to eat from the back of the car perhaps naively nathan spoke up im hungry now he said which settled matters they stopped for half an hour at a greasy spoon where their alien enjoyed sausage bacon eggs and a mug of tea just as hed had for breakfast indeed the standard english breakfast seemed to suit nathan so well it might have been devised specifically with him in mind the rest of them had sandwiches and coffee as they got back into the car nathan told them his immediate intention and as he settled in a corner of the rear seat and closed his eyes they kept their conversation to a minimum he was talking to the ashes of sir keenan gormley in his garden of repose a good many miles away to find out if the great majority knew about john scofield and the nightmare zone and to discover whether gormley could suggest some possible solution and as the esper team drew up in their vehicle outside the rundown police station in a wide windblown street where yesterdays newspapers flapped like ghosts and the bleary windows of halfempty shop fronts gazed out on a chilly afternoon nathan already had his answer yes the teeming dead knew about john scofield indeed he was the problem sir keenan had mentioned when first nathan went to see him and no there was no solution not that gormley could suggest anyway perhaps not surprisingly the place beyond death which was in fact no place just a void or at best an echo chamber for the voices of the incorporeal was usually quiet and melancholy people who expired and joined the great majority they took time to settle in but in the end their frustrations and anxieties dwindled and disappeared by which time they were ready to take their places in the beyond and usually that place was quiet but it could be unquiet too like now murder victims people who lost their lives needlessly hideously and often at the whim of psychopathic monsters who would go on unpunished in the world of the living or at best imprisoned but still alive while their victims had been robbed of that happy estate they took longer to accept their fate and sometimes they never would accept it lynn scofield and her son andrew fell within the latter category lynn had been used monstrously her home and body broken into both violated and the latter destroyed she had died with her throat stuffed with her own underwear but not before shed seen her sons head collapse under the assault of a maniacs booted feet as for andrew he had seen his mothers rape and had been knocked aside almost unconscious as prentiss took her first as a man then as a beast and finally into her choking convulsing throat and when the battered boy had crawled to lynn yet again in a vain attempt to fight this mad beast off then prentiss had finished the job and kicked him to death well and nathan had said that the dead were often restless so they were but in lynn and andrew scofields case it went far beyond that these two could scarcely be said to be resting in peace far from it in those long terrible last minutes before they died theyd been filled with a frenzy of fear furious but impotent and driven into a state of abject terror and they still were inconsolable mad with shock and completely unable to accept what had happened to them this descent into a vast unfeeling darkness the great majority could not comfort them nor even get close enough to try they had shut themselves out no they had locked themselves in into the security of their own minds mother and son together which had seemed to them the only safe place to be until john came home and put everything right again but as for john scofield himself he couldnt come home couldnt join them in their limbo not until tod prentiss was brought to justice except john was unable to find a punishment to fit the crime there was nothing cruel enough no measure he could take to even the score which was why he pursued prentiss beyond death itself and would continue to do so for as long as his incorporeal telekinetic powers would let him powers which in his case were not diminished but continued to grow and oh yes the teeming dead knew all about john scofield and about tod prentiss the former who they couldnt reach for his passion made him deaf to all their deadspeak pleas for sanity and the latter who begged their mercy their forgiveness their protection for if the nightmare zone was a menace in the world of the living it was no less problematic in that place beyond life where the minds of the dead lived on they too felt the buildup of metaphysical pressures as each fourmonth cycle approached its climax and they knew the disruption which the release of john scofields mental energy would bring to them on their own level the static blocking their deadspeak the agony of johns psychosis which each and every one of them felt as scofield drove his incorporeal mind to the limits of its potential even the possibility that in his madness he might disrupt the aether of death itself and in so doing destroy the very element of their communication which was everything that they possessed if you couid only get through to him sir keenan gormley had told nathan across many deadspeak miles where the necroscope had huddled in the back of a car speeding him into the heart of the nightmare zone if you could only speak to him then perhaps you could make him understand the danger in what hes doing there have always been ghosts nathan pitiful creatures who retain too much of the living world and forever try to return to it and never settle into this place at all but they are nothing compared to john scofield he is trying to return to your side permanently and take tod prentiss with him for his own maniacal purposes now much as we dislike it there is a balance between life and death and its a balance that john could disturb forever to which nathan had answered one man one dead man with so much power and he had sensed gormleys patient deadspeak nod as he argued but wasnt your father ust such a man a determined man with metaphysical talents and harrys talents were also exponential nathan he went from strength to strength right up to the moment when when he died for the first time there was a certain sadness in nathans deadspeak voice as he mentioned his necroscope fathers death yes gormley sighed even from another dimension something of his unthinkable pain reached out to us and found us here his pain and that of his son who died with him in your parallel world of vampires and his son nathan had thought to himself harry keoghs son but by another woman the dweller my changeling brother but gormley had continued and so you see in some men if their will is strong enough the possibilities are endless likewise the damage they can inflict just think of it before your father and the dweller died they woke the dead in perchorsk to do their bidding and put an end to any further agonies even here we heard the dweller crying out for help and knew how we had betrayed his father and yet apparently it is a lesson that the great majority still havent learned for even now they deny you here he had paused only to continue in the next moment i mention this only to illustrate what may be achieved by strong men even in death and who is as strong as a madman eh well this john scofield is very strong you may believe me then nathan had asked what is the worst he can do again gormleys shrug frustrated as ever there are those among the dead with theories except you must understand they are only theories heaven forbid they should ever become fact but if john scofields telekinesis was able to stretch the fabric which separates life from death far enough it might break possibly a theory thats all and if it did what then then it would be the last trump when not only ohn scofield and tod prentiss but all of the great majority would walk of their own volition burial grounds would give up their dead and the world would be full of the unbearable odours of the tomb griefstricken families would be reunited but in the most monstrous way when their dearly beloved dead ones came knocking on the door at the dark of the moon why its unimaginable there would be plagues wars between the living and the dead as the world became a madhouse and everyone who died in those wars would join the everswelling ranks of the great majority in their strange new undeath at that nathan had thought of what ben trask had told him of the nzs manifestations people or their leftovers zombies corpses cadavers are seen moving walking crumbling in the weirdest places phantoms of course revenants forcibly moved by john scofields telekinetic powers into an incorporeal or at best ethereal existence on the living plane but an entire world where the living and the dead could only be told apart by degrees of decay sir keenan gormley was correct it was unimaginable and as a theory must never be put to the test for the dead of this world were not like the thyre of sunsides endless furnace deserts the nomadic thyre were gentle civilized beyond their environment and mode of existence when rogei the elder nathans first friend among the thyres teeming dead had dragged himself or rather his mummified lich from his niche in the cavern of the ancients to succour nathan no fear had attached to his activity no stenches had accompanied it no malice was implied or intended and it would have been the same with all the dead of the thyre but in this world and among these people in this world there were psychopaths terrorists rapists murderers arsonists among these ordinary people there were those whose thoughts and deeds might even equal the evil of the wamphyri themselves in death such men were of no consequence they were shunned by the great majority quite literally excommunicated by them but what would they be in the world of keenan gormleys as yet theoretical strange new undeath monsters as before warlords psychopaths murderers rapists and arsonists as of old and what of the rest of trasks poltergeist manifestations the inexplicable frenzy of household pets ghostfires that started and stopped themselves as by some otherworldly spontaneous combustion foulsmelling graveyard fogs and the like merely a prelude for things to come trasks hand fell on nathans shoulder and caused him to start he looked up into the others face then at the gaunt wintrygrey street with its whirling newsprint and sweetwrapper dustdevils and its blearyeyed houses and store fronts and this is it trask told him holding the car door open the epicentre the heart of the nightmare zone and in there thats where youll find the very heart he pointed to the dilapidated police station where an oldfashioned lamp with many of its trapezoids of blue glass standing like broken teeth shattered in their castiron frame was bracketed over scarred oak doors with smallpaned reinforced glass windows in their upper panels weve got something over six hours to get ourselves settled in well to prepare ourselves at least deserted nathan said getting out of the car but the whole street trask nodded at both ends of the street youll find the odd shop or two still open and a couple of houses still occupied but mainly the entire area is falling into dereliction lets face it would you want to live here the expressionless paul garvey had keys to the place he opened the doors and trask and his team went in the interior smelled stale damp strange more like some cavern lair than a building it lingers trask explained his voice echoing the smell the feel the aura as a whole but back there grimacing he nodded his head towards the unseen reports room and the rear of the building is where its at its worst silent except for their oddly muffled footsteps the four passed through the inquiries and waiting room into the reports centre with its slightly elevated counter and operations area where trask lifted a flap gate in the desk to climb a pair of shallow steps up into the desk sergeants domain they were playing cards right here he said the night all of this got started and down there he nodded towards an open door at the rear where a dampshining corridor led the way into an aching echoing darkness thats where the morgue is paul garvey had never been here before he asked ok if i take a look he had the rest of the keys on a large key ring including the one for the morgue trask nodded there should be a gradual buildup of psychic energies until just before midnight after that itll be a riot until then youll be safe down there but it will probably feel weird the left side of garveys face twitched where after all these years severed nerveendings were still trying to match themselves up johnny found had cut him to the bone that time so that in fact garvey was lucky to have a face at all hey he said it feels weird enough to me right here right now and as he started down the corridor between the rows of empty cells nathan walked behind him just inside the corridor there was a light switch garvey snapped it up and down once or twice but the lights stayed out the small hairs at the back of nathans neck began to creep he could feel something stirring it was almost as if a waft of foul air had brushed his cheek so that he held his breath for a moment to avoid inhaling it garvey had felt nothing he went on but nathan held back a little to see if the thing recurred then garvey was at the door to the morgue and the keys jingled in his hand a moment more and the doors stood open garvey went in and nathan moved to close the distance between them but in the twenty paces it took to pass along the corridor what the hell garveys shaken voice came echoing back to him and to trask and smart still in the duty room but i thought this place was supposed to be empty the last word sounded as a gasp and as nathan reached the doors garvey came stumbling out his face white as chalk trask and smart came running their feet clattering on the tiles what is it paul trasks rasping query grated on nerves that were suddenly raw garvey flapped a hand at the yawning doors to the morgue in there he gasped containers littering the floor i saw bodies tipped out grotesquely sprawled there were filing cabinets all tumbled in a corner but the corpses they were they were nathan looked inside garveys head read his mind it was easy for garvey was a telepath too he saw what the other had seen metal coffins and the dead bodies inside them trying to sit up their faces twisted in horror at the knowledge that they were dead yet still mobile they were what trask brushed past the others and into the morgue alive nathan followed him into the large cold square room and looked all about but there was nothing to see no steel caskets no filing cabinets or corpses nothing nothing to see or feel at all except the cold garvey shivering uncontrollably and looking into the room over geoff smarts shoulder said i saw what i saw and then i didnt trask grunted and said its started and earlier than ever before then glancing out into the corridor at smart do you feel anything the empaths eyes were wide his red brush of a crewcut seeming more than ever erect the same as i felt last time he said only stronger much stronger i feel mounting fear horror the great majority nathan broke in i can feel them too their terror and i feel a monstrous anger smart finished trask said thatll be john and turning to nathan with some urgency son i think maybe youd better start doing your stuff right now the sooner you can make contact if you can make contact the better the air was colder still and the temperature still falling nathans breath plumed as he answered til bring a chair from the other room then ill ask you to leave me alone if i need you ill call but right now i would prefer to be alone youre all espers if you can feel something of the dead then maybe they can feel something of you since it bothers them to talk to me your presence can only make it that much more difficult also i need to concentrate he headed for the corridor but trask stopped him til go and get your chair you stay here and try to contact them here take my overcoat the rest of us well take turns out in the corridor after he had left nathan asked geoff smart what did you do last time what we always do we tried to contain it i cant say how much good we did but we used whatever psychic powers were available in us to suppress the thing im an empath i used my talent to calm the atmosphere of the place the unquiet spirits which were at work in it to calm john scofield i suppose telepaths do the same try to talk the thing down with their minds the others do whatever they can as for ben hes good for moral support in matters like this bens the rock that we all lean on wouldnt it be better if the whole team ebranch in its entirety were here to contain it smarts face was white in the frame of the doorway the truth of the matter is he said that we simply cant afford it if matters got out of hand if it got lethal this way we know that only four of us pay the price the survival of the branch is paramount nathan frowned yet you let the head of the branch risk his neck smart grinned however humourlessly have you ever tried arguing with him im not going to be the one who tells him to go home nathan this man stood side by side with your father against vampires even against wamphyri now that might not be such a big deal in your world but in this one trask was back with a metalframed chair nathan took it to the centre of the room sat down and drew trasks overcoat more tightly round his shoulders the cold seemed to have receded a little but he drew the overcoat to him anyway out in the corridor smart took first watch while trask and garvey went back to the duty room and there in the heart of the nightmare zone nathan collapsed his shield of alien numbers and opened his mind hoping that the great majority would sense him there not as a thing to be feared but as their friend and then that he would be heard and heeded by all the teeming dead v dead voices it was a tumult of distant only halfdiscernible whispers a babble a babel but of crumbling autumn leaves skittering over the stone flags of nathans mind the psychic aether seethed with them like the static hiss issuing from a coastguards radio as he listens for mayday messages on a stormy night except these whispers were that message the terrified sos of the teeming dead not sent out to the necroscope but to each other like the hoarse questioning whispers of frightened children trapped in a dark place which nathan overheard because he had a walkietalkie his deadspeak but couldnt answer because they were too afraid to switch their set to receive he finetuned his talent to listen to these tumultuous spirit voices which would scare any other man half to death if any other were able to hear them at all but nathan kiklu or keogh as it now transpired had listened to voices such as these all of his life from childhood and he knew that their owners were harmless mainly he also knew however that to interrupt would be to silence them causing them to withdraw as from a leper it was the legacy of his father come down to him in two worlds for in the end harry had been a monster and the dead of both worlds had feared him or rather they had feared his necromantic talents likewise they feared nathan and at any other time must surely have detected him by now but their circumstances were such that his presence had passed by unnoticed so the great majority continued to voice their fears in the unending night of death and nathan listened in trying to decipher their deadspeak whispers and uncertain as to his best course of action and yet if he was to help them help himself and his newfound ebranch friends he must break in must attempt to establish some kind of contact at least perhaps by now sir keenan gormley had found the time to talk to them there was only one way to find out and the sooner the better nathan cast about with his metaphysical mind discovering nearby presences in the aether of the beyond these could only be people who had died close by perhaps in the hospital overhead whose spirits yet attached to this place he would make his first overtures to them of all the dead they were surely the closest to the nightmare zone in this despite that hed been born with his talent nathan showed his inexperience his immaturity as a necroscope for he was already aware of others who had died even closer to this place which he nevertheless failed to take into account as he concentrated his deadspeak thoughts directly into the aether and whispering so quietly that only he himself could hear it he said whoever you are i need your help i need you to help me now so that i can help you later my name is nathan and im alive what who nathan liar it was like the shout of a giant or some furious madman in nathans mind causing him to start to his feet but of course he was the only one who heard it and out in the corridor geoff smart wasnt even looking the empaths talent wasnt automatic but must be induced like a kind of selfhypnotism living with his own thoughts and emotions for the moment he wasnt much concerned with anyone elses and anyway midnight was still a long way off smart leaned against a wall and lit a cigarette but in the morgue the temperature had dropped again plummeted and nathans breath plumed as before and again the short hairs on the back of his neck stood erect as he took slow careful steps towards the open doors for he could actually feel the presence there in the room with him and knew that its powers were as awesome as his own but where his were harmless its could only be devastating stop the command brought him up short panting it was as if he were back in turgosheim beyond the great red waste in runemanse and the seer lord maglore of the wamphyri had spoken to him such had been the force of that single word but still it had not dawned on him who issued it and who are you he whispered you know me and i know you tod prentissss the last word sounded in nathans mind as a protracted hiss filled with menace loathing and now indeed he knew who the presence was john scofield and another voice halfwondering asked what it was geoff smart silhouetted like a wraith in his own cigarette smoke and a swirling luminous mist just beyond the heavy steel doors drawing deeply on his smoke and rubbing his hands together briskly then more slowly as he stared at nathan where once more he inched towards the corridor but now the empath knew that something was wrong and reached out a tentative mental probe towards nathans aura a mistake what do you have friends here and you think they can help you think again tod prentissss smart couldnt hear scofields words but instead felt them like hammer blows to his psyche rocking him on his heels as the steel doors to the morgue slammed shut in his face and nathan he found breath to yell nathan but nathan was on the other side of the doors trask and garvey came running the telepath was more composed now but the left side of his face was alive with jerks and twitches as his nerves continued to play him up a little what now trasks voice was hoarse with dread nathans in there smart gasped but he isnt alone theres something someone in there with him it has to be john scofield trask tried the doors locked impossible garvey shook his head i opened them and i still have the keys then he realized what hed said nothing was impossible here for this was the nightmare zone give me the keys trask told him and a moment later he had a key in the lock but as he tried to turn it it was as if a cold invisible ironhard hand yanked his own hand aside and snapped off the key in the lock and the keyring fell jangling to the floor down there streaming out from a crack under the door a faintly luminous mist began to lap about their feet causing them to move uneasily as if they stood in icecold water then garvey said hes talking to someone i can sense it feel it but i cant hear it it isnt telepathy but deadspeak well thats what hes in there for trask rasped but were not supposed to be locked out here telekinesis locked this door and yes it has to be john scofield hes early this time nathan must have brought him on and turning to smart take the keys go round to the side of the hospital maybe youll find a key that will open a door if not then break something a window door anything but get into the hospital and down to the morgue and as smart raced off back along the corridor and out of sight come on trask took garveys elbow dont i recall seeing a bench back there in the inquiries room one of those oldfashioned oak benches that weigh half a ton it will make one hell of a batteringram they ran down the mistwreathed corridor leaving nathan alone in the morgue with the unquiet spirit of john scofield for the moment it was as much as they could do in the morgue nathan began to see things he knew that they werent there but just like garvey before him he saw them the triplestacked container unit with its rows of sliding refrigerated cabinets the filing system in a corner recess a pair of medical trolleys with white rubber sheets thrown over them a scene from the past brought into being by the flux of john scofields dead thoughts for a ghost doesnt have to be revenant of sentience it can also be of a place an object a thing other than human other than oncealive in this sense the phantasmal items which nathan saw were ghosts but ghosts of the morgue itself not its inhabitants that was only what he saw however while what he heard and felt those things were quite different for as the steel doors had slammed shut closing nathan in and condemning him to darkness then the presence of john scofield had loomed that much larger until it could be felt everywhere about and even as nathan realized his predicament so the dead madmans voice came back again so powerful as to be painful in the echoing caverns of the necroscopes mind tod prentiss prentiss prentssss wrong nathan whispered im not tod prentiss my name is nathan its nathan keogh keogh yes let scofield know who he was how he could speak to the dead let them all know that he was the son of the first true necroscope surely there were friends other than sir keenan gormley out there keogh keogh keoooogh nechoscope and for the first time scofields demented deadspeak voice contained something other than malice and madness so that nathan pressed his momentary advantage nathan keogh yes im the son of harry keogh and your friends in ebranch have asked me to help you they couldnt reach you but i can and im the only one who can thats why you have to listen to me thickening the poltergeist mist had taken on a lot more of weird luminosity sufficient now to light the entire morgue with an eerie blue foxfire and the morgue really was a morgue its contents appeared real now not wavering insubstantial and half opaque but solid as life john scofields hatred made it real as his enhanced telekinetic powers prepared the killing ground for a new assault upon his dead enemy nathan keoooogh his deadspeak voice breathed again breathed the mist which swirled about the room and filled its corners bringing them to glowing life and no you would try to trick me the voice continued if you are keogh you would deprive me of my prey and if you are not keogh then you are prentissss tod prentiss yessss and you are afraid of dying again now let me think how have i killed you in how many ways im keogh nathan insisted nathan keogh how else am i talking to you if not in deadspeak who else but a necroscope could do it the dead can do it any one of them can but you know that dont you prentiss for you are dead and would remain dead except i drive you back into a semblance of life so that i may kill you yet again as indeed i intend to kill you yet again feeling the dreadful intensity of scofields obsession his paranoia which would not be denied by anything as simple as the truth nathan opened his deadspeak channels wider yet now he must enlist the aid of the great majority for his was only one voice and theirs were many if he could only persuade them to talk to him perhaps he could convince scofield of his truth his thoughts were deadspeak of course and the madman had heard them oh clever so clever but you were clever in life too else you would never have lasted so long but tell me this if you are in truth the necroscope then why dont the dead talk back to you or are they saving that for later their trump card when everything else fails the only thing that puzzles me is why they should concern themselves with you at all and what about you nathan found courage to answer dont you care about the great majority are you so unfeeling of them dont you know how youre harming them how much damage you can do and not only to the dead but to the living you mentioned a trump card but would you play the last trump john what are you saying and again there was other than madness in the great voice my argument is with you tod prentiss it has nothing to do with the teeming dead unless they would deny me my revenge and certainly it has nothing to do with the living the last trump to call up the dead but surely thats your province necroscope the voice was caustic full of sarcasm and yours nathan was growing desperate and still the dead ignored him or if not that if they were beginning to listen to him now listening was all they were doing its your province too for youre the one who calls up tod prentiss out of death to make him pay for what he did to you and yours well and perhaps you have the right but why must all of the dead suffer and what of the living trickery scofield bellowed word games mind games but i wont play them with you you are going to die again and again and again tod prentissss word games well in a sense scofield was right it was a word game of sorts and nathan was good at them the mage of runemanse himself had admitted as much but this time so much depended on the game that nathan must use every word to maximum effect and so he fell silent to consider his next move the air in the morgue was freezing now and it throbbed almost audibly with a barely contained power that galvanized nathans hair into electrical life and raised gooseflesh on his arms and back it was at least five and a half hours to midnight and for all of that time the power would be building surely it couldnt be contained not in one room not by one man meanwhile he had inched his way slowly to the doors and now tried them useless there was no give in them they might as well be welded shut and tendrils of blueglowing mist were seeking him out creeping across the floor and weaving through the bitterly cold air to where his breath plumed frosty white while starting up again in his head how many times have i killed you tod prentiss not enough not nearly enough and in how many ways i have cut your throat with a razor but have i burned you no ive driven nails into your eyes your brain but have i crushed your skull with my telekinesis oh so slowly until brain fluids trickle from your ears like the yolks of eggs no ive gelded you with a white hot poker driving it into the steaming raw hole of what was your sex but have i drowned you in blood not yet putting his shoulder to the doors and leaning his weight on them like shoving at the face of a granite cliff without moving it the smallest fraction of an inch nathan felt the mist damp around his ankles damp and mobile and yet glutinous too gluey he looked down and saw that the floor was red six inches deep in red and scofields words came back to him but have i drowned you in blood not yet nathan sucked in air in a huge gasp held it thought for a moment that his heart had stopped that at the very least he was going to topple over faint and knew that that was the last thing he could do he darent faint for he was standing in blood up to his ankles and felt it oozing soaking through his trousers socks shoes for a moment he didnt believe it but he could see it feel it smell it blood on starside in turgosheim the wamphyri had a saying the blood is the life but here it was or could be the death dead blood like the terrible juice of a thousand slaughterhouses conjured by the telekinetic mind of a dead man to slap in sluggish scarlet wavelets at nathans ankles no at his calves for the lake of blood was getting deeper by the second galvanized gasping for air and barely managing to rein back on his horror nathan sloshed through this crimson stuff of nightmares this stuff of the nightmare zone to make for one of the surgical trolleys standing draped in its white rubber sheet if it was real he would climb onto it lift himself out of the blood and if it wasnt real then neither was the blood but as he got there so the rubber sheet bulked out took on shape the outline of a human body and suddenly sitting up jerking erect like a puppet on a string so that the sheet slipped to one side the corpse turned its pale white silently screaming face to look at nathan its throat was slashed ear to ear and its wrists sliced through and the dead blood was pouring from the wounds in a flood no nathan shouted shoving spastically at the trolley and sending it rolling sluggishly through the deep red flood its gruesome burden lolling then toppling into a lake of its own making and all a fantasy a nightmare conceived by john scofield where his dead mind thought its telekinetic thoughts in the heart of the nightmare zone but a fantasy that could kill stop a mans heart freeze the very blood in his veins or cause him to drown in it a fantasy that was rapidly expanding the other trolley was similarly occupied with a silently screaming bloodgushing corpse and the aluminium caskets had floated free of their refrigerated bank to drift like metal boats on a crimson lake and from within them a frenzied hammering of corpse hands on vibrating panels the lids thrown violently open corpses trying to stand up capsizing their grotesque vessels and tipping themselves into the ghastly flood the blood was up to nathans thighs he waded to the filing cabinets and climbed them and sat in the corner with his back to the walls watching the staggering corpses with their slit throats and wrists where they gradually submerged in the everdeepening tide and without even realizing it suddenly the necroscope found himself rocking to and fro and moaning to himself the human mind can only take so much nathan it was sir keenan gormleys horrified deadspeak voice nathan this isnt the way to go another dead man nathan thought which was dead speak of course a plague of dead men even starside turgosheim was better than this and suddenly gormley was frantic in his mind nathan are you giving in but you mustnt your father never gave in he was a fighter to the end nathan wanted to laugh cry shout his frustration symptoms of hysteria which finally he recognized somehow he controlled himself said harry keogh could afford to fight his army fought for him the dead were his friends his troops j have nothing only harrys wood as for his talent what good is that if the great majority wont let me use it but theyve been watching listening gormley told him you opened yourself up to them and they entered they heard your argument with john scofield your plea on their behalf and on behalf of the jiving theyve felt the warmth of your deadspeak thoughts and know that youre on their side nathan and now theyre ready to help you indeed theyve been helping you or trying their hardest nathan felt a new strength new hope gormley had a persuasive personality the dead are heping me how in what way scofields wife and son are locked in their own terror as theyve been since tod prentiss murdered them but now as the great majority make every effort to comfort them they are coming out of it they were in trauma nathan beyond our reach and perhaps more importantjy beyond john scofields reach they should be able to provide the element of control which is ah hes jacking together with his family scofield will be whole again nooooou scofield was back again more furious than ever trickery you tortured them in life and now you would torture them in death ah you can fool the teeming dead tod prentiss but you can never fool me now drown bastard in the blood of the dead and suddenly it was raining red nathan cast a disbelieving horrified glance at the low ceiling just overhead watched crimson cracks leaking first a splash a trickle then streams of blood the cracks joined up to form a spiderweb whose scarlet threads zigzagged rapidly wildly across the broad plaster expanse threatening blotches and blisters formed as the ceiling bulged under the weight of blood the plaster tore open with a soggy ripping sound like wet rotten meat letting down its load into the morgue and washed from his perch nathan went under then the doors burst open the twindoor leading to the police station and a moment later the door to the basement of the hospital but it was as if they were forced open from within and in fact they had been by the sheer weight of blood or by the weight of the mind that had created the illusion in the corridor trask and garvey were knocked off their feet hurled back along the celllined corridor clinging to a bench likewise in the hospital geoff smarts legs seemed cut out from under him as he was sent flying slapped down drenched in blood it happened and it was over as quickly as that and nothing had changed except the time out in the corridor ben trask and paul garvey issued simultaneous cries of astonishment they dropped their bench batteringram which narrowly missed trasks feet causing him to exclaim and jump back a little then off balance he sat down abruptly on the softly gleaming tiles but not in a pool of blood garvey leaned back weakly against the wall he mopped his brow with a trembling hand felt the impaired flesh of his face jerking uncontrollably in the doorway to the hospital basement geoff smart tottered like an infant sick and completely disorientated he bumped left and right against the uprights of the wide door frame but there was no blood anywhere not a drop to be seen finally the three espers pulled themselves together and trask and smart entered the morgue nathan was seated in a corner ashenfaced gasping for air and hugging his knees and the way he turned his head to stare all about it was obvious that his disorientation was the worst of all in his time ben trask had seen and been through a lot also he was the human liedetector and knew that what he was looking at now was the plain truth first to recover himself fully he went straight to nathan son are you ok nathan could breathe easy again and as trask helped him to his feet he asked what what happened he was shivering and damp not with blood but his own cold sweat out there trask looked over his shoulder at the silhouetted door space the glowing blue mist had disappeared along with the blood weve been trying like hell to get in thats about all thats happened and in here nathan felt dehydrated he knew trask had brought coffee sugar and milk with him in the car all the makings and still shivering he said ill tell you all about it but first i need a drink smart came to help trask with nathan i was with you right at the end he said god i dont know what it was about but it must have been the worst nightmare anyone ever suffered paul garvey waited out in the corridor not cowardice just good sense it wouldnt be clever for all four of them to be in the morgue together but as the others came out he said i was with you too or i would have been if they had let me they trask looked at him i tried to reach nathan just as we were about to start using the bench on the door garvey explained but there was a telepathic shield round his mind static as we would call it in the branch except it was cold cold stuff nothing living created it must have been scofield trask nodded but nathan said not necessarily for there are telepaths among the dead too and keenan gormley told me theyre trying to help us now by blocking your mind trask raised an eyebrow nathan shrugged perhaps by protecting it from the worst of what scofield could do and if so im glad for what he did was bad enough they were back in the duty room smart made coffee while nathan told what had happened to him as he finished his story there came a burst of static from a pocket radio trask had left sitting on the reports desk hasnt worked since we got here trask commented else i might have tried ordering up some cutting gear for that door back there then he frowned i told them not to bother us until pm and then to stay in close contact so why are they trying to get through now white as a sheet garvey answered because its pm thats why he was staring disbelievingly at his watch his eyes round as saucers and finally they knew about the time all of their watches told the same story a story of warped time the extension of a brief episode into something that had lasted for well over four hours what smart wasnt able to accept it we were moving in slow motion or something dont concern yourself with it trask told him it can drive you crazy trying to figure it out its just another one of those weird things that can happen in the nightmare zone but paul garvey said it does pose a problem though in that we only have sixty minutes left to zero hour finally the static broke up ebranch got through to them and david chungs slightly tinny worried voice said sunray this is echo hotel quebec signals over echo hotel quebec this is sunray trask answered signals ok but lets junk the radio procedure we havent the time chungs sigh of relief was clearly audible and then his question is everything ok ive been trying to get you for the last hour i was about ready to send a car over most of ebranch has reported for duty tonight were there with you right now in mind if not in body chung was one of only a handful of men in the entire world who could say that sort of thing and actually mean it weve had a few problems trask said but its cool now for the moment you can give us a buzz every ten minutes or so but dont send the cavalry and thats an order there are more than enough of us in the firing line already its just that zek wasnt able to get through to paul or nathan chung said and i couldnt locate you despite that i knew where you were none of us was getting anything you were swamped with static and naturally we were worried every ten minutes trask repeated meanwhile well you can wish us luck he broke contact smart wanted to know so why has everything suddenly gone quiet now trask glanced at him noticed how drawn he was looking all of them were and nathans clothes didnt fit too well trask would be willing to bet that nathan had lost seven or eight pounds in weight returning his gaze to smart he said it must have taken a hell of a lot out of john scofield to put on a show like that now hell be recuperating regenerating himself but that was only the start of it the finale comes at pm paul garveys face was as expressionless as the unfeeling flesh it was made of as he put in and if time narrows down again what then trask shrugged but in no way negligently you tell me nathan finished his coffee got to his feet looked at his friends i almost got through to them he said to the teeming dead i need to speak to keenan gormley again and through him to the great majority even to john scofield especially to him but i need privacy and quiet and i only have an hour trask was on his feet at once youll go back in there nathans turn to shrug thats where it is ben didnt you name it yourself the what epicentre whatevers coming its coming out of there john scofield is in there and his wife and son finally willing to accept whats happened to them even tod prentiss hiding somewhere in there and all the great majority prepared to talk to me at last they need me now and if im ever going to get back to sunside i need them so theres no other way i have to go back in trask opened his mouth to make an answer but nothing came out his eyes went instead to the electric jug in which smart had boiled water for the coffee it was no longer plugged in but the water had started to boil and garvey was staring at his watch again gapemouthed he showed the others the second hand was sweeping round the dial nathan flew down the steps to the corridor of softly shining tiles and raced along it to the morgue he didnt want to go in but he must too much depended on it the peace and sanity of the living and the dead of two worlds and behind him as he entered the morgue the doors slammed shut again prentiss john scofields mad awesome deadspeak voice was back in his mind tod prentissss and nathans hackles rose as he skidded to a halt in the bluemisted room and felt again the telekinetic aura of the dead man a tangible force in the midnight morgue not prentiss he answered in a gasp my names nathan nathan keogh why dont you listen to the dead john theyll tell you who i am why dont you listen to sir keenan gormley before you were a member of ebranch he was the head of that organization he was my fathers friend and now hes mine i know because i can talk to him even as im talking to you i know because im the necroscope would you harm me john the only friend you have left in the living world the son of the man who taught the teeming dead how to speak to one another when i seek you out i find you always you hide from me keep quiet and still close your mind but i always find you this time ive found you again but you would trick me into believing that you are some other this keogh except i know your deception how can you be any other but tod prentiss ive shut the teeming dead out for they would only meddle and the one voice the one loathsome being i seek is you of all the great majority yours is the single voice i allow myself to hear wherefore i know you tod prentissss cracks zigzagged across the floor the room shook with a rumbling rage of its own the floor fell away beneath nathans feet leaving him standing on a crumbling jut of tiled masonry as the walls extended themselves downwards changing from brick and plaster to roughhewn rock he teetered this way and that as more tiles and masonry fell away spinning into the blueglowing deeps and down there far below redroaring fire its vengeful heat warmed the shaft like a breath of hell you have the wrong man john it was sir keenan gormleys frantic deadspeak voice homing in on the awesome centre of power that was scofields incorporeal mind you dont know me but i know you i know of you aji of the teeming dead know you and if you persist in what youre doing the jiving will know of you too indeed you may even destroy their world if scofield heard him at all he ignored him but to nathan how many times have i killed you in how many ways a good many i know but have i crushed you in a fall and burned you in hells own fires more of the tiles fell from the rim of nathans rapidly diminishing refuge until he knew that the projecting tongue of masonry couldnt hold him up for very much longer but was it really possible for scofield to crush him in an imaginary fall or turn him to a cinder in imaginary fires it was yes possible to crush nathan with the power of his telekinetic mind and to move the fires of inner earth to surround him with their heat which is such that it will melt steel nathan was losing his balance he slipped fell clung to the disintegrating masonry as more debris went tumbling into the mental pit which scofield had created but john john come home now wherever you are and whatever youre doing stop it now and come home were here john and were not afraid any more the the dead have helped us to overcome they can hejp you too so pjease come home now oh its a strange sort of home know but where we are the three of us together you me andrew thats home lynn now scofield heard but did he believe lynn his voice gonged as before but its tone was different wondering as opposed to furious and then a groan but would they use you too to confuse me and delay my justice the pain sorrow and anguish in that voice would be enough for twenty grieving men are you are you a part of it part of what john there is no plot my love but just as tod prentiss is in hiding from you so weve been hiding too from the truth and so have you weve been hiding from each other but now its time to come together john and its also time for you to come home lynn scofield had been doing all right until she mentioned prentisss name but that had been a huge mistake home i should come home now when i have him where i want him he destroyed my home as i now destroy him the lone fang of rock broke away from the wall with nathan still clinging to it turning end over end he felt the rush of heated air from the core of volcanic lava below him and saw the sheer unscalable walls go rushing past then the pace slowed down he continued to plunge but oh so slooooowly he floated a feather with the weight of a man and he knew how why it was the teeming dead if john scofield could do it so could they their massed minds the joint effort of a million dead souls who suddenly knew nathan for his real value just as they had known his father in the early days of harry keoghs earthly innocence and now they turned their single deadspeak voice on john scofield telling him john weve found tod prentiss for you driven him out of hiding and well give him to you willingly this one last time in order to prove how wrong you are but if you let nathan die youll be damned by the dead for ever you of all men know what a crime it is to take the life of someone much loved kill tod prentiss again if you must but not this man for nathan keogh is the necroscope john hes the light in whats left of the lives of each and every one of us without his father what would we ever have been and without him who can say you have found tod prentiss scofields voice was uncertain then show him to me give him to me and another voice terrified utterly mindless with fear cried no no nooooo the scream of a maniac yes of a trapped rabid animal tod prentisss scream nathan falling slow as a leaf yet hurtling to his doom for all that saw the face of tod prentiss as it had been then in various stages of languid loathsome corruption and finally as it was now he saw it first bloated with evil red and round its eyes too small too close together over a blob of a nose loose fleshy lips and a receding chin the face of a beast which leered even without trying then he saw the mouth fall open and the leer turn to a look of terror horror as the flesh began to slough the lips and cheeks puffing up bursting and turning to rot the eyes glazing over sinking back into sulphur yellow orbits dribbling sick grey fluids from red rims the nose collapsing in upon itself livid flesh peeling back and a crater of jagged bone showing through finally the jaws gaping wide in a dead scream as maggots erupted from the purple rot and quickly fretted the whole to a skull nathan saw it and so did john scofield that is tod prentiss he knew it for a fact which can only mean that this one that he is nathan keogh the floor was back under nathans feet but he felt that he was still falling crumpling to the cold tiles then hugging to them he sobbed his exhaustion into the cool air of the morgue and saw that he lay in a pool of blueglowing mist and knew that it wasnt over yet vi confrontation conclusion connections trask and the others were battering at the doors again calling out to nathan asking if he was all right he was aware of them of their voices strangely distant as if they reached him from a very long way away and also aware that he wasnt alone in the eerie blue glow of the place there were combatants here too for this was to be the final confrontation combatants and an audience but never such a silent audience in the history of competition for they were all of them dead as were the phantoms they had come to watch the previous inhabitants of this place sat on their metal caskets in a ring that encircled the figures of two men john scofield and tod prentiss nathan could tell them apart from the start for he knew what prentiss had looked like his bestial face was unmistakable and his squat froglike figure hunched now in a defensive crouch or shrunken into itself in fear seemed likewise to cry his identity gravedirt clung in clods to his hairy body as for john scofield he was of medium height sparselyfleshed cleanlimbed both men were naked and the contrast was stark darkness against light good against evil whether it was an accurate physical representation or simply scofield and his mortal enemy as seen from scofields point of view nathan couldnt say but he knew which side he was on and he was even more sure when suddenly tod prentiss rounded on him and grunted cunt rabblerouser this dumb bastard thought he had me untij you and your dead friends convinced him otherwise then nathan saw that while prentisss basic emotion was definitely fear indeed terror of john scofield presumably hed managed to suppress it to allow for a bout of vicious homicidal rage survival nathan supposed for during his life of theft rape and finally murder prentiss had been a survivor as in life so in death his instincts were unchanged prentiss was still the survivor he had survived how many of scofields attempts to be rid of him in his incorporeal state he always would survive them for men only die the true death once nathans thoughts were deadspeak and tod prentiss heard them naturally dead right shithead living men only die the true death once and youre alive right for the moment youre alive anyway you dumb fuck prentisss sudden lunge in nathans direction might have taken the necroscope by surprise but not john scofield and not the ring of sad silent observers as prentiss came loping leaning menacingly forward with his long arms reaching and his wet lips drawn back from straining grimacing yellow teeth so the corpses moved to intercept they werent creaking groaning cadavers but bodies of the freshly dead and in these metaphysical moments of scofields and the great majoritys creation they were alive and mobile as life itself blocking the way they turned prentiss back brought him face to face with scofield again and seeing scofields cold stony expression prentiss shrank down whimpered like a whipped dog and backed off he knew why hed been called up why he was here to die again and he knew who would be his executioner then scofield said i wanted to show you nathan what ive been up against and why i cant stop myself wife and child were here in an afterworld devoid of body but not of mind and i for one refuse to share it with such as this one way or the other i will be rid of him but unti then i cant stop for the moment perhaps a brief moment i suppose i hope you would call me sane but i know that sooner or later the very thought of this creature still existing in however limited a capacity is bound to drive me mad again scofield paused as tod prentiss suddenly stopped whining drew himself upright shouted a curse and sprang at his enemy head on jaws gaping as if to bite him savage him like a mad dog scofield paused and held up a hand simply that but it was as if hed erected a wall a telekinetic wall that prentiss slammed into flattened against and slid down groaning to the floor at which nathan remembered something indeed several things in life scofields true talent had been telekinesis and it still was the power to move things at will with the mind alone the power to build an invisible wall or visible spirits from the memories and thoughts and dreams of what had been the power to crush enclose contain such power that the ebb and flow of its field produced those poltergeist effects which threatened the sanity of a world well and the dead were sometimes a threat in nathans world too and the undead even more so but the travellers of sunside had their own ways of dealing with such threats remembering those ways he now asked scofield where is prentiss now his body i mean what does that matter scofield turned his head to look at the necroscope at which prentiss climbed to his feet again and once more adopted his defensive or threatening crouch scofield shrugged he was buried close by else i might have difficulty calling him up his remains are still there in the ground but he is here this is him using deadspeak thoughts and pictures nathan showed what he intended at which prentiss went wild for he was able to see hear and understand nathans deadspeak scenario as well as scofield and the rest of the teeming dead and even knowing what his fate was to be or more properly because he knew his instinct for survival rose up in him one last time he hurled himself headlong at scofield again and again was met by the wall of the others mind except that this time it wrapped around him and folded him in enveloping him like a fly in a spiders cocoon the invisible cocoon of a dead mans telekinesis enhanced by his undying hatred but unlike a spiders cocoon this one was designed to contain a malignancy then slowly but surely john scofield crushed prentiss and shrank him down the ectoplasm which was prentisss body assumed a compressed spherical shape in which the grotesquely liquid contents had his features but features which gradually melted into the globular blob of the whole and such was the efficacy of scofields telekinetic bubble of pure thought that as it shrank so tod prentisss frantic screams shrank with it the process wasnt necromancy it involved no pain as such only the terror of absolute finality prentisss terror and search as he might nathan could find no pity within himself for the subject of this john scofields final exorcism for that is what it was the casting out of a devil the removal of a morbid tumour which had infected the flesh of the living but would no more suppurate in the minds of the dead let it be a warning to all such death is not the end and it isnt the end of justice within the thoughtbubble prentiss continued to shrink his outline was completely spherical now domed head sliding into bloodhound jowls into hunched shoulders into fat arms and vast flat hands which enclosed a bulb stomach hips and groin that crushed down on concertinaed legs and monstrously curving crumpled feet and as the bubble shrank so any semblance of life was likewise diminished what fleshtones had been present disappeared and were replaced by a green rottenness the evil light of tod prentisss soul concentrated within a small place and shining that much brighter or so much more lividly the telekinetic sphere of containment was less than eighteen inches in diameter now shrinking more yet it gave a last frantic wriggle like a soap bubble disturbed by a current of air so that for a moment nathan thought prentiss was about to break out but no he had tried certainly but it was his last desperate attempt scofields talent was too strong too terrible to resist and down went the bubble smaller and smaller and prentisss screams still furious less than whispers on the psychic aether until at last they were inaudible then i dont know how jong i can hold it together scofield said his own voice small now in nathans deadspeak mind what you promised do it now for once im spent it will be a long time before can build up to anything like this again nathan saw how close to exhaustion he was and now speaking out loud to the teeming dead help him give him all the help you can hold prentiss until i can see to it or all this is for nothing they understood added the weight of their incorporeal minds to scofields and helped him cram the pulsing green glow which was prentiss into an even smaller space in the end into no space at all merely a nucleus of sick green radiation which nathan plucked from the air and put in his pocket it was as easy as that he could do it he was the only one who could do it because he was the necroscope because to him death and everything connected with it is different and now that the great majority had played their part it was up to him to see it through the dead and their casket seats faded into blue mist which itself faded into nothingness the room darkened but momentarily before the doors crashed open trask and the others stood framed in the dim light from the corridor their breathing making grey funnels in the cold air and from some neardistant place in the quiet city the chimes of midnight rang out penetrating even here but at last no less than the city the nightmare zone was quiet too in the duty room nathan wasted no time prentiss was buried quite close to here thats right trask nodded is it important yes nathan answered curtly we have to dig him up and burn him and tonight but no buts not if you want to be rid of the nightmare zone forever listen time to explain later but right now can it be arranged there were few things that the head of ebranch couldnt arrange yes if i can get to a telephone then lets get to one the exhumation of tod prentiss was a speedy and less than dignified affair and his cremation in an industrial furnace at an engineering plant on the outskirts of the city took place without ceremony except for one small incident just before the bodybag went into the fire nathan stepped forward and unzipped it six inches along one side and taking some unseen thing from his pocket which couldnt be seen by anyone but him he thrust it deep into the bag where it belonged thus tod prentiss became one with his remains and was one with his ashes when they had cooled in the grey morning the first three airplanes out of gatwick and three more out of heathrow carried along with their more orthodox passengers ebranch agents on a special mission to disperse prentisss ashes across the world scattering them far and wide so that nothing of him could ever come together again also by first light the remains of john and lynn scofield and those of their son andrew were exhumed and cremated under circumstances and in a manner which were very different and in the kensington garden of repose ben trask zek foener and nathan stood with heads bowed as a short but solemn ceremony took place later when the three walked in the grounds of the place under a grey sky nathan told the others this may be strange it may even frighten you a little but it shouldnt worry you and it is what they want he carried an earthenware urn which suddenly he held out at arms length what trask said but nathan was talking to someone else now john ore you sure this is what you want right oh yes the answer came back at once and it has to be now whatever power i have left it will only just suffice i know it i drained myself keeping prentiss in his place until you could scatter him far and wide and now its for me to find a better place for my family but even if we dont make it if were scattered on the winds well be together at the end and at peace with ourselves we are at peace with ourselves nathan thanks to you and now do it nathan did it dropped the urn which crashed down onto a red brick herringbone pathway and shattered and for a moment there was a confusion of bouncing clattering pottery shards and grey dust springing up in a cloud then the cloud drew itself together into some sort of tenuous whole which despite the graveyards blustery crosswinds maintained a kind of cohesion as it rose up and made off in a single body across the perimeter wall up over the rooftops and quickly vanished into the distance and gone said nathan sadly in a little while trask nodded and croaked gone yes im not sure what youve done but but were sure its for the best zek finished for him for the best yes nathan agreed the best for the jiving and the dead alike keenan gormley sighed in nathans deadspeak mind and the dead know it nathan you have what you wanted youve made yourself a lot of new friends now be sure you use them wisely trask arranged for garvey and smart to have a week off duty simply to rest up then he handed over his own duties as head of branch to david chung for a week so that he could drive up to scotland with zek and nathan it would give nathan a break trask too and zek would be with them but in his heart of hearts trask knew why he wanted her along they stayed in edinburgh for three days where nathan took great pleasure in standing in princes street and looking up at the castle on the rock men built it he would whisper awed by the thought in turgosheim it wouldnt be much it doesnt seem a lot bigger than trollmanse lorn halfstrucks stump of a stack in the bottom of the gorge but men built this you should see the pyramids zek had told him smiling or the great wall of china trask had put in or the empire state building zek had finished it as was her wont men have built a good many things nathan had frowned and given his head a shake not on sunside they havent because youve been held back zek had reasoned with him ive been there and i know and im sure that you know too nathan your people are clever and even sophisticated in their way but for the constant oppression of the wamphyri but for them oh a lot of things he had answered i wouldnt be here for one and trask had brought the conversation to a logical conclusion with and so it can be seen that they might well have brought about their own doom you are szgany when you go home you can give the szgany weapons beyond their wildest dreams and far beyond the comprehension of the wamphyri but thats then and this is now and weve a way to go yet then zek had given nathans arm a squeeze and told him but well get there i know we will they went to see the gutted ruins of harry keoghs old house on the outskirts of bonnyrig not far from edinburgh it was snowing when they got there huge soft flakes and an inch of snow lay on the garden or what had been a garden trask told nathan how it had been there was no way we could let harry alone let him live here i mean here in this world but at the same time i knew that your father was different in more ways than one oh the necroscope was wamphyri all right was he ever i saw him spoke to him that night right here in this garden and i know what he was but he wasnt the kind who would simply give in and submit to his fate and never to a fate as cruel as that so i gave him a chance ebranch was out to get him the opposition were waiting for him at the perchorsk gate even the great majority had forsaken him but i trusted him looking back on it you would be justified in believing i was out of my mind but on the other hand well who would have known the truth of it better than i at least i knew the truth of the moment that harry intended no harm and the proof of that was to hand he had deadly enemies right here men who would kill him if they could one of them was a telepath but warped and full of hate ill make a long story short the necroscope disarmed him and dragged him into the mobius continuum right then i thought id made a dreadful mistake that i would never see that man again but no harry did no harm but a lot of good somehow he took away geoffrey paxtons talent which paxton had used in the worst possible way made him ordinary returned him snivelling but physically unharmed to me here in the garden all this while his house this old burnedout place his last refuge on earth was blazing up in fire and smoke and while there wasnt a man or creature in the entire world who harry could call friend still he didnt betray us not quite true ben zek put in quietly that he had no friends i mean he had you and he had me i knew what he was and was frightened of him when he came to see me in zante wolf and i especially wolf a real wolf a szgany watchdog we both knew but the necroscope and i went back oh a long time and i was still his friend harry was harry so i took a chance too and gave them shelter him and his girl while he arranged their departure from this world the headlight beam of his motorcycle was the last i saw of him when that beam blinked out and the roar of his engine was cut off and the darkness crept in on me as never before i knew wed seen the last of him and i wouldnt be here now if something of him hadnt come back at last nathan hugged his coat to him shook off a thin layer of snow from his shoulders you loved him zek and trask glanced at one another yes trask answered i suppose we did in a way but zek shook her head im not so sure she said you have to remember id seen inside his head and while he could be warm as a sunny day he could also be cold but a different kind of cold one that cuts to the soul itself and looking at nathan to nathan she said you have it too i suppose its what makes you what you are but be careful nathan and make sure that the cold never outweighs the warmth trask wasnt party to this but knew that something had passed between them and so his next statement was entirely coincidental when he shivered and said the cold is getting through to me what do you say we get back to edinburgh the hotel coffee and liqueurs as they passed through the ruins and got into trasks car it started to snow more heavily grey figures came out of the opaque backdrop and climbed into a second car special branch minders they were never too far away driving through bonnyrig towards edinburgh nathan received a mental impression of a dog a big black and white mongrel all lolloping and friendly floppyeared and tongue lolling hot and wet the sensation wasnt telepathy or deadspeak but the next best thing as if he were back on sunside and his wolves were close by he had used to know they were there without knowing how but here in an alien world it was strange that night he dreamed of the dog and in the morning over breakfast he asked can we drive back to that village close to where harry lived bonnyrig trask raised a questioning eyebrow if youd like to of course we can any special reason i dont know nathan answered with a shrug its just a feeling that someone knows me there but how could you know anyone there i dont but i think someone knows me they went back to bonnyrig trask driving slowly and carefully on the treacherous blackiced roads and as they passed street after street of neat terraced houses suddenly nathan said stop this is it i think the dogfeeling was back the dogmind impinging on his own as nathan got out of the car he teetered a little trask said careful thats black ice i know it looks like tarmac but in fact you could skate on it zek closer to nathans telepathic mind knew that he was suffering from a kind of disorientation not from the slippery surface of the road and catching trasks eye she said deja vu nathan was back in control of himself smiling he said its down here and he made his way down a side street to the garden of a house with a shiny brass number seven on the gate then up a short path to the door and as trask and zek caught up so he knocked nathan trask was mildly alarmed now what in the name of but zek took trasks arm and quietly told him just let it be ben nathan himself doesnt know what in the name of so lets wait and find out they didnt have long to wait nathans knock was answered almost immediately by a tall frowning goodlooking young man who was halfturned towards his visitors and half towards the interior of the house glancing at the three on the doorstep he said just a moment please and called back into the house paddy will you stop that and again to his visitors smiling now and by way of explanation my old dog i dont know whats got into him they heard a tumult of excited snuffling and barking from somewhere inside the house and paddy nathan said nodding yes as if the young man had just supplied the answer to something and in his mind a sudden vision dark skid marks burned into the tarmac and paddy a mongrel puppy dead in the gutter one of the pups forelegs flopping like a rubber band its spine kinked and its shoulders askew its partlycrushed head oozing brain fluid from a torn right ear the vision came and was gone who is it dear a slender middleaged woman came to the door crowding the space beside the yoang man her eyes peered out from a dim corridor into the light of day adjusting to the brightness then she saw nathan and the others but her eyes quickly returned to nathan and her gasp of recognition was perfectly audible but in a moment when shed taken the time to think about it whatever it was she laughed and said no it couldnt be trask was fascinated what couldnt be oh nothing she said but there was a young man we saw but once a vet he said fixed up paddy after an accident he looked so like you she turned again to nathan but of course it couldnt be not possibly for youd be younger now than you were then and that was all of oh sixteen seventeen years ago did you know this vets name this from zek ah thats something i did know the woman answered i have a cousin of the same name and so i remembered it was a mr keogh fixed paddy up that time and he did a good job too for the old dogs as frisky as ever hes nearblind now but never a days sickness for all his years trask and zek felt the gooseflesh rise and looked at each other maybe paddy had heard his name mentioned whatever he was curious and now the two on the doorstep must make way for him too it was the large mongrel dog of nathans dream and vision of course squeezing out between his master and the young mans mother paddy reared up but in no way threateningly whining paddy kneadded nathans stomach with his big front paws his black and white mop of a head was tilted back he tried desperately hard to lick the necroscopes face but couldnt reach it and certain now the woman gasped he knows you no nathan told her but i think he knew my father she sighed and her hand flew to her mouth of course of course the resemblance is remarkable but please come in do come on in and to her son peter do you remember remember the young man cried making way for the visitors and ushering them down a short passage beside the stairwell into a large livingroom til say i remember what a day that was one to remember the rest of your life and when the three were seated to nathan your father was he was like a miracleworker and nathan and zek together thought to say the least but out loud nathan said what makes you say so a middleaged greyhaired man had joined them from another room he must have heard something of the conversation and the excitement on his wife and sons faces was unmistakable your father was mr keogh eh the vet well and dont we owe him a favour it was a statement of fact not a question aye and doesnt the auld dog there know it hes no like that wi just anyone son paddy was at nathans feet where the necroscope sat on a couch his forepaws in his lap tongue lolling trask laughed well paddy mightnt see too well but he certainly seems to know you i have a way with dogs nathan shrugged but now the greyhaired man was more serious so did your father he said a healing way ahm john mcculloch by the way this is mah wife mary and mah son peter peter was just a wee lad then which has to make this the best aftercare a dog ever had can ah take it your father told you to look us up my father is hes dead nathan answered but yes he did say that if i was ever up this way well youre very welcome peter mcculloch told him told all three paddy has been a sheer joy all his life yet at the time i would have sworn there was no life left in him it was a car on the corner out there paddy was oh a mess so that i was sure he was dead but mr keogh took him away and brought him back that same night like a new dog not a mark on him to this day i still cant believe it youll stay and take a meal with us peters mother took zeks hand im afraid we have other appointments trask was quick to cut in in fact we have to be on our way right now its just that its that my father said i would always find a welcome here nathan finished it standing up and i did back in the car trask said that was amazing how did you know how could you have known nathan shook his head a moment then looked at trask curiously ben are you sure youve told me everything you know about harry he was the necroscope yes he talked to the dead and when he was threatened could even call them up to a semblance of life for his protection i know all that youve told me all that and actually its no great surprise for after all im a necroscope too but i feel theres something else here something different i mean the dead are dead and paddy was very much alive i tried to read his mind through deadspeak and it didnt work paddy is alive yet after all this time he remembered my father the feel of his mind and felt something of it in mine peter mcculloch told us he was sure at the time that his pup was dead so i suppose what im really asking is this what other powers did harry have for its one thing to make the dead walk but its quite another to make them live and breathe again trask stared studiously out through the windscreen at the road ahead and got his thoughts in order for nathan was right that side of his father was rarely touched upon by ebranch and had never been mentioned to nathan himself it was the difference between a necroscope and a necromancer between good and evil and yet even as time ran out for him harry keogh had not been evil only the thing inside him had been that which hed somehow managed to keep under control until the bitter end he had not been evil but he had been a necromancer necromancy a dark esoteric art which harry had learned from janos ferenczy last of an infamous line at his castle in the zarundului mountains of carpathia this much trask knew of it and no more except that harry had used it to bring back not only a dog but men from the great beyond even now the head of ebranch didnt much care to dwell on it for he knew terrible mistakes had been made and that espers had died one of them twice unnecessarily as trask thought these things so he glanced at nathan out of the corner of his eye and saw him staring back at him such was the others curiosity he hadnt been able to resist it he had even framed his question in such a way that trask couldnt answer spontaneously but must think about it and of course nathan had read those thoughts now he saw the truth the knowledge of what hed done reflected in trasks eyes and said im sorry but i had to know and it explains a thing or two why the dead who had loved harry for so long forsook him in the end it wasnt simply that they feared his necromancy but the form which it took to be able to call them back to life it must have given him a very terrible power over them yes trask agreed just such a power as janos ferenczy possessed for even the dead can only be tortured for so long until they become dust but apparently janos could call them up from their very ashes into life to torture them again and again harry never used it that way no but he did have the power if hed wished it nathan was thoughtful ive talked to several of the dead since john scofield he finally said even a handful who knew my father personally but none of them has ever so much as mentioned this other facet again trask looked at him perhaps with a trace of uncertainty even fear showing in his face and if you were one of the great majority would you mention it zek had been silent for a while now she said nathan i dont want you to have any doubts about harry when he was finished a vampire and necromancer forsaken by the living and the dead alike so that he must flee this world into the doubtful sanctuary of starside stilj he was harry he harmed no one indeed he cared for oh everyone all of us he cared for me for a girl called penny who hed brought back from the dead even for ben here and ebranch and he never betrayed us not once the truth of it is that we betrayed him so when you think of your father think of that and act accordingly the slightest nod of his head was nathans acknowledgement of her words that was the way he would think of it but his natural curiosity remained driving back down to london at the end of their tour trask took the opportunity to break their journey with an overnight stay in hartlepool this was hardly for the natural beauty of the place though in fact the onceindustrial towns gradual decay over a period of fifty years had now been arrested but because harry keogh had lived here before his recruitment into ebranch hed lived here and earlier in harden village a few miles away which at that time had been a colliery that evening they drove through to harden and trask took nathan and zek to see harrys old school the place was empty grimy silent it stood within sight of a dilapidated railway viaduct which was due for demolition with the swelling north sea greyly visible between its rotting brick arches by this time nathan had noticed trasks attraction to zek and the fact that she was showing a measured response he suspected that his mentor would probably appreciate some time alone with her which was why after they had walked round the perimeter of the school nathan suggested that the pair might like to go off and do something together while he took in the atmosphere of the place it was partly that he wanted them to be free of him for a little while but mainly that he wanted to be free of them for as the three of them had walked together down a narrow cobbled avenue of trees between the old school and the local graveyard nathan had felt the lure of the leaning lichenclad tombstones and had known that he would find friends there or rather that his father had found friends there it was a chance to find out more about harry it was a blustery afternoon but bright and uplifting as trask and zek walked off arm in arm towards the viaduct and the green valley which it spanned where a stream sparkled in wintry sunlight but as soon as nathan entered the graveyard as soon as the branches of the trees sprawling over the wall from the cobbled avenue shut out the sun he felt the solitude of the place its solemnity and knew that his father had walked here as a boy it was as if the necroscopes footprints were still there in the glittering marble chips of the winding pathways in the leafmould and grave dirt and the cropped grass between the plots then hearing or sensing something a muttered word or furtive movement nathan looked up to see a pair of muffled figures leaning on a gate some twenty twentyfive paces away his minders their breath pluming in the frozen air keeping a respectful distance and trying not to look conspicuous still they looked out for him and reassured he went on it was as if his feet had a mind of their own they led him on before he knew it he walked more surely in the shade of benign trees before coming to a halt where an old headstone stood over a weedgrown plot and as his eyes focused on the stones legend so he opened his deadspeak mind more fully to the whispers of the dead who is it they queried who can it be it feels like like but no for hes been gone a long time now he wont be back which is as well and yet this one lives too and his thoughts are deadspeak how can that be unless the rumours are true they say a new one has come into the world but is it him or is it some other dare we speak to him dare we inquire and a firmer stronger voice said long beore he became a threat the necroscope was our friend he was the only friend we had and now theres this one weu and are you satisfied to just lie here in your limbo and jet the jiving worjd pass by unseen unknown wilj you pass up this opportunity to make contact with a jiving mind harrys gone we alj know that and we know what he was but beore that he was our riend and i for one miss him youre not ajone said a wiser but fainter voice as yet another incorporeal one entered his own plea and despite that the voice was faint still it was close so that nathan guessed it issued from the earth at his very feet from this very tomb i miss him too i used to teach maths at the schooj just across the road it was oh i dont know how jong ago fifty sixty years but id been dead a long time when harry came to me with the first of his cjassroom problems problems in maths and do you know i actuajiy helped him to sojve them can you bejieve it i was the one who taught the necroscope his mathematics nathans jaw fell open the shorter hairs stood erect on the back of his neck he couldnt believe what hed just heard the incredible gift which now seemed within reach but finally as the legend showing through the lichens on the headstone took on new meaning he had to believe it for even with his limited understanding of the written word he could now make it out to read james gordon hannant june sept master at harden boys school for thirty years headmaster for ten now he numbers among the hosts of heaven vii incentive sir said nathan unable to contain the slight catch in his voice the excitement in his heart whoever you are i think i may have been looking for you since the day i was born for a moment there was a stunned silence then a deadspeak gasp of astonishment finally the mass exclamation of a hundred or more incorporeal minds harry but there was more than just astonishment in their voices there was fear too so that nathan at once informed them no not harry but nathan nathan keogh harry was my father thats why i why i sound like him sound and fee like him the voice was jg hannants no wonder the dead have been so reluctant your father was he became other than completely reliable i mean towards the end of er i know what you mean nathan told him i know what harry was i come from a world where they breed so theres really no need to explain your fears and then more eagerly but if i may impose upon you especially upon your time there is something you can perhaps help me with oh the other was cautious yes its what you were saying earlier about teaching the necroscope his maths whatever it is you showed him whatever method you used to instruct him id be grateful if you could show teach the same things to me ah said hannant well first things first and perhaps i should warn you i did show harry a few things yes but it was quite wrong of me to give the impression that i actually taught him anything what he had was instinctive i showed him several shortcuts thats all the rest came naturally but as i said first things first obviously you have a story to tell and we want to hear it how is it youre here nathan and why are you so anxious to follow in harrys footsteps perhaps you are too anxious eh perhaps you would follow him too closely im sure youll understand our reticence nathan told them his story the story of his life he kept it short picturing most of it as opposed to vocalizing it but despite that deadspeak frequently conveys more than is actually said still it took him the best part of an hour until at last he finished it with so you see i need all the help i can get i have some of my fathers talents his deadspeak obviously and even the telepathy which he displayed towards the end of his time here but they arent enough not nearly enough to prepare me for any sort of real confrontation with the wamphyri hannant had listened to all of this very attentively but in the background nathan had been able to make out the furtive whispers of the great majority voicing their fears doubts and indecision now as he fell silent one of these quieter more fearful voices came forward a spokesman for the dead how do you see your future nathan the voice was quavery uncertain as its owner lets just suppose that by some miracle of chance we or rather some of us like hannant here can actually help you what will you do nathans response was almost automatic instinctive as his fathers maths had been men should never try to read the future he said for its a devious thing but since you ask me this is how i see it ive been promised knowledge and weapons modern weapons to take back with me into sunsidestarside to give to the szgany weapons my people can use to fight and destroy the wamphyri except even now i cant be certain that i ever will get back but if i were able to understand and use the mobius continuum then i would be certain this mbbius continuum would give you the power to transfer at will between your vampire world and ours if there was a point to the question nathan missed it not necessarily he answered but it would be a step in the right direction and it would give me instant access to any number of escape routes if ever i do get back to sunsidestarside i see said the spokesman but so quietly and thoughtfully that nathan could almost see him rubbing his chin youve come here from a world of monsters in human guise which you have admitted is a plagueridden place and yet you persist in trying to create a gateway between worlds instantaneous right of passage for yourself and for what else now nathan knew what was troubling the other and causing this new wave of uncertainty but cant you understand he answered such gateways already exist two of them they are the source of vampirism in your world or what was your world when you had life im not trying to open them but close them down permanently or better still destroy the wamphyri on their own ground and make both of our worlds safe from them we dont for a moment suggest that you would deliberately use such knowledge to let vampires loose in our world no or its already apparent that youre neither evil nor criminally insane but as you yourself have pointed out no man may read the future with impunity and if you were to fall into their hands ive been in their hands and escaped them nathans frustration was mounting to be as close as this and to come up against a stumbling block this stumbling block the legacy of his vampire father and after all he went on uncontrollably what do you know about it have you stood face to face with a lord of the wamphyri was your father one of them and has your brother been changed into into but now he saw that hed gone too far that hed said and thought too much and after a moment of total silence not only your father but your brother too but now hannant was back and belligerent nathan take no notice ill help you if can and they can take their spite out on me for i believe every word you said and im sure that youll be as big a bonus to the dead as harry was so what can they do to me eh ostracism but ive been ostracized before from life itself and another voice joined him in his defiance of the great majority that first strong voice which had spoken up for the necroscope harry keogh and which now spoke for nathan in his turn hannant is right whats wrong with the lot of you have you lain here so long in the earth that nothing can move you any more we owed harry keogh and we betrayed him i was one of his teachers too just like hannant and even after i died i taught him unarmed combat why it probably saved his life a dozen times over i did that yes i graham sergeant lane and i was proud of it yet at the end even i betrayed him and i know why its this that we the dead will only admit to two states of being life and death having experienced both we understand them but theres a third state called undeath a state which we never accepted and harry was undead hed become a vampire and so we turned our backs on him well we were wrong to do so now weve been given the opportunity to square it with his son here and will you turn him down the background babble of deadspeak whispers came flooding in again there were those who believed that the living and the dead should remain apart always and that the mysteries of the grave should remain mysteries to the living until they in turn died and joined the great majority these were the bitter ones who had never succeeded in life and so lost nothing in death but they were shouted down by others whose time had been good so that death had cheated them of a great deal and their argument was that there was much to be gained to be able to talk again through the necroscope nathan with loved ones left behind perhaps to explain that death is not the end but the renewal of old loves and friendships waiting in the last long darkness not a physical renewal no but nevertheless a joining of sorts nathan was party to all of this which showed a certain understanding on the part of the dead at least that they no longer excluded him from their discussions even when he and his problem were the business under discussion and finally very well the voice of the spokesman for the teeming dead was back again we accept you and everything you stand for and as hannant said we hope youll understand our reticence these have been strange times or the dead nathan a great shouting a terrible tumult from the south reached us even here periodically we would feel it an urge to be up and about something beyond our control its not right that dead men should want to walk again or that others should have the power to make it so nathan recognized the others subject at once i believe i know what youre talking about john scofield and the nightmare zone but thats over and done with now maybe if id mentioned it earlier things would have been that much easier perhaps you would have accepted me sooner you had something to do with that i was the one called upon to put john and his family to rest yes though i have to admit i couldnt have done it without the help of the great majority but am i to understand that youre not all of you in contact all of the time and now it was hannant who answered him it takes quite a jot out of us to converse at a distance nathan indeed its exhausting not so hard for harry in his time once hed been introduced to someone he could usually speak to him from anywhere in the world and it should be the same for you but you and your father youre necroscopes with all the drive of the living and we are only dead people if it wasnt for you no one would know we were here at all except as memories and even memories are sometimes soon forgotten as hannant finished so the spokesman came back you have our word that well work with you as far as that is possible but nathan you should know this theres a great power in you and its not one you might easily recognize im talking about the power of love in the past the teeming dead loved your father so much so that they would do anything for him and now a new light shines in their darkness all we ask is this use that power sparingly we feared john scofield because in his madness he could have made us walk again in the world of the living dont make us fear you please stay out of danger in this world at least til try to nathan answered as humbly as he was able but as for your love i havent asked for it be my friends and ill be satisfied and as for calling you up i would never do that any who would come up out of the earth for me must do so of their own free will easily said the others deadspeak voice sighed but your warmth has touched us now harry keogh is in you the original harry before he succumbed and he was someone the dead ust couldnt resist a bringer of joy but a bringer of pain too its no easy thing to get up from the grave but when he needed us we couldnt refuse him and so i ask it again stay out of danger and before nathan could prepare an answer now then how may we help nathan turned eagerly to hannant tuned in on that ones deadspeak mind sir about harrys maths and hannant interrupting with wait before you ask me to show you anything perhaps youd better show me a thing or two you must have learned something since youve been here nathan showed him orthodox maths of a high standard with one or two original concepts thrown in it was as simple as that a pageant of equations marching like an army of numbers and symbols down the screen of his mind standard stuff mainly hannant commented his thoughts clipped precise and perhaps typical of a maths master but if i may say so you show exactly the same lateral tendencies as harry which of course you must if youre to achieve what he achieved but is this everything if so theres not much to work with there is other stuff nathan told him stuff thats inside me ive been training myself to keep it suppressed but im going to need a lot more of this lesser maths before ill be able to understand it its not the same as what i just showed you its in flux changing mutating all the time its alive it lives and works within itself its like a whirlpool a numbers vortex show me youre sure what the exheadmaster and maths teacher seemed momentarily taken aback surprised but only for a moment until he laughed and said but of course im sure i mean do you think it can harm me so nathan showed him and while the numbers vortex could not in truth harm hannant it could and did shock him rigid swift as thought nathans deadspeak the issue of his weird metaphysical mind underwent an almost metamorphic transformation like a mental meltdown it sent nearnucleic energies radiating outwards into the incorporeal aether and at the heart of the inferno the numbers vortex hungry seething and sentient in its own right it sought to fuel its own fires mutating formulae where they surfaced and swarmed on the whirling rim were sucked back into the core and devoured caught in devastating collision incredible calculi exploded in the cauldron of pure maths evolving equations were fired in bursts from the wildly rotating wall like bullets from a machinegun hannant took a full burst before his astonished deadspeak gasp registered causing nathan to rein back on the vortex and reduce it first to a spiral of valueless ciphers and finally to nothing and in a little while hannant said my god to which nathan replied in sunside we have no real god he died along with our civilization at the time of the white sun and when hannant was himself again as i recall he said the necroscope harry keogh wasnt too sure about a god either but if there isnt one how may i explain what i just saw and how is it that you dont understand it j mean to have something like that in your mind and not know what it is and yet this isnt the first time ive seen it something like it anyway it isnt nathans fascination was obvious no i dont think so but last time it was what controlled by harry of course he was in leipzig visiting the grave of mobius indeed i was the one who sent him there like you he had come to me searching for answers but unlike you all harry had was an idea a symbol hannant showed it to him the mobius strip and nathan thought mobiuss blazon and maglores and now mine too his hand automatically lifted to his ear to touch the golden earring there until he remembered that hed left it in london with david chung like a lifeline to ebranch hq maglore hannant broke into his thoughts nathans telling of his story had been brief and much of his stay in turgosheim had been left out a friend of yours nathan shuddered and answered friend no not him and putting maglore out of his mind he immediately reverted to their original conversation but did you say that my fathers numbers were different from those in the vortex not different but controlled where your numbers are wild untamed nathan the numbers in harrys mind were like a vast everchanging equation on the screen of a computer which he could stop at the touch of a mental button except the power of his numbers was such that it couldnt be contained which is the reason i compared them to god only attempt to still their activity they spilled over into something else their mutation became physical as opposed to hypothetical and then did they do something what did they do nathans eagerness was very nearly painful yet at the same time paradoxically he was cautious for several people had already told him that numbers cant do anything that they simply are but they warped hannant told him through harrys eyes i saw them warp and they formed doors then i saw harry use one of those doors saw him pass through it and disappear doors and once again as so often before nathans mind went back to sunsides furnace deserts to the caverns under the earth and the dwellingplaces of the thyre and to what the dead thyre stargazer thikkoul had forecast for him in the undying everlasting stars the doors of his future like the doors on a hundred szgany caravans but liquid drawn on water formed of ripples thikkoul had whispered doors constantly opening and closing and behind each one of them a piece of your future nathan snapped out of it mobius he groaned it always comes back to him an unending loop like the mobius strip itself a dead end ive been told that hes moved on perhaps used his own continuum to travel to worlds beyond i would go and speak to him except hes no longer there and remembering what gormley had said only mobiuss bones are in leipzig now i know hannant told him sensing the depth of his frustration but you know mobius wasnt the only mathematician in the world towards the end of harrys time here he even asked the help of the giants and they gave it to him for of course they owed him the necroscope was the one who showed us how to communicate among ourselves since when well theres quite a community of us now a fraternity you could say all the various experts in their various fields they talk to each other from time to time and keep up to date as best they can the giants hannant offered a deadspeak shrug which was hardly negligent but merely expressed his acceptance of his place in the order of things giants yes compared with such as pythagoras small minds like mine are as nothing perhaps when ive lain in the earth as long as he has pythagoras as briefly as possible hannant explained and in so doing he humbled nathan too for it brought a sense of human history to him and a feeling of awe that the people of this world had records going back all of two thousand six hundred years oh longer than that hannant told him we also have the record of the earth itself which goes back billions of years but as for feelings of awe i dont think you realize your own potential for while your colleagues among the living have the history you have the power to actually converse with that history your text books are the minds of the ancient dead or those of them still extant at least for a moment he paused and then went on more cautiously except yes except pythagoras has withdrawn back into his shell for a while harry brought him out of himself he had even dissolved the brotherhood and made himself available but when he discovered the advances we had made and saw how the numbers he had known were only the germ of current knowledge that was too much for him it was easier to retreat into the safety of obsolete doctrines surround himself in secrecy once more and await his grand metempsychosis no one has spoken to pythagoras for oh a long time but you know where he is oh yes and buoyed up again nathan answered then its high time someone did speak to him and such was his tone of voice the weight of his commitment he might easily have meant now this very instant speak to whom trask said his hand falling on nathans shoulder where he sat on the dais of hannants tomb it was so unexpected that nathan jumped six inches and startled out of his deadspeak mode he lost contact with hannant at once gasping he looked up at trask and blurted pythagoras the pythagoras this from zek whose glance was accusing where she aimed it at trask was there more than one no trask shook his head i think not then feeling zeks annoyance he followed up with an apology nathan im sorry like a fool i thought you were talking to yourself but now from the look on your face i know that you werent its just that even knowing your talent its still hard for me to believe thats all i tend to forget what you can do did we interrupt something important zek took nathans arm as he stood up truthfully he glanced at trask yes but its ok i can get back to him him this from trask nathan indicated the headstone a onetime teacher at the school across the road in life he must have been a very fine man later he was a friend of my fathers my friend now should we go off again trask wanted to put things right is there something you need to finish nathan shook his head later they let it go at that walked to the car and drove back to their hotel in hartlepool when we drove back through the town nathan said over their evening meal i noticed that my father had chosen to live in a house directly opposite a large graveyard a very old place trask nodded and said very appropriate dont you think and before nathan could answer til tell you something about that garret flatlet of harrys it was where harry junior your brother first used the mobius continuum and he was no more than an infant at the time so theres hope for you yet nathan thought to himself an infant the dweller my brother by a woman not my mother was a mere infant yet even as a helpless defenceless bairn he knew more than ive learned in a lifetime but if it was instinct in him then why not in me whats missing in me and where is it i feel incomplete did nestor get something intended for me and if so why hasnt it developed in him and a moment later but i thank trasks and hannants god that it hasnt and out loud if abstractedly how was it that time he asked trask i wasnt there the other shrugged perhaps regretfully i was out of it injured hospitalized the branch was tracking down a monster yulian bodescu who was wamphyri and id been hurt at the creatures house down in devon since then ive often wished i had been there but on the other hand maybe i was lucky a very good friend of mine was there however an extraordinary man an esper called darcy clarke and he told me about it also ive read the reports he paused for a moment then continued it was night harrys wife and infant son were in the flat bodescu forced his way in and killed a policeman and two special branch men who got in his way but the baby was a necroscope harry keoghs child the teeming dead loved him and he called them up to defend himself and his mother the dead of night no one saw them leave their tombs and come out of the graveyard but darcy he was in a locked barred room on the second floor and had just seen bodescu kill a colleague then while darcy was trying to make his escape through a window he looked down on the graveyard and ill always remember how he described what he saw at first he couldnt believe it the road outside the house was filling with people but in no way ordinary people silent streams of them were converging massing together they were coming out of the cemetery gates over its front wall men women and children and crossing the road to gather in front of the house and they were quiet as the graves theyd so recently vacated their stench drifted up to darcy on the damp night air the overpowering reek of advanced decay and rot ting flesh some of them recently dead were in their graveclothes but others had been dead for a long time they flopped over the cemetery wall squelched out of its gate shuffled or crawled across the road and then they were knocking at the door of the house seeking entry darcy thought he was going mad but knowing harrys talent and knowing now that his child was also a necroscope he had to accept the truth of it at which he made to go downstairs and let them in can you imagine it darcy was going to let a horde of walking corpses into this house of horror but in the end it didnt come to that something happened that he just couldnt take and he passed out and we learned the rest of it later from harry himself harry junior had already taken his mother to ebranch hq via the mobius continuum the dead people attacked bodescu in the garret flat and despite that he was wamphyri he didnt stand a chance against them for after all they had nothing to lose changing his bodyshape to an airfoil he crashed through the window but one of the dead was a marksman and put a crossbow bolt in his spine crippled he fell to earth they found him in the cemetery staked him down cut off his head and burned him thats the story nathan looked at him and nodded and well told he said but maybe the dead in that graveyard could have told it even better i think i should speak to them theres a lot to learn about my father and theyre the only ones who know the only ones who really know do you want us to go with you zek knew he didnt i think i might prefer to be alone nathan answered i can concentrate better also i get the feeling that the dead dont like it when other people are listening in so to speak your minders will be there trask reminded him as long as they keep well back nathan answered but you know the night time is their time the dead yes when the world is quiet thats when they come into their own whats left of it then feeling zeks eyes on him her telepathic probe he looked at her the night time was harrys time too she told him and in profile when you smile in that ohsosad way of yours you jook fust like him except at the end his eyes glowed red in the dark and in a little while know how dangerous your world is nathan for ive been there but you know this one can be dangerous too in so many ways so when youre on your own promise me youll be careful that was twice someone had asked him to be careful in as many hours it made him feel wanted made him feel good its a promise he answered as long as youll promise to take me to see pythagoras in the greek islands her eyes opened wider and jazz oh yes jazz too deal she said trask had been watching them the way their eyes locked now he grinned if a little uncertainly and told zek hes way too young for you zek patted his hand across the table and hes married she reminded him whats more hes a telepath and we generally dont get on too well together so consider yourself lucky ben trask consider yourself lucky can i suddenly he was more than halfserious zeks smile was warm on him can we talk about it later she said but the look in her eyes was different from when she was looking at nathan and suddenly trasks heart felt light as a youths in the arms of his first love of all men he knew the truth when he saw it that night nathan talked to the dead in the hartlepool cemetery on the blackball road and of course they remembered harry keogh his father but there was no reticence in them now the great majority wanted to make up for lost time they felt nathans natural warmth took him to their hearts and poured their loneliness on him until he felt weighed under by it until he felt indeed very much as harry had used to feel before him for if being a necroscope had a drawback this was it the fact that friends are not just for helping but also for being helped and while there were millions of them there was only one nathan in the ancient hartlepool graveyard however with all of its leaning mossgrown slabs their numbers were not so great that he couldnt cope for a little while at least and while he didnt learn a lot about harry keogh nathans honesty and humility did cement a friendship which would last as long as memory and the memories of the teeming dead are long indeed towards the end when the cold and a swirling ground mist had seeped so deep into his bones that he began to feel a part of the inscribed marble slab where he sat a small shy deadspeak voice said to him nathan do you think you could help me please it was a girlchilds voice but a voice filled with such sadness nathans heart ached for her if i can he told her but who are you my name is cynthia she told him i am i was seven that wasnt very long ago but my bones were sick and wouldnt make bjood for me and so i died but even before that my mummy and daddy were so worried about me at school i didnt make friends very we and they couldnt bear that was lonely so i know theyll be worried even more now because theyll think i have no friends at all but you can tell them that i do you can tell them i have lots of friends nathan thought about it and was stalled for ideas his new friends saw his indecision his helplessness and tried to help him out cynthia he heard them saying to her the necroscope is a busy man he just cant be at everyones beck and call he has his duties in the living world too you know and anyway how can he possibly tell your mummy and daddy that youve spoken to him they dont know that were down here in the ground still thinking our thoughts their argument made sense but still it seemed a cold one to nathan let it be he told them and to cynthia herself little darling if theres some way i can tell them i will and ill be sure to let you know that ive told them except youll have to tell me where they live and their second name and then well then theres something ill want from you in payment payment a small favour thats all just ask it a kiss he said just one right here and a moment later it was as if an angel had touched nathans cheek and in the air he seemed to smell the soft sad scent of soap and tears and innocence when nathan left the graveyard he was a man with a new mission just one more task among all the others hed set himself which to most men might seem very insignificant in the greater scheme of things to him however it seemed the most important thing in the world so that by the time he reached the hotel he knew what he must do about it he found trask and zek in the bar enjoying latenight cocktails and told them what he wanted to do now tonight trask checked his watch it was just after eleven right now nathan nodded why should they hurt any more than they have to but do you think theyll be up and about i mean will they still be awake at this hour trask didnt know what else to say his mind had been elsewhere nathan knew it and forgave him oh yes theyll be awake theyll be sitting there in their lonely home thinking remembering grieving for you see they havent been getting a lot of sleep nor are they likely to unless we help them zek said let me get my coat and trask and nathan sat in silence waiting for her they drove through light latenight traffic to an address on the outskirts of town a finelooking house with a gravel drive wellstocked gardens and a play corner with swings a slide and a tree house the place seemed in good order yet had a hardtodefine air of desolation or perhaps not so hard to define downstairs the lights were on in the living room whose glass patio doors looked out on the road and in that room a man and woman sat facing each other apparently in silence across a table their shoulders were hunched and they rested their heads in their hands parking a little way down the road and turning off his lights trask asked should i come with you but zek shook her head thanks ben she said softly but you might distract us nathan indicated a second car which passed them and came to a halt some fifty yards farther down the road perhaps you could speak to those two instead sure trask nodded as the two telepaths headed quietly back towards the house and when they got there will they see us zek whispered no nathan shook his head we see them because of the light in there but out here its dark and anyway they dont see much of anything any more and they dont think very much of anything either except cynthia which should make it that much easier what do you want me to do just give me your strength boost my telepathy help me get through to them im ready when you are nathan had given it a lot of thought he knew what to do what to say now he said and reached out with his mind to the couple inside the house their grief was enormous and nathan knew it for what it was when he had thought that his mother brother and especially misha were dead he had felt the same grief almost but with him there had always been a hope however slim that somehow they had lived through that terrible time and indeed they had but cynthia was undeniably dead and her parents knew it they had seen her through her illness fighting it all the way theyd stood beside her bed to be with her when she drew her last breath and it was just as nathan had explained it to trask all of the remembering the grieving and thinking of sad thoughts was still in them and all of the wondering about cynthia now where and how she was now it was in fact the way it is for everyone who grieves to see someone in the street who looks like the one who has gone and to wonder why this one is here and the other missing for despite that cynthia was dead it was too recent she just couldnt be dead missing yes but not dead not possibly not while other kids while everyone else lived nathan listened a while until he couldnt take any more of it and then only to this world he told them in both of their minds at one time shes only dead to this world who the husband looked at his young wife what her eyes were big and round and with all the force and feeling nathan could muster yet with compassion too that same compassion which had made his father the champion of the dead and with zek coupling her own telepathic drive to his he told them you are right she jives but in worlds beyond where she has friends galore dont ask about it but believe she can be happy there if she knows that you are happy here cynthias father shot to his feet moved quickly yet stumblingly about the room knocked a small coffee table over in his haste he searched in vain for of course there was no one there and in my head he said mine too his wife cried in both your heads nathan said now do you beheve its a very simple thing called faith cried the woman fainting her husband caught her before she could fall and looked up looked all about the empty room i i never believed but now you do yes oh yes then shell be happy but where in worlds beyond except you must never think of following her nathan cautioned for youre forbidden until your natural time and then shell be waiting but not alone for all of her friends are waiting with her the man let himself down onto a couch with his wife in his arms who are you he sobbed then a friend of cynthias nathan answered simply just one of of a great many and as the man began sobbing and crying god forgive me that i havent believed thank you thank you so nathan withdrew his telepathic probe on their way back to the car zek said will they be all right well return at first light and see nathan answered they did and they saw wood smoke rose from the chimney and the husband was in the garden in his shirt sleeves dismantling the swing cynthia wouldnt be needing it any more not now that she was with her friends in the worlds beyond in a little while as they watched the mans wife came out of the house and threw her arms round his neck talking and holding tight they moved inside returning to the hotel nathan requested that trask park for a moment or two outside the cemetery in blackball road then as they drove off again her mother and father will be fine now the necroscope sighed relaxing and closing his eyes in the back of the car and so will cynthia back at the hotel a special branch man came running from his anonymouslooking car sir trask could tell by the look on his face that it was important what is it message urgent came in over our radio he handed over a note and went back to his car trask watched him go thinking his is not to question why then he read the note for bravotango golftango requests to speak to you about tangotango at your earliest suggest you use a blender preferably ours deltacharlie it was david chung telling him that gustav turchin wanted to chinwag about turkur tzonov asap blender was branch jargon for a communications scrambler viii doors the drive down to london was uneventful back at ebranch hq at three oclock in the afternoon trask got turchin onscreen also in the background and slightly out of focus the ministry responsibles man in moscow the russian premier was short blocky apparently unshakable in his position he had to be currently he presided over food riots in kazakhstan massive radiation pollution in the black sea terrorism in the ukraine mafiastyle gang wars in moscow itself and minor territorial and border disputes just about everywhere and now this turchin said his words clipped pared to a minimum allowing for no misunderstanding no misrepresentation in response to your timely warning i found a way to access certain restricted information so far as i am able to ascertain your fears with regard to a highranking official of the usss security services no let us simply say turkur tzonov are borne out apparently there is some evidence of modest weapon shipments to the perchorsk project and modest trask put in im sorry mr president but we saw more than a modest arms cache in perchorsk in fact please turchin held up a hand i have a good idea of what you saw but modest yes in terms of the ordnance of a fullscale war but sufficient trask wouldnt be put off to mount an invasion on a technologically defunct country or world and lets face it there is no other requirement not in perchorsk the precautions against any kind of incursion from the gate are more than adequate as they stand so why why is the big question mr trask yes i have to agree turchin had gone very quiet which warned trask that even his diplomatic patience had its limits his dark eyes were glinting under bushy black eyebrows and his thin lips had tightened please let me finish and in a moment i did say that your fears were wellfounded did i not indeed i have had my eye several eyes on mr tzonov for quite some time alas it is not my position to prosecute but merely to advise in certain circumstances prosecution when the evidence is to hand then there will be time enough to but not yet again trask interrupted tm sorry mr president but surely time is of the essence tzonov is known to have megalomaniac tendencies and in at least one instance we know him to be guilty of murder or at the very least attempted murder siggi dam the premier paused and his lips tightened more yet is missing yes he halfturned from the screen then faced it headon fled to the west according to turkur tzonov rather than face an inquiry into her part in the escape of an alien from perchorsk but didnt we tell you that would be his excuse yes turchin nodded and as excuses go it would appear to be a good one for after all you do have the alien the alien trask countered hes here of course but if he hadnt been treated like an animal not to mention threatened with tzonovs machine he could just as easily be there in moscow ergo nathan the alien is where he wants to be but isnt that his right in a europe with no borders or passports or persecution and isnt it obvious how tzonov would build all of those old barriers again and draw an iron curtain across the world if he were given the chance to further his cause dont give him that chance sir i dont intend to he is under scrutiny both tzonov and his cause the glint in turchins eyes was now dangerous but slowlyslowly catchee monkey mr trask slowlyslowly thats an old one trask wound down a little allowed himself the luxury of a strained smile but if i may advise not too slowly tzonovs cause yes turchin didnt acknowledge trasks smile treason if were correct but he has many tentacles reaching out into almost every province of the uss i can see how eventually he might even use insurrection to further his ambitions if he could find a way to fund it indeed trask nodded and i think he believes that he has found just such a way sunsidestarside is rich in gold there its a common metal but just as i have my what informers so he has his spies too turchin still didnt appear to be listening too well but just looking at him trasks liedetector told him that he was in fact he controls some of our best intelligence agents mindspies mr trask in your parlance or perhaps the opposition in the old days yes and tzonov would bring those old days back again except we cant allow that which anyone but a raving lunatic or a megalomaniac must surely see but the damage he could do in the attempt is unthinkable i know he could destroy what weve all been trying to rebuild for fifteen years and in so doing destroy my country my apologies sir trask shook his head but you seem to have missed the point much as i appreciate your concern for your country my concern is for the whole world to be frank i wouldnt mind a bit if turkur tzonov went through the gate into starside tonight i would quite like it if i could guarantee that he wasnt going to come back or that if he did come back it would be as a man its not what he plans to steal from the vampire world that worries me but the fact that hell advertise this world to whatever is waiting in there for him thats what really worries me that hell bring something back inside him for a moment turchin was silent thoughtful then he said is the threat really that terrible and trask told him i know as much about it as any man of this world and you may believe me that there is no greater threat the gates are doorways to pestholes they could release a plague that would sweep across the entire planet and destroy or enslave each and every one of us eventually we must find a way to seal those gates forever even the perchorsk solution isnt good enough no way not with men like tzonov around and especially not with him in charge of it why not simply recall him get him out of there give him a job in moscow where you can keep an eye on him now it was turchins turn to smile however grimly ah if only it were that easy but do you know how limited my real resources are if i told you you wouldnt believe me and you advise me to recall him tzonov comes and goes as he pleases mr trask hes a power in his own right and the last thing i want to do is frighten him perhaps precipitating whatever he intends he shrugged but not negligently please dont forget perchorsk is a fortress trask was mystified so if weve already reached the same conclusions why are we having this conversation turchin sighed perhaps wearily and his shoulders slumped a little i love my country too he finally said i mean i love it as well as tzonov no better than tzonov because i love it for itself not for myself and so i am torn two ways you are worried about the wamphyri quite right so should we all but there is also this question of the exploitation of another world what im asking is which is the greater worry as you and everyone else knows my country has been desperately depleted could it be youre afraid well get there first and that russia will be strong again trask shook his head maybe in disgust perhaps in disbelief let me repeat myself he said getting there isnt the problem containing whats there already is if we i mean if ebranch ever has cause to send men into that vampire world it will be as a last resort or an attempt to destroy the wamphyri at their source it will not be for exploitation and youll let me know if that time should come youll be the first to know very well and in future we must speak like this face to face on a more regular basis we might very well have to trask told him as for now well as you can see i have a great many things to do im sure you do trask replied throughout the ministry responsibles man had remained a blurred silent figure in the background days became weeks became months nathan was so immersed in his studies he scarcely noticed the days flying by but that was a cliche for of course he noticed them and indeed they flew seven complete cycles to one of sunsides the sheer velocity of the sun across the sky was a neverending wonder to him he could actually see it move he studied engines but only those which would have application on sunside steamengines fascinated him especially and he acquired a tiny model to take home with him the benefits to the thyre would be enormous couple a thing such as this to the longdead artisan shaekens wheel of irrigation why the furnace deserts could be made to bloom nathan could see it clearly in the eye of his mind with a bank of wonderful thyre mirrors focused on the boiler of an engine through all the long hours of daylight not to mention the heat of the desert itself the requirement for solid fuel would be minimal and as for water no lack of that with shaekens water ram and hydraulic hoist and the great dark river to draw upon where it coursed its way through black bowels of rock deep beneath the surface he looked at agriculture the incredible variety of cultivated vegetables and remembered the tales lardis lidesci had told of the dwellers garden its wonderful produce and every chance that came his way he procured seeds to take back with him oh the szgany grew their own crops be sure but never in such abundance with the consistency yield and high quality of these the potato was quite amazing and completely unheard of on sunside he went from maths to science dynamics which was simply another branch or rather the application of numbers and he enjoyed it for here at last nathan could see that they could be applied but of course no more guesswork required to work out how many cogs were required on a wheel the baffling mathematics of circles was a mystery no more not with the principle of n fixed firmly in his head he undertook all of these studies with gusto for this was the knowledge these were the benefits he would take home with him but not all the benefits and not all of them harmless for he also studied weapons and practised with a variety of handguns semiautomatics shotguns submachineguns and grenades on an ailbut obsolete army firing range in the old garrison town of aldershot last but not least nathan practised his deadspeak except now it was easy for the teeming dead talked back to him without reservation however unintentionally he had done himself the greatest possible favour in going to the aid of poor little cynthia in the hartlepool cemetery it stood him in great stead for the dead knew now beyond a shadow of a doubt that they had found a new champion in nathan whatever his fight or quest was or would be from this time forward it would also be theirs frequent trips to hartlepool harden edinburgh and all of the many graveyards which harry keogh had frequented furnished him with an almost complete picture of the man who had been his father the man whom the dead had known as the necroscope and despite what harry had been at the end nathan was not ashamed of him for not one of harrys many dead friends had a bad word for him and as a man they regretted the fact that theyd ever turned their backs on him in every possible way the dead put themselves at nathans command he received introductions to members of the great majority in many lands and only had to reach out his mind to find them however far distant along with all of his new scientific knowledge his esoteric talent grew apace almost as if to accommodate the unaccustomed demands he placed upon it and whenever he met with difficulties the dead were there to help out except in the one area where their help would be most appreciated for not one of them knew harrys greatest secret or was able to offer a clue as to where nathan might find the answer the metaphysical mobius continuum seemed as far from his grasp as ever and suddenly it was the middle of may the changing seasons astonished nathan but all in all his senses were becoming used to abrupt changes the everchanging concrete scenery of the cities eyeblurring transport systems such as cars trains subways and airplanes the dramatic variety of the countryside especially the coastal regions of the northeast with their crumbling shale cliffs brooding grey ocean and plaintive seagulls a species unknown on sunside and a hundred other concepts away and beyond all previous experience now he was much more given to taking things in his stride the one thing he was not ready for because he had put it out of his mind was that which trask sprang on him one tuesday morning in the middle of the month the resurgent tributary at radujevac is down to its lowest level in five years trask told him waking him up in his fathers old room ive arranged our flight to belgrade for a week friday anna marie english has been out there for months now and shes really got things moving she tells me that our potholers have been up the sump to the gate they can get you there with all the stuff youve been gathering together weapons ammunition anything you can carry plus all that youve learned of course locked away in your head but not the thing i most wanted to learn what trask had said was still dawning on nathan he was still waking up blinking sleep out of his eyes and will some of your men be coming with me no trask shook his head weve made a deal with gustav turchin we sit still until turkur tzonov makes his move if he makes it meanwhile men loyal to turchin are infiltrating perchorsk turchin thinks he can stop tzonov right there on his own ground nathan paused in getting dressed to blurt out i hope he fails to stop him id like to meet up with that man in my own world better by far id like some of its inhabitants to meet up with him for by comparison turkur tzonov is only a very small monster still thinking about siggi if siggi dam went through into starside deprived of her senses her mind by that machine nathan shook his tousled head then thinking about her really wont do us much good but i would like the chance to avenge her yes take care of your own first nathan was trasks advice for if theres any justice in the world and its my experience that there is tzonov has enough of hard times coming without your help and as he headed for the door zek wants you to have breakfast with her down in the hotel something thats important to her and nathan knew what it was three days later they flew out to the greek islands nathans main interest was samos the teeming dead had told him pythagoras was there buried on the self same island where hed been born it would be nathans last shot at speaking to an expert one of the greatest ever experts who might yet help him oh he had spoken to a good many mathematicians orthodox and lateral thinkers alike but the numbers vortex had baffled them all no less than it had baffled j g hannant it was the way the thing mutated the way it wouldnt sit still not for a moment to let itself be studied and anyway how could you ever be sure you were studying the right part of it zeks interest of course was jazz simmons her husbands grave was in zakynthos close to her villa and midmay in the greek islands is a wonderful time it would be nathans chance to rest and recuperate while she would have the opportunity to say those few extra things which at the end shed never had the time to say to jazz he knew them anyway of course he did but a last fond farewell couldnt hurt ben trask had wanted to accompany the pair but when zek declined he had understood he hadnt been thinking that was all for despite all that had happened all of the accumulated evidence and the evidence of his own liedetector talent it was just no it was stijj a very hard thing for trask to believe in nathans art what he was and did as it would be for any man who was not himself a necroscope but this was zeks last chance to be together with jazz and ben had to accept that at least samos between the aegean and the dodecanese proved to be an exercise in frustration finally nathan tracked down a disciple of pythagoras who had come to his own conclusions about the masters mysticism and dropped out of the brotherhood and so the location of pythagorass grave was discovered when they got close nathan went on alone and as he reached the spot a small olive grove on a terraced hillside above a headland with a tiny white church so he felt a far dim deadspeak presence far in the sense of mentally remote and dim in that of a deep deep sleep in a living man this would be catatonia in pythagoras shortly returning to zek nathan told her it isnt any good hes way beyond my reach j g hannant was right pythagoras couldnt face the greater knowledge of the modern world the fact that science had outdistanced him he discovered that while his calculations were right his theology was all wrong unable to come to terms with it he retreated into his own doctrines yet in fact he has achieved a metempsychosis of sorts but instead of migrating soul to soul pythagoras has fled into the core of his own mind to him numbers were the all and so at last hes satisfied with his lot finally he is the first and last number a big cipher the great zero they took a hydrofoil to zakynthos zeks island home in the ionian and a taxi from zante town through porto zoro and along a winding rising road that followed the mountains contours to the southeast there where treeclad spurs descended into the incredibly blue ocean zek kept her villa harry keoghs final refuge at the end of his time here then briefly they were free of nathans minders the special branch men had been left behind in the port of zante where it had taken them longer than theyd anticipated to collect their hirecar but in the afternoon when the cool shadows of the mountains sprawled down across the pineclad slopes to paint the sea dark green and nathan and zek sat out on her balcony with coffee and liqueurs they were aware of the glint of chrome on the road up above where a last beam of sunlight struck between the peaks and they knew that their guardian angels were back nathan had the guest bedroom the following morning before he was awake zek got out her car and drove into town to replenish her refrigerator hearing her return nathan rose showered and got dressed by then the villa was full of great smells and he found zek in the breakfast room where she greeted him with a few of your favourite things namely coffee eggs and bacon and when they had eaten jazz he said carefully could we now she seemed uncertain whenever youre ready ive been thinking what to say to him i know he told her gently i lay awake for the best part of an hour last night listening to you tossing and turning in your room it wont be the same for me either not this time because its personal because i know how much you miss him but do you know what you want to say to him did you work it out i think so yes theres not a lot really all i have to do is not hint at whats come between us i mean nothing came between us in life not ever not even the wamphyri until the end of life itself i have to remember that and try not to cry dryings not like me not that hell hear me anyway i have to just talk to him through you as if as if he were jazz i mean he is jazz and yet it cant be like a simple telephone call it was the first time hed seen her distraught and very unlikely that hed ever see it again zek was a strong woman she saw the look on his face the sadness for her in his eyes and turned away and nathan told her it wont be as hard as you think deadspeak can be made to convey more than is actually said its a matter of feelings as well as words well use telepathy you and i so that were closer jazz wont hear telepathy but that way ill be able to straighten out your thoughts if they get tangled and relay his to you without any pain if there is pain but from what i know of him from what ive heard jazz was built of much the same stuff as you it will be all right she turned back to him will it there was hope in her eyes he nodded and smiled yes im sure it will be and he was sure for he would make it so some hours later on the way to her car zek paused by a leaning mediterranean pine to gaze out over the sea we loved this view she said nathan could well understand that there was nothing he wouldnt give to have misha here right now looking out over that marvellous ocean with him no sight shed ever seen in all sunside could ever compare with it zek had fallen silent glancing at her nathan saw that she was frowning he followed her gaze to a boat at the edge of the water directly below a caique she said the first of the holidaymakers they hire boats and find secluded bays like the one down there occasionally they climb up through the trees picnic leave stuff behind and generally spoil things there are more of them every year i dont think ill be able to live here much longer not on my own i thought i could but she stumbled to a halt nathan believed he understood this had been their place and magical but the boat was reality stealing away the last of the magic it spoiled zeks solitude lets go and see jazz he said between porto zoro and argasi they turned off the road onto a pebble track through the trees there on a rocky promontory a small white church shone like alabaster in the midday sunlight and was reflected in the sparkling waters of the bight between the trees and the pebble beach a graveyard was laid out in neat regularly tended plots all of this well off the tourist beat in as tranquil a spot as may be imagined jazz liked to fish for grouper just off the point there zek explained and when he knew it was all over he chose this place himself and so they went to jazzs grave and nathan made it easy for them for both of them at the end when shed said it all and couldnt hide the tears any longer zek walked out of the cemetery and onto the beach and stood at the edge of the sea and nathan told jazz were going now it was nice of you to come jazz answered and its great what youve done for zek know that harry would be proud of you but listen i dont like her hurting and lonely so do me a big favour if the time comes when someone really cares see to it that she doesnt feel guilty i mean tell her not to fee guilty let her know that only want her to be happy nathan nodded if im still here when if that happens then you have my promise but not until then of course thats good enough for me said jazz nathan left zek on the beach to get done with it in her own way and walked back to the car before leaving he noticed that the caique from zeks place was drawn up on the pebbles but there was no one in it and before reaching zeks car he saw a glint of chrome in a grove of olive trees and knew that his minders were there then looking closer he saw one of them or the arms of one of them sticking out from both sides of the bole of a gnarled old tree the hands were on the ground resting on their knuckles the man must be sunbathing but his hands were so still and in the car the second special branch man seemed asleep behind the steering wheel suddenly nathans blood was running cold sensing that something was wrong he reached out a telepathic probe there were other minds in the vicinity but strange minds and furtive recently nathan had used telepathy in partial conjunction with deadspeak instinctively he switched to the latter mode and the confused astonished utterly terrified minds of his minders were there they were dead he stepped to the tree and round it there sitting in the sun with his shirt open the chest of the man on the ground was drenched in blood he sat in a pool of his own blood his eyes and mouth were open in a frozen gasp but a second mouth gaped scarlet under his chin and adams apple nathan didnt need to look at the one in the car zek he aimed a probe towards the beach nathan she was there at once saw what was in his mind the monstrous picture he painted and added her own knowledge to it a man no two men in the water they must have got here in the caique they have spearguns and their thoughts are murderous theyre under orders from turkur tzonov there are others here he told her in the trees im coming and he raced for the beach in the greek islands it was pm but at ebranch hq london it was two hours earlier and the cadaverous lan goodly had just stepped out of the elevator as he did so he reeled gasped and clutched at his temples david chung was in the corridor he grabbed goodlys arm supported him said lan what is it hharrys room the other rasped yeah chung nodded licking suddenly dry lips me too they went there and met the empath geoff smart coming the other way smarts face was drawn eyes startled hands shaking as he hurried up to them i he began but we know they told him almost in one voice in harrys room goodly told chung i saw you plugging in the computer you me geoff we were all here and its now i mean you have to do it now chung said its nathans earring he showed it to them you cant see it but its vibrating in the palm of my hand i ive never had signs so clear before but im damned if i know what it means plug in the machine smart said and maybe well find out and as chung made to do so goodly said i dont think nathan ever used the computer after that last time the time it used itself i dont think he dared he said something to me once about saving what was left of it but im still not sure what he meant the screen blazed into life and chung fell away from the socket sprawling on the floor and on the screen the numbers vortex blazed into life golden equations rotated calculi careened common numbers collided in a frenzy of motion and all in brilliant yellow or glowing gold against a jetblack background but in the next moment the picture slowed and froze one massive incredible calculation remained but such a calculation that no one in the room could even conceive of the question let alone the answer then that answer revealed itself as the symbols flowed together and fused forming a threedimensional shape a golden dart which sped from the screen like a fish jumping from water it was some kind of hologram or a computer graphic brought to life a mass of electrical motes hanging in midair forming that translucent and patently insubstantial spike shape but however faint and transientseeming the thing might seem still it was real for a brief moment the dart paused hovered then sped in a blur of motion out through the wall and was gone and before a man of the three could move the computer exploded blowing apart in a flash of fire and a shower of hot plastic and electrical sparks it left the three espers staggered mouths gaping cringing back from the reeking blacksmoking mess of the console something plucked at nathans shirtsleeve as he raced across the pebble beach and a moment later he heard the phut phut exclamations of a silenced automatic zek was running towards him along the beach behind her one man was in the water and the other climbing up onto dry land they were in silver wetsuits and carried spearguns there was only one avenue of escape towards the northern end of the beach nathan angled his lowcrouching lope to meet up with zek where she headed that way but as more bullets zipped overhead he knew they werent going to make it both ends of the beach were closed off by rocky spurs that sloped gradually into the sea the rocks were sharp and dangerous climbing the pair would be slowed down they would make excellent targets against the black volcanic rock into the water nathan shouted he knew zek could swim like a fish and it seemed their only possible route hearing him and tearing off her dress she launched herself across the tideline and hit the water in a long low dive and in another moment nathan joined her back along the beach the wetsuited man on the rocks slid back into the water hard as you cari go nathan gasped get rid of your trousers she told him cool as a breeze in his mind zek was no stranger to dangerous situations now that the emotional times were behind her she could think like the old zek again you cant swim well in trousers but nathan was no stranger to danger either i already got rid of them then use telepathy you cant swim and talk but you can swim and think bullets plucked small spouts of water up from the millpond surface close by and dive he told her it was no good and they both knew it the men in wetsuits were already narrowing down the distance they wore fins which powered them through the water and on the beach two more men in grey suits were sighting along the barrels of squat ugly silenced automatics they could hear the thoughts of all four which were cold emotionless deadly these were professionals of a high order and so far the fugitives had been lucky coming up for air nathan saw large silver shapes cutting white wakes on the glittering surface and the men on the beach were shouting directions to their colleagues in the water this wasnt going to last much longer there were more muffled gunshots and something sliced a groove in the rounded muscle of nathans shoulder blood splashed among the blue he felt no pain but gritted his teeth anyway and asked are you ok yes but he knew she wasnt knew that she was very nearly exhausted then dive again surprise and shock had conspired to rob them of their natural energies this would be the last time they went down and they probably wouldnt be coming up again as zek upended and headed for the bottom she saw black flippers sliding under the surface only a short distance away on the beach the two exkgb men saw their prey dive for the second time glanced at each other and nodded a mutual affirmation it was very nearly over then as one of them put away his gun the other sniffed sharply wrinkled up his nose and said shit i smell shit or something we must be close to a sewage outfall the other shrugged so it wont matter a hell of a lot if we add to it right those two are done for he inclined his head towards the sea weighted down it wont take very long for them to turn to slop out there a hand fell on the speakers shoulder and he jumped six inches then fell into a halfcrouch as he turned and brought up his gun but even as he had moved hed seen that hand those shrivelled dirtingrained blacknailed fingers and hed smeljed them behind the killers a handful of figures came stum bling down the beach from the graveyard their leader was jazz simmons but a jazz long gone into corruption and one who had known what it meant when nathans minders had come suddenly among the great majority and now through the trees those minders too were on their feet and running for the beach running yes and full of purpose for their muscles werent wasted like the others and they still had a job to do and what theyd done in life they would continue to do in death one of them with a pair of bloody holes through his jacket and heart the other grinning ear to ear but grinning hideously with the mouth in his face and one other larger mouth in his throat but on the beach phut phut phut three bullets went through the rotten substance of jazz at close range and the man who fired them going vrk yaaaghh akkk as the grimy bones of one of jazzs skeletal hands tightened on his windpipe forcing him to his knees then jazz took the gun from him and thrust its silenced barrel into his gaping mouth as far as it would go and pulled the trigger and the other thug splashed with his comrades blood and brains gibbering and flailing where he retreated into the sea finally tripping and going under as a host of shroudclad avengers fell on him sat on him held him down where his air came belching to the surface in a gush of frothing bubbles theyd sit there mute but determined until the bubbles stopped and the figure on the bottom lay motionless and they did while out in the bay where the water was deep nathan and zek had got separated he found himself diving into a weedfestooned crevice while she hid between boulders on a pebbly bottom and looked back the way theyd come their pursuers were there searching unrelenting cold nathan had disturbed a small school of golden bream which scattered magically to avoid him and hed also disturbed a large grouper whose sudden startled motion filled the crevice with a mushrooming cloud of silt one of the men in wetsuits saw the eruption of muck from the crevice and came nosing speargun held to the fore nathan needed air he couldnt stay in here any longer he had to make a run for it but run he couldnt even swim he was done for he drifted up out of the crevice and into full view of whoever might be waiting for him he felt naked there had been times in the past when nathan had used the numbers vortex to hide himself now instinctively despite that it wouldnt work because it wasnt a physical device but of the mind he brought it into being in his head and as he did so saw a strange thing hovering just above the gash in the rocks the regrouped school of golden bream swung nervously this way and that and one of them wasnt a fish but a dart the thing tilted in the water seemed to aim its point at nathan sprang towards him it struck him in the forehead even as he jerked back his head but he felt nothing until a moment later when he felt something he saw the numbers vortex in the eye of his mind saw it freeze form a wall of numbers saw the numbers dissolve into a shape an oblong a door he could see it but he knew that no one else could for even as it formed water rushed into and through it and several of the golden bream passed through and were gone one of harrys doors yes a mobius door the man with the speargun came speeding trailing his gun to slipstream his body then beginning to draw his gun arm up and forward caught in the rush of water he shot forward into the door at which precise moment amazed by what was happening nathan relaxed his grip on the thing the door closed disappeared but the thug had passed only halfway through and the water turned red as the lower half of his body gave a massive shudder and stopped dead in the water then slowly began settling for the bottom as the lower torso sank trailing weird strings of guts and organs so a ring of silver wetsuit vest detached itself and floated away a severed hand was visible too drifting in the pink cloud releasing the speargun and posing like a strange fivefingered fish in the water nathan its over it was zek her thoughts filled with despair terror a sense of tragedy the knowledge that soon she too would be able to speak to jazz and it pulled nathan out of his shock the speargun was sinking he grabbed it turned in the water saw a trail of bubbles descending into dark deeps she was down there drowning dying but she was also in his mind her agony and it didnt have to be he didnt have to let it be with every last ounce of strength nathan kicked for the bottom two strokes of his free arm three and they came into view the thug could have shot her but hed dropped his gun and was satisfied to hold her down and drown her no he was more than satisfied he took pleasure in it nathan was behind him but there was no cowardice in it when he shot the man in his back it was simply a matter of expedience for zek was drowning jerking spastically forming a backwardsbending bow of agony the thug released zeks limp body and spiralled feebly into the deeps kicking up mud and weeds as he went nathan was all in he reached zek grabbed her and conjured the numbers vortex and froze it in a pattern which would soon become all too familiar a door formed sucked at the pressured water and sucked zek and nathan in too and at last he was there in the mobius continuum darkness nothing drowning where to go how to go space without stars without time without space and a gush of salt water emptying out of nathans mouth blobs of water great spheres of it colliding with him wobbling like jelly in the absence of gravity but in the distance oh far far away a point of golden light whether it was there physically or merely in his tortured mind nathan didnt know couldnt say but clutching zeks limp body to him he struck out for it fell towards it it grew bigger brighter it was a shape it was this shape itself on harrys room it was punched as by a massive fist and thrown open again and three hundred gallons of salt sea water came pouring through into the corridor david chung got the worst of it and was knocked from his feet he wasnt hurt but simply sprawled there with his fist clenched tightly on nathans earring except it no longer vibrated and chung knew why to confirm it from harrys room as the salty flood dispersed along the corridor nathans voice gasping his relief and a strangled coughing and gurgling as zek foener strove to throw up all of the water shed taken in and start to breathe again but as he rushed upon it so the thing dissolved into golden atoms and reformed into a door and together nathan and zek fell through it a moment earlier lan goodly the precog had shouted out get out of here and the three espers had scrambled for the door leaving it swinging behind them now on the inward swing as the door went to close epilogue in wrathstack olden starsides last great aerie of the wamphyri the lady wratha sat with her socalled colleagues and closest neighbours the doglord canker canison of mangemanse on her left and the necromancer nestor lichloathe of suckscar on her right the three were seated in chairs spread wide apart along one side of the banquet table in wrathstacks great hall while seated opposite the lords gorvi the guile of guilesump and wran the rage and his brother spiro killglance of madmanse glared their suspicion and wamphyri animosity across the broad black ironwood expanse wratha the risen had called this meeting and out of curiosity if for no other reason the vampire lords attended it there had been the usual banter a string of taunts ripostes and scarcely concealed challenges but now that her guests had settled down wratha made no bones of it but launched straight into her proposal i suspect im speaking the minds of all present she said when i tell you ive had enough of the szgany lidesci dont you agree isnt it high time we put aside lesser squabbles got together and wiped lardis and his band off the face of sunside only deal with the lidescis finish them for good the other tribes will succumb in a sixmonth and sunside will be ours to use as we will then well have all the good szgany flesh we need to fill the stack with fighting men and beasts and build an army invincible she sat back in her chair well ive said all that before and now ive said it for the last time thats me done and its your turn so tell me how shall it be and in a little while still empirebuilding are you wratha said wran scowling and stroking his wen what and will you bring us together again under your leadership aye and rob us of our get as once before you robbed us and gorvi the guile put in or is it that youve started to fear us now that our lieutenants are up to strength and our many warriors waxed for war what brings you to this wratha that you now counsel unity and cooperation among those youve so long abandoned at which in a voice so low it was almost a whisper nestor growled whats that you say about fear gorvi the gutless best remember when you speak to wratha like that youre also speaking to canker and me who fear no man for we are united frankly im sick of hearing how clever and artful you are when your only real forte is cowardice if it were my say id gladly cut you off down in the stinking roots of this place and let you rot there except to desert you would leave the stack undefended when if here apparently lost for words the necromancer paused gave a snort of disgust and sat back scowling in his chair gorvi smiled a typically sarcastic oily smile but made no answer but wran immediately suspicious snapped whats that you said about the stack being undefended if and when and then staring at wratha out with it lady whats all this about canker leaned forward in his chair and coughed me wran ask me what its about spiro killglance usually silent spoke up from directly opposite the doglord you then what goes on i read the future in dreams canker barked thats what goes on and i have dreamed of an aerial army circling the last aerie so many of them why they were like stinkgnats over goat droppings their flyers were a horde and their leader was vormulac there was a long silence then gorvis laugh but shaky for all that what and should we quiver and quake because you have deigned to dream hah and why pray should we place any faith in your dreams doglord all men nightmare and you more than most i should think and again wratha spoke laugh all you like but canker has the power to deny it is purest folly didnt we all laugh at his plan to call down a silver mistress from the moon aye we did and do we still laugh shes there even now in mangemanse maybe she came from the moon and maybe not but silver she is and real and cankers got her also nestor lichloathe here swears by cankers dreams for he is witness to the truth of them now listen i warned you long ago that vormulac would follow us out of turgosheim well he will and soon perhaps too soon will you be ready united to meet him face to face or would you prefer to hang from the battlements in chains and die in reek and smoulder with the rising sun she looked from face to face at each lord in his turn even nestor and canker and not a man of them said a word but sat there stonily in his chair with that last monstrous picture shed painted burning vividly in his mind so that at last wratha was satisfied and knew she would have her way in turgosheim in the first hour of sundown maglore the mage watched a menacing flypast of monsters a grand aerial parade through the gorges blustery upper regions level with its rim and the topmost promontory turret of runemanse vormulac unsleep had ordered the display so that he might review his armys fitness for war prior to its departure westward over the great red waste hopefully to olden starside and legendary lands of plenty for when next the sun sank down and darkness fell on the barrier mountains then the lord vormulac and his many lesser generals and all of their men mounts and warrior creatures would vacate turgosheim en masse hell bent for adventure discovery almost certainly war and definitely conquest and to the warriorlord vormulac of melancholy vormspire this had seemed as good a time as any tomass his forces and test out their battleworthiness in the air mainly it was a test of their flying skills in an ordered body for patently there could be no doubt but that they were fighting men and beasts they were vampires all or of vampire stuff at least even the moderately docile flyers were built of metamorphic flesh vampirized specifically to that end and as for the carnivore warriors so that in fact the pomp and ceremony of this grand aerial display was as much for the glory of vormulac as for any other reason it was his chance to drill and parade the lesser lords in his command and show them his might and it was their opportunity to rattle their battlegauntlets flex their muscles and feel the pride of their vampire heritage wamphyri and so maglore gazed out across the great gorge of turgosheim at gloomy vormspire with its pale orange chimney flares and glimmery ghostfires flickering in its windows and knew that vormulac stood on a balcony there watching the parade and the seerlord rejoiced for vormulac unsleep that soon he would fly off with his army into the unknown possibly to conquest and even greater glory indeed maglore revelled in the thought even more than vormulac himself but for different reasons entirely and round the rim in a mighty circle swept the myriad aerial creatures of vormulacs command men flyers and warriors all and maglore smiling and nodding his head as he recognized the various sigils standards and pennants held aloft to flutter in the hot exhaust of propulsive orifices and the tainted breeze of passage vormulacs own hanging man emblem lord grigor haksons rampant rod the virgin grandam devetakis grinscowl mask eran painscars spiny gauntlet zindevar cronesaps spitted pig and many another each contingent led by its master or mistress general in orderly ranks proud under its own banner and respectfully distanced from the next flight in line or group aflank the gleam of polished leather golden ornamentation ironstudded trappings the cacophony of gongs from all the manses and spires around the rattle of drums and blaring of golden horns and the bellowing cough and sputter of warrior exhausts all very grand and the seerlord hoped that vormulac took pleasure in the spectacle but as for maglore himself he would be glad when it was over and done with and even more so to see them gone from the gorge of turgosheim forever for once they were gone theyd never get back in again be sure ah but these were thoughts which he must keep to himself for a little while longer anyway indeed for while vormulac was powerful and dangerous he wasnt the only one with dreams of empire and in maglores book at least he certainly wasnt worthy of such dreams in suckscar the young lord nestor lichloathe of the wamphyri came yelping awake in his bed laved in the cold sweat of his nightmare and full of its terror even a lord of the wamphyri and a necromancer to boot terrified of a dream but this was in no way a rare complaint all men nightmare and vampires are no exception for however monstrous a man may become in his prime the dormant fears of his past will take root again and grow up huge in his dreams and always have the power to frighten him anew except what was nestor anyway but a young man even now there had scarcely been time for the fears of his childhood to mature into this also the terrors of his youth were long forgotten his youth entire forgotten in the main no this was a far more recent thing a recurrent dream which nestor had dreamed frequently too frequently ever since a certain disastrous night on sunside a dream which invariably unmanned him bringing him awake to this condition of mental agitation and uneasy premonitions of physical what decline it could be of course that hed supped too well there were fresh bloodstains on his pillow marking the spot where a lovethrall had lain until hed sent her away or perhaps his posture had been wrong had he slept on his arm he wondered until it too had gone to sleep whichever the dream or its prophetic nature was the reason he no longer slept in wrathas bed no not for all her heat and not from fear of her either rather for fear of himself getting up he paced the floor this way and that his arm still tingled his left arm and hand but for the moment he did not look at them and the nightmare still fresh in nestors mind or if not a nightmare as such a scene or memory out of the recent past a monstrous detail of that night hed spent on sunside in the camp in the camp of the lepers that grey shape standing beside his bed telling him where he was and nestor bolting upright grabbing the dangling arms of the others cowled robe empty sleeves which couldnt take his weight the way theyd torn at the shoulders to come away in nestors hands as he fell back onto the bed and the sight of the others twig arms with swollen fungus nubs for elbows now nestor looked at his left arm and hand the first grey blotches there on flesh which as yet had not quite taken on the leaden aspect of a lord of the wamphyri the numbness that came and went making his wrist and hand seem lifeless or at least insensitive impulsively he bit the ball of his thumb until the scarlet blood ran but even so it seemed to him it ran sluggishly and as for pain hed felt none of it but now before he could stop it the rest of his nightmare loomed up large as life in his minds eye not a fragment out of the past this time but a glimpse into the future possibly a lone shuffling figure slumped shoulders dangling arms and swaying head with chin on chest and a trail of footprints in the gathering dust of dereliction the forlorn track of the lone and lonely figure wandering like a lost soul through the empty echoing halls of deserted suckscar everyone fled save he and only the chittering bats for company now in the gloom of this hideous pesthole then in a chink of wan starlight where a mouldering curtain had been left open a crack the figure paused and almost as if sensing it were observed looked back and nestor seeing and recognizing that ravaged face those watery halfblind eyes blotched papery skin peeling from the ravaged bone fretted lips crumbling over black teeth in shrivelled gums he recognized the face of course for it was his next bloodwars invasion vasagis story the wrath of wratha necroscope v necromancer and more
