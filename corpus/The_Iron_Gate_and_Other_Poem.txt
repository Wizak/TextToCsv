the breakfast given in honor of dr holmess seventieth birthday by the publishers of the atlantic monthly boston december where is this patriarch you are kindly greeting not unfamiliar to my ear his name nor yet unknown to many a joyous meeting in days long vanished is he still the same or changed by years forgotten and forgetting dulleared dimsighted slow of speech and thought still oer the sad degenerate present fretting where all goes wrong and nothing as it ought old age the graybeard well indeed i know him shrunk tottering bent of aches and ills the prey in sermon story fable picture poem oft have i met him from my earliest day in my old aesop toiling with his bundle his load of sticks politely asking death who comes when called for would he lug or trundle his fagot for him he was scant of breath and sad ecclesiastes or the preacher has he not stamped the image on my soul in that last chapter where the wornout teacher sighs oer the loosened cord the broken bowl yes long indeed ive known him at a distance and now my lifted doorlatch shows him here i take his shrivelled hand without resistance and find him smiling as his step draws near what though of gilded baubles he bereaves us dear to the heart of youth to manhoods prime think of the calm he brings the wealth he leaves us the hoarded spoils the legacies of time altars once flaming still with incense fragrant passions uneasy nurslings rocked asleep hopes anchor faster wild desire less vagrant lifes flow less noisy but the stream how deep still as the silver cord gets worn and slender its lightened taskwork tugs with lessening strain hands get more helpful voices grown more tender soothe with their softened tones the slumberous brain youth longs and manhood strives but age remembers sits by the rakedup ashes of the past spreads its thin hands above the whitening embers that warm its creeping lifeblood till the last dear to its heart is every loving token that comes unbidden ere its pulse grows cold ere the last lingering ties of life are broken its labors ended and its story told ah while around us rosy youth rejoices for us the sorrowladen breezes sigh and through the chorus of its jocund voices throbs the sharp note of miserys hopeless cry as on the gauzy wings of fancy flying from some far orb i track our watery sphere home of the struggling suffering doubting dying the silvered globule seems a glistening tear but nature lends her mirror of illusion to win from saddening scenes our agedimmed eyes and misty daydreams blend in sweet confusion the wintry landscape and the summer skies so when the iron portal shuts behind us and life forgets us in its noise and whirl visions that shunned the glaring noonday find us and glimmering starlight shows the gates of pearl i come not here your morning hour to sadden a limping pilgrim leaning on his staff i who have never deemed it sin to gladden this vale of sorrows with a wholesome laugh if word of mine anothers gloom has brightened through my dumb lips the heavensent message came if hand of mine anothers task has lightened it felt the guidance that it dares not claim but o my gentle sisters o my brothers these thicksown snowflakes hint of toils release these feebler pulses bid me leave to others the tasks once welcome evening asks for peace time claims his tribute silence now is golden let me not vex the too long suffering lyre though to your love untiring still beholden the curfew tells me cover up the fire and now with grateful smile and accents cheerful and warmer heart than look or word can tell in simplest phrase these traitorous eyes are tearful thanks brothers sisters children and farewell vestigia quinque retrorsum an academic poem read at the commencement dinner of the alumni of harvard university june while fond sad memories all around us throng silence were sweeter than the sweetest song yet when the leaves are green and heaven is blue the choral tribute of the grove is due and when the lengthening nights have chilled the skies we fain would hear the songbird ere be flies and greet with kindly welcome even as now the lonely minstrel on his leafless bough this is our golden year its golden day its bridal memories soon must pass away soon shall its dying music cease to ring and every year must loose some silver string till the last trembling chords no longer thrill hands all at rest and hearts forever still a few gray heads have joined the forming line we hear our summons class of twentynine close on the foremost and alas how few are these the boys our dear old mother knew sixty brave swimmers twenty something more have passed the stream and reached this frosty shore how near the banks these fifty years divide when memory crosses with a single stride t is the first year of stern old hickory s rule when our good mother lets us out of school half glad half sorrowing it must be confessed to leave her quiet lap her bounteous breast armed with our dainty ribbontied degrees pleased and yet pensive exiles and a bs look back o comrades with your faded eyes and see the phantoms as i bid them rise whose smile is that its pattern nature gave a sunbeam dancing in a dimpled wave kirkland alone such grace from heaven could win his features radiant as the soul within that smile would let him through saint peters gate while sadeyed martyrs had to stand and wait here flits mercurial farrar standing there see mild benignant cautious learned ware and sturdy patient faithful honest hedge whose grinding logic gave our wits their edge ticknor with honeyed voice and courtly grace and willard larynxed like a double bass and channing with his bland superior look cool as a moonbeam on a frozen brook while the pale student shivering in his shoes sees from his theme the turgid rhetoric ooze and the born soldier fate decreed to wreak his martial manhood on a class in greek popkin how that explosive name recalls the grand old busby of our ancient halls such faces looked from skippons grim platoons such figures rode with iretons stout dragoons he gave his strength to learnings gentle charms but every accent sounded shoulder arms names empty names save only here and there some whitehaired listener dozing in his chair starts at the sound he often used to hear and upward slants his sundaysermon ear and we our blooming manhood we regain smiling we join the long commencement train one point first battled in discussion hot shall we wear gowns and settled we will not how strange the scene that noisy boydebate where embryospeakers learn to rule the state this broadbrowed youth sedate and sobereyed shall wear the ermined robe at taneys side and he the stripling smooth of face and slight whose slender form scarce intercepts the light shall rule the bench where parsons gave the law and sphinxlike sat uncouth majestic shaw ah many a star has shed its fatal ray on names we loved our brothers where are they nor these alone our hearts in silence claim names not less dear unsyllabled by fame how brief the space and yet it sweeps us back far far along our newborn historys track five strides like this the sachem rules the land the indian wigwams cluster where we stand the second lo a scene of deadly strife a nation struggling into infant life not yet the fatal game at yorktown won where failing empire fired its sunset gun langdon sits

as they flock together where late the boatman flashed his dripping oar the gull high floating like a sloop unladen lets the loose water waft him as it will the duck roundbreasted as a rustic maiden paddles and plunges busy busy still i see the solemn gulls in council sitting on some broad icefloe pondering long and late while overhead the homebound ducks are flitting and leave the tardy conclave in debate those weighty questions in their breasts revolving whose deeper meaning science never learns till at some reverend elders look dissolving the speechless senate silently adjourns but when along the waves the shrill northeaster shrieks through the laboring coasters shrouds beware the pale bird kindling like a christmas feaster when some wild chorus shakes the vinous air flaps from the

fishy carcase has no virtue in it the gunning idiots worthless hire to pay shrewd is our bird not easy to outwit him sharp is the outlook of those pinhead eyes still he is mortal and a shot may hit him one cannot always miss him if he tries he knows you sportsmen from suburban alleys stretched under seaweed in the treacherous punt knows every lazy shiftless lout that sallies forth to waste powder as he says to hunt i watch you with a patient satisfaction well pleased to discount your predestined luck the float that figures in your sly transaction will carry back a goose but not a duck

sinless sufferers pang forget or is thy dread accountbooks page so narrow its one long column scores thy creatures debt poor gentle guest by nature kindly cherished a world grows dark with thee in

the stony convent with its cross and beads how often gazing where a bird reposes rocked on the wavelets drifting with the tide i lose myself in strange metempsychosis and float a seafowl at a seafowls side from rain hail snow in feathery mantle muffled cleareyed stronglimbed with keenest sense to hear my mate soft murmuring who with plumes unruffled whereer i wander still is nestling near the great blue hollow like a garment oer me space all unmeasured unrecorded time while seen with inward eye moves on before me thoughts pictured train in wordless pantomime a voice recalls me from my window turning i find myself a plumeless biped still no beak no claws no sign of wings discerning in fact with nothing birdlike but my quill on the threshold introduction to a collection of poems bydifferent authors an usher standing at the door i show my white rosette a smile of welcome nothing more will pay my trifling debt why should i bid you idly wait like lovers at the swinging gate can i forget the wedding guest the veteran of the sea in vain the listener smites his breast there was a ship cries he poor fasting victim stunned and pale he needs must listen to the tale he sees the gilded throng within the sparkling goblets gleam the music and the merry din through every window stream but there he shivers in the cold till all the crazy dream is told not mine the graybeards glittering eye that held his captive still to hold my silent prisoners by and let me have my will nay i were like the threeyears child to think you could be so beguiled my verse is but the curtains fold that hides the painted scene the mist by mornings ray unrolled that veils the meadows green the cloud that needs must drift away to show the rose of opening day see from the tinkling rill you hear in hollowed palm i

see i looked upon this morning a brighthued feathered company of natures own adorning but ah those minstrels would not sing a listening ear while i lent the lark sat still and preened his wing the nightingale was silent i longed for what they gave me not their warblings sweet and fluty but grateful still for all i got i thanked them for their beauty a fairer vision meets my view of claras margarets marys in silken robes of varied hue like bluebirds and canaries the roses blush the jewels gleam the silks and satins glisten the black eyes flash the blue eyes beam we look and then we

we call funnel still fights the old south in the battle for life but weve opened our door to the west through the tunnel and weve cut off fort hill with our amazon knife you should see the new

his path a young asteroid found it as he sailed through the skies with the stars in his wake he thought t was the sun and kept circling around it till edison signalled youve made a mistake we are proud of our city her fastgrowing figure the warp and the woof of her brain and her hands but were proudest of all that her heart has grown bigger and warms with fresh blood as her girdle expands one lesson the rubric of conflict has taught her though parted awhile by wars earthrending shock the lines that divide us are written in water the love that unites us cut deep in the rock as well might the judas of treason endeavor to write his black name on the disk of the sun as try the bright starwreath that binds us to sever and blot the fair legend of many in one we love you tall sister the stately the splendid the banner of empire floats high on your towers yet ever in welcome your arms are extended we share in your splendors your glory is ours yes queen of the continent all of us own

of erin whose magic has bound us thy wand for one moment we fondly would claim entranced while it summons the phantoms around us that blush into life at the sound of thy name the telltales of memory wake from their slumbers i hear the old song with its tender refrain what passion lies hid in those honeyvoiced numbers what perfume of youth in each exquisite strain the home of my childhood comes back as a vision hark hark a soft chord from its songhaunted room t is a morning of may when the air is elysian the syringa in bud and the lilac in bloom we are clustered around the clementi piano there were six of us then there are two of us now she is singing the girl with the silver soprano how the lord of the valley was false to his vow let erin remember the echoes are calling through the vale of avoca the waters are rolled the exile laments while the nightdews falling the morning of life dawns again as of old but ah those warm lovesongs of fresh adolescence around us such raptures celestial they flung that it seemed as if paradise breathed its quintessence through the seraphtoned lips of the maiden that sung long hushed are the chords that my boyhood enchanted as when the smooth wave by the angel was stirred yet still with their music is memory haunted and oft in my dreams are their melodies heard i feel like the priest to his altar returning the crowd that was kneeling no longer is there the flame has died down but the brands are still burning and sandal and cinnamon sweeten the air ii the veil for her bridal young summer is weaving in her azuredomed hall with its tapestried floor and spring the last teardrop of maydew is leaving on the daisy of burns and the shamrock of moore how like how unlike as we view them together the song of the minstrels whose record we scan one fresh as the breeze blowing over the heather one sweet as the breath from an odalisques fan ah passion can glow mid a palaces splendor the cage does not alter the song of the bird and the curtain of silk has known whispers as tender as ever the blossoming hawthorn has heard no fear lest the step of the softslippered graces should fright the young loves from their warm little nest for the heart of a queen under jewels and laces beats time with the pulse in the peasant girls breast thrice welcome each gift of kind natures bestowing her fountain heeds little the goblet we hold alike when its musical waters are flowing the shell from the seaside the chalice of gold the twins of the lyre to her voices had listened both laid their best gifts upon libertys shrine for

her mantle of verdure is woven unfaded while shannon and liffey shall dimple and smile the land where the staff of saint patrick was planted where the shamrock grows green from the cliffs to the shore the land of fair maidens and heroes undaunted shall wreathe her bright harp with the garlands of moore to james freeman clarke april i bring the simplest pledge of love friend of my earlier days mine is the hand without the glove the heartbeat not the phrase how few still breathe this mortal air we called by schoolboy names you still whatever robe you wear to me are always james that name the kind apostle bore who shames the sullen creeds not trusting less but loving more and showing faith by deeds what blending thoughts our memories share what visions yours and mine of maydays in whose morning air the dews were golden wine of vistas bright with opening day whose allawakening sun showed in lifes landscape far away the summits to be won the heights are gained ah say not so for him who smiles at time leaves his tired comrades down below and only lives to climb his labors will they ever cease with hand and tongue and pen shall wearied nature ask release at threescore years and ten our strength the clustered seasons tax for him new life they mean like rods around the lictors axe they keep him bright and keen the wise the brave the strong we know we mark them here or there but he we roll our eyes and lo we find him everywhere with truths bold cohorts or alone he strides through errors field his lance is ever manhoods own his breast is womans shield count not his years while earth has need of souls that heaven inflames with sacred zeal to save to lead long live our dear saint james welcome to the chicago commercial club january chicago sounds rough to the maker of verse one

bunkers tall shaft you can climb if you will but youll puff like a paragraph praising a pill you must see but you have seen our old faneuil hall our churches our schoolrooms our samplerooms all and perhaps though the idiots must have their jokes you have found our good people much like other folks there are cities by rivers by lakes and by seas each as full of itself as a cheesemite of cheese and a city will brag as a gamecock will crow dont your cockerels at home just a little you know but well crow for you now heres a health to the boys men maidens and matrons of fair illinois and the

renowned tombed in these records on our dusty shelves scarce on the scroll of living memory found save where the waneyed antiquarian delves shadows they seem ab what are we ourselves pale ghosts of

gannett tracked the wild auroras path has bowdoin found his allsurrounding sphere what question puzzles ciphering philomath could williams make the hidden causes clear of the dark day that filled the land with fear dear ancient schoolboys nature taught to them the simple lessons of the star and flower showed them strange sights how on a single stem admire the marvels of creative power twin apples grew one sweet the other sour how from the hilltop where our eyes beheld in even ranks the plumed and bannered maize range its long columns in the days of old the live volcano shot its angry blaze dead since the showers of noahs watery days how when the lightning split the mighty rock the spreading fury of the shaft was spent how the young scion joined the alien stock and when and where the homeless swallows went to pass the winter of their discontent scant were the gleanings in those years of dearth no cuvier yet had clothed the fossil bones that slumbered waiting for their second birth no lyell read the legend of the stones science still pointed to her empty thrones dreaming of orbs to eyes of earth unknown herschel looked heavenwards in the starlight pale lost in those awful depths he trod alone laplace stood mute before the lifted veil while homebred humboldt trimmed his toy ships sail no mortal feet these loftier heights had gained whence the wide realms of nature we descry in

childrens children yet unborn when on this yellow page you turn your eyes where the brief record of this mayday morn in phrase antique and faded letters lies how vague how pale our flitting ghosts will rise yet in our veins the blood ran warm and red for us the fields were green the skies were blue though from our dust the spirit long has fled we lived we loved we toiled we dreamed like you smiled at our sires and thought how much we knew oh might our spirits for one hour return when the next century rounds its hundredth ring all the strange secrets it shall teach to learn to hear the larger truths its years shall bring its wiser sages talk its sweeter minstrels sing the schoolboy read at the centennial celebration of the foundation of phillips academy andover these hallowed precincts long to memory dear smile with fresh welcome as our feet draw near with softer gales the opening leaves are fanned with fairer hues the kindling flowers expand the rosebush reddens with the blush of june the groves are vocal with their minstrels tune the mighty elm beneath whose arching shade the wandering children of the forest strayed greets the bright morning in its bridal dress and spreads its arms the gladsome dawn to bless is it an idle dream that nature shares our joys our griefs our pastimes and our cares is there no summons when at mornings call the sable vestments of the darkness fall does not meek evenings lowvoiced ave blend with the soft vesper as its notes ascend is there no whisper in the perfumed air when the sweet bosom of the rose is bare does not the sunshine call us to rejoice is there no meaning in the stormclouds voice no silent message when from midnight skies heaven looks upon us with its myriad eyes or shift the mirror say our dreams diffuse oer lifes pale landscape their celestial hues lend heaven the rainbow it has never known and robe the earth in glories not its own sing their own music in the summer breeze with fresher foliage clothe the

morn hers are the blossoms of eternal spring from these green boughs her newfledged birds take wing these echoes hear their earliest carols sung in this old nest the brood is ever young if some tired wanderer resting from his flight amid the gay young choristers alight these gather round him mark his faded plumes that faintly still the faroff grove perfumes and listen wondering if some feeble note yet lingers quavering in his weary throat i whose fresh voice yon redfaced temple knew what tune is left me fit to sing to you ask not the grandeurs of a labored song but let my easy couplets slide along much could i tell you that you know too well much i remember but i will not tell age brings experience graybeards oft are wise but oh how sharp a youngsters ears and eyes my cheek was bare of adolescent down when first i sought the academic town slow rolls the coach along the dusty road big with its filial and parental load the frequent hills the lonely woods are past the schoolboys chosen home is reached at last i see it now the same unchanging spot the swinging gate the little garden plot the narrow yard the rock that made its floor the flat pale house the knockergarnished door the small trim parlor neat decorous chill the strange new faces kind but grave and still two creased with age or what i then called age lifes volume open at its fiftieth page one a shy maidens pallid placid sweet as the first snowdrop which the sunbeams greet one the last nurslings slight she was and fair her smooth white forehead warmed with auburn hair last came the virgin hymen long had spared whose daily cares the grateful household shared strong patient humble her substantial frame stretched the chaste draperies i forbear to name brave but with effort had the schoolboy come to the cold comfort of a strangers home how like a dagger to my sinking heart came the dry summons it is time to part goodby goooodby one fond maternal kiss homesick as death was ever pang like this too young as yet with willing feet to stray from the tame fireside glad to get away too old to let my watery grief appear and what so bitter as a swallowed tear one figure still my vagrant thoughts pursue first boy to greet me ariel where are you imp of all mischief heaven alone knows how you learned it all are you an angel now or tottering gently down the slope of years your face grown sober in the vale of tears forgive my freedom if you are breathing still if in a happier world i know you will you were a schoolboy what beneath the sun so like a monkey i was also one strange sure enough to see what curious shoots the nursery raises from the studys roots in those old days the very very good took up more room a little than they should something too much ones eyes encountered then of serious youth and funeralvisaged men the solemn elders saw lifes mournful half heaven sent this boy whose mission was to laugh drollest of buffos natures odd protest a catbird squealing in a blackbirds nest kind faithful nature while the soureyed scot her cheerful smiles forbidden or forgot talks only of his preacher and his kirk hears fivehour sermons for his sunday work praying and fasting till his meagre face gains its due length the genuine sign of grace an ayrshire mother in the land of knox her embryo poet in his cradle rocks nature long shivering in her dim eclipse steals in a sunbeam to those baby lips so to its home her banished smile returns and scotland sweetens with the song of burns the morning came i reached the classic hall a clockface eyed me staring from the wall beneath its hands a printed line i read youth is lifes seedtime so the clockface said some took its counsel as the sequel showed sowed their wild oats and reaped as they had sowed how all comes back the upward slanting floor the masters thrones that flank the central door the long outstretching alleys that divide the rows of desks that stand on either side the staring boys a face to every desk bright dull pale blooming common picturesque grave is the masters look his forehead wears thick rows of wrinkles prints of worrying cares uneasy lie the heads of all that rule his most of all whose kingdom is a school supreme he sits before the awful frown that bends his brows the boldest eye goes down not more submissive israel heard and saw at sinais foot the giver of the law less stern he seems who sits in equal mate on the twin throne and shares the empires weight around his lips the subtle life that plays steals quaintly forth in many a jesting phrase a lightsome nature not so hard to chafe pleasant when pleased roughhandled not so safe some tingling memories vaguely i recall but to forgive him god forgive us all one yet remains whose wellremembered name pleads in my grateful heart its tender claim his was the charm magnetic the bright look that sheds its sunshine on the dreariest book a loving soul to every task he brought that sweetly mingled with the lore he taught sprung from a saintly race that never could from youth to age be anything but good his few brief years in holiest labors spent earth lost too soon the treasure heaven had lent kindest of teachers studious to divine some hint of promise in my earliest line these faint and faltering words thou canst not hear throb from a heart that holds thy memory dear as to the travellers eye the varied plain shows through the window of the flying train a mingled landscape rather felt than seen a gravelly bank a sudden flash of green a tangled wood a glittering stream that flows through the cleft summit where the cliff once rose all strangely blended in a hurried gleam rock wood waste meadow village hillside stream so as we look behind us life appears seen through the vista of our bygone years yet in the dead pasts shadowfilled domain some vanished shapes the hues of life retain unbidden oft before our dreaming eyes from the vague mists in memorys path they rise so comes his blooming image to my view the friend of joyous days when life was new hope yet untamed the blood of youth unchilled no blank arrear of promise unfulfilled lifes flower yet hidden in its sheltering fold its pictured canvas yet to be unrolled his the frank smile i vainly look to greet his the warm grasp my clasping hand should meet how would our lips renew their schoolboy talk our feet retrace the old familiar walk for thee no more earths cheerful morning shines through the green fringes of the tented pines ah me is heaven so far thou canst not hear or is thy viewless spirit hovering near a fair young presence bright with mornings glow the freshcheeked boy of fifty years ago yes fifty years with all their circling suns behind them all my glance reverted runs where now that time remote its griefs its joys where are its grayhaired men its brighthaired boys where is the patriarch time could hardly tire the good old wrinkled immemorial squire an honest treasurer like a blackplumed swan not every day our eyes may look upon where the tough champion who with calvins sword in wordy conflicts battled for the lord where the grave scholar lonely calm austere whose voice like music charmed the listening ear whose light rekindled like the morning star still shines upon us through the gates ajar where the still solemn weary sadeyed man whose careworn face nfy wandering eyes would scan his features wasted in the lingering strife with the pale foe that drains the students life where my old friend the scholar teacher saint whose creed some hinted showed a speck of taint he broached his own opinion which is not lightly to be forgiven or forgot some riddles point i scarce remember now homoi perhaps where they said homoou if the unlettered greatly wish to know where lies the difference betwixt oi and o those of the curious who have time may search among the stale conundrums of their church beneath his roof his peaceful life i shared and for his modes of faith i little cared i taught to judge mens dogmas by their deeds long ere the days of indiarubber creeds why should we look one common faith to find where one in every score is colorblind if here on earth they know not red from green will they see better into things unseen once more to times old graveyard i return and scrape the moss from memorys pictured urn who in these days when all things go by steam recalls the stagecoach with its fourhorse team its sturdy driver who remembers him or the old landlord saturnine and grim who left our hilltop for a new abode and reared his signpost farther down the road still in the waters of the dark shawshine do the young bathers splash and think theyre clean do pilgrims find their way to indian ridge or journey onward to the faroff bridge and bring to younger ears the story back of the broad stream the mighty merrimac are there still truant feet that stray beyond these circling bounds to pomps or haggetts pond or where the legendary name recalls the forests earlier tenant deerjump falls yes every nook these youthful feet explore just as our sires and grand sires did of yore so all lifes opening paths where nature led their fathers feet the childrens children tread roll the round centurys fivescore years away call from our storied past that earliest day when great eliphalet i can see him now big name big frame big voice and beetling brow then young eliphalet ruled the rows of boys in homespun gray or oldworld corduroys and save for fashions whims the benches show the selfsame youths the very boys we know time works strange marvels since i trod the green and swung the gates what wonders i have seen but come what will the sky itself may fall as things of course the boy accepts them all the prophets chariot drawn by steeds of flame for daily use our travelling millions claim the face we love a sunbeam makes our own no more the surgeon hears the sufferers groan what unwrit histories wrapped in darkness lay till shovelling schliemann bared them to the day your richelieu says and says it well my lord the pen is sometimes mightier than the sword great is the goosequill say we all amen sometimes the spade is mightier than the pen it shows where babels terraced walls were raised the slabs that cracked when nimrods palace blazed unearths mycenee rediscovers troy calmly he listens that immortal boy a new prometheus tips our wands with fire a mightier orpheus strains the whispering wire whose lightning thrills the lazy winds outrun and hold the hours as joshua stayed the sun so swift in truth we hardly find a place for those dim fictions known as time and space still a new miracle each year supplies see at his work the chemist of the skies who questions sirius in his tortured rays and steals the secret of the solar blaze hush while the windowrattling bugles play the nations airs a hundred miles away that wicked phonograph hark how it swears turn it again and make it say its prayers and was it true then what the story said of oxfords friar and his brazen head while wondering science stands herself perplexed at each days miracle and asks what next the immortal boy the coming heir of all springs from his desk to urge the flying ball cleaves with his bending oar the glassy waves with sinewy arm the dashing current braves the same bright creature in these haunts of ours that eton shadowed with her antique towers boy where is he the longlimbed youth inquires whom his rough chin with manly pride inspires ah when the ruddy cheek no longer glows when the bright hair is white as winter snows when the dim eye has lost its lambent flame sweet to his ear will be his schoolboy name nor think the difference mighty as it seems between lifes morning and its evening dreams fourscore like twenty has its tasks and toys in earths wide schoolhouse all are girls and boys brothers forgive my wayward fancy who can guess beforehand what his pen will do too light my strain for listeners such as these whom graver thoughts and soberer speech shall please is he not here whose breath of holy song has raised the downcast eyes of faith so long are they not here the strangers in your gates for whom the wearied ear impatient waits the largebrained scholars whom their toils release the bannered heralds of the prince of peace such was the gentle friend whose youth unblamed in years long past our studentbenches claimed whose name illumined on the sacred page lives in the labors of his riper age such he whose record times destroying march leaves uneffaced on zions springing arch not to the scanty phrase of measured song cramped in its fetters names like these belong one ray they lend to gild my slender line their praise i leave to sweeter lips than mine homes of our sires where learnings temple rose while vet they struggled with their banded foes as in the west thy centurys sun descends one parting gleam its dying radiance lends darker and deeper though the shadows fall from the gray towers on doubting castles wall though pope and pagan rearray their hosts and her new armor youthful science boasts truth for whose altar rose this holy shrine shall fly for refuge to these bowers of thine no past shall chain her with its rusted vow no jews phylactery bind her christian brow but faith shall smile to find her sister free and nobler manhood draw its life from thee long as the arching skies above thee spread as on thy groves the dews of heaven are shed with currents widening still from year to year and deepening channels calm untroubled clear flow the twin streamlets from thy sacred hill pierias fount and siloams shaded rill the silent melody bring me my broken harp he said we both are wrecks but as ye will though all its ringing tones have fled their echoes linger round it still it had some golden strings i know but that was long how long ago i cannot see its tarnished gold i cannot hear its vanished tone scarce can my trembling fingers hold the pillared frame so long their own we both are wrecks a while ago it had some silver strings i know but on them time too long has played the solemn strain that knows no change and where of old my fingers strayed the chords they find are new and strange yes iron strings i know i know we both are wrecks of long ago we both are wrecks a shattered pair strange to ourselves in times disguise what say ye to the lovesick air that brought the tears from marians eyes ay trust me under breasts of snow hearts could be melted long ago or will ye hear the stormsongs crash that from his dreams the soldier woke and bade him face the lightning flash when battles cloud in thunder broke wrecks nought but wrecks the time was when we two were worth a thousand men and so the broken harp they bring with pitying smiles that none could blame alas theres not a single string of all that filled the tarnished frame but see like children overjoyed his fingers rambling through the void i clasp thee ay mine ancient lyre nay guide my wandering fingers there they love to dally with the wire as isaac played with esaus hair hush ye shall hear the famous tune that marian called the breath of june and so they softly gather round rapt in his tuneful trance he seems his fingers move but not a sound a silence like the song of dreams there ye have heard the air he cries that brought the tears from marians eyes ah smile not at his fond conceit nor deem his fancy wrought in vain to him the unreal sounds are sweet no discord mars the silent strain scored on lifes latest starlit page the voiceless melody of age sweet are the lips of all that sing when natures music breathes unsought but never yet could voice or string so truly shape our tenderest thought as when by lifes decaying fire our fingers sweep the stringless lyre our home our country for the semicentennial celebration of the settlement of cambridge mass december your home was mine kind natures gift my love no years can chill in vain their flakes the stormwinds sift the snowdrop hides beneath the drift a living blossom still mute are a hundred longfamed lyres hushed all their golden strings one lay the coldest bosom fires one song one only never tires while sweetvoiced memory sings no spot so lone but echo knows that dear familiar strain in tropic isles on arctic snows through burning lips its music flows and rings its fond refrain from pisas tower my straining sight roamed wandering leagues away when lo a frigates banner bright the starry blue the red the white in far livornos bay hot leaps the lifeblood from my heart forth springs the sudden tear the ship that rocks by yonder mart is of my land my life a part home home sweet home is here fades from my view the sunlit scene my vision spans the waves i see the elmencircled green the tower the steeple and between the field of ancient graves there runs the path my feet would tread when first they learned to stray there stands the gambrel roof that spread its quaint old angles oer my head when first i saw the day the sounds that met my boyish ear my inward sense salute the woodnotes wild i loved to hear the robins challenge sharp and clear the breath of evenings flute the faces loved from cradle days unseen alas how long as fond remembrance round them plays touched with its softening moonlight rays through fancys portal throng and see as if the opening skies some angel form had spared us wingless mortals to surprise the little maid with lightblue eyes white necked and golden haired so rose the picture full in view i paint in feebler song such power the seamless banner knew of red and white and starry blue for exiles banished long oh boys dear boys who wait as men to guard its heavenbright folds blest are the eyes that see again that banner seamless now as then the fairest earth beholds sweet was the tuscan air and soft in that unfading hour and fancy leads my footsteps oft up the round galleries high aloft on pisas threatening tower and still in memorys holiest shrine i read with pride and joy for me those stars of empire shine that empires dearest home is mine i am a cambridge boy poem at the centennial anniversary dinner of the massachusetts medical society june three paths there be where learnings favored sons trained in the schools which hold her favored ones follow their several stars with separate aim each has its honors each its special claim bred in the fruitful cradle of the east first as of oldest lineage comes the priest the lawyer next in wordy conflict strong full armed to battle for the right or wrong last he whose calling finds its voice in deeds frail natures helper in her sharpest needs each has his gifts his losses and his gains each his own share of pleasures and of pains no lifelong aim with steadfast eye pursued finds a smooth pathway all with roses strewed trouble belongs to man of woman born tread where he may his foot will find its thorn of all the guests at lifes perennial feast who of her children sits above the priest for him the broidered robe the carven seat pride at his beck and beauty at his feet for him the incense fumes the wine is poured himself a god adoring and adored his the first welcome when our hearts rejoice his in our dying ear the latest voice font altar grave his steps on all attend our staff our stay our all but heavenly friend where is the meddling hand that dares to probe the secret grief beneath his sable robe how grave his port how every gesture tells here truth abides here peace forever dwells vex not his lofty soul with comments vain faith asks no questions silence ye profane alas too oft while all is calm without the stormy spirit wars with endless doubt this is the mocking spectre scarce concealed behind traditions bruised and battered shield he sees the sleepless critic age by age scrawl his new readings on the hallowed page the wondrous deeds that priests and prophets saw dissolved in legend crystallized in law and on the soil where saints and martyrs trod altars new builded to the unknown god his shrines imperilled his evangels torn he dares not limp but ah how sharp his thorn yet while gods herald questions as he reads the outworn dogmas of his ancient creeds drops from his ritual the exploded verse blots from its page the athanasian curse though by the critics dangerous art perplexed his holy life is heavens unquestioned text that shining guidance doubt can never mar the pillars flame the light of bethlehems star strong is the moral blister that will draw laid on the conscience of the man of law whom blindfold justice lends her eyes to see truth in the scale that holds his promised fee what has not every lie its truthful side its honest fraction not to be denied per contra ask the moralist in sooth has not a lie its share in every truth then what forbids an honest man to try to find the truth that lurks in every lie and just as fairly call on truth to yield the lying fraction in its breast concealed so the worst rogue shall claim a ready friend his modest virtues boldly to defend and he who shows the record of a saint see himself blacker than the devil could paint what struggles to his captive soul belong who loves the right yet combats for the wrong who fights the battle he would fain refuse and wins well knowing that he ought to lose who speaks with glowing lips and look sincere in spangled words that make the worse appear the better reason who behind his mask hides his true self and blushes at his task what quips what quillets cheat the inward scorn that mocks such triumph has he not his thorn yet stay thy judgment were thy life the prize thy death the forfeit would thy cynic eyes see fault in him who bravely dares defend the cause forlorn the wretch without a friend nay though the rightful side is wisdoms choice wrong has its rights and claims a champions voice let the strong arm be lifted for the weak for the dumb lips the fluent pleader speak when with warm rebel blood our street was dyed who took unawed the hated hirelings side no greener civic wreath can adams claim no brighter page the youthful quincys name how blest is he who knows no meaner strife than arts long battle with the foes of life no doubt assails him doing still his best and trusting kindly nature for the rest no mocking conscience tears the thin disguise that wraps his breast and tells him that he lies he comes the languid sufferer lifts his head and smiles a welcome from his weary bed he speaks what music like the tones that tell past is the hour of danger all is well how can he feel the petty stings of grief whose cheering presence always brings relief what ugly dreams can trouble his repose who yields himself to soothe anothers woes hour after hour the busy day has found the good physician on his lonely round mansion and hovel low and lofty door he knows his journeys every path explore where the cold blast has struck with deadly chill the sturdy dweller on the stormswept hill where by the stagnant marsh the sickening gale has blanched the poisoned tenants of the vale where crushed and maimed the bleeding victim lies where madness raves where melancholy sighs and where the solemn whisper tells too plain that all his science all his art were vain how sweet his fireside when the day is done and cares have vanished with the setting sun evening at last its hour of respite brings and on his couch his weary length he flings soft be thy pillow servant of mankind lulled by an opiate art could never find sweet be thy slumber thou hast earned it well pleasant thy dreams clang goes the midnight bell darkness and storm the home is far away that waits his coming ere the break of day the snowclad pines their wintry plumage toss doubtful the frozen stream his road must cross deep lie the drifts the slanted heaps have shut the hardy woodman in his mountain hut why should thy softer frame the tempest brave hast thou no life no health to lose or save look read the answer in his patient eyes for him no other voice when suffering cries deaf to the gale that all around him blows a feeble whisper calls him and he goes or seek the crowded city summers heat glares burning blinding in the narrow street still noisome deadly sleeps the envenomed air unstirred the yellow flag that says beware tempt not thy fate one little moments breath bears on its viewless wing the seeds of death thou at whose door the gilded chariots stand whose dearbought skill unclasps the misers hand turn from thy fatal quest nor cast away that life so precious let a meaner prey feed the destroyers hunger live to bless those happier homes that need thy care no less smiling he listens has he then a charm whose magic virtues peril can disarm no safeguard his no amulet he wears too well he knows that nature never spares her truest servant powerless to defend from her own weapons her unshrinking friend he dares the fate the bravest well might shun nor asks reward save only heavens well done such are the toils the perils that he knows days without rest and nights without repose yet all unheeded for the love he bears his art his kind whose every grief he shares harder than these to know how small the part natures proud empire yields to striving art how as the tide that rolls around the sphere laughs at the mounds that delving arms uprear spares some few roods of oozy earth but still wastes and rebuilds the planet at its will comes at its ordered season night or noon led by the silver magnet of the moon so lifes vast tide forever comes and goes unchecked resistless as it ebbs and flows hardest of all when art has done her best to find the cuckoo brooding in her nest the shrewd adventurer fresh from parts unknown kills off the patients science thought her own towns from a nostrumvender get their name fences and walls the cureall drug proclaim plasters and pads the willing world beguile fair lydia greets us with astringent smile munchausens fellowcountryman unlocks his new pandoras globuleholding box and as king george inquired with puzzled grin how how the devil get the apple in so we ask how with wonderopening eyes such pygmy pills can hold such giant lies yes sharp the trials stern the daily tasks that suffering nature from her servant asks his the kind office dainty menials scorn his path how hard at every step a thorn what does his saddening restless slavery buy what save a right to live a chance to die to live companion of disease and pain to die by poisoned shafts untimely slain answer from hoary eld majestic shades from memphian courts from delphic colonnades speak in the tones that persias despot heard when nations treasured every golden word the wandering echoes wafted oer the seas from the far isle that held hippocrates and thou best gift that pergamus could send imperial rome her noblest caesars friend master of masters whose unchallenged sway not bold vesalius dared to disobey ye who while prophets dreamed of dawning times taught your rude lessons in salernos rhymes and ye the nearer sires to whom we owe the better share of all the best we know in every land an evergrowing train since wakening science broke her rusted chain speak from the past and say what prize was sent to crown the toiling years so freely spent list while they speak in lifes uneven road our willing hands have eased our brothers load one forehead smoothed one pang of torture less one peaceful hour a sufferers couch to bless the smile brought back to fevers parching lips the light restored to reason in eclipse lifes treasure rescued like a burning brand snatched from the dread destroyers wasteful hand such were our simple records day by day for gains like these we wore our lives away in toilsome paths our daily bread we sought but bread from heaven attending angels brought pain was our teacher speaking to the heart mother of pity nurse of pitying art our lesson learned we reached the peaceful shore where the pale sufferer asks our aid no more these gracious words our welcome our reward ye served your brothers ye have served your lord rhymes of a lifetime from the first gleam of morning to the gray of peaceful evening lo a life unrolled in woven pictures all its changes told its lights its shadows every flitting ray till the long curtain falling dims the day steals from the dials disk the sunlights gold and all the graven hours grow dark and cold where late the glowing blaze of noontide lay ah the warm blood runs wild in youthful veins let me no longer play with painted fire new songs for newborn days i would not tire the listening ears that wait for fresher strains in phrase newmoulded newforged rhythmic chains with plaintive measures from a wornout lyre august
