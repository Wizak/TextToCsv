 chapter one there was a crooked man and he went a crooked mile he found a crooked sixpence beside a crooked stile he caught a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse and they all lived together in a little crooked house british nursery rhyme i first met sophia leonides in egypt towards the end of world war ii she had quite an important job working for the government and when i worked with her i soon realized how good at her job she was though she was only twentytwo as well as being very goodlooking sophia had a clear mind and a delightful sense of humour we became friends she was easy to talk to and we enjoyed our dinners and dances together very much but it wasnt until i was ordered to go to east asia at the end of the war in europe that i realized i loved sophia and wanted to marry her we were having dinner together when i realized this it wasnt a surprise i think id known for a long time that i loved her i looked at sophia and liked everything i saw she had dark hair and bright blue eyes a small chin and a straight nose she looked very english then suddenly i wondered if she really was as english as she looked after all her surname didnt sound english although wed talked about many things sophia had never mentioned her home or her family i didnt know anything about her background sophia asked me what i was thinking about you i replied truthfully i may not see you for a few years sophia but when i get back to england im going to ask you to marry me she sat there calmly im not going to ask you now i continued because you might say no and id be very unhappy and if you say yes i dont want to be engaged for years or get married now and then leave you straightaway i want you to go home free and independent and decide what you really want but i wanted to let you know how i well how i feel but you dont want to be too romantic murmured sophia darling dont you understand ive tried not to say i love you she stopped me i do understand charles and i like your funny way of doing things you can come and see me when you get back if you still want to of course ill want to i interrupted you dont know that said sophia you dont know much about me do you no i admitted i dont even know where in england you live i live just outside london at a place called swinly dean she said in a little crooked house i must have looked surprised because she explained why she had used the last line of a nursery rhyme my family she said and they all lived together in a little crooked house thats us and though the house isnt really little its definitely crooked so do you have a large family i asked one brother one sister a mother a father an uncle an aunt by marriage a grandfather a greataunt and a stepgrandmother my goodness i exclaimed in surprise of course we dont normally all live together sophia laughed it was because of the war with the bombing it was too dangerous to stay in london but my grandfather takes care of us hes over eighty and very small but hes so alive that compared to him everybody else seems rather boring he sounds interesting i said he is interesting hes from greece and his name is aristide leonides she added with a smile and hes extremely rich i wonder if youll like him do you i asked more than anyone in the world said sophia chapter two more than two years passed before i returned to england sophia and i wrote to each other quite often our letters werent love letters they were about ideas and thoughts but i knew my feelings for her were growing stronger and i believed she felt the same i returned to england on a soft grey day in september and immediately sent a telegram to sophia just arrived back will you dine this evening marios restaurant nine oclock charles a couple of hours later i was at my fathers house in london reading the newspaper when i saw the name leonides in the deaths column leonides on september th at three gables swinly dean aristide leonides much loved husband of brenda leonides passed away in his eightyeighth year deeply missed there was another announcement immediately below leonides passed away suddenly at his house three gables swinly dean aristide leonides deeply missed by his loving children and grandchildren i thought it was strange that there were two announcements there must have been a mistake i quickly sent sophia a second telegram just seen news of your grandfathers death very sorry let me know when i can see you charles a telegram from sophia reached me at six oclock will be at marios nine oclock sophia i was both nervous and excited at the thought of meeting sophia again i hadnt seen her for so long that when she walked through the door at marios it seemed completely unreal we had drinks and then sat down to dinner i said i was sorry about her grandfather and we talked rather fast and were awkward with each other it wasnt just because we hadnt seen each other for such a long time i felt there was something definitely wrong with sophia herself didnt she love me anymore had she met someone else somehow i didnt think that was the problem i didnt know what was wrong then suddenly as the waiter brought us our coffee everything went back to normal sophia and i were together again and it felt as if we had never been apart sophia i said charles she said immediately thank goodness thats over i said with relief what was the matter with us it was probably my fault said sophia i was stupid but its all right now we smiled at each other darling i said how soon will you marry me her smile disappeared the problem whatever it was was back i dont know she said im not sure charles that i can ever marry you because because of my grandfathers death your grandfathers death but what difference does that make because i dont think he just died charles i think he may have been killed i stared at her but what a very strange idea why do you think that it was the doctor he wouldnt sign a death certificate and the police need to investigate officially why he died they clearly suspect that something is wrong i didnt argue with her sophia was very intelligent so i was sure she was right but even if something is wrong i said how does that affect you and me you work for the government it might affect your job no please dont say anything i know it doesnt matter to you but it matters to me im very proud i want our marriage to be a good thing for both of us and it may be all right so long as the right person killed him what do you mean by the right person sophia i know thats a horrible thing to say but im trying to be honest before i could speak she continued im not going to say any more charles ive probably said too much already but we cant make any plans until we know why my grandfather died at least tell me about it she shook her head no charles i dont want to tell you what i think instead i want you to see me and my family for yourself from the outside and how will i do that she looked at me with a strange light in her bright blue eyes your father will tell you she said i had told sophia that my father was assistant commissioner of scotland yard the london police headquarters i suddenly felt cold is it such a serious case i asked i think so do you see that man sitting by the door he followed me from swinly dean i shouldnt have left the house but i wanted to see you so i climbed out of the window darling well never mind were here together she paused and then added and theres no doubt that we love each other no doubt at all i said you and i have survived a world war sophia so we can survive the sudden death of one old man he probably just died of old age if you knew my grandfather said sophia you would be surprised that he died of anything chapter three i had always been interested in my fathers police work he was often in charge of important police investigations but now that interest was personal my father had been out when i first arrived home but this time when i returned from seeing sophia he was sitting at his desk he jumped up when i came in charles well well its been a long time we hadnt seen each other for five years perhaps our first meeting after so long didnt seem very emotional but my father and i are very fond of each other im sorry i was out when you got here he said but ive just got a new case aristide leonides i asked how did you know that charles he asked with a frown i met sophia leonides in egypt i explained and im going to marry her she had dinner with me tonight though she had to climb out of the window to meet me my father smiled she seems very independent he said so you want to marry her well it may be all right if if the right person killed him that was the second time that night id heard those words so who is the right person he looked surprised didnt your girl tell you no sophia said she wanted me to see it all from the outside i dont know anything about her family except there are a lot of them my father frowned and sat down very well ill tell you aristide leonides left greece and arrived in england when he was twentyfour just then the door opened and chief inspector taverner came in wed known each other for many years and said hello warmly taverner is in charge of the case explained my father so he can correct me if im wrong as i was saying leonides came to london and then started a restaurant which was very successful soon he owned seven or eight restaurants all making money and then he started a large business associated foods supplying food all over the country leonides had a natural ability for business and making money said taverner though of course he was always a bit dishonest a bit crooked he never actually broke the law but he came close to doing so he doesnt sound a very attractive person i said its strange but he was attractive said taverner he had a strong personality and though he was short and rather ugly women always fell in love with him he married a woman from a wellknown family in the country said my father her parents didnt like it but she was determined to marry him and it was a very happy marriage i believe leonides built a rather ridiculouslooking house at swinly dean and he and his wife lived there with their five children then his wife died leaving him with five children i asked yes but there are only two children still left alive said my father roger the eldest son whos married but has no children and philip who married an actress and has three children sophia eustace and josephine and now they all live together at the same house three gables i said thats right roger moved there after his house was bombed in the war and philip and his family have lived there for a few years and theres an old aunt miss edith de haviland sister of the first mrs leonides she always hated aristide leonides but when her sister died she came to look after the children well thats a big family i said who do you think killed aristide leonides taverner shook his head i dont know he said and we may never know but he was certainly murdered poisoned there is one obvious suspect but it will be very hard to get enough evidence i looked at my father in murder cases charles it usually is the obvious suspect he said aristide leonides married again ten years ago when he was seventyseven he married a young woman who worked in a tea shop and shes the obvious suspect yes said taverner shes only thirtyfour now and shes very close friends with a young man in the house who teaches the grandchildren i looked at him thoughtfully what was the poison i asked the poison was called eserine replied taverner it was in the old mans eye drops leonides had diabetes added my father and needed regular injections of insulin which comes from the pharmacy in small bottles using a syringe the needle is pushed into the top of the bottle and the insulin is taken up into the syringe for the injection i guessed the next bit and it was eserine in the bottle instead of insulin exactly said taverner and who gave him the injection i asked his wife i understood now what sophia meant by the right person do the family like the second mrs leonides i asked no replied taverner i dont think they speak much to each other it all seemed very clear so whats the problem i asked taverner if mrs leonides did do it why didnt she change the bottle afterwards so it was a real bottle of insulin it would have been easy there were plenty of bottles around if shed done that i dont think that the doctor would have noticed anything wrong not much is known about eserine poisoning the doctor only realized it was eserine because he checked the bottle in case the insulin was the wrong strength so i said thoughtfully mrs leonides was either very stupid or very clever perhaps she hopes youll think that nobody could be that stupid are there any other suspects anyone in the house could have done it said my father quietly there was plenty of insulin in the bathroom cupboard where anyone could take it someone could easily put eserine in one of the bottles knowing it would be used at some time in the future does anyone have a strong motive my father sighed aristide leonides was extremely rich he said and though he gave his family plenty of money perhaps one of them wanted more so you think it was his wife i said does her young man have any money laurence brown the teacher no hes very poor what do you think of mrs leonides i asked taverner i dont know he replied slowly shes very quiet you dont know what shes thinking and i imagine she likes an easy life she reminds me of a big lazy cat but we need evidence yes i thought we all wanted evidence that mrs leonides had poisoned her husband but no one was really sure that she had done it chapter four the next day i went to the leonides family house three gables with chief inspector taverner i didnt really have any official connection to the case but i had once worked with the police and my father wanted to know all about the people in the house from the inside this is the kind of crime that may never be solved my father told me unless we can get some definite evidence everyone in the family will always be under suspicion including your sophia why dont you ask her to help you so here i was in swinly dean once we had driven past the golf course we soon came to the front of the house it was incredible the house should have been called eleven gables not three gables it looked like a traditional little country house but one that was the size of a castle it had lots of crooked gables and wood timbers a little crooked house that had grown up suddenly like a mushroom in the night it was a greek restaurant owners idea of something english it looks very strange doesnt it said taverner its actually one big house divided into three separate houses and all of them are very luxurious sophia came out of the front door surprised and not very pleased to see me sophia ive got to talk to you i said where can we go for a moment i thought she was going to refuse but then she led me across the grass and through a hedge to an untidy garden where we sat down on a wooden seat well she said she didnt sound very happy i told her what my father had said and explained that the police needed definite evidence otherwise the crime might never be solved i asked if she would help me sophia listened very carefully your father is right she said thats just what ive been thinking after a pause she said quietly i have to know the truth i have to know what happened to my grandfather she sounded almost desperate i didnt tell you this last night charles but im afraid afraid i repeated yes afraid said sophia everybody thinks that it was brenda grandfathers wife i can say brenda probably did it but i dont really think she did i dont think she would take such a big risk what about the young teacher laurence brown laurence wouldnt have the courage said sophia of course i could be wrong but brenda she shook her head brenda likes sitting around eating sweets and having nice clothes and jewellery and reading cheap novels and going to the cinema and i know he was eightyseven but my grandfather did make brenda feel that she was an exciting and romantic person but what sophia had said earlier disturbed me why did you say that you were afraid i asked sophia shivered because its true she said in a quiet voice i am afraid were a very strange family we are all ruthless in different ways thats whats so disturbing my face must have shown that i didnt understand because sophia continued ill try and explain in greece grandfather once stabbed two men in a fight he told me about it in quite a relaxed way as if it wasnt important thats one kind of ruthlessness and then there was my grandmother i dont really remember her but ive heard a lot about her i think she was ruthless in a different way she was always so sure that she knew the right thing to do even in matters of life and death that sounds a bit unlikely i said doubtfully yes perhaps but im always rather afraid of people like that said sophia and then theres my own mother whos an actress shes a darling but she only sees how things affect her she doesnt think of anyone else thats rather frightening sometimes and clemency uncle rogers wife shes a scientist shes ruthless too in a cold unemotional way uncle rogers the exact opposite hes the kindest and most lovable person in the world but hes got an extremely bad temper things make him so angry that he hardly knows what hes doing and theres father sophia paused father she said slowly is almost too well controlled you never know what hes thinking he never shows any emotion at all it worries me a little my dear sophia i said youre getting very worried about nothing what youre really saying is that perhaps everybody is capable of murder i suppose thats true said sophia even me not you oh yes charles even me i suppose i could murder someone but only for something really important i smiled and so did sophia perhaps im being stupid she said but we have to find out the truth about grandfathers death we have to if only it really was brenda who killed him suddenly i felt rather sorry for brenda leonides chapter five just then we saw someone walking along the path towards us aunt edith said sophia as we stood up this is charles hayward charles this is my greataunt miss edith de haviland edith de haviland was about seventy with lots of untidy grey hair and sharp intelligentlooking eyes ive heard about you she said shaking my hand how is your father i knew him when he was a boy rather surprised i said he was very well have you come to help us asked miss de haviland i do hope so there are police all over the house she turned to sophia nannie wants you sophia about the fish for dinner oh dear said sophia ill go and sort it out she walked quickly back towards the house while miss de haviland and i followed her more slowly i dont know what wed do without nannie remarked miss de haviland she does so much work and has been here for so long she stopped and pulled viciously at a big weed in the garden i hate bindweed she said it gets tangled up with the other plants and is impossible to get rid of she ground the weed viciously under her foot this is a bad situation charles hayward she continued looking towards the house i never liked aristide leonides an ugly little man but now hes dead the house seems so empty ive lived here over forty years ever since my sister died and i came to look after the children and youve stayed here all that time i murmured yes she said i could have left i suppose when the children grew up and married but i loved the garden and then when philip married and moved back here i helped look after his children what does philip leonides do i asked curiously he writes books replied miss de haviland history books but nobody wants to read them they dont earn him any money but then he doesnt need to earn money aristide gave him over one hundred thousand pounds and roger is in charge of his biggest company associated foods all of them are financially independent sophia is regularly given a large amount of money to live on and theres money saved in the bank for the other children so no one gains by his death she looked at me strangely yes they do she answered they all get more money but aristide would have given it to them if theyd asked for it do you have any idea who poisoned him miss de haviland no i dont she replied its upset me very much to think that we have a poisoner in the house i suppose the police will think poor brenda did it she is rather stupid perhaps she got tired of waiting for aristide to die if it was her it will be all right she isnt one of the family do you have any other ideas i asked what other ideas should i have i wondered she seemed to be intelligent but as i looked at her i thought of the word sophia had used ruthless i remembered how miss de haviland had viciously ground the bindweed under her foot and just for a moment i wondered if edith de haviland had poisoned aristide leonides herself chapter six we went back to the house and through the large hall at the back where there would normally be stairs was a white wall with a door in it you get to aristides part of the house through that door explained miss de haviland philip and magda live in a different part of the house here on the bottom floor we went through a door on the left into a large drawing room it had paleblue walls which were covered with many photographs and pictures of actors and dancers there was a lot of heavy furniture and on the tables were large vases of flowers do you want to see philip asked miss de haviland i had no idea i thought id only wanted to see sophia should i talk to her father if i did should i say that i was a friend of sophias or that i was working with the police miss de haviland didnt give me time to say anything well go to the library she decided and led me out of the drawing room along a corridor and through another door we entered a big cold room full of books not just on the bookshelves but also on the chairs tables and even the floor a tall man of about fifty years old stood up as we came in philip leonides was very handsome which surprised me since people said his father was so ugly but this man had a perfectlooking face with a straight nose and fair hair that was just beginning to turn grey philip said edith de haviland this is charles hayward how do you do said philip leonides shaking my hand i couldnt tell if he had ever heard of me he certainly didnt seem very interested are the police still here asked miss de haviland i believe chief inspector taverner is coming to talk to me soon philip replied i dont know where he is now just then the door burst open and a woman came in she had big blue eyes and lots of red hair and was wearing a luxurious pink dressing gown she was talking very quickly in a clear attractive voice somehow it seemed that three women not just one had entered the room darling she said i simply cant decide what to wear at the inquest something dark of course though not black perhaps dark purple how calm you are philip how can you be so calm dont you realize we can leave this awful house now and be free of course we could never leave when your grandfather the poor old darling was alive he really did love us but if wed left that woman upstairs would have made sure she got the house the money everything but now now we can produce that new play and this murder will give us lots of free publicity so this was magda leonides sophias mother im looking forward to talking to the inspector she continued hell want to know exactly how and when everything happened and ill tell him all the little things i noticed and wondered about at the time mother said sophia coming through the open door you mustnt tell the inspector a lot of lies sophia darling and i know youre ready to give a most beautiful performance just as if you were acting in a play but youve got it all wrong magda looked puzzled what do you mean you have to act it in a different way said sophia dont say much at all keep quiet and dont talk much as if youre protecting the family a pleased little smile showed on magdas face yes she said slowly yes thats a good idea ive made you some breakfast added sophia its in the drawing room oh good im hungry said magda and quickly left the room sophia started to follow her mother then turned back to say chief inspector taverner is here to see you father you dont mind if charles stays do you i wasnt surprised when philip leonides looked confused but all he said was oh certainly certainly in a rather uncertain voice chief inspector taverner came in he looked calm and businesslike as i sat down in the background miss de haviland said do you want me to stay chief inspector not now miss de haviland but i do want to talk to you later of course ill be upstairs she went out shutting the door behind her i wont disturb you for long said taverner but i can now confirm that your father did not die a natural death he was poisoned by a drug called eserine philip did not show any emotion he must have taken the poison by accident he said my father was nearly ninety and he couldnt see very well so you think your father put the contents of his eye drop bottle into an insulin bottle said taverner does that seem likely philip did not reply his face still showed no emotion we have found the empty eye drop bottle continued the chief inspector there were no fingerprints on it which is strange your fathers fingerprints at least should have been there now mr leonides he continued can you tell me what you were doing on the day of your fathers death certainly replied philip i was here in this room all day except when i went to eat of course did you see your father at all i said good morning to him after breakfast were you alone with him then my er stepmother brenda was in the room is your fathers part of the house completely separate from yours continued taverner yes the only way to get to it is through the door in the hall is that door usually locked no never replied philip so anyone could go freely between the different parts of the house yes thats true how did you first hear of your fathers death asked the inspector my brother roger he lives on the floor above came rushing down to tell me that my father couldnt breathe and seemed very ill what did you do i telephoned the doctor but he was out so i left an urgent message then i went upstairs my father was clearly very ill and he died before the doctor came there was no emotion in philips voice it was a simple statement of fact where was the rest of your family my wife magda was in london but came home soon afterwards sophia was also out i believe but my two younger children eustace and josephine were at home and im afraid i have to ask you said taverner how your fathers death affects your financial position my father made us financially independent many years ago philip replied he gave my brother roger his largest company associated foods and gave me about one hundred and fifty thousand pounds my father didnt keep much money for himself but now he has made even more money than he had before for the first time philip smiled slightly so you and your brother dont live in this house because of financial problems asked taverner certainly not its just easier for both of us and my father liked us to live here i was very fond of my father added philip i came to three gables with my family in and my brother roger came in when his house in london was bombed i see said taverner now mr leonides can you tell me anything about your fathers will and how he has left his money my father was not a secretive man said philip he held a meeting with all his family and his lawyer mr gaitskill to tell us about his will my stepmother brenda was left one hundred thousand pounds and the rest of his property was divided into three parts one for me one for my brother roger and the other was kept in the bank for his three grandchildren i mean my children sophia eustace and josephine did your father leave anything to the servants no answered philip instead their pay increased each year they stayed in his service and so you yourself dont need any more money mr leonides i have enough money chief inspector said philip coldly and if i needed more my father would have given it to me i had no financial reason to want my father dead im sorry for asking said taverner but i need to know all the facts and now i have to ask you some rather personal questions about the relationship between your father and his wife were they happy together yes as far as i know said philip did you approve of your fathers second marriage my approval was not asked philip said but i thought the marriage was unwise it must have been quite a shock to you said the inspector philip did not reply did you get on well with mrs leonides taverner continued yes answered philip though i dont see her very often what can you tell me about mr laurence brown your childrens teacher not very much philip said my father employed him his references were good and he is a good enough teacher he lives in your fathers part of the house not here there was more room there have you ever noticed any signs of a close relationship between laurence brown and your stepmother was taverners final question no i have not philip replied chief inspector taverner got up thank you very much for your help mr leonides i followed him out of the room my goodness charles said taverner as we stood in the corridor hes a cold man chapter seven and now lets talk to his wife magda the actress said taverner the name she uses on stage is magda west ive heard her name i said is she a good actress she has starred once or twice in the big london theatres said taverner but shes never become famous perhaps because she doesnt need to earn her living if she wants to play a certain part she sometimes finances the whole play herself sophia came out of the drawing room my mother is in here chief inspector i followed taverner into the big drawing room for a moment i didnt recognize the woman who sat on the sofa she was so different from the emotional woman in the luxurious pink dressing gown i had seen earlier magdas red hair was now arranged in an oldfashioned style on the top of her head and she wore a neat grey coat and skirt and a pale shirt please sit down inspector she said in a calm quiet voice how can i help you thank you said taverner can i ask where you were at the time of your fatherinlaws death i was driving home from london magda said id had lunch with a friend and then gone shopping when i got here everything was in confusion my fatherinlaw had become ill and was dead her voice shook just a little were you fond of your fatherinlaw asked the inspector we were all fond of him replied magda he was very good to us do you get on well with mrs leonides we dont see very much of brenda we dont have much in common was mrs leonides happy with her husband oh i think so replied magda quietly she is very friendly with laurence brown i believe magdas body became stiff and she looked sadly at taverner brenda she said with dignity is friendly to everyone do you like laurence brown hes very quiet you dont really notice hes there taverner tried to shock her do you think brenda leonides and laurence brown were having a love affair magda stood up theatrically as if she was on stage i have no idea inspector she said and that is not a question you should ask me brenda was my fatherinlaws wife i felt like clapping her performance taverner also stood up thank you mrs leonides he said i followed taverner out to the door to the stairs im just going up to see roger the elder brother he explained can you help me taverner i said if anyone asks me what im doing here what should i say taverner smiled has anyone asked you well no i admitted if no one has asked you then dont explain or say anything he said simply everyone is too worried to ask you questions hmm he continued this door isnt locked none of them are in this house you realize of course that all my questions about who was in the house that day dont matter at all then why ask i said because i want to hear them talk taverner said i might learn something everybody in the house had the means and the opportunity to kill the old man what i want is a motive he knocked on the door at the top of the stairs it was opened by a big tall man with strong shoulders dark hair and an ugly but pleasant face you must be chief inspector taverner he said im roger leonides do come into the sitting room he led us into a completely white room which was light and airy and had very little furniture it was very different to magdas crowded room downstairs ill go and get my wife clemency said roger oh youre here darling i must get some cigarettes if you dont mind he bumped into a table and went clumsily out of the room i looked at clemency leonides she was about fifty with short grey hair that suited her intelligent and sensitive face her eyes were grey and she wore a simple red wool dress that fitted her slim figure perfectly she had a strong personality and i understood at once why sophia had said she was ruthless the room was cold and i shivered a little please sit down chief inspector said clemency in a quiet voice is there any news your fatherinlaw died of eserine poisoning replied taverner it was definitely murder this will upset my husband very much said clemency hes a very emotional person and he loved his father dearly did you get on well with your fatherinlaw mrs leonides i got on quite well with him she said quietly but i didnt like him very much i didnt like the way he did business what about brenda leonides do you think she was having a love affair with laurence brown i dont think so said clemency but i dont really know she didnt sound at all interested roger leonides came hurrying back well chief inspector is there any news your father died of eserine poisoning explained taverner my god exclaimed roger so that woman murdered him she couldnt wait for him to die why do you think that taverner asked who else could it be said roger walking quickly up and down the room pulling his hair ive never trusted brenda never liked her none of us did why did father marry her at his age it was madness madness my father was an amazing man chief inspector he did everything for me and i i failed him he sat down heavily now roger please dont get upset said his wife quietly chief inspector taverner wants our help id like to strangle that woman with my own hands said roger angrily yes id strangle her if she were here he was shaking with anger roger said clemency sharply sorry dearest said roger calming down i do apologize i please excuse me he said to us and went out of the room again he wouldnt really hurt anyone said clemency with a slight smile taverner politely began to ask his routine questions which clemency leonides answered clearly roger had been in london on the day of his fathers death working at the head office of associated foods he had returned in the afternoon and had spent some time with his father she herself had been at work in london and had returned to the house just before six oclock did you see your fatherinlaw on the day of his death asked taverner no replied clemency i saw him the day before after dinner but not on the day he died i did go to his part of the house to get something for roger but i didnt disturb the old man when did you hear that he was ill brenda came rushing over just after halfpast six i knew that these questions werent important but they gave inspector taverner the chance to look closely at the woman who answered them then taverner asked if he could look round their part of the house clemency was surprised but showed us the plain simple rooms which were all very tidy and neat then she opened another door saying roger will be in here its his own special room come in said roger as his wife left us his room was very different to those in the rest of the house it was a personal room full of papers photographs and big chairs and although it was untidy it was pleasant and comfortable im sorry about my behaviour earlier said roger i get very emotional at times he looked round to make sure that clemency was not with us my wife has been wonderful he said i admire her so much shes had such a hard life she looked after her first husband who died and i was so glad when she agreed to marry me so i could take care of her im so lucky id do anything for her again taverner politely began to ask his questions when did you first know that your father was ill brenda rushed over to tell me id left him only half an hour before and he was all right then i rushed over to see him he couldnt breathe properly and then i ran down to philip who phoned for the doctor i we couldnt do anything to help when taverner and i left rogers part of the house the chief inspector said hes very different to his brother isnt he i agreed with him and the women theyve married are very different too taverner added clemency and magda were indeed very different and yet i thought that both married couples seemed happy together but i dont think roger is a poisoner continued taverner though his wife might be no i think its much more likely to be brenda leonides though i dont know if well ever get any evidence chapter eight now we went to aristide leonides part of the house where a servant opened the door and led us into a big drawing room although it was the same size as philip and magdas drawing room this room looked very different it had bright sofas and luxurious curtains and on the wall was a painting of a little old man he had sharp but kindlooking dark eyes and crooked shoulders he looked powerful and full of life thats aristide leonides said taverner he certainly had a strong personality yes i agreed looking at the painting and the little mans lively dark eyes now i understood why edith de haviland thought that the house seemed empty without him theres a painting of his first wife over there said taverner i looked at the picture of a typical english country lady her face was handsome but rather dull and lifeless not like her husbands face just then the door opened and aristide leonides second wife came into the room brenda leonides was quite pretty she had brown hair and was wearing a black dress and lots of expensive jewellery she moved easily and lazily like a cat i noticed that though she wore makeup she had obviously been crying i also noticed that she looked frightened good morning mrs leonides said taverner im sorry to disturb you again you do understand dont you that you can have your lawyer here if you want i wondered if she understood what these words meant apparently not i dont like mr gaitskill said brenda leonides sitting down on the sofa i dont want him here well start then said taverner have you found out anything she asked her hands twisting nervously yes said taverner your husband definitely died from eserine poisoning you mean those eye drops killed him thats right you injected mr leonides with eserine not insulin but i didnt know that exclaimed brenda i didnt have anything to do with it then somebody must have deliberately replaced the insulin with the eye drops it must have been an accident or one of the servants said brenda weve interviewed the servants said taverner and we dont suspect any of them have you any other ideas mrs leonides she stared at him ive no idea at all she said you said you were at the cinema that afternoon yes i came in at halfpast six i i gave my husband his injection as usual and then he he became ill i was terrified i rushed to find roger ive told you all this before im sorry mrs leonides said taverner now can i speak to mr brown to laurence why he doesnt know anything about it i still want to speak to him she stared at the chief inspector suspiciously laurence is in the schoolroom teaching eustace taverner and i left the room and walked down the corridor to a large room overlooking the garden inside a fairhaired young man of about thirty was sitting at a table with a handsome dark boy of sixteen they looked up as we came in sophias brother eustace looked at me while laurence brown stared at chief inspector taverner oh er good morning inspector he said looking very frightened good morning taverner was abrupt can i have a word with you yes of course said laurence brown eustace stood up do you want me to go away he said his voice was pleasant but slightly arrogant we we can continue your lesson later said his teacher and eustace walked stiffly out through the door and shut it behind him well mr brown said taverner i can confirm that mr leonides died of eserine poisoning which was injected instead of insulin i cant believe it its incredible would you like your lawyer here asked taverner i dont have a lawyer said laurence brown and i dont want one i have nothing to hide im innocent innocent i have not suggested anything else taverner paused mrs leonides was a lot younger than her husband wasnt she i i suppose so i mean well yes she must have felt lonely sometimes laurence brown did not answer she must have liked having a friend near her own age living here i no not at all i mean i dont know it would be natural that you two should have become more than friends we did not insisted the young man i know what youre thinking but youre wrong mrs leonides was always very kind to me and i respect her but nothing more and i i wouldnt kill anybody im very sensitive and im not very strong i object to killing i wouldnt fight in the war they let me teach instead and ive done my best here with eustace and josephine shes a very intelligent child but difficult everybody has been very kind to me and now this awful thing happens and you suspect me me of murder chief inspector taverner looked at him closely i havent said that he remarked but you think so they all think so they look at me i i cant go on talking to you im not well he hurried out of the room hes really scared said taverner but that doesnt prove anything is he a murderer i dont know if hed have the courage i said this murder didnt need courage said the chief inspector all he had to do was switch two bottles then he could marry a very rich woman its a shame that the servants havent seen anything going on between them he sighed but its all theory he admitted its more likely to be the wife brenda though why didnt she throw away the insulin bottle or wash it he looked at me go back and talk to her charles id like to know what you think chapter nine i found brenda leonides sitting exactly where we had left her is inspector taverner coming back she asked abruptly not now i replied who are you at last someone had asked me that question im with the police i said but im also a friend of the family the family i hate them all brenda looked frightened and angry theyve always been horrible to me why shouldnt i marry their father what did it matter to them hed already given them lots of money and i was very fond of him i see i said its true brenda said i was sick of men i wanted a home and someone to be nice to me aristide made me laugh and he was clever im sorry hes dead she sat back on the sofa ive been safe and happy here she said aristide gave me lovely things she looked at the expensive ring on her hand with a satisfied smile and i was very nice to him do you know how we met brenda didnt wait for me to answer i was working in a tea shop and brought him his lunch i was crying and he asked me to sit down i said i couldnt id lose my job no you wont he said i own this place he was a little old man but he had power i told him what was wrong i was a respectable girl but i was i was in trouble i was going to have a baby she looked at me aristide was wonderful she said we were married at once then i found out he was very rich it was like a fairy story brenda smiled lazily like a cat and id made a mistake i wasnt pregnant i was a good wife to aristide and made him happy but his family they were always there living on his money they were horrible to me roger hates me and philip never speaks to me and now they think i murdered their father but i didnt i didnt i felt very sorry for her she was alone and helpless and all the leonides family wanted to believe she was a murderer and if they dont think that i did it they think that laurence did brenda continued hes so sensitive and ive just tried to be kind to him he has to teach those horrible children eustace is always rude to him hes been ill you know and cant go back to school yet but thats no reason to be rude and josephine well sometimes i think theres something wrong with josephine she likes to sneak and spy on people i didnt really want to hear about the children just now what chance do laurence and i have against the rest of the family brenda asked me it could have been one of them who killed aristide they dont seem to have a motive i said but i dont have a motive brenda said and nor does laurence they might think i said uncomfortably that you and er laurence are in love with each other and want to get married she sat up straight thats a wicked thing to say and its not true ive been nice to laurence but were just friends thats all you do believe me dont you i did believe her i believed that she and laurence were just friends though of course it was possible that she was in love with him without knowing it i was thinking about all this when i went downstairs to find sophia who was helping nannie with lunch she led me into the empty drawing room well she said what did you think of brenda i felt sorry for her sophia looked amused i see she said yes brenda does seem to get on well with men i was annoyed i can see her point of view thats all i said has anyone in your family ever been nice to her no we havent been nice to her said sophia why should we be youve seen brendas point of view now see things from my side i dont like the kind of woman who pretends shes going to have a baby so she can marry a rich old man was she pretending about the baby i asked i dont know but i think so said sophia but she didnt fool grandfather he knew what he wasdoing and he got what he wanted from his point of view the marriage was a complete success was employing laurence brown as a teacher a success too i asked ironically sophia frowned perhaps grandfather wanted to keep brenda happy and amused by giving her a mild romance in her life with someone harmless like laurence im sure he didnt think it would end in his own murder and that added sophia speaking with certainty is why i dont really believe that brenda or laurence did it because grandfather would have known that sounds very unlikely i said doubtfully but you didnt know grandfather she answered is laurence very frightened yes he is i said i dont understand how any woman could fall in love with a weak man like him dont you charles actually laurence is very attractive and you seemed to like brenda very much dont be silly i said shes not even pretty no but she made you feel sorry for her said sophia brendas not very pretty and shes not very clever but she does make trouble shes made trouble already between you and me sophia i exclaimed as she moved towards the door forget it charles i must go to the kitchen and help nannie with lunch i remembered something that had puzzled me sophia why do you have to do that why dont you have more servants in a house this size sometimes we do have more servants she replied but then mother upsets them and they leave apart from nannie we dont have any permanent servants at the moment so i have to help as much as i can sophia went off to the kitchen and i sat down in one of the big chairs to think upstairs i had seen brendas side of the story and now i had seen sophias side i realized that it was quite natural for sophia and her family to dislike brenda so much but i saw something that they didnt see they were rich and powerful with a safe place in society they didnt know what it was like to be poor and helpless brenda leonides had wanted pretty things and a safe home and in exchange she had made her old husband happy i felt sorry for her i could see both her side of the story and sophias side but who was right i hadnt slept well the night before and had got up early that morning now in the warm room and the comfortable chair my body relaxed and my eyes closed and i went to sleep chapter ten i woke up so slowly that at first i didnt realize that id been sleeping in front of me i saw a human face a round face with a big forehead combedback hair and small black eyes the face was attached to a small thin body and was looking at me closely hello said the face im josephine i had already guessed that this was sophias sister josephine was an ugly little girl about eleven or twelve years old who looked very like her grandfather youre sophias young man said josephine but why did you come here with chief inspector taverner hes my friend i told her is he i dont like him i wont tell him things what sort of things the things i know i know a lot of things i like knowing things she sat down and continued to look at me closely grandfathers been murdered did you know yes i said i knew he was poisoned with eserine she said the word very carefully its interesting isnt it i suppose it is eustace and i are very interested we like detective stories im being a detective now im collecting clues she was rather a strange child i thought i think therell be a lot of changes here now josephine told me well go and live in a house in london mother will be very pleased father couldnt afford it before he lost lots of money on one of mothers plays grandfather wouldnt pay for it he said it would be a failure but mother didnt listen im sorry the play was a failure i said yes mother was very upset the things they said in the newspapers were so bad that she cried all day and threw her breakfast at one of the servants who left it was rather fun are you sorry your grandfather is dead i asked not really i didnt like him much he stopped me learning to be a ballet dancer did you want to learn ballet dancing yes and mother and father didnt mind but grandfather said id be no good she stood up and danced a few steps round the chair i suppose the house will be sold now unless brenda goes on living here and i suppose uncle roger and aunt clemency wont be going away now were they going away i asked curiously yes they were going on tuesday said josephine abroad somewhere it was a secret they werent going to tell anyone until after theyd gone they were going to leave a note behind for grandfather josephine do you know why your uncle roger was going away i said she looked at me slyly it was something to do with uncle rogers office in london i think but im not sure that hed embezzled something that means stealing money why do you think that josephine came so near that i could feel her breath on my face the day that grandfather was poisoned he and uncle roger were shut up in a room together for a long time they were talking and talking and uncle roger was very upset he said he was a failure and that he wasnt upset because of the money but because grandfather had trusted him i looked at her josephine i said did you listen at the door josephine nodded her head yes she said you have to listen at doors if you want to find out things im sure the police do and they look in peoples desks and read all their letters and find out all their secrets but theyre stupid they dont know where to look josephine spoke coldly as if she was better than the police i didnt really notice the importance of what she said the unpleasant child continued eustace and i know lots of things but i know more than eustace does and i wont tell him he says women cant be great detectives but they can im going to write down everything in a little black notebook and then when the police are completely confused ill tell them who the murderer is do you read a lot of detective stories josephine yes lots and do you know who killed your grandfather well i think so but i need to find a few more clues she paused and added chief inspector taverner thinks that brenda did it doesnt he or brenda and laurence together because theyre in love with each other you shouldnt say things like that josephine why not they are in love with each other you dont know that yes i do they write to each other love letters josephine how do you know that because ive read them theyre very soppy letters but laurence is soppy he was too frightened to fight in the war just at that moment a car arrived outside and josephine ran to look out of the window its mr gaitskill grandfathers lawyer she said i expect hes come about the will very excited she hurried from the room a few minutes later sophia and her mother magda entered with a small elderly man your husband asked me to bring his fathers will the lawyer was saying to magda but i dont have it do you know anything about it about poor dear grandfathers will magda opened her eyes astonished no of course not he told us hed sent it to you after he signed it but the police didnt find the will with mr leonides private papers said mr gaitskill ill just go and talk to chief inspector taverner he left the room darling said magda to her daughter im sure that wicked woman upstairs has destroyed it i know im right nonsense mother she wouldnt do a stupid thing like that said sophia it wouldnt be stupid at all if theres no will shell get everything ssh mr gaitskills coming back the lawyer reentered the room with philip leonides and chief inspector taverner ive talked to the bank the inspector was saying but they dont have any private papers belonging to mr leonides i wonder if roger or aunt edith knows anything said philip sophia can you ask them to come down here but when the others arrived they couldnt help father signed the will said roger and told us he was going to post it to mr gaitskill the next day i sent mr leonides his will ready for signing on november th mr gaitskill said a week later he told me it had been signed and sent to his bank to keep it safe thats right said roger eagerly it was in november last year you remember philip that father read us the will and what did the will say asked taverner it was quite simple said roger father left fifty thousand pounds to aunt edith and one hundred thousand pounds and this house to brenda the rest of fathers money and property was going to be divided into three parts one for myself one for philip and the third for sophia eustace and josephine and the money for the last two was going to be kept in the bank until eustace and josephine were twentyone i think thats right isnt it mr gaitskill that is correct agreed mr gaitskill slightly annoyed that he hadnt been allowed to explain the will himself father read it out to us said roger and asked if we had any comments and brenda said that she hated to hear her darling old aristide talk about death added magda quickly and when he was dead she didnt want any of his stupid money thats only what people of her class think they ought to say said miss de haviland coldly i realized suddenly how much edith de haviland disliked brenda and after reading the will what happened next asked inspector taverner exactly how and when did mr leonides sign it roger looked round at his wife so it was clemency who answered the inspectors question my fatherinlaw put the will down on his desk and asked two of the servants to come in she said he covered the will with a piece of paper so they couldnt read it then signed the will and asked the servants to sign their own names under his signature thats right approved mr gaitskill to be legal a will must be signed in front of two witnesses who must then sign at the same time and then what happened asked taverner my fatherinlaw thanked the servants and they went out said clemency then he put the will in an envelope and said that he would send it to mr gaitskill the next day do you all agree said chief inspector taverner looking round that this is what happened there were murmurs of agreement you say that the will was on the desk continued taverner were any of you near that desk no we were sitting about five or six yards away said clemency and did mr leonides get up or leave the desk after reading the will and before signing it no chief inspector taverner took out an envelope and gave it to mr gaitskill we found this with mr leonides private papers he said to the lawyer please have a look and tell me what it is mr gaitskill looked at the contents of the envelope with astonishment i dont understand he said this is the very same will but it isnt signed perhaps its just a copy suggested roger no said the lawyer no its the very same will that i prepared for mr leonides to sign there is a small mark on the paper that i noticed at the time i swear its the exact same will but thats impossible exclaimed philip speaking with more excitement than id heard from him before we saw both the servants and my father sign the will father couldnt see very well but he was wearing his reading glasses that evening yes i remember that too agreed clemency and nobody you are all sure of that went near the desk before the will was signed asked taverner nobody went near the desk said sophia and grandfather sat there all the time then i dont see how the will was changed said taverner perhaps the signatures were erased or rubbed out roger suggested but we would still be able to see signs of that said mr gaitskill and there arent any the family looked at one another we were all there said roger it just couldnt have happened miss de haviland coughed but it did happen she remarked what id like to know is what happens next it is an interesting legal problem said mr gaitskill this will of course cancels all previous wills and a large number of witnesses saw mr leonides sign it taverner looked at his watch im afraid he said i must go now everybody stood up and i went quietly towards sophia and asked if i should go too yes i think thats best agreed sophia i followed taverner out of the room and saw josephine outside in the corridor she appeared to be amused about something the police are very stupid she said chapter eleven i arrived at my fathers office at scotland yard to find chief inspector taverner talking about the case i havent discovered anything at all he was explaining sadly i cant find a financial motive they all have enough money and theres no evidence that brenda leonides and laurence brown were having a love affair i can do better than that i said sitting down roger leonides and his wife clemency were planning to go abroad roger and his father had an emotional interview on the day of the old mans death aristide leonides had found out something was wrong and roger admitted it how do you know that demanded taverner a private detective told me i explained to them about josephine and how she thought roger had been stealing money from his company it sounds as if the child knows everything that happens in that house my father commented if this information is true it changes everything said taverner if roger was stealing money from the company and his father found out then roger had a motive for killing him brenda leonides was out at the cinema all roger had to do was go to his fathers bathroom empty out an insulin bottle and fill it up with eserine or perhaps his wife clemency did it she admitted that she went over to aristide leonides part of the house and i think shes quite capable of poisoning someone i still dont think that roger would use poison to kill someone i said but i agree that clemency might i had liked roger i dont think that clemency cares about money but she does care about her husband for him she could be well ruthless the next day taverner and my father had news rogers company associated foods is definitely going to go bankrupt soon reported taverner looking pleased and slightly excited its been badly managed for years by roger leonides i asked yes hes in charge said taverner but we dont think hes been stealing money he just doesnt know how to run a business properly and has made lots of bad decisions roger was only in charge of such a big company because he was aristide leonides son my father remarked hes been stupid added taverner but he hasnt done anything against the law so why commit murder i asked associated foods needs a lot of money quickly to stop it going bankrupt explained taverner roger inherits a lot of money now his father is dead though he wont get the money in time the banks will give him credit and the company can be saved why didnt roger just ask his father for help i asked i think he did said taverner and josephine overheard but the old man refused to give roger the money i thought that taverner was right aristide leonides was a generous man but he didnt like to waste money he had refused to give magda the money to produce her play i thought it was unlikely that he would give roger enough money probably hundreds of thousands of pounds to save associated foods the only way for roger to avoid financial ruin was if his father died it was a strong motive for murder ive asked roger leonides to come here to my office my father said hell be here soon sure enough roger soon arrived clumsily bumping into a chair as he entered the room in fact he was so clumsy that i couldnt imagine him putting eserine into an insulin bottle surely he would have dropped the poison or broken the bottle you wanted to see me said roger eagerly oh hello charles i didnt see you have you found something my father spoke coldly and officially telling roger about his legal rights and asking him if he wanted a lawyer roger looked confused but why am i here he asked ive told you everything i know you did not tell us about the conversation you had with your father on the afternoon of his death said taverner about associated foods roger sat down suddenly holding his face in his hands i didnt think anybody knew about that you need to tell us the truth said taverner will associated foods go bankrupt yes admitted roger the company cant be saved now i wish my father had died without ever knowing about it i feel so ashamed my father trusted me with his biggest company and i failed him why did you and your wife plan to go abroad without telling anybody asked my father i didnt do anything against the law said roger but i didnt want to tell my father about it he was so fond of me and would offer to help but im no good at business or managing a company ive been so unhappy i just wanted to escape from it all clemency shes a wonderful woman agreed to go away with me without telling anyone so we could live somewhere simply and quietly i see said my father slowly so why did you change your mind and ask your father for help roger stared at him but i didnt he exclaimed my father found out himself when he asked me about it i told him everything the dear old man was so good and kind to me he insisted on giving me the money to save associated foods and wrote to his bank straight away your father agreed to help you asked taverner astonished yes ive still got the letter said roger i forgot to post it i was so shocked and confused after fathers death he looked in his pockets here he said finding the letter read it yourselves if you dont believe me my father and taverner read the letter eagerly i read it later roger had told the truth aristide leonides had asked his bank to give associated foods enough money to save the company from bankruptcy what did you do after your father wrote this letter asked taverner i rushed back to my own part of the house and told clemency what had happened and how wonderful my father had been about half an hour later brenda came rushing in saying that father was ill just as i told you before so you didnt visit your fathers bathroom at any time my father asked i dont think so no no i am sure i didnt why you dont think that i my father stood up and managed to interrupt thank you mr leonides he said shaking rogers hand you have been very helpful though you should have told us all this before when roger had left i looked at the letter so aristide leonides was going to help roger said my father that means that roger had no motive for murder in fact he paused if aristide leonides had lived a day longer roger and associated foods would have been all right but because he died so soon the company will now go bankrupt maybe someone wanted roger to fail suggested taverner what about the old mans will my father asked who actually gets the money now taverner sighed the lawyers cant tell us there is an old will but it was cancelled when the new will was made but if aristide leonides died without a legal will then his wife brenda leonides gets everything shes the most likely person to have played tricks with the will though i still have no idea how i didnt know either we were looking at the problem from the wrong way round chapter twelve chief inspector taverner left and my father and i were alone after a short silence i asked dad what are murderers like now that murder had come so close to me i wanted to know more about his previous police experience my father looked at me thoughtfully some of them he smiled sadly are very nice ordinary people just like roger leonides looked surprised oh yes he continued murderers can be ordinary people who want something so much that they kill for it they dont think about what happens next and some people although they know that murder is wrong dont feel that its wrong they think that it wasnt their fault or that their victim deserved it and theyre never really sorry for what they did do you think i asked that someone could kill old leonides if they hated him hated him for a long time its possible but unlikely my father replied looking at me curiously people are more likely to kill those they love than those they hate only people you love can make your life impossible but this doesnt help you does it he added what you really want to know is how to recognize a murderer in a house full of people who seem pleasant and normal yes thats right i admitted my father paused to think the one thing that all murderers have in common he said finally is that they are all vain they are frightened of being caught but they still want to show off about how clever they are and a murderer wants to talk to talk yes because theyre very lonely explained my father they cant tell anyone about what they did or how clever they are and they will never be able to tell so they like talking about the murder i think charles that you should go back to three gables and get everyone to talk to you everyone in the family guilty or innocent will talk to you because they can say things to you that they cant say to each other and if the murderer talks he or she might make a mistake and say too much i told him then what sophia had said about how the family was ruthless in different ways he was very interested yes he said most families have a weakness and it sounds as if both the de haviland family and the leonides family have a different kind of weakness but i wouldnt worry too much about that charles the best thing to do is to go and talk to them all only the truth can help you and your sophia as i went out of the room he added and look after the child josephine we dont want anything to happen to her i stared at him come on charles think he said theres a murderer in that house and josephine seems to know everything that happens there she certainly knew all about roger i agreed and her story about what she overheard seems to be correct yes said my father a childs evidence is usually very reliable even if we cant often use it in court but children like to show off if you want josephine to tell you anything else dont ask her questions instead pretend that you think she doesnt know anything but take care of her he added its possible that she knows too much chapter thirteen as i went back to the crooked house as i called it in my own mind i felt slightly guilty i hadnt told my father and chief inspector taverner what josephine had said about brenda leonides and laurence brown writing love letters to each other i told myself that it probably wasnt true but really i didnt want to find any evidence against brenda i felt sorry for her surrounded by a family who disliked her so much and if there were any love letters taverner would soon find them and perhaps josephine was wrong though when i remembered the intelligence in her small black eyes i doubted it i had phoned sophia earlier please come charles she had said the police keep searching the house and were all very nervous ill go crazy if i cant talk to someone there was no one in sight as i drove up to the front door which was open as i stood there wondering whether to ring the bell or to walk in i heard a noise behind me i turned my head and saw josephine standing by the hedge eating a large apple and looking at me hello josephine i said she didnt answer and disappeared behind the hedge when i followed i found her sitting on a wooden seat swinging her legs she looked at me coldly and didnt speak why wouldnt you speak to me when i said hello i asked i didnt want to said josephine still eating her apple why not you sneaked to the police about uncle roger she said oh i said but its all right josephine the police know that roger didnt steal any money or do anything wrong josephine looked at me as if i was stupid i wasnt worrying about uncle roger she said but surely you know that in detective stories you never tell the police until the end oh i see i said im sorry josephine im really very sorry so you should be she replied i trusted you i said i was sorry again and josephine seemed to forgive me she continued eating her apple but the police would have found out anyway i said because uncle roger will be bankrupt as usual josephine knew what was going on father and mother and uncle roger and aunt edith are going to talk about it tonight aunt edith wants to give uncle roger all her money though she hasnt got it yet but father wont again i was impressed by how much she knew josephine i said you told me that you were almost sure who the murderer was well who is it i asked i promise i wont tell inspector taverner i want a few more clues first said josephine throwing away what was left of her apple and i wouldnt tell you anyway then will you tell me more about the letters i asked what letters the letters you said laurence brown and brenda wrote to each other i made that up said josephine i often make things up it amuses me i stared at her and she stared back somewhere not very far away a twig snapped with a sudden noise rather late i remembered my fathers advice oh well i said its only a game for you you dont really know anything josephine looked at me angrily but she kept her mouth firmly shut i got up i must go and find sophia now i said come along im staying here said josephine no youre not i insisted pulling her to her feet youre coming in with me josephine seemed surprised but decided to come in with me probably to see how the family behaved when i arrived it wasnt until i walked through the front door that i realized why i hadnt wanted josephine to stay outside it was because of the sudden snapping of a twig chapter fourteen i heard voices coming from the big drawing room but i didnt go in instead i walked down the corridor towards the kitchen and pushed open the door there i found nannie a large cheerful old woman i knew she had worked for the family for many years looking after the children its mr charles isnt it she said come in and have a cup of tea i sat down in the big comfortable kitchen and nannie brought me a cup of tea and two sweet biscuits i felt like a small child again i felt that i was safe and that everything was all right because nannie was there miss sophia will be glad youre here said nannie shes been getting rather overexcited at that moment the door opened with a rush and sophia came in oh charles she said oh nannie im so glad hes here i know you are dear nannie smiled to herself and went into the room next door and shut the door behind her i put my arms round sophia dearest i said youre shaking whats the matter im frightened charles said sophia im frightened someone in this house someone i see and speak to every day is a murderer if only i knew who it was i didnt know what to say i wished i could take her home with me away from this house and the worst thing is she whispered is that we may never know i knew she was right and that we might never know who poisoned aristide leonides and then i remembered something id wanted to ask her tell me sophia i said how many people in this house knew about your grandfathers eserine eye drops and that they were poisonous if injected that doesnt help charles she said because we all knew we were all with grandfather one day after lunch when brenda put the eserine drops in each of his eyes josephine asked why it said not to be taken on the bottle of eye drops and grandfather smiled and said if brenda made a mistake and injected me with eye drops instead of insulin i would probably stop breathing and die because my heart isnt very strong josephine said oo we were all listening we all heard him say it so aristide leonides had actually told the murderer exactly how to kill him i took a deep breath sophia seemed to know what i was thinking and said yes its rather horrible isnt it just then nannie came back into the kitchen she must have overheard what we were saying i think you should forget about such horrible things as murder she said leave it to the police its their business not yours but nannie dont you realize that someone in this house is a murderer said sophia nonsense replied nannie the front door is open all the time anyone could get in to this house she again went into the room next door come on charles said sophia lets go to the drawing room theres a family meeting about rogers business affairs if youre going to marry me you need to see what my family is really like in the drawing room all the family were there except brenda and josephine philips face looked cold and serious while rogers face was red and he looked annoyed clemency who was looking at the paintings on the wall looked calm and cool and edith was sitting up very straight doing some knitting magda and eustace both so goodlooking sat together on the sofa eustaces handsome face was unhappy as sophia and i came in everyone stopped talking and looked at us philip frowned sophia this is a private family meeting he said coldly i heard the click of miss de havilands knitting needles charles and i hope to get married sophia said in a clear and determined voice i want him to be here and why not said roger charles knows all about it already do sit down clemency said i looked at her thankfully as i found myself a chair the family meeting continued i think we should do what aristide wanted said miss de haviland roger when the will is sorted out you can have my money to help save the company roger pulled at his hair no aunt edith no he exclaimed i suppose said philip that i might be able to give you a little money thats not very fair to our children said magda quickly im not going to take anyones money roger said excitedly of course hes not agreed clemency anyway magda added roger will have his own money when the will is sorted out but surely he wont have the money in time to save the company said eustace angrily eustace is right said roger nothing can stop associated foods from going bankrupt its too late he sounded almost pleased and what does the company matter compared to the fact that father is dead we are only trying to help philip said stiffly his face turning slightly red i know phil i know said roger but theres nothing you can do it was all my fault i was in charge yes philip said slowly looking at him you were in charge edith de haviland stood up i think weve talked enough about this she said with such power in her voice that everyone went quiet it seemed that the family meeting was over magda and eustace got up and left the room while roger put his hand on philips arm and said thanks phil for trying to help the brothers went out together followed by sophia who said that she would get my room ready as i was staying the night edith de haviland put away her knitting she looked towards me as if she was going to speak but she changed her mind sighed and went out after the others i was left alone with clemency who was looking out of the window and went to stand beside her im glad thats over she said magda arranged it all just like a play act ii the family meeting there was nothing really to discuss she sounded pleased about it rather than sad dont you understand she asked were free at last roger has been unhappy for years he was never any good at business and it broke his heart because he failed his father roger loved his father a great deal they all did clemency turned to look at me its ridiculous to think that roger would have killed his father especially for money roger was actually glad when he knew the company would go bankrupt he was looking forward to our new life where were you going i asked to barbados she replied a cousin of mine died recently and left me a small house and some land well be very poor but well be together away from all rogers family and i dont mind not having much money i dont like money i was happy with my first husband when we were poor and i didnt love him like i love roger she closed her eyes and smiled to herself i could tell how strong her feelings were and i was sure that clemency meant what she said she wasnt interested in money or living in luxury are you still going to barbados i asked oh yes as soon as the police will let us when everything has been sorted out we can leave i hope it doesnt take too long clemency i said do you have any idea who did this any idea at all she gave me a strange look and when she spoke her voice sounded stiff and awkward im a scientist i deal with facts not guesses all i can say is that brenda and laurence are the obvious suspects so you think they did it clemency shrugged her shoulders and stood for a moment as if she was listening then she went out of the room passing edith de haviland on the way edith came straight over to me i want to talk to you she said about philip i hope you didnt get the wrong idea about him philip is rather difficult to understand he may seem cold but he isnt really i didnt really think i began she didnt let me speak philip is really a dear when you understand him you see aristide loved all his children dearly but roger the oldest was his true favourite and i think philip felt it and though he always hides his feelings he suffered as children do hes always been jealous of roger even if he doesnt realize it himself so do you think that philip is secretly pleased that rogers company has failed yes said miss de haviland i do think that and it upset me that philip didnt want to help roger straightaway why should he i said roger is a grown man with no children to think about if he was ill or very poor his family would help but im sure roger would prefer to start a new life without their help yes im sure he would said miss de haviland and so would clemency she looked at me i realize that this is all very difficult for sophia she continued im sorry that she has so much to deal with when she is still so young i love them all you know roger and philip and now sophia eustace and josephine i love all my sisters children and grandchildren she paused for a few moments yes i love them dearly but not too much she added before turning abruptly and going out of the room i had the feeling that her last remark was important but i did not understand it chapter fifteen your rooms ready said sophia we stood together looking out of the window at the grey and windy garden it was getting dark outside and as we watched two people came through the hedge and walked back towards the house the first person was brenda leonides she was wearing a grey fur coat and moved quickly and easily like a cat as she passed the window i saw that she was smiling a few minutes later we saw laurence brown walk through the hedge it didnt look as if he and brenda had been for a normal walk there was something secretive in the way they returned to the house i wondered if it was brendas or laurences foot that had snapped the twig that made me think of josephine and i asked sophia where she was shes probably with eustace in the schoolroom sophia replied im worried about eustace why she frowned hes behaving so strangely lately since hes been ill i dont know what hes thinking sometimes he seems to hate us all hell probably change as he gets older its just a temporary thing yes i suppose so said sophia but i do worry perhaps because mother and father dont i didnt notice until i came back from the war but they are a strange couple father lives in the past with his history books and mother makes everything into a scene from a play she arranged that meeting tonight because she was bored and wanted a dramatic scene forget about your family sophia i said firmly i wish i could i was happy in cairo when i could forget about them i remembered that sophia had never mentioned her home or her family is that why you never talked about them i asked because you wanted to forget them i think so were all too fond of each other and we all live too closely together all together in a little crooked house we havent grown up separately and become independent were all tangled together and have grown up crooked i remembered edith de haviland grinding the weed under her foot just as sophia added like bindweed and then suddenly magda burst through the door and turned on the lights what an incredible scene that was she said eustace was so annoyed and i love it when roger gets angry and pulls his hair and edith really meant it when she offered roger her money shed do anything for this family it must have been hard for her after her sister died i remarked especially because she disliked old leonides so much disliked him interrupted magda who told you that nonsense she was in love with him mother said sophia but she herself told me i argued that she always disliked him she probably did when she first came here said magda she was angry with her sister for marrying him but she was definitely in love with him i know im right edith didnt like it when he married brenda she didnt like it at all you and father didnt like it either said sophia no of course we didnt said magda but edith hated it most ive seen the way she looks at brenda then she added on a completely different subject ive decided to send josephine to school in switzerland its not good for her to be here at the moment im going to arrange it tomorrow grandfather didnt want josephine to go to school said sophia slowly darling old grandfather liked us all to live together but i think that josephine should be with other children switzerland is such a healthy place it will be good for her magda stood up smiled and went towards the door children must come first she said as she went out it was a lovely exit line sophia sighed mother is annoying when she gets a sudden idea why should josephine be sent away to switzerland in such a hurry it might be good for josephine to go to school i said grandfather didnt think so argued sophia i was slightly irritated did such an old man really know what was best for josephine i asked he did know best insisted sophia though i admit that josephine is rather difficult she likes to sneak around and spy on people but only because shes playing at being a detective i thought about how josephine seemed to know everything that happened in the house perhaps magda had another reason for suddenly sending josephine to school switzerland was a long way away chapter sixteen as i washed my face the next morning i thought about what id learned people had talked to me just as my father said they would the only person who hadnt talked to me was philip leonides i thought that was strange especially as he knew i wanted to marry his daughter edith de haviland had told me that philip had been an unhappy child jealous of his brother roger could philip have killed his father not for money but so that roger would be blamed for it i looked at my face in the mirror what was i trying to do prove that sophias father was a murderer that wasnt what sophia wanted or was it did sophia herself suspect her father and was she bravely trying to find out the truth what did edith de haviland mean when she said she loved the family but not too much and why had clemency looked at me so strangely before she said that brenda and laurence were the obvious suspects everyone in the family wanted brenda and laurence to be guilty but they didnt really believe it of course brenda and laurence could really be guilty i thought or it could be laurence and not brenda that would be better but that was only what i wanted to be true it wasnt necessarily the truth still i wanted to talk to laurence brown so after breakfast i decided to visit him in the schoolroom as i went into brendas part of the house i noticed that none of the doors was locked and there was no one to see me as i went into aristide leonides bathroom in the bathroom i looked in the cupboard and found the bottles of insulin and syringes everything was clear well arranged and easy to get to it was impossible for the police to find out who put the eye drops in the insulin bottle anyone could have done it as i went through the house i didnt see anyone else though i heard edith de haviland talking on the telephone when i got to the schoolroom i stopped outside the door to listen i was behaving just like josephine i thought i was very surprised to hear laurence brown talking with amazing imagination and enthusiasm he was an excellent teacher and although i didnt hear josephine say much when eustace spoke he showed that he was both interested and intelligent after a while the lesson ended and eustace and josephine came out they looked surprised to see me but while eustace waited politely josephine went past me uninterested i told eustace i just wanted to see the schoolroom and he opened the door for me laurence brown looked up and then quickly left the room you frightened him said eustace do you like him i asked oh hes all right he knows a lot and hes a good teacher he makes you see things differently we talked for a while about history and poetry eustace though he seemed to be badtempered was an interesting person to talk to i soon realized that he was bad tempered because of his illness which had been frightening and difficult for him before his illness he had been enjoying his life and his time at school i wish i was well enough to go back to school he told me i was going to be in the football team i hate staying home and having lessons with josephine shes only twelve i said that josephine was quite an intelligent girl for her age i dont think so said her brother arrogantly shes pretending to be a detective at the moment sneaking around and writing things down in a little black book its just silly mother is quite right to send her to school wont you miss her i asked miss josephine of course not said eustace shes only a kid really all my family are impossible to live with mothers always making a big drama about nothing and fathers shut away with his books i remembered how sensitive and embarrassed about my family i had been when i was sixteen what about your grandfather i said do you miss him a curious expression showed on eustaces face all grandfather thought about was how to make money he said he was too old to enjoy his life properly it was time for him to die he eustace stopped as laurence brown came back into the schoolroom please be back here at eleven eustace said laurence weve wasted too much time in the last few days ok sir eustace went out leaving me alone with his teacher laurence brown was looking at me nervously how are the police getting on he asked his nose twitched reminding me of a mouse in a trap are they going to arrest anyone soon i dont know i replied laurence became even more nervous you dont know what its like he said quickly not knowing what the police really want they keep asking strange questions i let him keep talking what chief inspector taverner suggested about brenda leonides and me he continued its just not true the family has never liked me his hands began to shake they are rich and powerful and im only a teacher i didnt fight in the war i knew i couldnt kill anyone everyones always laughed at me i always do things wrong everyones against me whoever killed mr leonides arranged it so that i would be suspected what about brenda leonides i asked laurences face reddened and he suddenly behaved less like a mouse and more like a man brenda leonides is an angel he said firmly she is sweet and kind and would never poison anyone the police are ridiculous if they suspect her he went over to a bookcase and began sorting the books i didnt think he was going to say any more so i left him alone as i was walking along the corridor a door on my left opened and josephine suddenly appeared in front of me her face and hands were very dirty and there was a spiders web in her hair where have you been josephine through the halfopen door i could see steps leading up to a small attic josephine replied briefly up in the attic detecting what is there to detect up in the attic i asked curiously i must wash was all josephine said before going towards the bathroom at the door she turned back to me and said i think its time for the next murder dont you what do you mean the next murder i asked with surprise well in books theres always a second murder about now someone who knows something is killed before they can tell anyone you read too many detective stories josephine i said real life isnt like that the only answer i got was the sound of water from a tap so i left josephine to wash as i went back to the other part of the house brenda came out through the drawing room door and put her hand on my arm well she asked looking up at my face i shook my head i dont have any news im so frightened she said charles im so frightened her fear was very real i could feel it she was so alone i wanted to help her to make her feel safe but there was nothing i could do or say i suddenly felt that sophia was watching me and remembered her saying yes brenda does seem to get on well with men the inquest is tomorrow brenda said and im sure therell be newspaper reporters there just dont talk to them i said perhaps you should get a lawyer brenda to look after your interests and advise you what to say and do you see i added youre very much alone her hand held my arm more closely yes she said you do understand charles and you have helped i went downstairs feeling warm and satisfied then i saw sophia standing by the front door youve been a long time she said coldly your father telephoned he wants you to go back to london did he say why sophia shook her head her eyes were anxious dont worry darling i said putting my arm around her ill soon be back chapter seventeen when i arrived at his office at scotland yard i found my father talking to chief inspector taverner and mr gaitskill the lawyer who seemed a little upset oh hello charles said my father as i came in something rather surprising has happened surprising exclaimed mr gaitskill this morning continued my father mr gaitskill received a letter from someone called mr agrodopolous who is an old friend of aristide leonides in with the letter was aristide leonides will mr leonides had asked mr agrodopolous to send the will to mr gaitskill after his death i have been mr leonides lawyer for over forty years said mr gaitskill why didnt he trust me he was obviously upset when mr gaitskill opened the will my father added he decided that we should see it at once it is not the same will that i prepared said mr gaitskill mr leonides wrote it himself a very unprofessional thing to do this was all very interesting but i didnt understand why i was involved is the will different i asked i mean is the money left to someone else my father was looking at me chief inspector taverner was very carefully not looking at me i felt slightly uneasy i looked at mr gaitskill am i right he said in saying that you are going to marry miss sophia leonides i hope to marry her i said but she doesnt want to become engaged at the moment in this will said mr gaitskill aristide leonides leaves his wife one hundred thousand pounds and everything else to his granddaughter sophia leonides i gasped i hadnt expected this but why did he leave everything to sophia i asked mr leonides explained his reasons in this letter which was with the will said my father handing me the letter to read dear gaitskill i am sorry that i have behaved so secretly let me explain why i have always believed that in a family there is one strong character who looks after everyone else in my family i was that person and i have been lucky enough to live a long time and take care of my children and grandchildren but when i die someone else must take care of the family after much thought i have decided that neither of my sons is the right person to do this my dearly loved son roger has no business sense and has poor judgement my son philip is too unsure of himself and is hiding from life eustace my grandson is very young and i do not think that he has enough sense and selfcontrol only my granddaughter sophia has intelligence good judgement and courage and is fair and generous i believe she is the best person to take care of the family including my sisterinlaw edith de haviland to whom i am very grateful for her lifelong care of my children and grandchildren now i must explain why i kept my decision secret from you i thought it best not to tell the family i was leaving everything to sophia i asked you to prepare a will which i read out to all my family i put both the wills on my desk and covered them with a piece of paper when the servants came in i moved up the piece of paper and we all signed the will that i wrote myself not the will that you prepared please forgive me for not telling you about this i am an old man and wanted to keep it secret thank you my dear friend for all the care you have taken while dealing with my affairs give sophia my love and ask her to take care of my family yours very sincerely aristide leonides extraordinary i said after reading the letter most extraordinary said mr gaitskill i repeat i do think my old friend mr leonides could have trusted me he stood up and left the room his professional pride obviously hurt now its been explained it seems obvious said taverner aristide leonides was the only person who could have played tricks with that will we were stupid not to think of it i remembered josephine saying how stupid the police were but she hadnt been there when the will was made and i didnt think she could guess what her grandfather had done so why did she say the police were stupid was she just showing off suddenly i realized how quiet the room was i looked up to see that both my father and taverner were watching me sophia knew nothing about this i said nothing at all shell be amazed will she asked my father there was a pause which was ended by the sudden loud ring of the telephone on the desk my father answered its your young woman he told me she wants to speak to you its urgent i took the receiver from him sophia i said whats the matter charles is that you said sophia sounding very upset its josephine shes been hit on the head and has concussion she the doctor says she may not recover josephines been knocked out i told my father and taverner my father frowned i told you to look after that child he said sharply chapter eight taverner and i were immediately driven to swinly dean in a fast police car on the way i remembered how josephine had talked about a second murder the poor child hadnt known that she was to be the second victim josephine must know something about the murder that we didnt i remembered the snap of the twig in the garden i should have taken better care of josephine had magda realized that her daughter was in danger was that why she suddenly wanted josephine to go away to school in switzerland as we arrived sophia came out to meet us josephine she said was in the local hospital and dr gray would telephone as soon as there was any news how did it happen asked taverner sophia led us round to the back of the house and through a door to a small yard in one corner was an old washhouse josephine likes to play here she explained the washhouse was small and dark inside and full of wooden boxes and old broken furniture just inside the door was a stone doorstop its the doorstop from the front door sophia explained it must have been balanced on top of the door a booby trap said taverner reaching up a hand to touch the top of the low door then he looked at the doorstop has anyone touched this no said sophia i told everyone not to youre quite right who found her i did she didnt come in for dinner at one oclock nannie said she had seen josephine go outside about quarter of an hour before i said i would go and get her replied sophia who knew that josephine liked to play here asked taverner everyone in the house knew sophia said no one really conies out here except her and you cant see this little yard from the house said taverner thoughtfully anyone could have set that booby trap he looked up at the door she was unlucky he said it could easily have missed her next taverner looked at the floor there were various deep marks in it it looks as if someone tried the doorstop out first to see just where it would fall we didnt hear anything said sophia we had no idea until i found her lying face down her voice shook there was blood on her hair is that josephines taverner pointed to a wool scarf lying on the floor yes using the scarf taverner carefully picked up the stone doorstop there may be fingerprints he explained though he spoke without much hope what are you looking at charles i was examining an old wooden chair with a broken back which was with the other old furniture on the seat of the chair were a few small pieces of mud interesting said taverner someone stood on that chair with muddy feet now why was that i had no suggestions taverner shook his head what time did you find josephine miss leonides about five minutes past one and nannie saw her going out about twenty minutes earlier has anyone else been out here today ive no idea said sophia but josephine herself was here after breakfast this morning so someone set the trap between then and a quarter to one did you notice that the doorstop was missing sophia shook her head its been too cold to have the door open today she explained and do you know where everyone was this morning i went out for a walk replied sophia eustace and josephine had lessons until halfpast twelve with a break at halfpast ten i think father has been in the library all morning and mother was just getting up when i came in at about a quarter past twelve she doesnt get up very early we went back into the house and i followed sophia to the library philip and magda were sitting close together philips face was white and magda was crying have they telephoned from the hospital yet sophia asked philip shook his head why wouldnt they let me go with her cried magda my baby my funny ugly baby she hated it when i called her that shell die i know shell die hush my dear said philip hush i felt that i had no place in this sad family scene so instead i went to find nannie she was sitting in the kitchen crying quietly this is all because of me mr charles because of the awful things ive been thinking i didnt understand what she meant theres wickedness in this house nannie continued i didnt want to see it or believe it but somebody killed mr leonides and the same somebody has tried to kill josephine but why should anyone try to kill josephine i asked you know what shes like mr charles nannie said she always wants to know things and find out things you see she was always a very ordinary little girl not goodlooking like her brother and sister her mother sometimes ignored her and said she was ugly josephine hated that and it had a bad effect on her she started sneaking around and spying on people but that isnt safe when theres a poisoner about i murmured in agreement and then i remembered something do you know where josephine kept her little black book where she wrote things down i asked nannie ive no idea mr charles it wasnt with her when she was found had someone taken josephines notebook or had she hidden it in her own room i thought i would go and look i went upstairs and stopped i didnt know where josephines room was but then i heard taverner calling me come in here he said im in the girls room its a real mess the small room was indeed a mess drawers had been pulled out and their contents thrown on the floor everything had been pulled off the small bed the chairs had been turned upside down and the pictures taken down from the wall someone had been looking for something did anyone hear or see anything i asked it seems not said taverner ive checked and anyone in the house could have done this and set the booby trap it could have been philip magda nannie or your girl sophia brenda was alone all morning laurence brown and eustace had a halfhour break from lessons and miss de haviland was in the garden alone roger was in his study and even clemency didnt go to work today ive no idea who it was or what they were looking for i suddenly remembered where i had seen josephine last wait i said and ran out of the room and up the stairs to the attic where josephine had been detecting it was dark and the ceilings were low but it was a good place to hide things i thought as i started to search properly indeed it didnt take me long to find a packet of letters wrapped in brown paper i read the first letter oh laurence my darling my dear love im sure everything will be all right aristide has been so good to me i dont want him to suffer but there cant be any pleasure in living when youre over eighty soon we shall be together for always how wonderful it will be when i can call you my dear dear husband i love you love you love you i grimly went downstairs and gave taverner the letters this might be what someone was looking for i told him taverner looked through the letters and read a few lines then he looked up at me with a satisfied expression on his face so it was them he said quietly brenda leonides and laurence brown it was them the whole time chapter nineteen from the moment i found the letters all the sympathy and pity i had felt for brenda leonides disappeared completely she had lied to me and had tried to kill josephine but i think it was laurence brown who set that booby trap said taverner that explains what puzzled me about it josephine had the letters but the murderer couldnt find them so he tried to kill her but why didnt he just hit josephine on the head himself putting a stone doorstop on top of a door is stupid it could have missed or not hurt josephine at all so why do it well i said whats the answer at first i thought it was to fit in with someones alibi but no one has an alibi but if it was laurence brown it all makes sense he doesnt like violence and he couldnt hit josephine himself with the booby trap he didnt have to see it happen yes i see i said slowly its just like putting the eserine in the insulin bottle exactly do you think brenda knew i asked i dont think she helped set the booby trap said taverner but i think the eserine was her idea even if she made laurence brown do it himself and with these letters theres a clear case against both of them he looked at me so how does it feel to be marrying a very rich girl he asked id forgotten about the will sophia doesnt know yet i said do you want me to tell her mr gaitskill is going to tell everyone tomorrow after the inquest said taverner i wonder what the family will say chapter twenty nothing unusual happened at the inquest because the police had said that they needed more time to collect the evidence we were all feeling more cheerful however because wed heard from the hospital that josephine was not as badly hurt as we thought and she was getting better quickly she wasnt allowed any visitors at the moment not even her mother particularly not her mother murmured sophia i made that quite clear to dr gray mother would only make a big dramatic scene which isnt good for someone whos been hit on the head you think of everything dont you darling i said aristide leonides had been right to choose sophia i thought she was already taking care of the family after the inquest mr gaitskill came back to three gables and made his important announcement he read aristide leonides letter and then the will itself it was very interesting to watch i was just sorry i couldnt watch everyone at the same time philips mouth was shut tightly and he didnt speak magda however spoke as soon as mr gaitskill finished darling sophia she said how extraordinary how romantic but poor darling roger now he doesnt have the money to save the company sophia you must help roger no said clemency we dont want anything roger stepped forward clumsily we dont want any money he said holding sophias hands clemency and i are going to barbados to live a quiet life he smiled but if i ever need anything ill ask the head of the family but roger you cant just go bankrupt and leave the country said edith de haviland it makes the family and sophia look bad as if we didnt try to help you roger put his arms round his aunt and hugged her aunt edith he said you are a darling but you dont understand what clemency and i want none of you added clemency annoyed understands roger you never have and you never will come on roger they left the room as mr gaitskill pretended to sort his papers it was clear that he deeply disliked such family dramas when i looked at sophia herself she was standing up straight and her eyes were calm she had just inherited an enormous fortune but my first thought was that now she was alone separate from the rest of her family her grandfather had believed that she was strong enough to be responsible for everyone else but just then i felt very sorry for her congratulations sophia said mr gaitskill you are a very rich woman if you wish to discuss anything else ill be very happy to advise you what about roger insisted edith de haviland roger said mr gaitskill quickly must look after himself hes a grown man and hell never be a successful businessman he looked at sophia if you save associated foods from bankruptcy roger is the wrong man to manage it im not going to save associated foods from bankruptcy said sophia clearly it would be a stupid thing to do mr gaitskill looked at her and smiled to himself then he said goodbye and left the family alone together everyone was silent for a moment before philip stood up i must get back to the library he said i have wasted a lot of time father sophia spoke uncertainly she stepped back as philip looked at her coldly i wont congratulate you he said i am too shocked and humiliated that my father has ignored my lifelong devotion to him yes devotion for the first time his emotions broke through how could he do this to me he exclaimed he was always unfair to me always oh philip cried edith de haviland please dont think that he never cared for me said philip in a rough low voice it was always roger at least father finally realized that roger was a fool and a failure his handsome face was full of jealousy he didnt leave roger anything either what about me said eustace i saw that eustace was shaking with violent emotion his face was bright red and there were tears in his eyes how could grandfather do this to me he said his voice high and angry i hate him ill never forgive him as long as i live i wanted him to die i wanted to get out of this house now sophia is in charge and i wish i was dead he rushed out of the room he has no selfcontrol said edith de haviland quietly i know just how eustace feels said magda the poor darling i must go after him now magda edith hurried after her sophia stayed behind looking at her father but philip again looked at her coldly quite in control of himself once more youve managed things very cleverly sophia he said and went out of the room that was a cruel thing to say i said to sophia holding her in my arms your grandfather shouldnt have done this to you he thought i could bear it said sophia and i can but i dont like father and eustace being so upset your mothers all right but she wont like asking me for money for her new play said sophia what will you say if she does i asked curiously sophia stood up very straight ill say no she said its a bad play and it will be a failure its a waste of money i laughed thats why your grandfather left everything to you i said youre just like him chapter twenty one i was sorry that josephine had missed all the drama she would have enjoyed it she was getting better very quickly and would soon be home but before she came back one more important event took place i was in the garden one morning with brenda who said that she needed some exercise and sophia after a while brenda said abruptly youre giving laurence the sack sophia why were making other arrangements for eustace sophia said quietly and josephine is going to switzerland well youve upset laurence very much he feels you dont trust him sophia didnt answer and at that moment a car arrived in front of the house and chief inspector taverner stepped out he went into the house why have the police come back said brenda nervously what do they want now i thought i knew why they had come because of the letters taverner came out of the house again and walked over to us he spoke to brenda in his official voice brenda leonides i am arresting you on suspicion of murdering aristide leonides with eserine on september th brenda completely lost control of herself she held on to me and screamed no no it isnt true charles tell them i didnt do it i dont know anything about it dont let them take me away it isnt true i havent done anything it was a horrible scene all i could do was try and calm her down i told her that i would arrange for a lawyer for her that a lawyer would help her with everything come along mrs leonides said taverner we have to go now laurence she said staring at taverner what have you done to laurence mr laurence brown is also under arrest said taverner at this news brenda fell to the ground the tears fell down her face as taverner quietly helped her towards the car laurence brown came out of the house with a police officer and they all got into the car and drove away sophia was pale and upset its horrible charles she said you must get her a really good lawyer she sighed deeply but why have they been arrested now i explained that the police had found love letters from brenda and laurence it is horrible sophia i added but isnt it what we wanted you said yourself it would be all right if the right person had killed your grandfather brenda was the right person wasnt she brenda or laurence dont say that charles you make me feel awful but its true isnt it now things can go back to normal and we can get married your family are cleared of suspicion of course none of you really had a motive sophias face suddenly went white except me charles she said i had a motive i knew about the will what i stared at her i suddenly felt cold i knew that grandfather had left his money to me he told me he said i must look after the family when he was gone why didnt you tell me when there was such confusion with the will i thought perhaps hed made a mistake or changed his mind i didnt want him to leave everything to me i was afraid afraid i said why because because of the murder so sophia had been afraid that she would be suspected of murder i understood now why she had refused to be engaged to me and why she desperately wanted to know the truth as we walked back towards the house i suddenly remembered something sophia had said that she supposed she could murder someone but only for something really important chapter twenty two before we reached the house we met roger and clemency hello you two said roger i see the police have arrested that horrible woman and her boyfriend at last i hope theyre both hanged clemency frowned dont be so cruel roger she said cruel said roger rubbish they poisoned a helpless old man i loved my father dont you understand i loved him i know roger i know said clemency we went towards the house roger and sophia walked ahead and i walked behind with clemency the police should let us leave now she told me do you want to go so soon i asked im desperate to go i looked at clemency in surprise dont you understand charles she continued im fighting for my happiness and rogers i dont want roger to stay here in england i want him to come away with me i want him all to myself right away from his family i hadnt realized how desperately clemency loved roger i remembered what edith de haviland had said that she loved her family but not too much had edith been thinking of clemency a car drove up to the front door and josephine and magda got out apart from the bandage round her head josephine looked very well i want to look at the fish in the lake she said darling said magda come in and lie down for a while first ill get you some soup i dont want to lie down said josephine and i hate soup im quite all right magda looked doubtful i knew that josephine had been kept safely in hospital until brenda and laurence had been arrested ill look after her i said to magda as josephine went to see the fish when we got there i asked josephine if she wanted to hear about what had happened do you know that your grandfather left all his money to sophia mother told me josephine said sounding bored anyway i knew already i heard grandfather tell sophia were you listening at the door again yes i like listening said josephine i heard what grandfather said about me nannie doesnt like it when i listen i changed the subject to something i thought would excite her chief inspector taverner has arrested brenda and laurence yes i know she said still bored how can you know its only just happened we passed their car on the road she said brenda and laurence were inside so of course i knew theyd been arrested im sorry i said but i had to tell the police about the letters i found them in the attic you could have told them yourself if you hadnt been knocked out josephine touched her head carefully i could have been killed she said sounding pleased i told you it was time for the second murder it was stupid to hide those letters in the attic i knew laurence had hidden something there when i saw him coming out of the attic but i thought i stopped as we heard edith de havilands voice calling josephine josephine come here at once josephine sighed its aunt edith so i have to go she ran across the garden and i followed more slowly when josephine had gone inside i was left alone with edith de haviland she looked very tired and old im glad its over she said to me do you think brenda and laurence will be found guilty i dont know i admitted i dont know how much evidence the police have there are love letters edith looked very grim im not happy about this charles i dont like brenda in fact i dislike her very much but i feel its my responsibility to make sure shes treated fairly and laurence laurence is a man she said he must look after himself but aristide would never forgive me if she didnt finish instead she suggested that we should go in for lunch and i explained that i was driving back to london will you take me with you she asked and not tell anyone i was surprised but i did as she asked we didnt speak much on the journey when i asked her where i should stop she said harley street harley street was where all the best london doctors worked i felt uneasy i hope i began and stopped thats why i didnt want to tell anyone edith said theyll just make a fuss im very sorry i said dont worry she said ive had a very good life she smiled and its not finished yet chapter twenty three after a quick visit to my father who was busy i went out for a drink with chief inspector taverner well he said the case is over at last but he didnt sound very happy about it do you think brenda and laurence will be found guilty i asked him its impossible to say he replied theres no proof and no definite or direct evidence against them its the same in a lot of murder cases what about the letters the letters say things like it wont be long now but they never mention poison they could argue that all they meant was that aristide leonides was so old he was sure to die soon and what do you think are they guilty i asked he looked at me with no expression on his face i dont think anything charles ive done my duty and its been decided to send them to trial thats how i knew that taverner wasnt satisfied a few days later i talked to my father about the case like taverner he said that there was enough evidence against brenda and laurence to send them to trial thats not what im talking about i said with your experience do you think theyre guilty to be honest with you charles i just dont know they could be guilty but im just not sure and i wish i was we were silent for a while before my father said so tell me charles what do you think do you think that one of the leonides family is the real murderer yes i do i finally admitted because thats what they think themselves do they said my father thats very interesting only roger is sure its brenda i continued the others dont think so so who do you think it is my father asked quietly sophia no of course not no but youre not completely sure are you said my father even if you wont admit it what about the others i can think of reasons though not always good reasons why they all could have killed aristide leonides i said philip has always been very jealous of roger and he could have poisoned his father to make sure that rogers company went bankrupt i dont think magda is involved and although she suddenly wants josephine to go to school in switzerland i think its because shes afraid that josephine knows something and she would never hit josephine on the head why not charles said my father dont you read the news mothers often dislike one or more of their children who else is there what about roger im sure that roger didnt kill his father but his wife might have done it i told him about my conversation with clemency and edith i continued edith de haviland might have done it if she had a good reason but i dont know why would she hit the child on the head no i said slowly i dont believe she would which reminds me josephine said something that doesnt fit in but i cant quite remember what it was youll remember soon said my father anyone else well i said it could be eustace he didnt like his grandfather and he has been behaving very strangely and hes the only one who i think could knock out josephine if she knew something about him and she does seem to know everything she writes it down in a little book i stopped whats the matter asked my father ive just remembered what josephine said i exclaimed we thought that josephines room was searched because of the letters but josephine told me that it was laurence who hid the letters in the attic she saw him and found the letters but left them where they were well that means that it wasnt the letters that someone was looking for in josephines room it must have been something else her little black book where she writes everything down if josephine still has that book i stood up then she still isnt safe said my father is that what you were going to say yes i said she wont be out of danger until she leaves for switzerland i think youre right about the danger said my father you should go to three gables at once is it eustace i asked him desperately clemency i think the facts point clearly in one direction my father said gently im surprised you dont see it yourself i think at that moment a police officer knocked on the door i know you asked not to be disturbed sir but miss leonides is on the telephone she says its urgent i quickly picked up the telephone and heard sophias voice say desperately charles it isnt over the murderer is still here whats wrong sophia is it josephine its not josephine said sophia its nannie josephine didnt drink her cocoa and left it on a table nannie didnt want to waste it so she drank it poor nannie is she very ill oh charles said sophia shes dead chapter twenty four it was like a terrible dream taverner and i drove back quickly to swinly dean just as we had before on the journey i kept saying to myself that it hadnt been brenda and laurence they had fallen in love with each other and written romantic letters but they hadnt poisoned aristide leonides or nannie as we went through the front door i saw a big pile of luggage in the hall clemency came down the stairs youre just in time to say goodbye charles she said were leaving tonight but surely you cant go now i said with surprise nannie is dead nannies death has nothing to do with us said clemency roger and i were upstairs packing and we didnt come down at all when josephines cocoa was on the hall table can you prove that i said roger and i are going away said clemency angrily why would we want to poison nannie you might not have meant to poison nannie we wouldnt poison josephine either but josephine knows a lot about people i said she i stopped as josephine herself appeared eating an apple her eyes shone with excitement nannies been poisoned she said just like grandfather its very exciting isnt it arent you upset about it i demanded didnt you like nannie not really she was always telling me not to do things do you like anybody josephine asked clemency i love aunt edith josephine said i love her very much and i could love eustace if he let me but hes so horrible to me i wont tell him what ive found out that now i know there was a moments silence josephine stared at clemency i heard a noise from behind one of the doors but when i opened it there was no one there i felt uneasy as edith de haviland came down the stairs i took hold of josephines arm and led her firmly into an empty room i made her sit down in a chair while i sat opposite her now josephine i said were going to have a talk what exactly do you know do you know who poisoned your cocoa josephine nodded and you know who poisoned your grandfather josephine nodded again and who knocked you on the head again josephine nodded then youre going to tell me everything now and then well tell the police i wont said josephine i wont tell the police anything theyre stupid they thought brenda and laurence did it i didnt think so so i made a test and now i know im right she sounded very pleased with herself i tried hard to be patient i know youre very clever josephine she looked pleased but dont you realize that youre in danger of course i am said josephine in some books lots of people are killed this isnt a detective story this is real life you must tell me what you know you dont understand said josephine i might not want to tell i might be fond of the person she paused and if i do tell she continued ill do it properly with everybody sitting together ill talk about all the clues and then say suddenly it was you she pointed her finger just as edith de haviland entered the room josephine throw that apple away said edith and wash your hands im taking you out in the car she looked at me its safer out of the house well go and get an ice cream josephine looked pleased can i have two perhaps said edith now go and get your coat its cold outside today charles can you go with her i must quickly write a few letters she sat down at the desk and i went upstairs with josephine sophia came into the room looking pale and nervous as josephine was getting ready charles she said with surprise i didnt know you were here im going out with aunt edith said josephine importantly were going to have ice creams sophia frowned as we went back downstairs to find edith who was just putting her two letters into envelopes its quite a nice day said edith cold but clear she was silent for a moment looking down at the letters in her hand and then she turned and kissed sophia goodbye dear edith said dont worry too much some things just have to be accepted she and josephine got into the car and waved to us as they drove off i suppose its better to keep josephine away for a while i said but she must tell us what she knows she probably doesnt know anything sophia said shes just showing off and making herself look important i think its more than that i said do they know yet what poison was in the cocoa they think its aunt ediths heart medicine there was a bottle full of pills but now its empty isnt the medicine kept locked up yes replied sophia but the key is quite easy to find but who was it i said what do you think sophia i dont know she whispered its like a bad dream come outside with me charles its safer outside im afraid to stay in this house chapter twenty five we stayed outside in the garden for a long time we didnt talk about the murders instead sophia talked fondly about nannie the games they had played with her and the stories she had told them i think this made sophia feel better i wondered what taverner was doing more policemen had arrived and nannies body had been taken away at last it was almost dark we should go inside said sophia with a shiver aunt edith and josephine havent come back yet surely they should be back by now i felt uneasy what had happened to them we went inside and had tea with magda philip stayed in the library magda didnt speak much except to ask where are edith and josephine theyre out very late i felt even more uneasy so i went to speak to taverner the police will let us know if theres any news i told sophia who was alone in the room when i got back im worried charles she said something must have happened its not really late yet she kissed me goodbye said sophia with a strange expression on her face i didnt understand what she meant we sat there for a while pretending to read it was halfpast six when taverner opened the door and his serious face warned us that something was wrong im sorry he said i have bad news we found edith de havilands car at the bottom of the nearby stone quarry both people inside are dead killed immediately josephine magda was standing at the door her voice rose as she cried josephine my baby sophia put her arms round her mother wait a moment i said as i remembered something edith de haviland had not been carrying any letters when she got into the car i ran out to the hall and found the letters on the table halfhidden behind a vase the first letter was addressed to chief inspector taverner and i stood beside him as he read it when you read this letter i expect i will be dead i wish to accept full responsibility for the deaths of nannie and my brotherinlaw aristide leonides i swear that brenda leonides and laurence brown are innocent dr chavasse of harley street will confirm that i have only a few more months to live i prefer to end my life in this way and save two innocent people from being sent for trial for a murder they did not commit edith de haviland sophia too read the letter aunt edith she whispered but why josephine why did she take josephine with her then at last i saw everything clearly i realized that i was still holding ediths second letter in my hand it was addressed to me i tore the envelope open and josephines little black notebook fell out i opened it and saw the writing on the first page we were wrong charles werent we sophia whispered aunt edith didnt do it no i said she didnt it was josephine wasnt it it was josephine together we looked down at the first page in the little black notebook today i killed grandfather chapter twenty six afterwards i wondered how i could have been so blind the truth was so obvious josephine and only josephine was vain and selfimportant she had loved to talk about the murder and about how clever she was and how stupid the police were because she was a child i had never thought that josephine could be the murderer but both murders could easily have been committed by a child in fact her grandfather himself had told josephine exactly what to do and she read so many detective stories that she would know about fingerprints she had attacked herself not really realizing that she could have been killed there was a clue the mud on the seat of the old chair josephine was the only person who would need to climb up on a chair to balance the heavy stone doorstop on the top of the door obviously it had missed her a few times the marks in the floor showed that but she had tried again using her scarf so she didnt leave any fingerprints finally the doorstop had hit her we had all thought that josephine was in danger just as she wanted she knew something she had been attacked i realized how she had carefully shown me on purpose where the attic was so i found the letters and she had made the mess in her room herself but when she came back from hospital josephine was unhappy the case was over brenda and laurence had been arrested and she herself wasnt getting much attention so she stole edith de havilands heart medicine poisoned her own cocoa and left the cup on the hall table did she know that nannie would drink it possibly did nannie with a lifetime of experience with children suspect josephine and edith had she suspected too or had she known i looked down at the letter in my hand dear charles this letter is just for you and for sophia if you want to show it to her i want someone to know the truth i found josephines little notebook hidden in the garden it confirms what i already suspected i dont know if what im doing is right or wrong but my life is nearly over and i dont want josephine to suffer for what she has done if i am wrong i hope i can be forgiven i did it out of love bless you both edith de haviland i gave the letter to sophia and when she had read it we opened josephines little black notebook today i killed grandfather as we turned the pages we saw josephines horribly childish motives for murder here are the important entries grandfather wouldnt let me do ballet dancing so i made up my mind i would kill him then we should go to london to live and mother wouldnt mind me doing ballet i dont want to go to switzerland i wont go if mother makes me i will kill her too if i can get some poison eustace made me very angry today he says i am only a girl and that my detecting is silly he wouldnt think i was silly if he knew it was me who did the murder i like charles but he is rather stupid i have not decided yet who i shall say has done the murder perhaps brenda and laurence brenda is horrible to me but i like laurence her last words were i hate nannie i hate her she says i am only a little girl she says i show off shes making mother send me away im going to kill her too i think aunt ediths medicine will do it if there is another murder then the police will come back and it will all be exciting again nannies dead im glad i havent decided yet where ill hide the bottle with the pills perhaps in aunt clemencys room or in eustaces room when i am dead i shall leave this notebook behind for the chief of police and they will see what a great criminal i was i closed the book sophia was crying oh charles its so awful shes such a monster but i also feel so much pity for her i felt the same i had liked josephine but she had been born with something wrong with her she was the crooked child of the little crooked house what would have happened to her sophia asked me if she had lived i dont know i said perhaps she would have been sent to a special school or a childs prison its better this way sophia said with a shiver but i dont like aunt edith taking the blame it was her decision i said i dont suppose anyone will find out brenda and laurence will be free to go and there wont be a trial and you sophia i added holding her hands will marry me well go away together and you wont have to think about your family for a while you can think about me instead arent you afraid to marry me charles said sophia looking straight into my eyes not at all i said why should i be poor little josephine inherited all the worst from your families but you sophia have inherited the best your grandfather thought so and he my darling was always right i love you charles said sophia and i will marry you she looked down at the notebook poor josephine poor josephine i said what really happened charles my father asked me i never lie to my father it wasnt edith de haviland i told him it was josephine my father nodded his head gently yes he said i thought it was poor child the end
