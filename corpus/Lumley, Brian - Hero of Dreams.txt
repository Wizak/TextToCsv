part first meeting chapter i it was evening and the uplands of dream were turning chilly spiked grasses nodded in a slight breeze like hissing gorgon heads where they made silhouettes atop rocky rises soon the sun would be down and the stars would come out to blaze in the heavens of earths dreamland david hero did not know these parts for his dreams had never before carried him here he knew only that he did not like this place where green plains gave way to scrub stony slopes and sliding shale and the crags cast gaunt shadows that would soon become threatening caves of blackness as night drew in he shivered a little and fondled the hilt of his curved sword where it hung at his hip then turned up the hood of his brown cape a littlebut not too much he did not want to shut out the evening sounds of these uplands for his ears were sensitive and would often tell him of a danger before the danger itself became visible the breeze stiffened to a wind and moaned with an eerie insistence as he leaned forward up the slope and high overhead a scud of gray clouds hurried into view as they crossed the peaks and headed south south brian lumley now why couldnt he have dreamed himself south to celephais perhaps where king kuranes reigned or skyfloating serannian where the west wind flows into the sky but no he was here wherever here was and so must accept whichever dreams were his due this night whichever dreams or nightmares david hero knew he was in the north of earths dreamland but no more than that these peaks above him could well be the ultimate range leading to leng itself whose plateau was home to some of dreamlands vilest inhabitants or they might merely be the foothills of that far mightier escarpment kadath in the cold waste thoughts such as these had almost determined the dreamer to turn back and head for healthier lands when on cresting a ridge he came upon a scene which had him drawing his sword in a whisper of steel and falling automatically into a defensive crouch below a lone wanderer sought cover in crevices of rock while ranged about him a trio of sixlegged spiderhounds hissed and snapped at his leatherclad legs trying to secure a hold on him and pull him down one of them awkwardly clutched a straight sword in a prehensile forepaw having doubtless snatched it from the frantically scrabbling hoarsely panting object of their detestable torture david hero knew some of the ways of spiderhounds from tales told to him by travelers and storytellers in dreamlands more civilized regions how they would wear a man down with their vile hissing and leaping then paralyze him with their poisonous stings and eat him alive often making their meal last through several nights such was obviously the intention of this monstrous trio and hero could well understand the neardemented scrabbling of their victim as he sought to find some crevice in which hero of dreams to wedge himself the better to make a stand against the horrors without a thought to his own safety the newcomer gritled his teeth and went slithering and leaping in the gloom down the shalecovered slope he waved his sword above his head as he ran at the hissing scampering creatures whistling and shouting like a madman still on the run he snatched up a large lump of lava in his free hand and hurled it at the insectlike hounds and had the satisfaction of seeing one of them leap high in the air with the shock of the impact as die missile struck home then he was upon them slicing with his sword and panting through clenched teeth and grimacing lips by good fortune his singing blade took the jointed hind legs right off one of themthe one that held aloft the beleaguered strangers swordand in another moment the man had leaped forward to snatch back his weapon from the crippled spiderhound striking together the two men put paid to that demented creature where it dragged its stinger uselessly behind it but now the other spiderhounds had realized that the balance of the game had evened up and that therefore a quick end must be made of it as at a single word of command they launched themselves at hero twisting their bodies in the air so that their stingers struck at his face he ducked impaled one of them on his sword felt the weight of the other on his back and a lancing agony as a single drop of mordant poison burned through his clothing to the skin then felt the horror kicked from him and heard its final hiss as the rescued man took both hands to his sword and hacked its cockroach head clean from its body quickly without a backward glance hero tugged his own weapon free of the scalearmored hound where it twitched and jerked among shale and lava fragments then split its chitinous skull with a single stroke the fight was brian lumley finished and only the moaning of the wind over the peaks remained that and the panting of the men and the nameless drip of the thin gray ichor which was the lifeblood of diese denizens of nightmare now hero turned to the other man peering at him where he stood cleaning his weapon on his black jacket the other looked back in turn and gratitude shone in his eyes but his breathing was ragged and he coughed painfully they took you by surprise hero ventured eh the other finally grunted yes they did damned horrors didnt see em till they were on me they dont hiss at all when theyre tracking youonly when they have you cornered i wouldnt know hero answered this is the first time ive come across themim happy to say he touched a severed head with his furbooted foot and turned it until starlight fell onto the faceted eyes then grimaced at the way the thing seemed to stare at him even in death then headless as it was one of the carcasses began to twitch and the hard carapace rattled on the rocks both men stepped back from the dead things and shiveredand not alone from the chill of the night air finally they turned more fully to one another and clasped hands in the manner of dreamland in the village where i sometimes lodge im known as eldin the darkjacketed man told hero since eldin is the old word for wanderer it suits me well enough of course ive another name in the waking world at least i think i have and how are you called my names hero david hero i havent earned myself a dreamname yet though im pretty welltraveled in the better known places no dreamname eh david eldin grinned and nodded as if he knew something special just a fellow trav hero of dreams eler from the waking world eh well there seem to be damn few of us about these days and what brings you here i could ask the same of you hero answered casting nervously about and i would if i didnt think this a funny sort of spot to be spending our time in idle chatter is there no place we can make ourselves at ease for the night i was making for a cave back there in the shadows when these damned things set on me eldin said ive a flint in my pocket and the makings in my pack and we should be able to pick up a few dry sticks for a fire what would you say to a cup of tea hero caught a flash of grinning teeth in the darkness id say that was a very kind offer he answered lead on eldin and well pick up some sticks as we go now then said eldin when they sat on flat stones in a dry and sheltered cave and sipped their tea out of tiny silver cups you were going to tell me what youre doing here on these unbeaten paths so far away from dreamlands towns and cities hero shrugged i go where dreams take me this time they brought me here youre not an inveterate dreamer then well i am yes but my dreaming never seems to have much point to itif you know what i mean its like i said i go wherever my dreams take me i have no anchor here as you seem to have no village where i board no place to call home i never seem to be here long enough to build up any sort of permanency come to think of it i believe im pretty much the same in the waking world when im there i cant remember much of this place and when im here you cant remember much of the other place eh brian lumley only my name hero answered and thats about all i always make a point the other said of going down the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber ive found that if you do that it makes it easier to stay here for longer periods you dont wake up so easy those steps take you down to lower levels of dream if you see what i mean not for me hero shook his head ive heard of people using those steps who never returned to the waking world at all theyre used by people who have to escape into dreams and i dont have to i suppose im not much of a dreamer reallyand i dont think i really care to be have it your own way eldin growled anyway we still seem to be two of a sort the way i see it weve got too much going for us in the waking worldor too little and so we dream you say youve no anchor here ill bet theres precious little to anchor you to the waking world either and then again im older than you perhaps dreams are kinder to me than the waking world anyhow i like it here things seem easier somehow he coughed and held up a great hand to his mouth ill take my chances in dreams if they dont kill me this damned old troublesome body of mine surely will hero shrugged he looked at the other in the flickering firelight eldin was older than heros twentysix years by at least a dozen probably more with a scarred bearded quite unhandsome face which yet sported surprisingly clear blue eyes stocky and heavy yet somehow gangly there was something almost apish about him yet his every move and gesture hinted of exceptional intelligence and a rare strength but hero suspected that the mans strength was being sapped internally that the flame of death brightened steadily in his lungs threatening to blossom into a hero of dreams raging inferno perhaps that was why he was here this misfit from the waking world and what of you he finally asked seeking to confirm his reckoning what are you doing here eldin i mean specifically well here in the uplands eldin grinned and sipped his tea peering at his new friend and admiring his strong arms clean features and straight slim figure me why i was looking for you for me hero was taken aback let me explain said eldin in bahama on the isle of oriab theres a wharfside tavern where sailors gather from all the seas of dreamland its a funny little place that tavern and until recently none too healthy for outsidersif you know what i mean theres been a big cleanup however and many of dreamlands peoples have taken to traveling about a lot more even dylathleen gets its quota of visitors these days and im told that people are settling there again but eldins words had set heros mind wandering he remembered stories hed heard of the bad days when the demongod cthulhus minions in dreamland had attempted a coup over all the lands of dream and only the intervention of two men from the waking world had stopped them he remembered the names of those men titus crow and henrilaurent de marigny and felt a certain awe when he thought of the battles they had fought against all the forces of nightmare anyway eldins words brought him back to the present i was in bahama across the southern sea and it was therein this tavern ive mentionedthat my future was told by a certain seer of no mean skill mind you these old bellows of mine were playing me up and i was a little drunk at the time and so i cant swear to the surety of my memory but still ill tell you what i think the prophet told me jo brian lumley he cast his stones gazed at my palm with his strange invisible eyes and said invisible eyes hero felt obliged to cut him short what sort of eyes are those for goodness sake the firelight flashed on eldins grin and sent shadows slithering over the caves walls what kind why invisible of course the kind when you look into them and see nothing the spaces between the starsan empty voidyou know no hero shook his head you can see their edges eldin patiently explained their rims like craters on both sides of the nosebut inside them nothing ive met several such in dreamland hero slowly nodded and said you were saying eh oh yes well id had a few drinks i admit ityes and i fancy the old seer had tooand so he read my future in the stones and in the palm of my hand and he said eldin youll meet a man one evening in the northern uplands and hell save your life then hell join you on a queston several questswhich will take you to the farthest corners of dreamland quests i said what sort of quests but hed say no more fascinated hero asked nothing else that was all he told you im afraid so eldin nodded ruefully then he brightened and added oh yes he did say that if we lived through these quests how then that youd have earned yourself a dreamname thats how i know youre the one because i have no dreamname eldin nodded well then i reckon ill have to get along without one hero of dreams n you wont come with me eldin seemed disappointed hero by name the other reminded him but not necessarily by inclination and i dont much care for the way your seer foretold the future if we live through it you say theres one sure way to live through it my friend and thats not to go questing in the first place sorry eldin but you can count me out anyway it all seems rather vague to me were to go aquesting you say where to what for eldin shrugged i never did discover but what does it matter since youre not interested now hero frowned he turned his face away and gazed out of the caves mouth into the night lets sleep on it he said without looking at the other eldin grinned ill take first watch he said david hero chapter ii david hero awakened to sunlight that burned through his eyelids and warmed his face he briefly wondered how this could be for he remembered that the cave he shared with eldin faced south and away from the rising sun then shielding his eyes he opened them to squint up at latticed windows where they sloped down and formed the eastfacing roof through the small panes he could see the morning sun rising over arthurs seat arthurs seat eldinburgh of course it was eldinburgh no edinburgh without the now why on earth had he called the city eldinburgh and this was his studioflat in a converted attic in the dalkeith road in that split second of confused realization david hero was once again a man of the waking world all accumulated memories of that other worldlife shrank and receded into those halfsuspected regions of mind at which students of the human psyche have occasionally hinted and upon which they frequently conjecture earths dreamland in that moment ceased to exist for him or at least became a shadow in his subconscious except brian lumley eldin now what or who in hell was eldin and why had hero been so surprised upon awakening to find himself in edinburgh he sat up in bed yawned and shrugged the minds natural confusion in the transitory moments between dreaming and waking he supposed he had always had trouble waking up now what did he have planned for today a walk on the castles esplanade he always enjoyed that the view of the olden city from on high he loved the marvelous silhouettes which always seemed to remind him ofother places beyond memory and perhaps that was how he might explain the inspiration for his outrg art he got out of bed and crossed scrubbed floorboards to peer at yesterdays work there on an easel a newlydaubed canvas was given a certain perspective as the morning light just failed to strike it basalttowered and myriadwharved a gray and eerily fantastic city with leprous cobbled streets seemed to gloom back at him through the bleary smallpaned windows of its houses buckled pavements made darkshadowed humps in subsided roads and deserted wharves crumbled into a soulless sea there was no sign of life at all and the whole scene was distinctly gloomy and disquieting looking at the painting hero cocked his head on one side and frowned the thing looked too damned dismal something utterly hideous had happened to that city and he felt he should know what it was he was not at all sure now that this was the effect he had wanted there was nothing wrong with the painting itself indeed the work was good no the fault lay with the subject matter dylathleen he muttered to himself yesbut much too dreary a good name though and he picked up a pencil and quickly scrawled dylathleen in one corner of the canvas there now i wont forget it then he stepped back and yawned again scratching his hero of dreams tousled yellow hair the picture would be better he thought if done as a night scene with dimglowing lights behind certain of the windows friendly groups of small people in the streets and the occasional figure on a doorstep lanthorn held high it would lose none of its otherworldliness but it would certainly be made more welltrue to life after all dylathleen was like that now wasnt it he snorted derisively at his own fancies and turned to peer at a second older picture where it hung in a cheap frame this one was more lively its highlights accentuated by the glinting sun striking into the attic room trapped in golden beams motes of dust seemed to float like a thousand tiny drifting airships among faery towers domes and turrets and below overhanging a blue crystal sea the foundations of the city were set in an incredible promontory of green volcanic glass in one comer of the canvas hero had long since scrawled the legend ilekvad unwashed unshaven he frowned again turned and seated himself at a small desk his mind was usually strangely fertile during its first waking moments rapidly he sketched upon a scrap of paper heavy hills quickly formed a background to his sketch and in the foreground he grimaced at the hairy insectlike dogthing he had drawn then crumpled the scrap into a ball and tossed it in his wastebasket wherever the inspiration for that came from today he could well do without it no today was a day for walking in the cityor perhaps a trip out to the firth of forth bridge whose massive cantilever of almost four thousand feet never failed to fascinate himor better still a day on the coast at dunbar where the seagulls called and the boys collected and sold empty fistsized sea urchin shells washed in on the tide there was a place where he liked to sit on the rocks at the edge of the sea brian lumley and look down into deep pools where tiny fishes darted in deeps of waving weed no sooner had this thought occurred to him than another far stranger vision came in his minds eye he stared down from ilekvads cliffs of green glass into waters where the finny and bearded gnorri swam and with thenselfappointed and allconsuming industry pursued the construction of intricate and utterly mazy labyrinths this idea coming so suddenly startled david hero for this was surely inspiration he had been commissioned to prepare a dustjacket for an epic of submarine science fiction and the vision his mind had just conjured seemed nearperfect for his purpose a scene of gentle subaqueous beings going about their business among the caves of a fantastic seabedand in the foreground to one side of the main picture weirdlysuited and armed intruders about to burst rapaciously upon the scene excellent but it could wait until later in the day perhaps this evening right now hero must wash and tidy up make his breakfast and decide where the days wanderings were to take him over eggs and bacon washed down with black coffee he mentally reverted to his original choice edinburgh castle if ever a place were designed to create awe wonder and inspiration in the eye of the beholder surely this massive skyclimbing castle was that place yes he would go thereand tonight he would start his subsea painting to the polyglot tourists who thronged the royal mile as hero toiled up steeply slanting pavements past public houses and souvenir shops he would not be too impressive a figure in old jeans spotted with paint and faded by sun and sea and wearing his yellow hair long so that it lay on the shoulders of his dark opennecked shirt he might hero of dreams well be just another wastrel idling his time away in the hot summer days and indeed if such was the general suspicion then it were not too seriously misplaced he was academically qualified to be sure but his tutors each and every one had found occasion to remark that he was much too much of a dreamer or given to flights of fancy totally removed from his studies the one field in which he felt truly at homeand in which he somehow managed to make his way in lifewas painting and this was really as much as he wanted to do oh it would be nice to be rich certainly but not if that meant joining in the rat race since he was not without a degree of responsibility he could not be termed a dropout but at the same time his ambitions were very limited his trouble was that he was a man bom out of tune and perhaps out of place he could well picture himself as a swashbuckling privateer on the spanish main or an explorer of strange horizons on distant worldsbut never as an executive in some sprawling towerblock of offices on th century earth why the very world felt alien to him except in certain places edinburgh was one such place with its fresh sea breezes and highriding gulls its castle ancient monuments and general air of antiquityfor which reasons hero could bear living here and of course atmosphere was very important to his painting eventually he found himself on the esplanade at the top of the royal mile where he turned left out of the stream of tourists and went to lean on the old south wall beneath the wall the grass of the hillside fell swiftly away merging into a rocky precipice which plunged down to a ribbonlike road that wound round the castle rock and into the labyrinthine city high overhead the seagulls wheeled and cried in distant discord and hero found one with his binoculars following the great circle of its effortless glide as it rose in the cas brian lumley ties thermal for long moments the bird gained height then deliberately turned out of the rising current of air and fell in great swoops towards me earth down past the castle rock down to where the circular structure of granby halls stood in the castles shadow on a piece of waste ground beside the halls stood a billboard and there the gull came to rest keenly scanning accumulated garbage dumped amongst weeds and wild ivy hero following the gulls swoop briefly scanned the billboard through his binoculars before he found the bird where it perched above the large freshlypasted poster he found the bird then frowned and lowered his glasses until the wording once more sprang into sharp relief dreams and their meaning said the poster and beneath this heading it displayed a legend in letters which were far smaller and less legible at this distance hero adjusted the binoculars and tried again and after a moments jiggling he managed to get the lower part of the poster into perspective dreams and their meaning the extension of the human psyche into the subconscious realm of dreams your sleeping fantasies explained in laymans language by scotlands foremost expert on the hidden worlds of the mind there was more but the letters were much smaller and hero was at a loss to further enlarge them and still retain a degree of clarity again he read the posters more readily legible lettering and frowned lowering the binoculars to let them hang on his chest dreams and their meanings foremost expert an expert on dreams almost without knowing it simply letting his feet take him he left die esplanade turned right off the royal mile hero of dreams and wended his way down into the city in a little while he had found his way to the billboard and was able to read the rest of the posters legend tues wed thurs this week pm pm professor leonard dingle talks on the fascinating subject of mans secret desires the dreams which motivate his every waking moment there was a little more in much the same vein but hero read no farther professor leonard dingle there was something about that name something that rang bells of inquiry in the back of his memory a bright vision of a bearded burly face flashed in his minds eye then was gone did he know the man but how could he know him and yet it might be an interesting talk at that and the dustjacket painting could always wait until tomorrow after all what harm could there possibly be in attending a lecture the bells of inquiry in his mind turned to a distant barelyheard clangor of alarm but david hero wasnt listening second meeting chapter iii the hall was hardly filled to capacity anything but and hero suspected that things were not likely to improve since this was tuesday and the first night of the lecture it fully looked as though prof leonard dingle was in for a lean time of it in the height of the tourist season he must have been extremely fortunate to obtain the use of the hall in the first placeand surely this was the most dismal looking audience the hall was about onethird full of middleaged ladies who looked like rejects from the bingo halls with nothing better to do foreign tourists who fidgeted and chatted in diverse tongues obviously having paid their entrance fee in error and wondering what time the main feature began jeanclad leatherjacketed roughnecks who appeared to be lying low from someone or thing and in the rear row of seats courting couples who plainly were not interested in anything the speaker or anyone else had to say hero arriving tate took all of this in as he entered the darkened hall to discover the lecture already underway he found a seat three rows back from the front and having quietly made himself comfortable at last turned his atten brian lumley lion to the speaker scotlands foremost expert on the hidden worlds of the mind and here a paradox for at one and the same time dingle was and was not exactly the figure hero had expected that is to say while he was not the small fraillooking bespectacled and retiring chap his name and subject might suggest to the minds of most people he very definitely was the burly gangling figure hero had glimpsed in his minds eye while studying the poster there were differences however and hero found himself trying to pinpoint them as he studied the man where he stood behind a lectern beneath a spotlight talking into a microphone which amplified his voice only just sufficiently to make it audible at the back of the hall for one thing the speaker was clean shaven which was inconsistent with heros precognitive glimpse and for another he was far more articulate than hero had pictured him this of course was only to be expected in a man who delivered talks and lectures and yet somehow hero had not expected it the voice was deep and fairly impressive as he had somehow guessed it would be and marred by an irritating cough or the suspicion of one which also seemed to fit the artists preconception and yet for all dingles aggressiveseeming stance and gangling appearance still he seemed much too much the scholar and gentleman to truly represent heros previous knowledgeof him again the artist found himself wondering did he know the man and if so where had he met him before but at last the professors message was getting through to hero and despite his consuming curiosity about the man himself he became gradually drawn in by the speakers subject and gripped by his words for certainly dingle knew his stuff hero of dreams most people at some time or other have been puzzled by dreams the professor was saying dreams are often thought of as mere curiosities occasionally prophecies omens and sometimes parapsychological experiences periodicals may today be purchased which purport to translate dreams into forms which have commonplace or at least everyday meanings and applications but what do dreams really mean what are they all about was sigmund freud right can dreams be explained away simply by calling them primary processes of the mind are they indeed the royal road to the unconscious mind disguised expressions of otherwise suppressed urges modern thinking with some aid from hardware science as opposed to the science of psychology would seem to show that freuds conclusions are not altogether complete a recent theory has it that our minds are computers which require regular clearing that is removal of superfluous programming dreams perform the clearing getting rid of accumulated and unwanted experiences the mental garbage of conscious existence pretty clever but is that it is that all is that really all there is to it i for one dont think so there areanomalies big ones for instance how may we explain kekuls dream of the benzene ring wherein a complicated molecular structure which had baffled many scientists was suddenly made clear to the dreamer astonishing or could it be that dreams serve the purpose of solving problems which are too difficult for a merely conscious cluttered mind to comprehend hp lovecraft a writer of horror stories who was anything but prolific actually dreamed entire storiesalmost as if his dreaming mind were trying to solve his waking problems of these dream brian lumley tales several were published and are fairly good examples of their genre and so in lovecrafts case we see that something solid actually came out of the allegedly insubstantial world of his dreams i ask myself could that world really be so insubstantial and if dreams are so ethereal what of gerhard schrachs statement on the insubstantiality of socalled solids his own dreams you may remember were so real that he was ever at a loss to know which world was the more vital the waking world or the world of dreams once in vienna i was fortunate enough to meet and talk at some length with schrach about some of his experiences in those subconscious realms of his mind which he termed the dreamlands for it seemed to schrach that those brief periods of our steeping lives which the great majority of people term dreams were not dreams at all as he understood the term but merely reflections of the waking world impinging on the surface of the subconscious mind during its shallower sleeptimes to discover the real dreamlands schrach said one must go much deeper for gerhard schrachs dreaming took the form of a separate and solid existence which he believed lies at the roots of mans subconscious not merely his own subconscious you understand but mans he believed that if only we knew how then all of us might explore those selfsame worlds of wonder but even so it would be an exceptionally rare dreamer indeed who could bring back even a fragmentary recollection to the waking world as i have said he was just such a man and i was so impressed with the depth and detail of what he told me he had dreamed that i found myself actually carried along by his recounting of his adventures in those dreamlands by tales and descriptions of dreamlands customs peoples rivers and hills and cities hero of dreams yes it actually seemed to me as i listened to schrach that i too had known such rivers as the skai and the tross such cities as ulthar celephais and ilekvad ulthar celephais and ilekvad hero jerked upright in his seat and his hair felt full of some weird energy an electrical pricking which crawled across his scalp and down his neck to solicit a response from his suddenly charged skin covering him in shuddery goosepimples ulthar celephais and ilekvad what in the name of everything holy this man on the stage in the haze of his spotlightthis familiar stranger hero could not possibly but did somehow recognizewas talking of the subconscious world of another mans dreaming imagination and yet david hero too had somewhere known those fabled names and places before why when his own imagination was working at its strongest he even painted them hero heard no more but stumbled to his feet he was utterly shaken numb as he made his way to the foyer and from there to the wings of die stage where he waited in a sort of euphoric stupor for dingle to finish his monologue he heard little of what remained of the professors talk however for his head was humming with winds of mystery his minds eye full of halfseen visions that could not quite be brought into perspective he stood he knew on the tiireshold of something quite momentous something unique and always he kept asking himself how could this be had he heard aright did he and gerhard schrachyes and perhaps leonard dingle tooshare in part a mutual dreamworld which upon awakening rney left behind except for the occasional tantalizing glimpse or vision or had schrach perhaps written of the lands of his dreaming and then without knowing it had hero somewhere long ago read his work and remembered it so mat the names of brian lumley certain dreamplaces and something of their descriptions had stuck in his head there was that possibility of course but hero did not believe that was the answer for even now as he impatiently waited for the professor to finish misted visions of incredible lands beyond the boundaries of the conscious world kept flashing across his mind halfglimpsed and transient and yet real he knew at last it was over and the lights went up on a hall containing less than half of its original number the roughnecks had departed to face whichever fate pursued or waited for them the foreign tourists had long since discovered their error and taken their leave of the place and at last the small core of the audience got wearily to its feet and made to pass out into the city where by now the twilight of evening would be silently settling hero met dingle in the wings with sir my name is david hero and hero dyou say dingle rumbled tucking his crammed briefcase under one great arm he looked at hero closely and his forehead wrinkled in a frown weve met somewhere before eh heros heart gave a mighty lurch i i dont think so he answered then quickly added yes i dobut i dont know where i was hoping you and he paused not quite knowing how to explain his presence here in the wings hero eh hmm the professor rumbled the name rings a bell youre from the south yes the northeast coast of england yes hero nodded im from the midlands myself seems unlikely wed ever come together what brings you to edinburgh i live herenow hero explained im an artist when im anything at all as to why im here the city has hero of dreams an atmosphere like no other its like a steppingoff place to he shrugged i know what you mean dingle rumbled and coughed a little as a shadow of pain crossed his face youll excuse my cough he hastily said thats my main reason for being here ive lived here for some time but i go even further up north whenever i can its good clean air up there scotland the last bastion of civilized airbreathing man at least in this world in this world once again hero felt the weird tingling of his scalp what other world is there ah dingle smiled well now thats a secret between me and myself he picked up a poster or two threw a coat over his arm and prepared to leave the halls were you part of the er audience mr hero he grinned ruefully for a while the other nodded then unable to hold himself back any longer he blurted is that what you meant by another world the world of ilekvad and dylathleen dylath the other gasped dropping his briefcase so that it burst open and scattered its contents on the floor i made no mention of but you know it dont you youve heard of it before dumbly the professor nodded then grasped hero by the shoulders in a halfwhisper he said and oriab in the southern sea with its coastal capital city bahama and hathegkla in the stony desert which atal the ancient climbed in his youth from which only he returned while barzai the unwise remained behind after a long moment the professor said they come and go these visions and when theyre gone i hunger af brian lumley ter them his grip tightened on heros shoulders you wouldnt be having a little practical joke at my expense hero shook his head no here in edinburgh this is where its strongest for me it was the same in durham city and whitby on the coast but not so strong listen ive got paintings at home of uekvad and dylathleen yes and others its so hard to believe dingle began then he fixed hero with suddenly sharp eyes and said what do you know of of ulthar and hero knew that this was the final test suddenly from nowhere the answer came a memory from limitless depths of dream it lies beyond the skai in ulthar no man may kill a cat dingles hands fell from heros shoulders and he slumped wearily against a wall not even gerhard schrach remembered that he finally said you have pictures you say where do you live not far in the dalkeith road im in musselburgh may i offer you a lift home perhaps i could see your paintings in dingles tiny fiat whose pistons clattered as the professor raced it through the streets its headlights probing the cobbled ways ahead the two sat hunched in mutual astonishment neither one quite believed the evidence of his own senses and occasionally as ideas came they would put each other to the test they say that thalarion is demoncursed hero began where the eidolon lathi rules a monstrous hive of horror dingle finished it for him without quite realizing where such esoteric knowledge came from and what lies beyond the basalt pillars of the west i wonder hero of dreams splendid cathuria some say but what of zoogs and ghastst and gaunts and spiderhounds with a mutual gasp they turned to one another and all the superficiality of the waking world melted away in an instant of time eldin hero croaked eldin the wandererprof l dingle hero cried the other david hero no less who saved my life in the northern uplands at that very moment the professors tiny car shot through a light which was red the blaring of a massive horn the screech and hiss of powerful airbrakes and the vastly glaring lights of an articulated juggernaut seemed suddenly to fill the whole world there followed rushing headlong motion tearing pain and a hungry black vortex that sucked both men down down down to worlds of wonder as old as the dreaming mind of mankind part ebraim borak chapter i two big men they were that walked their greak yaks out of the river mists that night wandering dreamers long departed the teeming cities of the waking world to seek their fortunes in dreamlands coastal towns and villages but despite the fact that these were men of the waking world their bigness lay not alone in powerful muscles and towering frames of flesh no for in the years of their companionship they had also acquired a certain stature in the art of thievery as to the passage of time since that early morning when against his will and better judgment david hero had descended the seven hundred steps to pass through the gate of deeper slumberand later to find eldin where he lodged for a day or two at a village inna great many mornings had seemed to pass and time had become a confusion which is usually the way of it with dreams for as any dreamer can testify dreamtime passes very strangelywhere entire adventures may take place in a single hour and an hour itself lengthen to a weekso that a year in dreamland might easily pass between the closing brian lumley of ones eyes and their opening to a single mornings sun in the waking world but even so eldm and hero had seemed to wander an inordinately long time and surely one or the other or both ought by now to have returned through the thin veil of sleep to the world of their conscious beings they had not done so however and since neither one of them could remember the circumstances which had occasioned their meeting in the waking worldor the terrible accident which returned them once again to the dreamland where now they had come togetherthey had long since given up trying to fathom the riddle of it they were now to all intents and purposes inhabitants of dream though to dreamlands genuine citizens they would always be men of the waking world and of course they were the two dreamers who came down into theelys david hero and eldin the wanderer grown closer now than brothers and questing afterwhat but questing anyway the ferryman who brought them across the mouth of the tross had known something of them but had said nothing and for all that they towered over him still they had paid for his services and made no trouble for him others in dreamland had not been so lucky where these two were concerned the ferryman knew but he also knew that their reputation was not a bad one they were thieves and known for their brawling true but they stole only from those whose fortunes were great and they brawled with those of their own kind in which fighting seemed instinct outlaws they might bebut not yet outcasts in the passing years eldin had grown somewhat quick to anger but his loyalty to his companion remained unswervable scarfaced blackbrowed and gangling like hero of dreams an ape now he sucked in the river mists and gritted his teeth straining to control the red coughing that threatened constantly to explode deep in his lungs a condition that worsened as the seasons waxed and waned hero on the other hand had seemed to profit from his long immersion in dream tall rangily muscled and blond as his waking selfblue of eye and fleet of foot bursting with easy laughter and in a tight corner wizardmaster of a flickering snakes tongue in the shape of a curved blade of jungled kledhe loved songs a good fight and sometimes girls he was younger by a good fifteen years than his companion and clad in brown as compared with the others night black but the lands of dream have often known stranger comrades at least the two were of the same basic mind and shared the same wild wanderlust now that wanderlust had brought them south and east and having crossed the river tross by ferry at last they were come down into theelys of money they had very littlesufficient only for a day or twos bed and board and perhaps a little extra for a wineskin or so if they carefully avoided the gaminghousesso that they were sharpeyed and eager for easy pickings thus in the street of rats at that hour when torches are lit against the dark mists of the tross they stabled their yaks and put up at the tavern of hymat zorathin there they tossed their few belongings into a tiny room with a pair of even tinier bunks before elbowing their way into the aleroom and securing a corner table with their backs safely to the baked brick wall and a wineskin between themin the warm noisy smoky atmosphere of the lowceilinged tavernthey felt at ease and began to cast about with practiced eyes to see what they might see and they were not the only ones in hymat zorathins house with hard bright eyes that night no indeed for in brian lumley the shadows across the room where the red and yellow flickering of the torches barely reached a hooded figure stood silently apart from the taverns boozier customers and regarded the newcomers thoughtfully through orbs that were sly beneath highpointed brows this was ebraim borak outcast of the ossaran steppes many hundreds of miles to the east a man who employed his keen wits and skeptics knowledge of human nature to live a life of comparative luxury in the waking world he had been an arms manufacturer asleep and dreaming when a barrel of his own explosive had stranded him forever in the dreamlands his house was in a lordly quarter of the city wherein he kept a handful of beautiful black slavegirls of parg and a eunuch manservant or two but his presence in this lowly tavern was not unusual often in such places he found men and women whose various talents were suited to his own equally varied needs and his interest in the two dreamers sprang chiefly from the fact that he recognized their hooded hungry peering knew their precarious position their almost penniless condition which in turn ought to make them ideal tools for a certain scheme of his some years ago the wizard nyrass of theelys whose walled and highturreted castle loomed on the outskirts of the city had promised borak great riches wealth almost beyond reckoning if he could only devise a means of stealing a certain magical wand this wand was a prized possession of an ancient and extremely wicked priest of the dark god yibbtstll who tended his duties at the feet of the monstrous stone idol of that god in a dark temple high in the great bleak mountains hero of dreams the wizard nyrass a good man despite his various thaumaturgies and magical machinations had openly warned borak that the dangers attendant upon any attempted larceny of the wand would be great indeed to begin with yibbtstlls priest was a worshipper of the terrible demon gods who seeped down with cthulhu from the stars when the earth was an inchoate infant and dreamland still undreamed and he was rumored to wield weird powers for through the wand he controlled an alien energy which could shrivel men to bones like the blast of a mighty furnace or the heat in the heart of a rumbling volcano and then there was the stone idol which if the right runes were invoked and certain other sigils applied could take on a semblance of life and walk abroad even as yibbtstll himself and yibbtstll was grim indeed tainted with all the vile lusts of the terrible demon gods of which he was one against dangers such as these the dizzy mountains and the often perpendicular climbs necessary to reach the temple of the god were as nothing neither those nor the snowleopards or even the nightgaunts which were believed to inhabit the caves of the upper crags and so ebraim borak knew that the road to yibbtstlls dark temple was fraught with danger and the stealing of his priests wand even more so for which reasons he was not greatly surprised that of the wanderers he had sent to steal and bring back the wandeight men so far a group of four a pair and two other lone adventurersno single word had since been heard doubtless they had followed the tross to its source somewhere in the mountainous heights where the massively monolithic keeps of the first ones were known to stand featureless and fearsome vast blocks of stone as high as the hills pitted by centuries of rain and ice and bran lumley lightnings eight prospective pillagers ayebut not a man of them had ever returned borak knew why this was so indeed he knew much more than the good wizard nyrass suspected for unbeknown to nyrass borak had found a way to contact the wizardpriest of the mountains discovering him to be a cousin of nyrass one thinistor udd udd in turn had engaged boraks services offering him two thousand tonds for each man he could send him but he must never send more than four at any one time borak did not question the sinister wizards requirements his greed put aside all need for questions and there was no such thing as ethics in his business since nyrass also paid boraks expenses and since no one ever returned from his fools errand to claim the reward the ossaran was in an enviable positionfor a man without scruples and if ever some fool should win thinistor udds wand well he could always be disposed of and then borak would lay claim to the aforementioned riches promised him by the wizard nyrass thus was ebraim borak a web for the spider thinistor udd and the poor fools who fell in with his plans mere flies for that wizards larder and now here if he gauged his men aright benevolent fates had sent him two more adventurous souls whose paths he could doubtless turn to the north a few pieces of gold and a promise or two there were those in certain quarters of theelys would gut their grandmothers for a halftond such men were not however suited to the ossarans needs these wanderers from the waking world on the other hand that man eldin softly growled almost imperceptibly nodding in the direction of a staggering drunken kledan slaver whose brawny black arms were banded with gold hero of dreams ought not to go home alone why in his condition and with the mist so thick outside almost anything might befall him on his way back to the black quarter eh he took his eyes from the lurching aleslopping kjedan indelicately squirted a burst of wine into his mouth and laughingly slapped his younger companion on the back as if he had just told some remarkably good joke david hero grinned back at his friend shook a long yellow lock of hair out of wide blue eyes and answered aye there are many dark alleys between him and his bed some highspirited lad might easily bump into him in the dark and inadvertently knock him off his feet it would be the ruin of those baggy silk pants the kledan swayed wildly and half fell then somehow managed to straighten up he headed unevenly for the exit eyes glazed arms adangle pushing smaller men out of his way as he went when his head struck against an especially low beam he reeled and cursed aloud in guttural jungleborn accents finally teetering through a hanging curtain of beads into the narrow passage that led out onto the street of rats eldin was halfway to his feet when a wellmanicured but firm hand fell upon his shoulder pushing him back unseen in the momentary diversion caused by the kledans ungainly exit ebraim borak had made his way over to the dreamers now he loomed over them too tall for a man born of the dreamlands but proudfeatured as the race which had first adopted him easy my friend borak murmured smiling from beneath the hood of his rich red robe there are easier ways to make a living i assure youand anyway the foggy air will quickly sober him up youd not get away with it for theyd notice you leaving hot on his trail the jails of the city are full of wouldbe pickpockets sharpers and cut brian lumley throats he seated himself easily between the dreamers and clapped his hands ordering a skin of the taverns finest wine we wouldnt have cut his throat hero protested in lowered tones merely tapped him on the head thats all aye eldin agreed and in the morning hed surely thank us for a good nights sleepand anyway those golden bangles of his must weigh a ton theyre like to break the poor fellows arms then you admit you were up to no good little point in denying it answered eldin stifling a painful cough since youve obviously traveled that road yourself and would you tell on us not i answered the ossaran holding up his hands in denial indeed and as you correctly deduce if times were harderand they often have beeni might myself entertain just such wild designs no im here to make you an offer not to deliver you into the hands of the citys jailers besides ive little enough time for the law my own reputation reaches far back into the past and is less than spotless and that gentlemen he hurriedly went on is not meant as a slur on your own characters i assure you in which case rumbled eldin bringing into view from beneath the table a curving dagger whose blade reflected the poor light glintingly theres no requirement for this he slipped the weapon into its scabbard at his belt boraks eye narrowed beneath the hood of his cloak in grudging wary admiration as he gazed at the burly dreamer well then he eventually continued before we get down to business how are you named you two and whats your tradeother than rolling drunks that is rolling drunks is part of it hero nodded frowning when you have nothing and youve reached nowhere you hero of dreams start againat the bottom at the moment were thieves thats all his larger companion grunted in agreement theres more money in thieving than trading in dreamlands wares he said and the work is easieruntil youre caught we havent been caught yet and we dont intend to be as for our names this is david hero and im eldin the wanderer and weve roved and robbed half across dreamland always in search of in search of borak prompted him of what wealth a good woman a place to settle adventure life death all of those things eldin snarled suddenly impatient and curiously peeved by boraks questioning what more is there he coughed again an expression of pain momentarily twisting his already unlovely features borak shrugged then answered shrewdly what more an easy lifewhile you still have one to live he turned to hero wouldnt you agree easy living would be nice i suppose for a while came the answer but theres more there must be more than wealth and property more than a pretty girl and a warm hearth to park your boots on adventuremaybe thats it theres always a hill behind the next one always an uncharted island somewhere a scent you never smelled before a taste you never tasted borak lifted an eyebrow in surprise are you a poet then dreamer as well as a thief he turned his gaze once more upon the heavier man and yet your friend here seems just the opposite you make a strange pair im a bit of a poet thats true agreed hero but dont misjudge eldin his nature was once pretty much like mine now he shrugged dont they say that opposites attract anyway we understand each otherand bran lumley wed understand you better too if youd only get to the point aye the ossaran agreed enough useless chattering he stirred himself took out a leather pouch emptied its contents carefully onto the table one hundred triangular tonds the principal coinage of the southeast lay golden and gleaming in the taverns smoky light silence fell over the room in an instant and every eye glitteringly reflected the gold softly humming an olden tune of the steppes to himself borak deliberately divided the heap into two equal piles one for david hero and the other for eldin the wanderer the hand of the older dreamer was touching his pile when the youngers trapped his wrist their bright eyes met across the table questioningly then turned to stare at ebraim borak we could live like kings for a threemonth hero murmured but what do you want of us for your money he wants someone murdered eldin granted isnt it obvious ebraim borak shook his head and smiled no im not hiring assassins he assured them not tonight if murder was what i wanted i could get it cheaper than this i promise you all i want is your attention to know that youll hear me out the money is payment in advance for that alone then if i can interest you in my proposition he formed his next words carefully in a voice little louder than a whisper five hundred tonds each as a retainer ten thousand when the job is done ten thousand tonds hero whistled softly thats five thousand each no no my young friend borak quickly corrected him you misunderstand me i meant ten thousand eachl after a period of stunned silence eldin grunted and hero of dreams scooped up his pile of money oh well listen he nodded his head emphatically you may be sure of that aye agreed the younger man letting his pile of tonds lie but listening is a thirsty game eh sotaverner he called out another skin if you please no better make it threeand some meat to soak it up of omens and nightgaunts chapter ii in the foothills of the great bleak mountains two hundred miles north of theelys and three weeks later as evening settled in and a pair of great kites soared on high eyes sharp for unwary rabbits the dreamers added their own lengthening shadows to the greater darkness beneath an overhanging outcrop of rock and spread their blankets in preparation for the night they freed their single yak from the trappings of its lightframed travois and tethered it where the new spring grass stood green in the fading light it was not an especially cold night but hero threw a blanket over the yak anyway the animal was his eldins mount having fallen foul of a rock vipers bite five days gone and since then the dreamers had walked while the animal pulled the weight of their various necessaries upon its rough but sturdily constructed travois this last day had been harder than the rest of the journey for they had climbed constantly up through the steep foothills until now with the night they were come at last to the feet of the great bleak mountains tomorrow would be that much harder so to fortify themselves in advance they roasted a rab bran lumley bit over a wood fire and brewed up a pan of sweet tea from the ossaran steppes talking in low weary tones while the silence of die night deepened and the stars began to show beyond the up of the overhang as they rested on their blankets a shooting star raced down across blueblack heavens of dreamland an omen murmured hero his companion merely grunted a star he answered after a while only a star falling out of the sky an omen nonetheless the younger man insisted again eldin grunted as you wish he said then a good omenor a bad one a shrug in the fireflickered darkness who can say disgruntled the older man snarled then why worry about it oh omens are worth watching out for huh a moment or two later as hero settled himself down and pulled his blanket up to his chin eldin began to cough long and wrackingly he coughed and when it seemed that he might never stop his companion stirred himself to ask are you all right old friend the coughing subsided eldin spat onto a rock beside the guttering fire he dabbled his finger in the spittle and showed it to hero in the dying light from the fire the younger man saw traces of frothy red now thats what i call an omen said eldin and he laughed low and bitterly at noon the next day they set the yak free and with a slap on its rump hero said his farewell to the animal it trotted away back down the slope that had steepened all through the morning only pausing at a defile to turn its head and look back then it snorted tossed its head once and was gone around a rocky spur and lost from sight hero of dreams from now on it was to be a climb not sheer yet by any means but steep by any mans judgment high overhead were the snows melting on the lower slopes but still heavy in the peaks of this section of the great bleak range icy water rushed down from above a wide waterfall in the main for way up ahead in the peaks the tross had its secret source midway through the afternoon they took a break ate a meal drank tea and talked as they had talked a hundred times since leaving theelys after a weeks debauchery at ebraim boraks expense of money they still had plenty were rich by any dreamers standards but borak had promised much more this was the topic of their conversation i can understand the ossaran paying good money for this mysterious wandwhich must after all be worth many times what hes willing to pay for itbut how can he be sure well ever bring the thing back to him eldin squinted at his younger companion scowling through the smoke of their small fire where else could we sell itand who could afford to buy hero answered realistically a wand thats all it isa stick or a rodand you cant eat wands you know and damned if id know how to use it but when we take it back to ebraim borak then well have money for life and we do know how to use that oh boraks sure enough well deliver it if we ever get it maybe the other dreamer grunted but there are plenty of rich lords in dreamland if we were dishonest men we might easily easily what eldin sell borak out to some rich lord do you know what that rich lord would do throw us in a cell and have us tortured until we told where we got the wand thats what and then when we told hed have us brian lumley put to death how do you suppose these rich lords got to be so rich yes i know i know eldin rumbled but theyre not all bad still theres that about this quest that worries me sorely i mean if the jobs to be so easy why didnt borak come and do it himself what a cultured city gent up here in the heights of the great bleak mountains battling the elements and venturing along unknown ways and all all rubbish eldin finished it for him an ossaran cultured indeed spoken tike a true expert hero laughed derisively and what pray would a bloodstained thief of a marooned dreamer know about culture huh ive a suspicion im a pretty smart fellow in the waking world eldin muttered oh well i wouldnt know but anyway i think your questions are all easily enough answered no this job boraks given us will not be the simple thing he made it sound and yes there are certain dangers other than those he mentioned if there werent someone else would have stolen the wand long ago but thats just it what dangers can there be a few cliffs to climb and maybe a gaunt or two to wing us away in the dead of night a handful of snow leopards and a doddery old priest guarding a stone god in a cavern temple to dreamers such as you and i surely these are mere irritations hero nodded aye so it would seem and yet im sure that it wont be at all easy and dont scoff at such things as nightgaunts in celephais i talked to a prospector who once had a brush with gaunts when he was climbing in the heights of lerion he was panning streams for gold at the time well he camped one night in a saddle between two hero of dreams ridgesand woke to find himself already aloft in a great flapping of leathery wings two of them had him between them and they were heading north he put up such a fight in the dark that he soon made them lose height and before very long he felt his feet dragging over solid ground he broke free from one of the gaunts got out his knife and stabbed the other wounding it he was winded when the injured creature fell with him but not much he jumped up and cut the head off the gaunt then hid in a cave till morning when it was light he went out and found the carcass of the one hed killedits carcass and its head hero paused to pull a sour face go on again his friend prompted him and there was no face on the gaunts head eldin grunted and nodded ive heard that said of gaunts before that they have no faces he shuddered involuntarily well hero continued presently finally the old prospector got down out of the hills and made his way back to celephais hed been away such a long time that his wife gave him hell eldin grunted again huh precipices and snow leopardsold priests and secret templesbitter cold mountain heights and faceless nightgaunts what in the names of all the gods are we in this for david money old friend the other reminded him pouring out two more tiny cups of tea with one hand and buttoning his brown jacket more warmly about this throat with the other were only here for the money the cave in the mountains chapter iii three days and nights laterthree days of fingerskinning backbreaking nervewrenching climbing and clawing up precipitous walls of crumbling rock three nights of campingdown on narrow bitter blustilyexposed ledges overhanging thousands of feet of empty airthen wearily hauling himself up onto what seemed like the thousandth crest of the thousandth ridge a few paces in front of eldin hero gave a low breathless whistle and paused to stand and stare mouth agape and sucking hungrily at air in awe of the titanic monolith which now reared its monstrous featureless cube before him one of the keeps of the first ones its foot dimly shadowed and wreathed in late morning mist its towering summit stained mottled and weathered by the passage of nameless centuries the vast stone block was set back from the sheer freshlyconquered face looming in the final fold of mountain that went up whitecrested to the ultimate ridge of snow neither door nor window showed nor indeed any evidence at all to show that the structure had ever known or been capable of knowing habitation of any sort and yet brian lumley patently it was not a natural feature it had been fashioned by intelligent beings hero stared a moment longer then his eyes went to the distance that separated him from the base of the massive keep his jaw dropped farther yet when he saw that the foot of the keep far from being close at hand was at least a quartermile away from him across this rocky and snowpatched penultimate plateau suddenly the keep seemed to loom even larger in the eye of his imagination and he wondered at the nature of its builders starting violently when eldins heavy hand fell upon his shoulder nervous my friend inquired the latecomer in his deep bass rumble aye hero answered then catching sight of a white moving blur in the corner of his eye and rightly so guard yourself brother out of a large patch of snow that dazzled witii its myriad reflections of sunsparkle the white blurspringing apart and forming two blurs two pure white snarling furious snow leopardsshot straight at them the creatures each as heavy as a small man covered the distance between in the merest twinkling of an eye but that was as much time as the wandering dreamers needed as the first beast sprang at hero he fell to his knees his curved bjade leaving its scabbard with a steely whisper slicing upward to slit open the great cats belly in one clean deep killing cut behind hero the snow leopard hit the ground scrabbling yowlingly for a split second in its own steaming entrails then skidded in a white and scarlet blob over the lip and into space springing to his feet the lithe dreamer whirledin time to see eldin behead the second cat with a single swing of his long straight blade this was an act of mercy for with a blow unseen by his companion the gruff wanderer had already almost sliced the beast in two parts now the short hero of dreams hairs of his neck abristle eldin poked at the cats carcass with the tip of his sword did that one of yours wear a collar he asked of the younger man i cant honestly say that i looked hero replied well this one wears a collar so i see a welcoming committee dyou think eldin shook his head negatively no see over there he pointed to where the snow showed pink where a broken shape lay huddled in death theyd caught a goat when we disturbed them theyd been let out to find food for themselves thats all huh grunted hero well theyll not be going home again thats for sure home repeated the other making it a question his voice a low rumble as he shielded his eyes against snowglare and scanned the false summit with its looming featureless keep home ayeand where might home be i wonderand who the master there that runs hounds such as these what did the ossaran tell us hero inquired and immediately answered himself intoning behind the keep where the mountain overhangs there in a deep cave thats where youll find yibbtsths temple and the idol of stone fashioned in his imageand thmistor udd and his magic wand eldin finished it well then do we approach head on all caution to the wind or should we sidle around the great keep and follow the foot of this last rise to the caves entrance or perhaps we should wait for evening added hero equally adept at interrupting that small and extremely comfortablelooking cave we passed a minute ago on the way up will suit us ideally snow leopard steaks hot tea an afternoons sleep all snug in our blanketsand after that well feel more like facing whatevers ahead come evening brjan lumley well get into the shadow of the keep and from then on trust to luck and a pair of bright blades eldin approvingly patted his companion on the shoulder youre a clever lad he growled for all that you still use your waking worldname right you go on back down and ill lower this poor dead pussycat down to you he rubbed his great hands briskly together and smacked his lips by koths awful sign i can taste those steaks already eldins painfully wracking cough woke hero up the older dreamer sat in his blanket holding his chest rocking to and fro and coughing fit to die which sooner or later is exactly what hell do but to his sick colleague out loud he said there cant be a deal wrong with lungs as noisy as those of yours old friend huh the others spasms finally subsided and who was it said that the mountain air was sure to do me good well youre not often right david but youre wrong again laughing hero stretched shrugged out of his blanket and came to his feet careful to avoid cracking his head against the low ceiling the firebuilt of large sticks from the violated nest of a spotted eagle and fortified with dried goat dunghad long since burned itself out and shadows were sharply etched in the cave outside evening had crept over dreamland and soon the first stars would begin to show themselves in the darkening sky leaving all of their necessaries in the cave the adventurers climbed up again to the vast and now shadowy shelf in silence something of a wind blew in their faces as they emerged onto the plateaulike surface a strangely warm wind that sprang from its unknown source beyond the mountains the dreamers had already formed the opinion hero of dreams that the old legends and rumors were false and that these mountains were not kadaths foothills and now this wind in their faces seemed fully to confirm theirbelief for kadath lay in the cold waste and this wind from the north was a warm one but the wind soon died away and despite the fact that they were well wrapped soon the bitter cold of the evening mountains began to gnaw into them particularly when they passed into the shade of the towering keep of the first ones both of them shuddered a little then and drew their clothing more tightly about themselves moving faster now they passed round the foot of the keep skirting jagged stones and boulders which had worn free and fallen from its looming surface during the passage of countless centuries and sure enough the face of the mountain that went up beyond the keep did overhang in one place and where the shadows should have been blackest below this overhang instead there shone the faintest gleam of yellow light flitting now from shadowed area to shadowed area like a pair of ghouls the dreamers were brought up short by a sudden call it was highpitched ululantplainly the cry of a master to his minions his hounds or his snow leopards hritta the warbling cry repeated nythlar and its echoes rebounded mockingly from distant peaks then plainly audible there came to the ears of the adventurers an angry grumbling and cursing and finally the light retreated leaving the entrance in darkness still as statues hero and eldin stood until the latter gave a quiet burp i wonder he whispered which one that was hritta or nythlar something else that didnt sound like the voice of any doddery old priest to me brian lumley shh hero admonished and they moved forward again warily they entered the caves mouth below the overhanging mountain peak and gradually their eyes adapted to the darkness the cave wound away into the mountain seemingly a natural tunnel whose ceiling was three times the height of a man and whose width was that of five men laid head to heel around the first bend a glimmering light showed and soon the pair crept into a large chamber lighted by dimly flickering and smoky flambeaux the place was bare but iron staples supporting light chains were fixed in the walls the chains were of ample length to meet across the width of the cave thats where the snow leopards spend their nights murmured hero or rather where they used to watchdogs no less umm answered eldin strikes me weve already gone a long way toward disarming the old lad what say your i say my hair is prickling the first answered its prickling all the way down my neck for all heros premonition they went swiftly on emerging in a few moments more into a second chamber here the rocky walls were hung with skins and the floor was covered in furs a rough wooden table bore a flat platter of meat and a stone bottle a second plate with an empty goblet standing close at hand bore the remains of a meal eldin cautiously approached the table lifted the bottle and sniffed at its unstoppered neck he smiled then a thirsty smile and licked his lips nectar he declared in a low rumble like a cats purr tilting the bottle and drinking deeply then his eyes went wide and he sighed his appreciation by all thats beautiful david taste this curved blade at the ready still staring warily all about hero of dreams at the shadows cast by sputtering flambeaux the younger man crossed to the table and took the proffered bottle automatically swigging at the sweet strong liquid before whispering well obviously hes had his supper and doubtless hes now preparing for bedor already tucked up strikes me hes not as wise as he might be by any means either that or were not as clever as we think we are now thenwheres mat damned temple eh right eldin agreed taking back the bottle we really cant afford to dally like this when the bottle was empty to a drop and only the heady scent of the wine remained then spirits greatly bolstered they left the second chamber behind them and continued deeper into the bowels of the mountain occasionally as they went small tunnels would branch off to right and left all terminating after only a few paces so that following brief explorations they were obliged to continue down the main shaft several of these secondary tunnels were in use being storage rooms for furs and skins casks of oil barrels of fruit and vegetables and other household items the priest of the as yet unsighted temple whoever he was seemed to live very well indeed according to the usual standards of the wandering dreamers along the way at intervals the tunnel was illuminated by sputtering torches but after a while these were more widely spaced out so that there were periods of neardarkness as they crept through one of these dark sections eldin whispered at this rate well soon come out through the other side of the mountain to which hero replied it only seems a long way but hi any case i dont think we have much farther to go now they moved a little slower each touching a wall with outstretched hand while inner arm was linked with that of his companion the tunnel here had narrowed brian lumlev down somewhat but shortly they had to extend their inside arms as the cave widened out again at the last only their fingertips touched their swords were now sheathed and they carried their knives between clenched teeth before each step the floor in front was explored by timidly probing booted feet then suddenly the walls widened farther yet and they paused amidst an almost unendurable darkness conscious now of an inner tingling of an allenveloping sensation of extreme danger and ofa presence a presence aye and even at the realizationas at a signalthe cave was at once dazzlingly illuminated brilliant blinding bars of brightness crisscrossed the nearsolid gloom about them in a coruscating blaze and this in turn was replaced in the next instant by the steady yellow burning of a dozen wallbracketed torches that burst almost simultaneously into flame shielding their eyes against the sudden glare the dreamers drew swords and held them threateningly out in front then back to back they turned in a slow circle taking in every detail of the cave in which they now stood alert for any strange sudden or menacing movement in the hanging tapestries of the place thinistor ljdd and one other chapter iv the apartment or temple was huge fifty feet across and almost as high with daggerlike stalactites hanging from the ceiling and squat stalagmites rising up through the luxuriant furs that lay three deep upon the floor the walls were covered with black furs stitched together into drapes and at intervals these were parted to frame the mouths of inner tunnels that led back into darkness two of these entrances were fitted with stout metal gates whose bars were inches thick having satisfied themselves that no immediate danger threatened none of any mundane nature at least the pair faced the old man in his wizards robes of red and black he sat upon the cushioned stump of a stalagmite tasselled conical hat upon his shrunken head slender knobbed black wand in his monkeys hand peering at them sullenly through eyes which were yellow slits in his crinkledparchment face behind this evillooking ancient standing half in the shadow of a massive stalagmite the carven figure of yibbtstll loomed overlooking all else in the temple and over all else it was this monstrous effigy despite being partly obscured which primarily drew the wide eyes of the dreamers brian lumley of more or less manlike proportion thethinghad a head a polished black lump atop its sloping shoulders of stone two eyes were frozen in oddly unnatural positions on the surface of the head one was up near the top the other was low where the corner of a mouth might have been in a more nearly normal statue the lower eye was green and shone with an inner luminositya massive emeraldbut the other was of a reddish bloody hue and of the two it looked decidedly more real the narrowly sloping shoulders were cloaked as was the bulky body beneath but the cloak carved of the same stalagmite stone as the god was open in front to reveal many polished black breasts this was an anomaly in itself since patently the figure was male beneath the cloak where it billowed in petrified rigidity a cluster of stone nightgaunts their wings folded clung tightly almost lovingly to the unseen body of the god the idol was a nightmare made even more nightmarish by its heightwhich was almost three times that of a tall man staring at the loathsome thing the dreamers felt mat they had left the sane world of dreams and now inhabited an alien dimension at the very rim of sanity their eyes went from the idol to the yellow eyes of the wizard back to the idol and finally so the wizardpriests thin reedy voicewhich yet hinted of an awful strength a sorcerous powerdrew their thoughts back to earth and you two are the murderers of my pets are you the cruel butchers of poor hritta and nythlar well welcome dreamerswelcome to the temple of yibbtstll i thinistor udd need not ask why you have come for surely like all the others recently ventured this way you were sent by the ossaran ebraim borak on behalf of my cousin nyrass of theelys to steal my wand and did you too like the others think that it would be so very easy hero of dreams old man thinistor udd answered hero weve no quarrel with you were after the wand thats true enough but no need for any violence and no magic please for our knives are surely faster than any of your spells the two had separated as hero talked widening the distance between themselves moving forward now with swords once more sheathed and replaced by long curving knives suddenly and for no apparent reason eldin blundered into a naked stump of stone and fell over it his knife flying from his hand at the same time hero felt a dull ache spreading behind his eyes clouding his mind he too reeled and only managed to steady himself by leaning against a rocky knob that jutted up waisthigh from the floor eldin gropingly retrieved his knife and hauled himself to his feet you were warned wizard he rumbled no magic his arm went back curved blade gripped between thumb and forefinger and no cried hero no eldindont kill him magic cackled the evil ancient no no my friends from the waking world not magic merely a drug the wine gasped eldin and hero in unison aye the wine you see i was expecting you its been a while since borak sent me two such as you indeed you are long overdue ah but this time he excels himself borak snarled eldin and thendespite or perhaps because of one last attempt to throw his knifethe older dreamer gave a strangled cough crumpled and sagged to his knees fell face down among the furs hero took two more paces forward while the great cave seemed to revolve around him then he too toppled feeling nothing of the impact as his body brought a cloud of dust up from the furstrewn floor brian lumley eldin was dying he knew it from the very moment he awoke to the nonetoogentle slapping of tiny hands about his bearded face there was a searing fire in his lungs burning as never before and all his great strength seemed to have evaporated within him steamed out of his body by the consuming fire he awoke with a great bloody cough bursting upwardwhich expired unaltered when scented delicate fingers clamped firmly over his agonized mouth shh quiet dreamer a girls tremulous fearfilled voice whispered hush nowlest you wake thinistor udd at that eldin remembered where he was and all that had gone before he opened his eyes and stared straight into those of an apparition by the flickering flame of a small stone lamp he studied the girl slim as a willow twig she was blueeyed and fairskinned with delicate features much like the aristocrats of ilekvad longlimbed for all that she was tiny with soft golden hair falling about her bosom in alland dressed as she was in the flimsiest of gauzes and wraps and certainly in any place other than thisshe was a sight for sore eyes eldin forced back the tearing coughs he felt welling inside to wheezingly ask who are you girl and what by all the gods are you doing here aye he stared about at the small featureless caveand for that matter where exactly is here eh you are in one of thinistors gated cells she told him but hush hush she turned her attentions to david hero who lay nearby eldin tried to get up discovered himself to be bound hand and foot lay back again and watched the girl as she slapped heros drawn face until his eyes flickered open eh hero saidthen what in the name of shh the girl once more admonished and again she suffered the burning gaze of a dreamer as hero studied her hero of dreams where she sat upon her haunches do not struggle she said as he began to strain against his ropes for youll only tighten thinistors bonds but what hero began again only to be cut off by you are the wizards captives and he would kill you most horribly only i can save you and only you can save me if i have your promise that youll take me with you then ill help you to escape done said eldin at once but only set us free aye agreed hero you have our word but come loosen these bonds and while youre about it you can tell us what you know of thinistor udd the knots were tight and the ropes thin and strong but nevertheless the girl worked hard and fast with small deft fingers she worked on hero first and as her fingers flew so she talked my name is aminza anz and i was taken by a gaunt from the balcony of my fathers home in ilekvad that was almost a year ago since when ive been here at first i thought that the gaunt would eat me but i dont know if they do eat hero nodded we know he said gaunts have no faces and so no mouths neither has yibbtstll a mouth if we can judge by that idol we saw in thinistors temple true and yibbtstll is the lord of gaunts interesting hero mused for goodness sake go on girl grunted eldin impatient of interruptions anyway aminza quickly continued i wasnt eaten but brought here it took the gaunt all of three nights to get me here resting in mountain caves by day and only journeying under the stars sometimes hed fly me halfway up to the moon and then for hours wed glide and glide where shoals of hideous shapeless drifting things groped brian lumley and pawed and tried to wrest me from the gaunts awful grasp the larvae of the other gods said hero his voice hushed ive heard mention of them before perhaps aminza answered then grunted with delight as one of the knots came loose behind heros back without pause she started on another by now eldin was fidgeting as though he had fleas go on lass he urged cant you get on these ropes are cutting me in pieces well she went on i was asleep when we got here and when i woke upthere was thinistor udd she shuddered and hes kept you here ever since eh asked hero but why did he have you brought here in the first place has he been bothering you pardon does he take you to bed lass eldin was more direct no no she shuddered again but he looks at me a lot and makes me dance and sometimes he touches me huh the gnarled dreamer grunted hes past it then only his body is old she answered as yet another knot came loose in her hands his mind is sharp as a razor its a razor ill be taking to his scrawny throat as soon as youve got us loose eldin replied the razor edge of my knifeif i can find it hero sniffed disgustedly you didnt really think hed leave us our weapons did you dont go snapping at me lad eldin rumbled or by shh hero fiercely hissed hells teeth eldin youll have the roof down on us with your bellowing hero of dreams then to the girl he said and did he lock you up with us aminza surely he was taking a chance no she answered indeed he forbade me to come near but you are my one chance for freedom soon he would do with me as he does with the others i was small enough to squeeze in through the barsbut you two will have to break down the gate she gave a little grunt of triumph said thereand at last heros hands were free work on eldin the young dreamer told her ill free my own feet as soon as theres an ounce of blood flowing in these numb hands of mine he began to rub at his hands working life back into them gods girl but i could kiss youaye and more than thatif things were a little different aminza said nothing but her blush could be seen even in the flickering lamplight as she started work on the ropes that bound eldin the older man asked what others were you talking about and what was it thinistor did to them for a moment she paused in her task to peer at him and again she shuddered other prisoners she finally answered other men that the gaunts bring him or who come here from theelys sent by by a treacherous ossaran dog eldin cut in aminza nodded thinistor he he sucks at them like a vampire with his wand he changes them to little bags of bones which he then feeds to his snow leopards you see hes determined to regain his youth thats why he came here in the first place why he discovered a way into the keep of the first ones he brought things out of there with him secrets the first ones knew secrets hero repeated finally freeing his feet what sort of secrets things that drove him mad she answered his wand hero pressed brian lumley no he found that hidden in these caves from the keep he brought knowledge of strange magicks he knows how to call up yibbtstllor so he says the dreamers looked at each other then back to the girl how do you know all this aminza asked hero he told me so himself often he rambles on especially when the moon is round and mil in the night sky for years he has worked to discover the secrets of the first ones and now he finally draws close to understanding mem his search for youth is only the first step after that the magick of the first ones will make him the greatest sorcerer in all the dreamlandsand the crudest what makes you think hes close girl asked eld in ive seen him when hes drained someone she answered with a grimace for a little while hes young again thenswiftly he grows old with you two he plans to stay young forever after that strong and daring hell go back into the keep of the first ones who can say what hell bring out next who indeed echoed hero thoughtfully using us hell stay young forever eldin suspiciously repeated her words you mean he plans to little bags of bones hero grimly cut in aye well im not quite ready for mat yet come on toss your feet over here old friend its time we were loose and on our way to aminza he said wheres thinistor now girl and where does he keep his gaunts he sleeps such are his thaumaturgies that he needs a great deal of sleep when he wakes he will draw strength from yibbtstlls idolwhich is an avatar of the true demongodand then she paused uncertainly then its our turn eh they asked as one for answer she nodded so i believe as for the gaunts why youve seen them for yourselves hero of dreams eh hero frowned you mean those stone horrors hanging from the idols teats indeed when they are needed thinistor wakes them the dreamers stared at each other david i fear were deep in nightmares now said eldin and much as i know youre against murder this time it seems well have to kill him hero finished it for him the other gravely nodded right there are too damned many wizards in dreamland anyway and the sane ones are bad enough the taking of the eye chapter v damn it girl you said he was asleep eldin accused in a loud whisper hes the liveliest sleepwalker ive ever seen he must have been eager to start aminza answered in his ear her voice a mere breath certainly he was asleep when i left my bed something may have woken him up perhaps he sensed your game said hero and discovered your absence no no she replied for i made up my bed to appear as i were in it besides he would have come for me and called me out the three of them were crouched in the shadows at the gate of the tunnel that led back to their prison cavelet in the main cave through the bars of the gate and by the light of flambeaux thinistor udd could be seen to be engaged in magic his back was turned to them where he stood halfhidden by a stalagmite before yibbtstlls idol his arms were stretched high and wide over his head and in one hand he held his knobbed wand his voice crackled like subdued lightning in the confines of the cave and as he chanted his alien discords so brian lumley occasionally he would strike the stony gaunts where they clung beneath the folds of yibbtstlls cloak whenever he did this bursts of brilliant white fire would go slanting off dying before they could strike either ceiling or walls whats he doing asked eldin he draws strength from the idol aminza answered see how he swells up when his wand strikes fire also he is waking the gaunts he always wakes them before before she stared at the dreamers eyes wide in a deathwhite face before he drains someone asked hero she nodded the gaunts go out to guard the plateau and the mouth of the cave making sure there are no intruders and that thinistor will not be disturbed even as she spoke a fantastic thing began to happen the gods stone cloak grew blurred in appearance as if viewed through smoke and its central parting seemed for all the world to widen wholly revealing the gaunts where they now writhed fitfully as they clung to the gods monstrous body then one by onestone things no longer but rubbery creatures from the mind of a madmanthey fell from the idol like strangely ripened fruit opening their wings and speeding in a flock round and about the caves walls and ceiling a moment more of this wild circling until as at a signal they made for the exit tunnel and disappeared into it in a great flapping of leathery wings we must act now aminza hissed a moment more and he will be too strong for you lookahtoo late for thinistor had turned from the idols uncertainly wavering figure had seen the three where they crouched at the barred gate and his yellow eyes were tinged red with fires of hell he pointed his wand now cried eldin and hero together stepping back a pace before slamming their massive frames against the hero of dreams metal bars of the gate the bars bent from their combined weightchains snapped and hinges shearedand the gate went down in a cloud of dust and stony debris the dreamers fell with the gate as thinistors bolt passed harmlessly over their heads it missed aminza by the breadth of a hot kiss and exploded in white fury in the depths of the prison if a bolt strikes you the girl screamed it will not kill you outright but suck you dry carrying your strength back to thinistor hearing her hero rolled to one side as a second bolt seared the air scant inches away spending itself in a blazing ball of white sparks against me draped wall of the cave eldin was springing forward last dregs of strength powering him carrying a long metal stave snatched up from the debris of the gate aminza too played her part sprinting for the shelter of a knobby stalagmite distracting the enraged wizard and indeed thinistor no longer shrunken but swelled out with sorcerous power was enragedand confused his passion saved the three for in its throes his bolts flew wide and scored no hits then too late the wizard saw the iron stave where it flew at him from the hand of the older dreamer he saw it shrank back hurled one last useless bolt and screamed one shrill scream as the spiked head of the stave impaled him and threw him down he fell clutching the iron where it entered the center of his body and his wand of power went bouncing harmlessly across the covered floor by the time the three had converged warily upon the wizards once more shrunken form his eyes had closed and he lay still theres no blood observed eldin panting from his exertions and clutching painfully at his chest wizards dont bleed said hero you must be quick now aminza grasped their arms brian lvmley soon the gaunts will return which they must before the idol can once more turn to true stone but surely the idol is stone hero frowned no its half and half see and she pointed sure enough the outline of the hideous effigy still wavered and it seemed to the dreamers that its red eye gazed evilly down upon them the emerald eye on the other hand still beckoned enticingly and now there was nothing to stop diem from taking it our weapons cried eldin spotting their knives and swords where they lay wrapped in a skin on the floor good said hero his voice much harder than its norm give me my knife mountains and snow leopardsgaunts and mad wizardsdemon gods and what all damn them to the nineteen hells we came for the wand and now we have it aye and that great jewels coming with us too when we leave he pointed at yibbtstlls emerald eye well spoken lad wheezed eldin sitting down heavily on thinistors stony throne but thats a climb youll need to make on your own this old fellows winded girl he grasped aminzas wrist is there nothing for a man to drink in this place while aminza found an unbroken bottle of wine for eldin hero climbed the carved folds of yibbtstlls cloak he was aware of the unpleasant vibrating feel of the warm and slimy stone under his hands aware too of the half life with which this monstrous lump of rock seemed imbuedwhich made its surface appear fuzzy to his eyes and full of trapped motion like a frozen whirlpoolbut at last he perched with one foot in a high fold of cloak and one arm thrown about the horrors neck then he took his knife in his free hand and started to prise the jewel loose he dug around the edges of the socket where the stone hero of dreams seemed strangely soft until finally he could stab the knife in deep and lever the great emerald free as he did so suddenly it seemed to him that the idol convulsed in a kind of spasmof agony perhapsand at that he gave an involuntary shudder and jumped free to land catlike on the furs at the foot of the carven effigy the jewel had fallen too directly into aminzas hands where she stood waiting grimacing hero wiped his hands on his brown jacket and took back the huge jewel he took out a coarse handkerchief formed it into a little sack around the emerald and tied it to his belt by then despite the fact that eldin was a half bottle of red wine heavier the older dreamer was back on his feet and raring to go to the girl he said aminza does thinistor have any other goodies of value lying around a treasure chest or two perhaps he has a lot of money somewhere she answered but ive been here for a year and never found it yet perhaps hes hidden it in the great keep and of course theres his wand of power ill take that said eldin catching up the wand from where it lay at his feet but no sooner was the wand in his hand than a great blue spark leaped from its knob to strike him in the forehead standing his hair on end and hurling him backward head over heels in a somersault from thinistors stalagmite throne he let out a yell of shock and anguish as he fell in a tangle to the furs of the floor then as eldin dizzily propped himself up on his elbows and shook his head to clear it hero stepped over and gingerly tried his luck with the fallen wand before his fingers could even touch it however small bright sparks flew up in warning causing him to snatch back his hand damn thing just doesnt want to be taken he snarled then well have to leave it eldin grunted and in brian lumley any case wands are for wizards if borak still wants it hell just have to come after it himselfif hes still capable when ive finished with him aye too true hero readily agreed he was fully recovered now from his funny turn with the idol but still he kept a wary eye on the mutilated face of the stone god where it stood half in shadow anyway we have this monsters eye and i say thats treasure enough so lets be on our way to aminza he said can you climb girl i can try she answered good the great bleak mountains are high and its a long way down if you fall and so they quickly set off along the main tunnel that led back to the lofty plateau and its sentinel keep of the first ones this time they moved faster through the tunnel lighting the way with torches taken from the flambeaux in the temple and in a very short time they emerged from under the overhanging peak onto the plateau dawn was coming up over the edge of dreamland and with it a chill and moaning wind that blew the torches out leaving the trio shrouded in a cold and deceptive halflight the dreamers headed straight for the keep intending to skirt its great base and return down the mountain along the same route they had used to climb it aminza now warmly wrapped stepped nimbly between them almost aglow with the gladness of being free at last from her ordeal then as they entered the shade of the looming keep batwings beating and a cloud of leathery gaunts settling all around them the things had been waiting in shadows high on the face of the keep and now they buffeted with their wings punched kicked and gouged with their rubbery paws hero of dreams swords whispering and slicing knives stabbing the dreamers fought back to the best of their abilityah but they were not used to looking after a woman aminza having no weapons of her own with which to fight was snatched aloft by a pair of gaunts and whirled away back toward the overhang and the cave it shadowed her cries came back to the two as they battled desperately fighting for their very lives and abruptly as the fight had begun it was over the gaunts lifted up and flapped away leaving three of their number behind stretched lifeless on the cold snowpatched ground against a brightening sky hero stood tall and roared his frustration damn and blast all creation he cried waving his sword now well have to go back for her eldin whatt he quickly kneeled and held out his hand to the older man whats wrong old friend did you get a clout my bloody pumps the other wheezed spitting redly on a patch of snow theyre coming apart im sure you go back and all speed ill get my wind and follow ill wait for you at the mouth of the cave sorry davidand good luck but hero was already gone racing for the overhang white teeth gritted and sword at the ready the weight of yibbtstlls emerald eye jouncing against his thigh aminza buffeted almost unconscious by the wings of the two gaunts as they sped with her back along the tunnel toward the temple of yibbtstll did not see what passed her moving in the opposite direction this was as well for while the gods stone idol was a sight evil enough by any standard yibbtstll in the flesh was a thousand times worse she knew however as soon as she regained her brian lumley senses where her captors had tossed her to the floor of the temple what had happened thinistor udd though gravely injured had not been dead when they had left him in the temple recovering he had used his wand to gain strength from the morbid idol this was all too plain from the way he now sat with his back propped against the base of his throne wand to hand darkly stained stave beside him where he had lain it after dragging it from his body the idols absence spoke for itself that and the trail of dishevelled furs that led across the floor of the cave and into the exit tunnel now as aminza lifted herself onto one elbow thinistor looked at her glistening droplets of sweat formed on his bald yellowed pate and forehead to roll down and wet his sickly agonized face but his yellow eyes were bright and evil as ever from the wand he held in his clawlike hand a greenish light streamed out following the trail of disturbed furs and disappearing into the mam tunnel aminza knew that thinistor guided the god through this thread of alien energy knew also that he had sent that hideous being out to bring back her friends from the waking world to bring them backor to kill them did you think to escape from thinistor udd so easily girl he whispered through cracked lips which scarcely moved so great was his pain i can see that you did well old thinistors not dead yet not by a thousand years or more and youll pay for your treachery you may count on it as for your friends theyve seen their last morning in dreamland i fear they took yibbtstlls eye which displeased him greatly even if i wanted to i couldnt save them nowand i dont want to no he cautioned as aminza made to rise dont move girl or theyll have you quick as a flash he cast his eyes up to the ceiling where clung the two gaunts which had recaptured her hero of dreams as she sank down again to the floor of the temple thinistor laughed aye best to do as youre told gaunts have no faces but theyre manlike enough in other ways eh girl and despite his obvious agony he cackled mercilessly before returning his gaze to the weave of green light where it flowed from his wand the dark god walks chapter vi reaching the cave entrance under the overhang hero paused the bristling of the short hairs at the base of his neck warned him that apart from all else there was something here completely outside human experience dreaming or otherwise something which never should be in any sane or ordered universe a wind was rushing from the tunnel carrying with it a rotten smell that had him pinching his nostrils in disgust he stood as at the lip of a tomb freshly opened after many centuries and his eyes widened as he saw deep in the gloom of the cave a greenish light swelling and brightening even as he watched something was coming down the tunnel from yibbtstlls temple and the way die dreamers feet suddenly seemed rooted to the earth he knew that whatever it was it boded ill for any merely human adversary dawns light was brightening rapidly now and the wind from the west had slackened slightly incapable of motion and feeling that chill but gentle wind on his back heros eyes bugged as he watched the green glow pulsing closer still and his inner mind screamed for him to take some defensive action to run and put distance between himself and the unknown horror then breaking his paralysis brian lumley david came eldins cry carried on the wind that blew from the looming keep man come back and give me a hand i cant handle all of them myself at that the younger dreamer halfturned saw his companion less than a hundred yards away hard pressed by the flight of gaunts which had returned and now hovered about him where he slashed and hacked alone he could barely hold them at bay and slowly but surely they were driving him back toward die caves entrance back to whatever it was mat came in greenish rottenness looming ever larger from the depths of the tunnel hero cast one more glance into the gloomy bowels of the mountain enough to make out the outline of the thing that moved there in its nimbus of emerald fire and then his feet seemed to grow wings as he sped back to eldin and joined him in fighting off the gaunts what now lad eldin panted his face white in the halflight and drawn with awful exertions back to the cave no gasped hero skewering a gaunt and withdrawing his blade before the dead creature could crash to earth at his feet ive seen whats coming after us i think its yibbtsdl himself and these damned gaunts are simply here to slow us down eldin roared his anger as one of the rubbery monsters fell onto his back almost throwing him from his feet he leaned forward and hero lopped off the horrors blind head on the next instant as the carcass of the headless creature slid from the older mans straining frame the remaining gaunts lifted skyward in a concerted throbbing of wings for a second the two dreamers stared at each other wideeyed then gazed back toward the cave beneath the overhang yibbtsths bulk was emerging into the still dim light surrounded by a greenish glow and one look at that black hero of dreams god of horror was almost too much for the adventurers to bear eldin grasped heros arm and croaked the cliffs quick we must go the way we came no the other answered gulping air into lungs which felt starved galvanizing a body that seemed utterly unmanned no the gaunts would pick us off the cliff like flies off a wall what then the final crest perhaps well have room to fight the gaunts off up there and we might just be able to start an avalanche and and send that great horror to hell yes lad i like your idea but the way i feel you might yet end up seeing this thing through on your own and eldin coughed up a great red blotch and spat it onto a patch of snow inadvertently as they fled for the slope that climbed to the final crest of snow the two found themselves drawn to look back again at the thing that pursued them yibbtstlla loathsomeness from the dead spaces between the starswhose living visage made his previously stony aspect seem almost warm and friendly by comparison greenly illumined yibbtstll seemed to flow toweringly purposefully toward them the gods feet or whatever other members propelled him were hidden beneath his billowing cloak his eyethat single eye where recently there had been twowas now alive redly glistening quick with a hideous mobility it slid over the surface of the demongods pulpy face with a swift and apparently aimless motion the empty socket which once had housed the other eyethe great emerald that now jounced against heros thighmoved in similarly pointless circles and dripped a black pus that steamed where it splashed on the stony ground but if the movements of yibbtstus hideous orb and its companion socket seemed aimless the determined brian lumley way in which he now moved after the dreamers most certainly was not what few gaunts remained had gathered themselves to the huge monster and disappeared beneath his weirdly fluttering cloak their presence there did not however slow him down and for all his vast bulk he flowed effortlessly up the final slope obliterating the tracks that the dreamers had left in the thawing snow now approaching the crest of the snowridge the two struggled through clinging kneedeep snow that drenched their legs slowing and tiring them until at last almost exhausted they reached the very top and there they were finally obliged to call a halt for at their feet as if some giant had sliced both snow and mountain with a massive sword a sheer fall of rock went down and down for thousands of feet into mighty misty deeps before them the seemingly bottomless chasmwhere the morning mists now boiled upward climbing the sheer face of rock toward themand to the rear the lumbering god of unknown dimensions beyond dreamland bent upon the recovery of his emerald eye and certainly upon less mentionable things thinistor udd lives croaked eldin see the green light follows the god like a long trail winding away back to his temple it was the wizard sent yibbtstll after us whoever sent him ill jump before i give myself up to that hero pantingly declared as he spoke a warm glow bathed their backs the sun risen at last on what could well be their last morning in earths dreamland and still the horror came on his stench reaching them like the breath of an open tomb as he climbed the slope of snow down on all fours went the adventurers frantically shaping great balls of wet snow which they propelled down the slope toward yibbtstlls hideous form gathering snow and momentum as they rolled the balls smashed hero of dreams into the monster god with the impact of boulders but what they had in weight they lacked in consistency flying apart and tumbling past the lumbering giant in wetly bouncing fragments that avalanched down to the plateau of the keep and yibbtstll was impeded not at all less than fifty feet separated the pair at bay from that awful being when the latters cloak suddenly burst open to release upon the beleaguered dreamers the few remaining gaunts balanced precariously on a narrow and infirm ribbon of snow hero and eldin were hardly in a good position to do battle with the creatures it was as much as they could do to protect themselves and still the terrible form of yibbtstll came on his single eye sliding over his face more rapidly now perhaps in nameless anticipation aminza knew she dared wait no longer the look on thinistors face told her that much seated with his back against the base of his stalagmite throne the wizards yellow eyes were wide and full of mad delight and the corners of his mouth curved upward in an awful smile aminza had little doubt that in some magical way he saw whatever sight presented itself to yibbtstll carried back to him perhaps by the greenly weaving umbilicus of light that still streamed from thinistors wand if that was the case then her dreamer friends must be in a fearsome plight and if they were done for then so was aminza she feared the wizard yes and also the pair of gaunts that silently clung to the caves ceiling but the wild men of the waking world that she had befriended were her last hope her one chance for freedom lithe as a cat in one flowing movement she came to her feet and flew at thinistor snatching up the heavy stave from where it lay beside him and whirling it once about her head she heard the throb of rubbery wings as the brian lumlev shadows of the gaunts fell across her but then before the wizard could do more than turn his feral eyes on her she swung the metal stave against his head thinistor gave a single shriekhigh and bubblingas the ancient bones of his skull caved in where the stave embedded itself in soft brain and then all was chaos the greenly glowing light dimmed and flickered one gaunt instantly frozen in stone crashed down to the floor with a shock that shivered it to fragments the other smashed blindly into the caves wall its wings snapping like chalk as it too returned to its stony state then the green light flickered one last time and with a crackling of alien energies snapped out thinistor dropped his wand and fell to one side he lay still his yellow eyes wide and blind accusingly staring at aminza as his brains trickled out of his shattered skull the living eye chapter vii in the same moment that aminza rose up to hurl herself at thinistor up on the snowridge yibbtstll had come within reach of the dreamers now as eldin skewered the last of the gaunts through its neck sending its lifeless body spinning into die awesome chasm the demongod reached out from beneath his billowing cloak three green and black things which might have been arms each terminating in seven slimy worms which were perhaps fingers hero immediately slashed at one of these loathsome appendages with his curved blade of kled but his weapon simply bounced off the monsters flesh was completely impervious to weapons of earths dreamland the seven long fingers of that uninjured hand wrapped around heros head forcing him to his knees while the other two arms reached for eldin utterly exhausted the older dreamer miraculously avoided yibbtstlls slimy grasp and went down on his knees beside his companion as he did so his fingers touched the kerchiefwrapped gem where it hung from heros belt he tore at the bundle crying its your eye isnt it youve come for your damned eye and as hero fought to tear loose the vile fingers brian lumley which groped to get into his eyes his mouth nostrils and ears so eldin ripped open the snowwet bundle and clutched its contents to his heaving chestfor a moment only for the gem was a gem no longer nor was it green and hard it was wet and soft as jelly and it was red it was an eyea living eyethe twin of me loathsome orb that vacillated even now over yibbtstlls hideous face instinctively or as if inspired eldin squeezed the thing in his massive hands and instantly the demongod snatched back his three writhing pseudopods for a moment yibbtstll seemed to throb and expandin rage perhaps or painbut then his cloak flew wide and allowed the stunned dreamers to peer within at a writhing mass of sucking mouths lashing pseudopods and heaving black breasts right up to the two flowed the horror from the stars and in another moment his cloak had started to close about them then take your damned eye yelled eldin and with his last ounce of strength he hurled the softly plastic thing into the horrors face with a sickening squelching sound the eye flew into and filled the empty socket in that same instant the demongod shuddered to a halt all motion went out of the huge figure the cloaks eery undulations ceased the vastly lumbering being turned stony gray and its prodigal eye flashed green once more whatever yibbtstlls living weight it in no way compared to his weight as a stone thing the ridge shuddered as a jagged zigzagging crack appeared in the thick crust of snow directly beneath eldin where he crouched as the gap widened he lost his balance and tumbled into it falling face down on solid rock then there came the roar of avalanching boulders and snow and eldin saw the ridge swept clean as the petrified god began to somersault back hero of dreams ward down the steep slope flying into fragments as he went in less than a minute all was still except for the wracking coughs that shattered an almost unnatural silence eldin when he had himself under control turned his face from the scene of devastation down on the plateau of the keep staring into the disk of the rising sun david he croaked scanning the empty ridge then he blinked his eyes against the dazzle of sunlight and stared harder unable to comprehend that indeed the summit was naked a ridge of scarred and empty rock david eldin roared hearing his mighty shout of horror and despair echoing away and down into unknown inner vaults for a moment there was utter silence then never mind the shouting old lad came his friends hoarse cry from beyond the rim of the ridge just get on down to the caves and fetch a ropeand be quick about it eldin laughed wildly at that and crawled to the lip of the chasm fifty feet below sprawled in the branches of a cleftgrown shrub green with springs buds david hero looked up with white face and wide eyes below him the face of the cliff seemed to go down forever was lost in cloud at an indeterminate depth hang on lad eldin cried ill be back never fear and david yes dont go away in fact it was aminza climbed the ridge to haul hero to safety she had met eldin as he staggered on useless legs toward the cave had helped him into the warm tunnel covered him with furs poured wine down him until he could talk coherently then she had found a rope and gone to look for hero brian lumley since then a month had gone by and with it the very last traces of snow from the heights since then too hero and aminza had searched diligently among the fragments of stalagmitic rock at the foot of the final rise discovering nothing of yibbtstlls emerald eye which was probably just as well now the three of them stood together at the foot of the great keep weighed down with necessaries fit and rested and ready to move oneven eldin ruddy with health whose painful coughing had not been heard for well over a week i still dont understand it the older dreamer grumbled there was i fit to dieand here i am now strong as a horse thinistors medicine aminza answered with a laugh if ive told you once ive told you a dozen times when the great gaunt first brought me here i too was near to death it was a result of all that flying in the cold night air thinistor gave me the same elixir i gave to youwith the same result we were both made well so you see some good came out of that old devil thinistor after all indeed it did eldin growled giving the girl a hug that near cracked her ribs he turned to the younger man strangely silent as he stared up the massive wall of the keep whats on your mind david uh oh i was just wondering about what the keep eldin frowned and took the others arm now just a minute lad but hero shook himself free and turned to his companions with blazing excited eyes why not he demanded thinistor found a way in didnt he why shouldnt we whos to say what wed find in there eldin looked at the girl and shrugged you did say that the wizard had a lot of money hidden away somewhere aminza well perhaps he kept it in the keep hero of dreams so she answered fatalistically where do we go from here her companions looked at each other and grinned we have a way of making decisions at times like this said hero taking out a golden tond he handed the coin to eldin are you with us girl do i have a choice well do as you wish aminza eldin immediately answered we owe you that much at least yes but youd never forgive me she returned so lets do it let it all rest on the toss of a coin for a long moment the three stared into each others eyes we do have a little unfinished business with a certain ossaran hero murmured aye eldin agreed but its not as if well be here forever two or three days at most they looked up at the looming keep and as the sun passed behind it so its shadow began to fall upon them heads we stay said hero breaking the silence and tails eldin began means theelys aminza finished and a ship bound for ilekvad for me hero took a deep breath and flipped die coin high and the triangular tond glinted as it flashed out of shadow and into sunlight before falling to the earth at their feet part in the keep chapter i hey yelled hero as he raced in through the entrance of the overhung cave hey eldin aminza ive found it the way into the keep ive he skidded to a halt eyes going wide as he took in the scene there they sat on a pile of soft furs eldin the wanderer swilling wine from a stone bottle one arm carelessly over aminzas shoulder the hand fondling a breast through thin silk and the girl snuggling up to the great oaf nuzzling his leathery cheek counting the forest of hairs on his massive chest startled they looked up at him for a moment then eldin got to his feet ah david its as well youve discovered our little secret er for wed have to tell you sooner or later but aminza and i were going to be wed youll be best man of course wont you eh hero shook himself blew dust off his brown jacket oh certainly but you look puzzled lad the older man rumbled placing what he meant to be a fatherly hand on heros shoulder hero who stood somewhat taller than eldin and wasnt all that much younger hated it when his friend took on that tone of voice pretending a paternal interest brian lumley is it so strange that the little baggage should want to bed me down you asked me aminza sweetly interrupted remember hero pointed vaguely behind him out of the mouth of the cave at the great keep of the first ones where it loomed massively across the high plateau look it doesnt matter who asked who whom or whichi just of course well have to fight for her the scarfaced eldin scowled its the custom in certain villages where ive lodged what hero howled hopping impatiently now from one foot to the other look its you who wants her not i if your engagement calls for bloodletting youll just have to bang your thick head on the wall of the cave once or twice that should do the trick meanwhile you disappoint me david eldin cut him off havent you learned any of dreamlands customs the best man to be always to hell with the best man to be hero roared you sexbesotted clownill and he swung a rockhard fist at the others head thats better eldin grunted grinning as he sidestepped the angry blow to deliver a lightning ham with a satisfying thok on heros jaw the younger dreamer was lifted an inch off his feet and thrown across the cave mouth banging his head on a stone where he landed on his back hero shot to his feet eyes turning bloodshot now curved kledan blade growing almost magically from his hand the other backed off a step made placating motions with his hands said easy lad easy enough is enough thats all the ceremony calls for die challenge and the answer nothing extravagant he turned from hero and hugged aminza to him the first marrying priest we hero of dreams find he startedand stopped short his great head snapped round and his black eyebrows peaked in the middle as he stared at his friend from the waking world did you say hero cast his eyes to the ceiling of the cave and his sword with a clang to its dusty floor whats the use he asked of no one in particular disgustedly dabbing at a trickle of blood from where hed bit a lip when eldin struck him you found the way in the big man whispered then roared where where he unhanded aminza and bounded across the cave peering out and away at the hugely looming keep yellow now with sharp sunlight there said hero slitting his eyes and pointing at the distantly featureless face of stone between the stars i see no said eldin craning his bull neck then fists clenched into a club hero hit him on the back of his head down went eldin like a felled oak face down in the dust now do you see them hero grinned but the other merely groaned and spat out dirt boys will be buffoons said aminza moving lithely across the cave mouth to offer eldin her hand did you really find the entrance david i did he grinned again while you two were eyeing and sighing back here i rediscovered old thinistors secret i found the way into the great keep the old wizard had marked his route and i stumbled across it we were wasting our time seeking a door in the base of the keep the entrance is halfway up its face then well need ropes eldin grunted squinting his eyes and tenderly fingering the back of his head what did you find inside thinistors gold treasure marvels and wonders hero shook his head i found a maze he answered and i spent an hour trying to get back out brian lumley a maze eldin frowned what in hell good is that are we to spend days without number exploring a maze the legends tell of a black princess yathlhi of tyrhhia who built a mighty underground maze beneath a great desert aminza thoughtfully said at its center she kept all the treasures of her silverspired city and only she knew the way in when she went in to admire her hoard or to add to it she would have her bearers slain as soon as she led them back out through the maze when she died her nation died with herpenniless no one could ever find the mazes center ive heard that story hero nodded do you think eldin grabbed his shoulders that the first ones did the same thing its possible that the black princess copied their idea yes hero answered but thats no guarantee that theres a treasure but there might be hero shrugged right lets go said eldin rubbing his hands together eager now to be up and at it ropes first reminded aminza and food in case you have trouble finding your way out oh and plenty of chalk chalk eldin looked puzzled to mark a trail hero sighed has love robbed you of all your wits old man now see here but hero ignored him he rubbed his hands in anticipation turned to aminza and said well then come on lets get busy busy the day wears on and we cant stay here forever and eldin uh wear some warm clothes its damned cold in there hero of dreams down below on the vast boulderstrewn plateau aminza stood out from the shadow of the keep and looked up at the men where they toiled upward they had used the ropes for a quick safe climb rather than spend exhausting hours on the job which had been heros lot that very morning now it was midafternoon and high on the face of the keep the men looked like spiders to aminza anz and their ropes like strands of web to them she too looked insectlike and catching sight of her where she stood far below david hero glanced speculatively at his burly companion they had just hauled themselves up onto a narrow ledge and now sat dangling their legs in thin air how old are you anyway queried the younger dreamer brushing dust and fine debris from his brown trousers eh im fortyseven why do you ask you still climb very well hero answered after a moment of thought especially for one who couldnt draw breath without choking only a handful of weeks ago i always was good on a face eldin preened perhaps i was a mountaineer in the waking world then he looked shrewdly at his friend but you cant fool me lad thats not really why you asked my age is it still ill play your game and how old are you thirtytwo arent you hero nodded aye fifteen years your junior but i was only twentysix when first we met and youre wondering how an old lad like eldin the wanderer managed to catch a pretty little butterfly like aminza eh and right under your nose at that hero shook his head no not at all though ill grant you shes a pretty enough creature for any man but weve been together now for six years and brian lumley ah now i understand cried eldin you think that this will split us up right oh itll do that eventually no doubt about itbut he shrugged all for the best really i suppose and hero picked at his square nails and gazed off into space what eldin scowled what are you trying to tell me something how do you mean all for the best well they have a saying in some of the villages where ive lodged hero answered more a poem really he paused but i dont suppose it applies to such as us i mean after all were from the waking world you know foreigners foreigners were damned dreamers thats all and if one of us is a foreigner why its you you havent even earned yourself a dreamname yet ah well hero shrugged forget it he pointed at a deep shaded crack in the rock face thats it he said the entrance before eldin could comment the younger man stood up on the precarious ledge found easy hand and footholds overhead and pulled himself leisurely up and into the fault they were roped together eldin watched hero disappear felt the rope tighten about his waist and followed a moment later they stood together in the cool shade peering into gloom where the fissures flat floor receded into the heart of the keep go on then said eldin say it eh say what asked hero innocently peering at the stone floor beneath his feet see here he pointed these tracks in the dust here theyre mine but these others they can only be thinistors come on lets not hang about and as their eyes became more accustomed to the dim interior of the keep so they moved forward hold commanded eldin before theyd gone more hero of dreams than a dozen paces hero looked at him and could see that he was rapidly losing his temper say your damned saying or your poem or whatever say it now or damn your eyes ill go no farther hero sighed you wont like it he warned youll only want to fight what me fight over a silly poem no no the other vigorously shook his great head not over a fools rhyme well anyway i wont say it said hero his voice echoing hollowly in the gloomy rock passage weve no time now for fighting say it roared the other and they both winced at the echoes that came thundering back are you trying to bring the whole keep down on our heads hero whispered all right all rightl ill say it a mans a man till forty but past that as a rule hes old and rude and naughty and any females hold eldin snarled dont you dare say it you just this minute made the damn thing up anyway here let me lead the way careful as you go cried hero as the other brushed brusquely by him easy i say just around that comer theres a and he threw himself flat on the dusty floor wedging his body tight with arms elbows head and feet in the narrow corridor pitfall came the cry of the other as his weight fell on the rope nearly jerking hero loose it took eldin only a moment or two to haul himself back to safety and when hero felt the rope slacken he crept round the corner of brian lumley rock to he flat beside his friend and peer down into the black depths without a word the younger dreamer took a prepared brand from the pack on his back he struck flint and flames instantly burst from the torch the two stared down into die black reaches of an apparently bottomless pit hero looked sideways at the older man the sight of his companions throat undulating so rapidly as he nervously gulped and swallowed was something one might only witness once or twice in a lifetime to emphasize a point hero plucked a piece of burning rag from die torch and let it fall for well over a minute the flaring speck of light could be seen receding into unguessed depths before it was swallowed up in darkness a good thing we were tied together said hero aye eldin readily agreed david i accept your apology the other preempted him good and no more needling and no more bullheaded arguing and an end to bloody poetry and no dream namecalling they grinned at each other in me flickering torchlight which way do we go eldin finally asked see there the ledge along the wall its narrow but safe enough hero held his torch high and the shadows were pushed back the chasm was about twentyfive feet wide and indeed a narrow rim of rock crossed it along one wall i was along there once already remember keep your face to the wall and youll find handholds galore follow me but quietly and listen old thinistor did us a favor from here on in he left warningsprobably reminders for himselfsmudges of dye in hazardous places white is safe red means danger hero of dreams fine butdont you think that now would be a good time to get rid of this rope it just saved my life granted but next time it might mean the end of both of us agreed said hero only be careful remember i know the wayor at least some of itand its a pretty tricky way you may believe me the keeps core chapter ii half an hour later they had reached heros previous point of penetration to do so they had to bypass a further halfdozen fearsome falls where the floor would have slid away beneath their feet they had to avoid pivoting slabs of stone which would slam down from the walls if a foot should fall in the wrong place and they had to tightrope across a great chasm on a bridge of stone which in places was less than six inches in width they had received adequate warning of each of these hazards in the shape of thinistors smudges of red dye strategically daubed on the walls but the latest obstacle was one which spoke eloquently if mutely for itself explaining why hero had chosen to go no farther on his own for now they had come to a place where the floor of the tunnel suddenly fell away vertically to a depth of some eighty feet but this pit of its own was not what had stopped the younger dreamer casting one of his torches into the depths after first lighting a second from its flame david hero lighted up the floor of the pit the torch had fallen speedily landing with a strangely heavy thump and going out almost immediately but not before the adventurers had seen the many white bones that littered the pits brian lumley bottomthe bones and the coils of rope on which they lay and with which they were intermingled you can see why i went no farther hero said holding his torch high to light up the ceiling see there that thick bar of metal that crosses the ceiling from wall to wall and do you see the frayed ropes that hang from it what do you suppose happened here hmph eldin grunted isnt it obvious over the years a good many adventurers have found their way in here theyve thrown their ropes up over the bar and attempted to swing acrossbut their ropes snapped and they fell to their deaths all of them eh what do you mean can you honestly see any adventurer worth his salt trying to swing across there on a weak rope hero shook his head oh no theres something very fishy here and see theres old thinistors warning on the wall eldin looked as directed and sure enough there was the wizards smudge of warning red the burly dreamer scowled its simply his warning of a hazard he grunted just like all the others weve seen but thats just it hero insisted all of those other hazards were hidden more or less but this one is clearly visible or is thinistor warning us of something we cant seer theres a way to find out grunted eldin here give me one of those grapplinghooks of yours hero took an iron hook from his belt and passed it over eldin tied the end of a slender but extremely strong rope to the hook whirled it round his head and expertly released it the iron soared up and over the bar was pulled back by eldin until its tines caught fast there you go he said with some satisfaction all ready to swing as were all the others hero frowned here ive an hero of dreams idea lets see what happens if and he searched the floor around his feet until he found a large jagged rock fallen from the ceiling in unknown ages past carefully he cut the rope and tied the rock to its end with a firm knot then with a great push he sent the weighted rope swinging out over the chasm like a pendulum the stone should have swung away and returned to heros handsbut it did not at the halfway point as if caught and pulled from below by the hand of some invisible giant the rock plummetted downward trailing strands of snapped rope what in the name of the dreamers whispered in unison hero found a smaller stone whipped his hand back then forward shot the projectile out across the chasm instead of shooting straight across to the other side the pebble curved sharply downward accelerated slammed into the scattering of bones below it failed to bounce eldins eyebrows beetled as he lowered them in a frown as the stones approach the center so they get heavier hero finished it for him and so did our friends down there he pointed at the dark depths below where bones lay scattered in white and shattered disarray when they tried to swing across they grew too heavy for their ropes magic eldin snarled his fear of the supernatural visible in his wide eyes and bared teeth i dont think so said hero at least not the sort of magic you mean this is something the first ones left behind them how do you mean eldin asked well you know how a northstone always points to the north i think theres something down there buried in the heart of the keep that pulls things into it in much the same way except that it pulls harder brian lumley hmph eldin grunted a damned sight harder id say so how did old thinistor get across now it was heros turn to frown lets not forget he was a wizard he said aye but if this is something the first ones left behind surely its power would supersede his at times eldin could display alarming powers of logic hero scratched his head for a moment then snapped his fingers he walked across eh walked are you feeling well lad across the bottom the other sighed he climbed down on a rope walked across climbed the other side and he didnt get heavier on the way down we can soon find out hero hammered a spike into a crack in the floor tied a rope to it tossed the thin coil over the lip lying down he held his torch out over the rim and gazed into the depths in the flickering torchlight he could just see that the rope had reached bottom what does that prove eldin asked well hero answered hauling on the rope which came up easily enough the rope itself hasnt got any heavier has it so neither will we when we climb down i think the pull increases toward the center thats where all the bones are but you cant be sure no but im willing to go first here hold the torch when i get to the bottom ill light another and passing eldin the torch he grasped the rope and swung himself over the rim and out of sight after a while when the rope went slack eldin called out are you all right david fine came the answer come on down and a sudden flaring light from below confirmed heros safe arrival at the bottom of the pit eldin immediately threw down his torch and lowered hero of dreams himself over the edge a minute later he stood beside his younger friend and stared along the length of the pit across the scattered bones at its center to the sheer wall at the other end here we go said hero stepping out gingerly toward that far wall eldin followed and with each step as they approached the center of the pit so they felt weight settling invisibly on their shoulders their limbs every part of their bodies uh said eldin i feel as if i were carrying three men hero ahead by two paces answered where i am it feels like five and look eldin looked in time to see the flames of his friends torch dragged downward and snuffed out as they crawled along the stock of the torch toward heros fingers those flames hero grunted might just have had the right idea in fact he got down on hands and knees i think id better crawl before something snaps eldin too got down on all fours his very clothes now felt as if they were made of lead and the bones of the pit as he pushed them out of his way were heavy as boulders now the dreamers were panting sucking at air which seemed compressed and hard as iron literally wriggling forward on their bellies they dragged their chins in the dust and bones cutting knees and elbows as their weight became that of ten men and more whatever you do dont stop hero gasped or youll be here forever then silent except for their panting gasping wriggling and clawing they gave their all to fighting their way out of this region of monstrous magnetism after what seemed like hours finally they could get back onto all fours and moments later climb weakly to their feet until at last they leaned on trembling legs against the sheer wall of rock at the far side of the pit brian lumley i could sleep for a week eldin sighed while hero lit a torch me too the other agreed which is all the more reason to get moving again well climb this face take a bite to eat and a quick swig of water and press on immediately ive a feeling theres not much farther to go to what to whatever it was kept old thinistor up here in the great bleak mountains all these years hero answered he handed eldin the torch attached a small grapplinghook to a coil of light strong rope whirled the hook round his head and let it fly up and over the rim of the looming wall at their feet the coil of rope unwound itself with a hiss and moments later they began to hop about and yelp covering their heads with their arms as the rope fell back in loose loops and the hook came clattering down out of darkness it missed eldin by inches and hero caught it on the bounce if at first you dont succeed hero muttered in what he hoped was a placating tone but eldin simply snatched the hook from him and scowled blackly here you hold the torch he snarled im damned if ill stand here and be pounded to death by illtossed grapplingirons with a great heave he shot die hook into the air it caught at once and he gave a jerk on the rope sinking the hook into the floor of the passage eighty feet above there he said with satisfaction now you can climb after you said hero promptly youre heavier than i am you go first and anchor the rope for me oh and what if it slips when im halfway up hero shrugged you threw it he blandly replied with a snort and an oath eldin gave the rope a second tug then grunted as he braced his legs against the wall and started to climb hero watched him in open admiration hero of dreams and in less than two minutes was able to follow on when the older man called down to him and announced his safe arrival at the top after hauling up the rope the pair sat down on the cold stone floor ate some dried meat and drank a little water but while eldin would have been content to rest a while longer his younger companion was eager to push on come on hero said getting stiffly to his feet the sooner weve done with this the better were low on ropes irons and torches and our food and waters not much to mention id hate to get stuck in here i suppose so the otiier grudgingly agreed but look whats that up ahead they both stared into the darkness ahead a darkness partly illuminated by the flickering light of their torch which seemed reflected now by some vast and polished surface as they moved forward so the glow grew brighter until indeed they could see that the tunnel was sealed by a great plate of shining metal that extended from ceiling to floor and wall to wall it was inscribed with glyphs utterly alien to he eyes of the adventurers and yet it seemed to them that there were elements of all dreamlands writing and hieroglyphics hidden in these cryptical etchings of the first ones greatly daring eldin stepped forward and banged on the metal doorfor that was surely what the great plate waswith a heavy fist the door shed clouds of dust and gonged hollowly setting up echoes that reverberated for a long time in the confines of the passage meanwhile hero was peering at the walls and muttering ominously at something he found there whats wrong now lad eldin rumbled more of thinistors red paint red yes hero answered and white the contrary old wizard how are we to read that brian lumley why were to go on cried eldin but carefully which means that there has to be a way in the younger dreamer grunted if only we can find it see the crack in the walls floor and ceiling said eldin the door doesnt just block this corridorit extends into the very rock a sliding door hero asked perhaps or maybe one that opens inward the other replied well then if we cant push it open and they leaned their shoulders mightily against it perhaps we can slide it to one side uh and they tried that too but the door would not budge they sat down in the dust and shared a sip of water and as eldin munched morosely on a piece of dried meat so hero rapped facetiously on the door and cried open up in there i david hero command it and with a hiss and a rumble the great silver panel instantly slid up into the ceiling leaving the two comrades to spring to their feet in a blinding blaze of light that spilled like the fires in the heart of the sun out from beyond the raised portal this is it hero cried crouching down and shielding his eyes from the awesome glare weve done it weve reached the core of the keep the keeper chapter iii as hero strode forward into the glare from the open door so eldin grabbed him by the back of his brown jacket bringing him to an abrupt halt easy lad we dont know whats in thereyet knowledge old friend hero answered or treasure perhaps all your heart desires no we dont know whats in therebut whatever it is old thinistor was mighty keen for it aminza reckons he was only after power the power of the first ones maybe he was and maybe he wasnt well never know if we stay out here and look now that the dazzless faded a bit why theres nothing at all in there to be afraid of afraid eldin stiffened did you think i was afraid he released his grip on heros jacket who me afraid of a few bright lights glaring at us out of this lair of the first ones of all those shiny things i can see in there of metal doors that slide up into the ceiling and disappear afraid damned right i am you go first and he gave hero a push in the middle of his back the younger dreamer staggered forward his curved brian lumley blade whispering from its sheath where he had strapped it behind his back for ease in climbing eldin too unsheathed his sword covering the back of his colleague they crossed the threshold and behind them the door gave a hiss and slid down out of the ceiling sensing the doors descent even as it moved the two turned and sprang for the opening all in one movement both of them bounced off the still shivering metal panel and fell crouching to face one another wonderful eldin snarled his scarred forehead wrinkling like old leather hero shook himself he stood up straight and aloof held out a restraining hand to eldin leaned casually against the door rapped upon it as before and said all right whoever you are open up at once no came a booming throbbing echoing answer that had both of the dreamers dropping their swords and clapping hands to ears which rang like the clappers of great bells who dares command the keeper still reeling from the effects of the vast voices refusal the two were almost stunned by its question stumbling to and fro they held tightly to ears whose drums felt ruptured gasping in agonies of sheer unbearable sound well the voiced slammed at them yet again are you dumb no howled hero were not dumbbut well damn soon be deaf if you dont lower your voice who speaks asked the voice again in a tone mercifully lowered by many decibels i do said hero retrieving his sword i david hero adventurer in dreams man of the waking world keepclimber and swordsmasteri speak he whipped his curved blade through the air making it sing to whom do i speak hero of dreams to the keeper who is the other man i speak for myself eldin rumbled im eldin the wanderer dreamer adventurer and swordsmaster just like my young friend hereand i eat lesser men for breakfast a pair of wanderers then said the great voice strays from the waking worldand one a cannibal he doesnt really eat men hero was quick to point out that was merely an indication of his great strength and skill at arms during their brief conversation with the as yet unseen keeper the two intruders had been studying their surroundings now that their eyes were accustomed to the brightness and glare of the place they could see that they stood in a great circular chamber whose walls like the door seemed made of some strange silver metal the floor was padded and springy with a warmth they could fee through to the soles of their feet and the ceiling was high and domed set in the inward curving walls were huge mirrors some of which did in fact mirror their forms but the surfaces of a greater number were of opaque mistygray metal and glass machines and instruments were everywhere motionless bright and glittering but of course the dreamers did not know what they were or how they functioned or even if they had any functions at all ten padded chairs formed a ring about a tall central hump of metal studded with smaller screens levers dials and buttons but naturally this huge instrument panel was likewise a thing of complete mystery to david hero and eldin the wanderer they did wonder however at the size and odd design of the chairs and they stood in awe of the minds which could have conceived of and constructed such a place moving carefully around the huge controlcenter the brian lumlev two eventually reached a point where they could see its far side there the screens were alive with small dancing lights and colors and when the keeper spoke again they noticed that the patterns of colored lights seemed to move in rhythm with his voice you david hero stand on the gray disk beneath the wheel of globes quickly heros eyes found the circular plate of gray metal set in the floor above it suspended from the inwardcurving ceiling a wheellike affair whose spokes terminated in large golden knobs glittered and winked in the changing patterns of light as the echoes of the keepers voice died away hero was immediately suspicious why must he began but no sooner had he opened his mouth than a beam of green fire stabbing from nowhere singed the hairs on his naked forearms in the nearness of its passing do not question the keeper the great voice warned merely do as i say no harm will come to you if you obey with a lowmuttered oath and the short hairs of his neck stiffly abristle the young man stepped gingerly forward and onto the gray disk do not be afraid of the lights or the movement of the wheel i merely wish to look at you came the keepers voice preceding a rapid rotation of the wheel of globes and a silvery haze that sprang downward from its circumference to the gray metal plate completely enclosing hero in a tube of light through which his form glowed like a pale pearl to eldin it seemed mat his companion was frozen in the tube of light motionless and in another moment that he stood in dire peril of his very life for now heros outer form had grown insubstantial as air while all of his bones and inner organs became clearly visible to eldins unbe hero of dreams heving eyes obviously eldin thought the silvery haze was the keeper himselfand damn him he was devouring hero alive in a blur of motion the older man whirled his sword once twice about his headand released it straight at the spinning wheel of globes overhead the sword stuckand disappeared in a blinding flash of light tiny pellets of hot metal filled the air stinging like wasps where they struck and stuck to flesh and eldin danced for a moment or two until he had shaken these revenants of his sadly defunct sword from his person fool cried the keeper said he would not be harmed the wheel of golden globes stopped spinning the silvery haze retracted upward from the gray metal plate and there stood hero unharmed frowning puzzledly as he noted the dumbfounded expression on his burly friends face before hero could speak however the keeper said now your turn eldin the wandererand please no more heroics feeling naked without his sword eldin stepped awkwardly forward and took heros place on the gray plate now the younger dreamer watched a repeat performance of what had gone before and he was similarly alarmed at the sight of eldins innards displayed as if his flesh was become water since he himself had survived the examination however he merely waited until the thing was done and eldin stepped with a glad sigh of relief from the metal disk back onto the springy now familiar surface of the floor so you are what you say you are said the keeper men of the waking world and remarkably robust specimens at that your race has changed little in a million years a certain enlargement of the cranium perhaps to accommodate larger brains the discovery of certain scientific techniques such as the forging of metals these and brian lumley one or two other achievementsand what of writing do you know how to use runes or glyphs theres nothing wrong with our brains cried eldin and weve been forging swords for hundreds of years as for writing of course we know its use why in the waking world i was something of a scholar i think yes and we know the runes of dreamland too and you david hero are you so clever more so hero answered at once ive learned all of dreams runesalmost he sings too offered eldin a little peevishly and he makes up poetry indeed with all that learning cramming his cranium its a wonder he can think at all you interest me said the still unseen keeper yes i am greatly interested sit down in two of the chairs there and be at ease we shall talk for a while but a warning do not touch the instruments on the panels before you to do so might mean placing your very lives in jeopardy the two sat as bidden if a trifle timidly but in no time at all they felt soothed by the shifting lights of the panels and eased as die padding of the chairs molded in their forms the first ones lived in style eh eldin said hero they did that lad came the rumbling reply maybe thats why they died out too much soft living they did not die out said the keeper they merely went awaymost of them but not all of them hero mused are you a first one keeper not i i merely worked for them then they were your masters and are your masters still here they are nine of them nine first ones for ten chairs hero thoughtfully replied hero of dreams there were tenonce the keeper answered but enough of this now i wish to know about you two start at that point which first set your feet on the trail that brought you here to the keep of the first ones leave nothing out i would know it alt then depending on how i judge your tale i may have work for you work growled eldin we dont sell our swords cheaply keeper you for one eldin the wanderer at present have no sword to sell came the immediate response but be sure you would be well repaid for any services rendered how repaid hero asked with riches beyond your wildest dreams came the answer with powers which would make you great in all the dreamlands with whatever your hearts desire the two adventurers stared at each other for a moment with shining eyes then shall you begin or shall i asked eldin of hero hero cleared his throat we had come down into theelys he started the keepers tale chapter iv and thats the whole story said eldin with finality he had taken up the tales telling when hero flagged for a long moment there was silence and the two dreamers sat patiently and waited for the keeper to speak they had grown to associate his voice with the moving lights on a certain panel so that to them the panel had become the keeper during the telling of their story the lights had not been particularly active but now they flashed and shifted their moving colors forming intricate and meaningless patterns finally in a burst of light the keeper said yes i believe you two will do very nicely but will you accept the challenge you worked for ebraim borak and got not a button out of it groused eldin but you will work for me for the great ones we did get something out of the ossaran hero contradicted eldin we had a good time at his expense in theelys and were not broke yet by a long shot to the keeper he said we dont have to work for you you know true enough but that would be a very unfortunate matter indeed it would brian lumley a threat keeper eldin questioned frowning you got into the keep the keeper answered but who is to say youd get out again definitely a threat hero sighed but what good would it do you to kill us keeper oh i would not kill you replied the keeper you would die by no action of mine no for that would be against all the laws i would simply fail to help you to stay alive if as of this moment ignored your presence here then you would never get out you could not open the door hero and eldin glanced at each other and pulled wry faces as to what good that would do the keeper continued none at allfor you for me i would not have to suffer the veritable tribe of wizards and adventurers which your loose tongues would doubtless send here wed not say a word cried eldin in a hurt voice not until the next time you were drunk the keeper shrewdly answered huh the older dreamer grumbled all right keeper you have the advantage hero grudgingly admitted but we cant very well work for you if we dont know what the works to be weve told you our storynow how about you telling us yours colored lights flashed as the keeper considered then would not be my story but the story of the first ones but i can see no harm in it since if you do not accept the quest you will never leave the keep alive very well stay still and listen to the tale at the dawn of time many millions of years ago there was born in the waking world the primal continent of theemhdra no trace of that land and its civilizations has survived the ages and the greatest savants of earth do not even admit the possibility of its prehistoric existence yet hero of dreams theemhdra was its cities teemed with mankinds thronging races and its mountains and forests were alive with strange birds and beasts and it was mans loteven the lot of those first mento live two lives one in the socalled waking world and the other in the dreamlands the first gaunts dwelt in theemhdra and so when the first men dreamed gaunts were borne into dreamland for when all is said and done dream is only a world lying parallel to the conscious lands of man and there are many such parallel worlds and so intelligent men lived in theemhdra and dreamed their first dreams and life came to the dreamlands and they were powerful dreamers some of those early men the architecture of theem hdra lives on in some of dreamlands cities even now notably inquanok for the northmen of the primal continent were cold and hard and their cities likewise and inquanok will last as long as dreams themselves and across all the mighty distances of space there was life and life was scattered down the timestreams its diverse forms like manycolored grains of sand strewn throughout the limitless spacetime universe of planets and places and parallel worlds the race of the first ones was old even then but not the oldest of races by any means they called themselves the first ones because they thought they were and when they discovered even older raceswell still they kept their old name perhaps it was vanity or perhaps that was simply the name by which they had come to be known and the first ones discovered many marvels their savants were masters of science and sorcery who plumbed the voids betwixt stars and times and the misted mysteries of parallel planes of existence they made a great study of all intelligent forms of life and eventually they came to theem hdra where already man had risen up from his predawn ancestors there they established their great brian lumley keeps in the mighty circle mountainsjust as here in dreamland they have set them in the great bleak range and from the keeps they went out in clever disguises to study the ways of man then it was that they discovered mention in the myths and legends of man of those eternally damned demon gods of the cthulhu cycle which seeped down out of the stars in earths earliest days and built their hideous titan cities in the steaming fens of the dawnworld and such were these legends that they fascinated the first ones for according to writings predating earthly life cthulhu and certain of his cohorts yet lived on prisoned in hidden places and sending visions to the minds of men which turned their dreams to nightmares and so the legends concerning the cthulhu cycle had extended into the dreamlands where revenant nightmares nurtured seeds of an elder horror and the mad dreams of cthulhu wandered abroad ever ready to seize upon the dreaming minds of mortal men ah and when the first ones sought to ascertain the truth of the olden mythswhether or not cthulhu and certain of his contemporaries indeed lived onthen they recoiled in horror from that which they discovered namely that the legends lied not cthulhu livedhe livesand he will never cease in his efforts to free himself from magicforged chains and roam free again in the sane and ordered universe breeding madness and ruin and horror and chaos then the first ones pursued cthulhus legends no longer but turned themselves to the task of reinforcing the immemorial prisons of the terrible demon gods and again they discovered their vanity shaken for to admit that cthulhu and his spawn were prisoned was to admit that some even mightier beings had prisoned them and thus the first ones would fathom the secrets of the great elder gods whose home is called elysia hero of dreams and for the first time the first ones found themselves denied access to a place or time or parallel world for such was the might of the great elder gods that they had built elysia and hidden it away where it might never be found or visited or even suspected by anyone or thing which had not the right so to find visit or suspect it and so the first ones gave up their efforts to seek out the elder gods and they wisely withdrew from any further tampering or discovery or even curiosity concerning the natures or manner of being of the immemorially prisoned demon gods of the cthulhu cycle of the terrible demon gods themselves suffice to say that yibbtstllof whom you now have some knowledge since you have met and dealt with one of his many avatarsis one of the lesser demon gods the others are they are much worse but to continue and so the first ones completed their studies of early civilized man and of other lifeforms in that area of the spacetime universe and moved back into the keeps to prepare them for a move to some new and hitherto unexplored region now the keeps had stood in the waking world for thousands of years so that the men of the primal continent of theemhdra no longer remembered anything but the vaguest of legends concerning their coming and when they leftahthat was a marvelous thing these massive cubes of centuriesweathered stone levering themselves loose from the earth and flying off across the world to disappear into strange times and stranger dimensions here in the dreamlands however here all was not well there were three keeps in the dreamlands and the first ones who controlled them were to take their brian lumley leave of mens dreams soon after the exodus of their fellows from theemhdra the time of their leaving the dreamlands was not important for time is different here and anyway these three keeps were not accompanying the greater force but intended to journey to the dreamlands of other worlds alas it was not to be one of the first oneswrongheaded and wilful a renowned lover of mysteries and explorer of unknowns without peerdefied the decision of the council of first ones and secretly sought out cthulhu and others of his ilk here in the dreamlands aye and having found what he sought his payment was permanent madness deranged he became a minion of cthulhu and set out to perform certain tasks for that great demon god firstly he stole from one of the keepsthis very keep whose keeper speaks to youthe three wands of power one of which eventually fell into thinistor udds hands and now lies in his templecave without that wand and its lost companions the remaining nine masters of the keep became marooned here in your dreamland for the wands control the greater force which powers the keep on its long voyages between the stars secondly the deranged first one klarekyam by name caused those things to happen which destroyed utterly the inhabitants of the other keeps it was thought that he would try to do the same to his own keep but something must have happened to him all those many aeons agone to foil his mad design then because my remaining nine masters could no longer leave earths dreamland and since they had no desire to live out their lives here they placed themselves in a deep sleep until the time should come when the wands might be returned they remain hero of dreams asleep to this day and still the wands have not been returned the first ones are not immortal you see though they are exceedingly longlived and so they must conserve their lives by suspending them in the sleep during which they do not age and so they sleep hidden away within this very keep dreaming dreams within dreams as they wait for their hoped for but long delayed release much like cthulhu and his spawn from what youve been telling us eldin rumbled and hero thought to himself how clever of the old lad clever or not the keeper seemed offended do you dare compare my good and kind masters to the filthy crawling spawn of cthulhu your good kind weak masters said david hero with the emphasis on weak what weak did you say calm down calm down answered the younger dreamer placatingly surely you can see keeper thats the way it looks why did the nine not go out and find the tenth for themselves recovering the wands and so assuring their safe departure from these regions did they think that going to sleepeven a long long sleepwas going to solve all their problems for them but klarekyam had the wands of power the keeper blusteringly replied against weapons such as the wands how could my masters hope to prevail yknow rumbled eldin the wanderer i think heros right why dont you wake up the nine and let them go find the wands themselves after all this klarekyam must be aeonsdead by now when the first ones wish to be awakened then shall i awaken them they have indicated no such desire no there is a better way and were it said hero with a sigh right brian lumley correct using the first wand you shall seek out the others and return them to the keep and how might we use the first wand when we cant even touch the damned thing eldin roared havent we already explained that now it was the keepers turn to be placating calm calm he said you shall see what you shall see now then gather up all the small pieces of metal which once were your sword eldin and hero you help him muttering the dreamers obeyed collecting the fused fragments of eldins blade and placing them on a large handkerchief laid out on the floor when they had gathered together all that they could find the keeper said now place the sundered melted bits of sword on the gray metal plate where you stood for your examination good now stand back well back the dreamers obeyed and once more the wheel of globes began to spin this time the hazy tube which sprang from ceiling to floor was of a golden hue which turned the room a glowing yellow in less than a minute the job was done and eldins sword reconstituted lay on the gray metal plate shinier and newer than ever before the dreamers had beheld it grumbling to himself to cover his amazement eldin advanced and retrieved his blade it seems to be lighter he said swishing the sword through the air you must have missed some of the bits replied the keeper but i assure you that the sword is stronger than ever it was also it is now filled with the aura of the first ones only touch thinistor udds wand with that sword and the wand will give you no more trouble oh eldin seemed doubtful indeed and now you must be about the quest we havent said well do it yet reminded hero but you will the keepers voice seemed to chuckle hero of dreams whats to stop us agreeing to your quest eldin queried and then when were free of the keep going our own way and he nimbly sidestepped heros swift dig at his ribs very little it would seem the keeper replied then continued now listen when you have thinistors wand simply dangle it from a thread like a northstone and it will point out the quickest route to the second wand when you have acquired the second wand then matters will take their own course and is that all asked hero when it appeared that the keeper was through speaking it is only remember to return the wands of power to the keep when all is done what could be easier his voice faded away and the lights began slowly to dim in another moment the massive silver door hissed up into the ceiling and the exit lay open to the gaze of the two dreamers without more ado as the lights further dimmed and began to go out they made their exit part the descent chapter i early morning sunshine covered the plateau and made long brown shadows the three adventurers were outside the entrance to the late thinistor udds cave their necessaries split into three packs two fairly large ones and one much smaller for aminza eldin the wanderer sat on a rock tenderly examining a naked arm where he had rolled up the sleeve of his jacket what in all the dreamlands are you so sore about david hero spoke to the older dreamer what are a few hairs to a walking doormat like you a few hairs he saysa few eldin rumbled volcanically hells bells ladthe damned thing nearly singed my arm off only touch the wizards wand with your sword says the keeper and like a damned fooli did hero grinned as he slitted his eyes against the sun and peered at eldins hairless arm well he was right wasnt he weve had no more trouble have we your sword drew the wands last blast and that was that and look and he held up a length of twine with the wand suspended at its end and it works too said aminza see how it points the way brian lumley well er yes said hero somewhat less happily but there might be something a little wrong there i mean the damn things pointing north sure enough the wands knob not only pointed north but was actually tilted upwardup the final slope to the spot where eldin and hero had confronted the demon god yibbtstll somethings a little wrong there mimicked eldin rolling down his sleeve ill say there is just over that final ridge theres a damn great cliff that looks like it goes down to dreamlands core and thats our quickest route to the next wand is it well i say we head for theelys ebraim borak owes us a deal of moneyand i owe him a couple of broken ribs at least was that cliff really unclimbable aminza asked of the two men cant really say mused hero it looked a bit tough ill admit but remember i wasnt looking at it from a very comfortable angle and there again a lot of things are a far sight easier in dreams thats as it may be eldin rumbled but they can be a damn sight harder too ill grant you one thing though theres never been anything easier than falling off a cliff hmm frowned hero his eyes following the knob of the wand where it aimed itself at the rocky ridge he twirled it once or twice at the end of its twine but each time he did so the wand quickly steadied to its previous position and always it pointed to the ridge well said aminza whats it to be or are we going to stay here forever youre a plucky lass aminza said hero with feeling but i reckon eldins right if it was just the two of us perhaps wed give it a try but with you along its a tough climb sure enough its theelys then she said looks that way eldin rumbled climbing to his feet hero of dreams j disappointment clearly audible in his voice they shouldered their packs and turned south since we already know the way the older dreamer continued i suppose wed do well simply to retrace our route what do you say hero eh the younger dreamer tugged distractedly at the wand frowned then let go of the thing and stepped back in amazement suspended in midair floating free and dangling its thread beneath it the wand hovered four feet above the rocky ground and stubbornly pointed north up the steep slope to the ultimate crest well ill be hero started gritting his teeth and taking both hands to the wand strain as he might the wand would not budge as soon as hero took a pace or two up the slope however then the wand went along meekly enough a monkeys uncle gasped eldin putting the finishing touch to his friends incomplete comment well heres a fine thing we wont go north and the wand wont come south what now we could leave it here suggested aminza well get nothing else out of ebraim borak if we do said hero except a deal of satisfaction when i break his arm growled eldin or the girl said and waited for a response from her friends from the waking world are we to come out of this utterly emptyhanded asked hero jutting his chin aggressively with nothing but a few tonds between us added eldin the three formed a triangle about the wand where it pointed up the slope and quivered like a dog on a leash hero licked his lips ail our hearts could ever desire the keeper said brian lumley and a fine adventurous quest in the bargain eldin rumbled aminza stamped her little foot and laughed why it couldnt have worked out better if youd planned it this way she cried the two men peered at each other and grinned wolfishly whats life without a taste of danger now and then asked eldin hero sucked a finger and held it up testing the wind north it is he said and they turned their faces up the slope up until now the cliff face had not been too difficult though difficult enough and the climbers had made good use of the weathered faces many hand and footholds where the suns warmth had dried them out the summit had long since disappeared into a misthazed sky and in places the cliff was concave which meant that the three must remain securely roped together for long periods aminza had proved to be a good natural climber which helped matters but hero and eldin could have progressed a lot faster on their own now they had found themselves a wide ledge on which to rest and eldin had brewed a pot of tea im so tired said aminza stretching her body to ease its aches and pains its the climbing eldin rumbled it gets you that way when youre not used to it to hero he said how deep are we do you think hero shrugged he gazed out and down into deeps which were gray and swirling full of heaving vapors look at it down there youd almost believe you could walk on it and it seems to get thicker the deeper we go as to how deep we arewe could be deeper he answered a trifle grudgingly weve come down maybe six hero of dreams seven thousand feet but it must be well into the afternoon by now we can only go half as far on the next leg for then aminza will be exhausted which means that if we dont strike bottom in the next three hours or so well be stuck on the cliff face for the night said aminza with a shudder and its all my fault not at all my dear eldin gently rumbled placing an arm about her shoulders where they sat dangling their feet in empty air dont blame yourself lass for we all knew what we were doing when we set out and anyway it wont be the first time hero and i have faced nightfall on the face of a cliff well make out all right providing it doesnt rain said hero and there are no visits from stray gaunts and no rock falls and he glanced ominously upward aminza began quietly to snivel a little and eldin glared at hero where he leaned his back against the cliff hero cast his eyes to the heavens gritted his teeth and silently ruttutted for a moment then said eldins right dont blame yourself aminza its not every girl could have done half so well now sip your tea and take it easy well rest ourselves here for a halfhour or so then carry on down if only it wasnt so misty down there we might be able to see the bottom at least the wand doesnt seem to have any doubts look and he dangled the wand from its thread and showed how it pointed northward into space and slightly downward into the everthickening mists below somewhere down there hero nodded in the direction the wand pointed well find the second wand eventually umm said eldin well for the immediate future ill be happy simply to get down off this damned cliff in the meantimebreak out a piece of meat eh david lets have something to chew on brian lumley half an hour later they set off again and at first the going was a lot easier they followed a route which moved to the left as it descended and there were plenty of hand and footholds after about an hour however they began to hear the rush of water and the rock of the face rapidly grew slimy the very last of the thaw grunted eldin examining the smooth knob of a huge boulder which stuck out from the cliffs face close behind him hero said yes and its not only making the going nasty but thickening the mist too turning his head to look back he said are you all right girl aminza nodded her face shiny and damp as the rocks she bravely tried a smile but it didnt quite come off her arms felt like lead and she just couldnt seem to draw air quickly enough im fine she gasped meanwhile eldin had embraced the great boulder which blocked his way with his huge arms wrapped about it slowly he slid his chest over its surface toward the far side there the narrow ledge they had been following continued its steep downward route when he was safely across he moved on a pace or two until he could see around a sharp comer in the face of the cliff were in trouble now he groaned and thats for sure whats up hero queried stretching himself to the limit to embrace the great round rock a moment later he was beside eldin and they peered together in silent dismay at the scene that awaited them beyond the corner of the cliff it was a great waterfall and its rush was a tumult of sound now that the cliffs face no longer protected their ears below the mists boiled and tossed the rock ahead hero of dreams was sheer and glistened slickly it looked utterly impossible and yet as heros ears became used to the roar of the cataract he began to grin listen he shouted above the roaring of falling water do you hear it hear what cried eldin in return why the water striking bottom hero shouted back weve almost made it if we go back a little way and take a different route we should be down within minutes at worst we should find ourselves on a different sort of face a slope perhaps at the bottom of the cliff grinning the two looked back along the ledge three or four paces away aminza was clambering over the great boulder that blocked her path she had not the reach in her arms to skirt the rock in the manner of her friends even as the two watched her they saw the boulder tilt outward from the cliff its hold weakened by the steady seep of moisture the great rock was unable to take her weight aminza eldin croakedand a split second later she gave a little shriek as the boulder tilted farther yet and seemed almost to shrug her into space for an instant it was as if she floated gently downwardbefore her plummeting weight snatched first hero then eldin from the slippery ledge tied together they fell a giant bolas whirling in air mist sucked their rushing bodies in savored them coughed them out onto a surface resilient as water it was water a deep cold lake deep they sank then fought weakly for the surface gasping as they bobbed like corks in a froth of wavelets they saw first the sheer wall of rock going up into mist then to their right a tiny shingle bay luxuriant with tall femlike trees brian lumley they swam and in a matter of minutes which seemed like hours felt the sloping bottom beneath their weary feet still roped together they dragged themselves up onto the pebbly beach and there they lay for some time drinking deep of the damp air and thanking their lucky stars that they yet lived whirlpool chapter ii between the nodding trees far down on the beach aminza could see her friends from the waking world where they worked naked except for tiny loincloths lashing together a raft from fallen trunks of the giant hollow reedy trees back here in the cave they had found overhung by the mighty cliff and protected from the dank air by thick foliage she dried out their clothes before a roaring fire and watched the two as they struggled mistwreathed lashing trunks together with tough rubbery vines they had been at it for hours now and must surely be worn out but still they straggled on their clothes were almost dry and aminza completely naked wanted to be dressed before the men had finished their raft she watched their activity for a while longer then tried her clothes for dryness yet again she had long since given up the flimsy garments which thinistor udd had made her wearhad done so before the decision had been taken to set out upon this present guestand now her clothes were of much the same cut as those of her companions she had found them in one of thinistors storage caves and doubtless they had belonged ho brian lumley to some small adventurer sent into the mountains by ebraim borak but aminza did not like to think on the fate of their previous owner as she dressed herself she was pleased that the soft leather of her jacket and short trousers in no way disguised her softlyrounded femininity having dressed she turned the steaming clothes of the two men where they hung on a rope stretched across the width of the cave then peered once more from the caves mouth through fringing foliage she saw the two step back from their work hands on hips saw them nod and grin in a selfsatisfied manner the raft was ready as they began to strain and heave dragging their craft a little higher up the beach aminza put eldins tiny kettle on the fire and began to boil water for all that their exertions would be keeping them warm the lake was cold and the mist penetrating they would be ready for a cup of tea and a bite to eat then a night in the warmth of the cave stretched out before a crackling popping fire with shadows walking on the walls tomorrow would be a new day thinking these thoughts aminza carefully wrapped eldins firestones in a scrap of dry skin which she placed in his waterproof pouch she yawned as she watched the pair shambling up the beach shoulders slumped yes they looked bone weary and she could well understand that it had been a hard day indeed now night was falling and up above the mists the stars would soon be coming out in the clear skies of dreamland who could say but that tomorrow night they might be well away from here sailing under those very stars guided ever onward by the pointing knob of thinistor udds wand with a glad little sigh aminza began to lay out fragrant beds of firedried ferns hero of dreams hi morning came in an aching of bones and a throbbing of protesting muscles it came early for hero and when the others awakened from their dreams within dreams he was already returning from the misted beach with a catch of three fine fishes thus when they pushed their raft off an hour or so later then bellies were full and their spirits high in no time at all they drew away from die base of the great cliff and emerged from the mists into brilliant sunshine a huge blue lake now opened before them which looked so clean fresh and unspoiled that hero was prompted to state you know i wouldnt be at all surprised to discover that were the first dreamers who ever chanced this way eldin sorrowfully shook his great head ah no my young friend truth is ive heard of this lake before a vast blue lake somewhere beyond the great bleak mountains yes and hero prompted eh grunted eldin well this is it and thats all why what else should there be the older dreamer shrugged but he frowned a little and tugged at his beard then he snapped his fingers and grinned ah yes there was something else its said that the lake feeds a great swamp somewhere beyond thalarion what cried hero but how can that be thalarion lies in a different region of dreamland entirely oh no i cant see that at all perhaps i have it wrong growled eldin and he shrugged again aminza had been quiet for some little time but now she spoke up this is a queer lake sure enough she said but thinistors wand is stranger by far does it imagine were fishes dyou think brian lumley they could see what she meant dangling from a line strung between two upright poles the wand still pointed north but its downwardpointing angle was steeper than ever before could it be they wondered that the second wand lay deep beneath the waters of this vast lake what makes you say the lake is queer hero asked of aminza well she answered for one thing its too quietyou know what i mean eldin nodded patiently its quiet yes of course it is but the sun is shining bright enough nothing queer about that aminza shuddered no she said thats not what i meant its an unhealthy quiet the air is far too still theres no wind at all its like the lull before a storm and for another thing yes hero prompted aminza sighed you stopped paddling some time ago she pointed out and yet were still making a good forward speed eh said eldin how can you tell i dropped a length of twine over the side she explained with a twig tied at its end the twine is now at full stretch and the twigs bobbing along nicely in our wake a current said hero the hair starting to rise at the back of his neck but whoever heard of a lake with a current and look cried eldin pointing a shaking finger at the steadily darkening water where wavelets had sprung up from nowhere to collide and froth in a foamy spray and thats not all yelled aminza as a wind suddenly blew up and snatched at the hair and clothing of the three just look at thinistors wand now they lookedand saw the difference at once the wand hero of dreams no longer pointed north now its knob held waveringly to a northeasterly direction and even as they watched it turned more fully to the east not only that but its angle had grown much more steep so that it pointed downward at some sixty degrees directly into the lake three pairs of eyes followed the pointing knob and three sets of hackles rose as the dreamers spotted some hundred yards away a circular area of lake where the water shone dark blue and threw up a hazy mist of spray whirlpool cried hero as the raft tilted a little in the suddenly rushing water were caught in a whirlpool hang on for dear life roared eldin here aminza let me tie you downand hang onto our supplies whatever you do feverishly they worked as the raft turned about the dark core of the descending chute they lay flat and spread their bodies across the deck lashing themselves and their bundles securely to the heaving members of their pliant vessel and all the time the raft tilted farther onto its side and rushed faster and faster about the central funnel soon from where they lay flat on its deck as the raft churned wildly round and round the three could look down the slope of the whirlpool into its very throat and now the turning circle of the raft was such that they grew dizzy with its whirling thinistors wand too still suspended from its line was obliged to spin in order to aim its knob constantly into the center of the maelstrom pointing out with some demon instinct the shortest route to its closest contemporary which seemed most certainly to lie at the bottom of the lake and again the raft tilted so that eldin and hero gasped aloud and aminza gave a little scream as the deck became nearvertical thena final jerk and a tiltand an allenveloping darkness as the raft slid down down down the great and glassy throat of the whirlpool brian lumley the three knew that this was the endand so were astonished to discover that it was not for after some time the raft tilted again regaining something of its former stability and yet again until it rushed along horizontally though still it spun in crazy gyrations upon its own axis now the damp and swirling air was filled with an eerie luminosity a sort of ignis fatuus that danced upon the rafts logs upon the bodies and faces of its passengers and their bundles and upon the walls and roof of the stalactitedraped tunnel through which they now raced at a fearful speed for indeed they had reached the lakes sinkholehad reached and passed through it into the mighty sump which drained the lakeand now they were bound for some unknown sea of dreamlands nethercaves wherein the waters of the whirlpool must surely empty and at last hero remembered eldins words that the lake fed a great swamp somewhere beyond thalarion perhaps it was so after all for space in dreamlands was often paradoxical as time itself and distances could be more than deceiving sick with the motion of the raft the three adventurers lay with lolling heads and prayed for death or whatever other future might await them anydiing but the continuation of this nauseous ride they watched the rough ceiling of the tunnel rush by festooned with stone daggers often mere inches away from their faces and tiiey felt doubly ill in the rotten and unnatural glow that lit their way as they rocketed along seemingly through one of hells deepest bowels then a light showed ahead the clear light of day as opposed to the already fading blue luminescence of the tunnel and as the dim white glow became a glare so the tunnel widened and the speed of the raft slackened a little minutes passed and the disk of light ahead grew larger then ex hero of dreams panded in a final mad burst of speed and was upon them in a moment and out into open air they shot propelled by a veritable spout of water skipping over scummy depths like a stone spun by some titan child each bounce jarring and bruising them until their bodies felt pulped and finally the raft came to rest in tall reeds and lolling bullrushes for a long time the world turned round and round and hero suspected that his brain must be permanently damaged it must have been shaken loose inside his skull a quarter of a mile away a tall cliff loomed spouting water from a resurgence near its base this was the emergence of that subterranean river which had spat them out like a pebble from a slingshot feeling a little strength returning hero loosened the lashings that still held him fast and sat up he was immediately sick into die reeds and rushes eldin too was now conscious cursing and groaning where he lay fumbling at his fastenings hero when he had recovered from his nausea went to his assistance freed him then turned weakly to aminza a great bump on her head was turning blue but her bosom rose and fell with a steady reassuring rhythm well hero groaned and held his head for a moment and this must be your great swamp somewhere in thalarions hinterland so it would seem answered the older dreamer tenderly examining his mass of bruises as life slowly flowed back into them the two questers stared about at the swamps desolation some clear water existed between the raft and the cliff with its great jet of water as for the rest it stretched away an endless morass of dead and shrouded trees reeds and weeds nodding bullrushes and gloomy papyrus strange orchids grew in brian lumley the mushy stumps of rotted trees vines hung everywhere dipping knobby thin fingers in scummy soupy pools full of morbid plant life the lake most certainly was but of fleshandblood creatures there was never a sign then staring into weedchoked distances and feeling the heat of the noonday sun upon their heads the dreamers heard aminzas waking crya strange little choking cry and turned to her a green vine had crept up over the lip of the raft and was tightening about the girls throat the tree chapter iii with a cry of horror hero threw himself down beside aminza slashing at the vine with his knife when he had hacked the thing loose from her he sliced at her fastenings and hauled her to her feet propping her against one of the rafts upright poles then he picked up the severed piece of vine shuddering at its twisting and twining in his hand its underside was lined with tiny green suckers which opened and closed and pulsed in hideous hybrid deaththroes eldin snatched the thing from him and gave a cry of loathing as he tossed it away from the raft into the morass and a second cry as the scummy surface instantly erupted in a green writhing of hungry life the whole swamp was a seething den of carnivorous creepers and tentacled plants what in the name of eldin choked what lunatic of a mind nightmared this lot hero wasted no words he snapped long branches from a driedup tree standing close to the raft and handed one to his burly companion get poling he snarled head for the open water there aminza still disoriented hung on grimly to the now brian lumley wobbly uprights as hero and eldin used their branches to propel the raft through the morass no sooner was their craft moving however than a dozen more of the suckered vines came snaking hungrily over the edges of its platform hero threw down his branch on the deck and whipped out his curved blade razor sharp the kledan sword severed wherever it touched and in another moment the raft broke through into open water no use heading for the cliff hero panted snatching up his pole wed be smashed to bits by that great spout of water run parallel with the cliff until we find a bank desperately the men poled through waters which were quite shallow and as they began to make some headway so aminza stated at least were going in the right direction according to old thinistors wand that is looking back hero saw that she was rightthat the knob of the suspended wand pointed straight aheadbut he also saw something which was far less gladdening following them from the seething mass of tangled vines and bullrushes winding after them through the scummy water came a tapering snakelike member which was thick as his wrist pole faster he cried but in another moment the great vine had reared up out of the water and lashed itself to eldins leg mercifully it also trapped one of the rafts uprights so that it was unable to pull the older dreamer overboard heros sword gleamed in the hot sunlight as he once again tossed his pole down and leaped to his friends aid his blade and eldins chopped into the vine together severing it in two places so that two great lengths of it flopped about the deck as the damaged parent limb thrashed the scummy waters to a foam in their wake mouthing curses the weary dreamers kicked the writh hero of dreams ing suckerlined lengths of vine overboard and yet again took up their poles behind them the entire jungle of living green throbbed and tossed in a sort of fury and despite their bruised and battered bodies the men needed no urging to toil frantically and put as much distance as possible between themselves and the enraged denizens of the swamp but by now they were clear of the morass proper and the water ahead seemed calm and harmless enough half an hour later they beached the raft on a grassy bank where the cliffs were split by the bed of a driedout stream here as soon as they had recovered from their longsustained ordeal of terror they might easily scale the cliffs and be on their way again eldin made a fire well away from the waters edge and brewed tea while aminza took dried meat and figs from a pack for his part hero spent some time recovering various bits of rope from the raft and pushing its now sadly defunct members back into the water some of them might find a mooring somewhere and take root after eating the three adventurers found themselves unbearably weary but not so tired that they were willing to sleep within sight of the swamp so they shouldered their packs and made their way up the bed of the dead stream until they reached a place where shrubs grew in abundance on the sides of the gorge and they could easily climb to the top for all that it was a safe simple climb they were just about all in by the time they stood on the summit now they found themselves on a gently undulating plain of short grasses and flowers bushes and shrubs that stretched away southward into low distant hills finding themselves a wild apple tree for shade they made down their beds in the warm semitropical afternoon and were all three asleep in the twinkling of an eye brian lumley they awakened together from dreams within dreams to a sky already turning darkblue with the stealthy encroachment of evening they sipped tea and ate an apple each then shouldered their packs and walked in moon and starlight across plains which were soft beneath their feet with a springiness that somehow eased their bumps and bruises and always the wand pointed the way ahead just suppose this is thalarion said hero after a while which i suppose it is what do you know about it first off eldin answered i know that this isnt thalarion but you said hero began i said that the swamp lies in the hinterlands beyond thalarion said eldin thalarion isnt a countryits a city i have heard of that city said aminza in a quiet voice holding tightly to eldins great arm its monarch is the eidolon lathi and what pray asked hero is an eidolon an image an idea a flight of fancy answered eldin i think an idea hero snorted curling his lip in a certain way a flight of fancy ruling a city it sounds nonsensical to me ah but youre young in the ways of dreams lad said eldin shaking his head in the moonlight when will you learn that a nonsense is only something you dont understand or havent experienced its your own ignorance a faceless gaunt is nonsensicaluntil theres one looking right at you so is a vine with suckersuntil you get one wrapped around your leg i have heard other things of thalarion said aminza even more quietly im not sure i want to know of them said hero if hero of dreams your tiny littie whisper is anything to go by im sure theyll be unpleasant say on lass said eldin and take no notice of him forewarned is forearmed they say i think thalarion is demoncursed she said hero stopped walking turned and took her by the shoulders aye ive heard that said before his brow wrinkled though i cant seem to remember where or when aminza frowned back at him and the stars shone in her big eyes also she continued its said the eidolon lathi rules over a hive of horror now eldin took hold of her he shook her a little but gently now now now he rumbled we dont even know if were going to thalarion yetor even where the city lies were following thinistors wand thats all lets forget thalarion eh suggested hero look its a beautiful night and weve a way to go well see the sun up breakfast on wood pigeon eggs sleep till noon then carry on to journeys end what say you i say answered eldin squinting ahead i say were heading straight for that tree there the one with the moon standing above it ahead atop a low rise the topmost branches of a tree showed as a black silhouette against a blueblack sky full of stars hero stared then said there must be something wrong with my eyes plainly the tree stands atop the hill or just beyond it and yet somehow the perspective is all wrong its just an effect of the night said eldin no aminza shook her head i can see what david means look the outline of the hill is sharp but the silhouette of the tree seems indistinct distant i wonder why thalarion was forgotten now in the light of this new mystery in silence the three trudged up the hillside and soon brian lumley stood upon the summit well theres one question answered grunted eldin and he whistled his amazement a mile perhaps two miles away the tree stood on a plain that dipped gently down toward a distant sea its shape was that of a beautiful brandy glass but it towered at least a third of a mile into the night sky i have heard of just such a tree said eldin wisely as they made their way down the slope of the hill to the plain but of course you have hero yawned mightily is there anything in all dreamland that you havent heard of dont knock experience lad the older dreamer growled anyway i was at a banquet in ulthar some years before we met this was toward the end of the bad days if i remember correctly the feast was in honor of a pair of mighty dreamers men of the waking world indeed of many worldsnamed titus crow and henrilaurent de marigny ah now i have heard of them said hero good and now that youre satisfied with the authenticity of my tale perhaps youll let me finish it well the drink was flowing and everyone was in gay mood and i might tell you that many of dreamlands greatest men were there and when all the speechmaking was done then they got this crow fellow to tell a few tales of his trip to elysia and what he saw there elysia said aminza the home of the elder gods the same answered eldin this crow is a very special fellow you see and he has a special place in elysia whenever he desires to go there hmm mused hero that would offend the vanity of the first ones a bit i fancy a mere man allowed into elysia hero of dreams well possiblybut as i said this crow chap is a rather special fellow anyway he told of a tree just like this one up ahead growing in a vast garden in elysia moreover he said that the tree was sentient it was intelligent and full of love and beauty there what do you think of that but before eldins companions could answer all three adventurers stumbled from green grass underfoot onto a powdery surface of crumbling soil and in the moonlight they could see that this most peculiar path led straight as the flight of an arrow to the foot of the green giant rearing its massive trunk and branches less than half a mile away across the plain moreover thinistors wand continued to point in precisely that direction and you think this tree could be related to that other great tree in elysia do you asked hero as they followed the sandy path toward the shadow of the giant eldin shrugged cant really see how thats possible he answered a pity said hero after all weve been through i could do with a little love and joy and beauty soon the moon began to disappear behind the great trees bulk and then the dreamers trod more warily in starlight and occasional moonbeams and as they passed into the shadow of the tree so a hush fell over them and they stopped talking and even breathed more quietly now the tree towered overhead and they passed under its outermost branches making never a sound as their paces grew shorter and slower cool hanging tendrils touched them as they passed beneath and softedged leaves as long as a man softly brushed them the gloom seemed full of weird energy an almost electrical excitement as if they tiptoed across the chest of some sleeping behemoth beyond imagination then aminza tripped on a root and gave a little cry as brian lumley she flew into eldins armsand immediately the tree came to life who goes there demanded a throbbing tremulous voice from nowherefrom everywhereas leaves lashed and retreated and tendrils groped uncertainly in darkness what treachery is this does lathi send out her termen to steal my tender leaves under cover of night speak i say wildeyed the dreamers stared about in leafy gloom and in another moment strong tendrils had found them and snatched them up like bobbins on threads passing them higher and higher into the trees heart suddenly hero discovered one of his arms to be free and he whipped out his curved sword eldin heard the hiss of his friends blade unsheathing and saw its gleam in a stray beam of moonlight even as they were rushed aloft he called out stay your hand lad or youll doom us all its a long way down if he drops us besides he wont harm us at least you dont think so hero breathlessly finished it for him and a second later all three adventurers were dumped without ceremony into the crotch of a great branch a thousand feet above the ground the trees tale chapter iv no sooner did hero feel the bark of the branch beneath him than he leapt to his feet hells teeth he yelled blindly waving his sword ive really had enough this time eldin sucked in by a whirlpool and sicked up in a swampvictimized by vampire vines and chased by frenzied foliageand now tackled by a titan tree damn it to hell wheres it all to end right here and now if you dont stop dancing about eldin replied with feeling have you any idea how high we are yes do sit down david said aminza crossly he doesnt like you stamping about like that i dont give a damn what the old duffer likes or doesnt like hero shouted i i didnt mean eldin she cut him off and eldin gave a pained snort in the dark eh hero asked suddenly deflated then who did you mean he sat down beside his friends and peered at them in the leafy darkness now that his eyes were growing accustomed to the gloom he could see that slender green creepers enwrapped them and huge soft leaves trembled above them like great listening ears brian lumley if youll only sit still a minute and put your sword away hell talk to you too said eldin damned if id converse with someone who threatened to cut my tendrils off you havent got any bloody tendrils cried hero but he nevertheless sheathed his sword no sooner was the blade out of sight than several tendrils fell down from above and settled tentatively on his shoulders a great leaf unfurled close by and brushed his face at first the touch of these appendages made him start at which the leaf and tendrils immediately drew back but as soon as he settled down they approached once more and at last he was permitted to know the source of that throbbing yet ethereal voice he had heard down on the ground ah said the voice but you are an angry oneand therefore you are not of lathis brood for they are without emotion no you are a man of the waking world as is your companion you are a pair of wandering dreamers adventurers in earths dreamland and the girlshe is a real girl hero took in all the voice said but was at first too astounded to answer for he knew now that he heard the trees voice in his mindthat its messages were sent to him telepathically through the tendrilswhich would have been an amazing trick even for a wizard let alone a ree and the tree could hear his mind as well as it would hear the spoken word oh im no wizard david hero im the tree thats all but i am a rather special tree and yet again hero was stumped for what does one say to a tree aminza on the other hand was positively voluble and full of questions but who are you she asked out loud and how did you get here and what did you mean about the eidolon lathistermencoming to steal your leaves hero of dreams slowly my child slowly said the tree stroking her face with a great downy leaf its a wonder ive not altogether forgotten how to talk to people for my visitors have been few indeed in the hundreds of years since the eidolon lathi built her city on the southern coast there once was a time when id meet oh a dozen wanderers in any given yearaye even a few from the waking world but all of that is finished now the trees branches soughed in a great sigh before he continued a pity for men are full of wonder now now all has changed what has changed asked aminza and what is it that makes you so sad ah no my child answered the tree my problems are insoluble and therefore can wait first you must tell me how you are come here and why and then say how i might help you for i sense that you have troubles at least as great as mine at the trees invitation in bits and pieces the three then told their story and when finally they were done it was as if the tree applauded bravo he told them well done and so you have come this far and you follow the way pointed out by thinistors wand and so inventive and so daring you are wonderful creatures and the size of you so tinybut you forge ahead like giantsas i myself should go if things were as they used to be come come said eldin gruffly as the tree lapsed into a troubled silence weve told you our tale as you requested and there doesnt really seem to be a lot you can do to help us so why not unburden yourself on us we can listen as well as you you know and who knows there may even be some way hi which we can be of assistance brian lumley once we know the problem hero conservatively answered and so the tree set about to tell his tale my forebears he began grew on a remote world far away in space and time and their world was vast and there were many of them indeed they were as a forest longlived the very oldest of earths great trees are as saplings by comparison there came a time however when our world began to die as all worlds must in the end the air grew chill and the ground froze with the winter of the world and spring nevermore came one by one the race of great trees died and sheets of ice moved inexorably across the whole planet on one small island in what had been the tropics in an acreage sufficient only to sustain them stood the three last trees in the heart of their topmost branches they tended their lifeleaves and mourned the new trees which might have been but now were doomed and each day the dying suns rays were fewer and the cold more penetrating then by some miracle of chance a ship of the elder gods found the world of my forebears the ship bore one of the chosen ones of he elder gods who was a man he was the white wizard ardatha eh also the last of his people which had been great in primal putha and he had found his way to elysia alone and unaided for which reason the elder gods adopted him and now because he was restless and a wanderer by nature he ventured out from elysia among the worlds of space and so came to the world of the trees there ardatha ell found the last trees all three of them and there he remained while they withered and died for he was much too late to save them and he comforted them in their dying which is why the race of man will always be held dear in the hearts of great trees wherever they are found hero of dreams and before they died the trees asked a further boon of ardatha ell that he take their lifeleaves with him on his voyage and plant them in warm and gentle worlds where there would be men and women to talk to he agreed and when the three trees shed their lifeleaves and settled down to die gathered up the golden lifeleaves and bore them to his ship thus when ardatha ell left that frozen world circling under its cinder sun he carried with him the entire future of the race of great trees now eventually he returned to elysia home of the elder gods and mere he planted one of the three lifeleaves in the mountaingirt gardens of nymarrah where it grew into the most fortunate tree i cannot swear to this however but such are the rumors ive heard over the centuries of the second tree i can tell you nothing for no word of him has since reached me but i assume that indeed ardatha ell planted him also and of course i myself am the third tree whose lifeleaf the white wizard planted here in earths dreamland all those thousands of years ago on his way back to elysia now i nurture my own lifeleaf which you may see if you desire against the time of my dying when i will release it to drift on the winds of dream to some lovely land there to live and grow in splendor and alasthe day of my dying may not be too far away the tree paused come now cried hero suddenly aghast at the thought of this magnificent creatures dying explain yourself what can possibly harm you here on this verdant plain and why would any one or thing desire to harm you in the first place why indeed whispered aminza for you must be the very gentlest of beings patience my children signed the tree in a soughing of branches and let me finish my tale brian lumley when first ardatha ell planted me here the plain was warm and green and lovely even as it is now with one exception of which i shall speak presently my rooting was lengthy however and centuries passed before the great network of roots which supports me became established even then nothing of me showed above the surface for my lifeleaf had long returned to dust and it was just as well that i remainedso to speakdormant for all that long time for in earths waking world the northmen were in their ascendance and they were fierce dreamers they brought with them snow and ice and mammoths and for a time it seemed that i too like my long dead parent tree must shrivel and die in the cold which the northern dreamers brought with them but at length other dreamers came from warmer lands of the waking world and gradually the climate of the dreamlands swung full circle then i put up my trunk and first leaves and drank of the hot sun and cool rains and drowsed in the heady nights of this earths dreamland and i was favored here so that i grew quickly and began my long slow walk your walk gasped hero incredulously a giant like you and so firmly rooted indeed the tree answered why you yourself have followed the road i took the path of dry and crumbly soil rumbled eldin the dead track we followed from the hills to the north correct said the tree in a nodding of leaves that was my road i have walkedhowever slowlyin the manner of all great trees for that is how giants such as we survive so great are we that the nourishment we take from the soil rapidly deplenishes it which means that we must move on or perish and once the walk is begun it may only end in the days of our dying for ten thousand hero of dreams years and fifty miles i have walked less than one inch every day and now my journey is almost at an end but why cried aminza are you grown old no child not that the tree chuckled however sadly am a mere youth in the number of my years what then growled eldin why must your walk end here because of thalarion the tree answered unable to mask a certain bitterness from the three adventurers but there they are so many and i am only one and what is my life compared to so many of theirs nor shall i truly die for all of my memories the memories of my entire race are locked in my lifeleaf what of thalarion asked hero fascinated with the trees tale how may the life of thalarions peoples so drastically affect your own i will explain said the tree and presently continued i have told you of my walk its mechanics need not trouble you but as i move along so i send my roots on aheaddeep in the earth often for distances of many milesseeking pastures which are favorable to me of course this is a long and tedious process certainly it would seem so to you also i have my tendrils many of which are longer than you could possibly imagine these i send out over the surface seeking ways between hills and shallow fords across the rivers which may lie in my path already i have forded one such river and passed through one such range of hills to the south beyond the last hills and standing on the shore there towers thalarion the eidolon lathis city some years ago knowing nothing of lathi or her city i sent my rootlets there my long tendrils also my rootlets discovered the earth to be dry dead and honeycombed with strange tunnels and my tendrils found the city where brian lumley it sprouts above ah and the denizens of that city they found my tendrils the lathis brood you see eats only green things and ray tendrils were green and tender when my tendrils were cut and i felt the pain then i drew them back to heal them but in so doing i alerted the eidolon lathi to my presence and from that day to this i have known no peace for it would seem that of all the flesh of all the green things in earths dreamland lathi and her people prefer mine thats monstrous hero burst out leaping to his feet well not permit that why there are green growing things galore on this plain and you say they cannibalize you indeed the tree sighed but please sit down hero sal but the muscles jumped in his face and his agitationthat of his companions toowas an almost tangible force in the forestgloomy air daily they come the tree continued in their hundreds they come and i bow down my branches so they only take the older leaves which are dying but i can feel in them the desire the lust for my younger leaves and tender shoots and ever that lust grows stronger when do they come when roared eldin unable to contain himself a moment longer damn it theyve a surprise in store they come in the morning after the sunrise and always they leave before noon and such is their harvesting that i am no longer strong enough to protest it they sap my strength you see forcing me constantly to grow new buds with which to replace the older stolen leaves and if i did not bow down my branches why then they would steal whatever they could reach and i would be devastated and they know you for an intelligent lovely being hero of dreams these people asked aminza horrified do they speak to you they know it the tree answered and they speak to me aye to give me their orders and tell me to bend to them are you telling us that men do this thing hero cried in outrage and disbelief ah said the tree they are men yes of a sort but not real men not like you they are lathis termen not real men aminza mused and earlier you said that i was a real girl now what did you mean by that i meant what i said answered the tree that you are real while the eidolon lathis handmaidens are not explain that later if you will said hero impatiently but first tell us why you do not fight back after all you have these massive branches and the great tough tendrils that bore us aloft why tree youre a mighty army im a tree the tree sadly answered and trees burn they threatened you with fire aminza gasped suddenly eldin who had been quiet for a while yawned a great yawn that had him stretching his limbs in all directions at once damn im tired he said by way of an apology its all the walking and talking i fancy you know you two if we have a fight on our hands in the morning its best we get some sleep no protested the tree at once you must not fight for my sake and the termen are far too many as for feeling tired that is my fault my leaves breathe air but the air which they give outit is filled with the dust of dreams men may sleep as they never slept before beneath a great tree now in sympathy with eidin aminza and hero found themselves stifling yawns in another moment it was more than they could do to keep their eyes open but this is no bfifan lumlev good at all protested hero as he stretched himself out across the great branch theres so much to talk about to be explained and he yawned again and blinked eyes that refused to stay open aminza lying with her head on eldins massive chest mumbled something quite unintelligible and eldin himself began to snore his snoring was almost volcanic as his waking voice but heros eyes had closed and he did not hear it out of the darkness a great furlined leaf descended covering all but the heads of the three where they lay in their dreams within dreams and not one of them heard the great trees sigh before he too went to sleep the eidolons city chapter v hero awoke with a start and quickly stood up the suns rays from the east penetrated the trees high branches and sent stray beams glancing through leafy shade hero peered down at his companions where they lay and saw that they were rubbing the sleep from their eyes he stretched and stared aboutup and down left and rightat this vast arboreal world which was the tree something had awakened him but what i awakened you said the trees voice in his mind and hero saw the slender sensitive tendrils where they coiled upon his shoulders they are coming lathis termen approach then youd best get us to the ground eldin rumbled climbing to his feet we cant fight them up here you cant fight them at all answered the tree i thought that was understood there will be a hundred of them for each one of you and are we simply to stand and watch it asked aminza i dont think i could bear that you are to leave me said the tree and save yourselves ive known of many wanderers who entered thalarion but none who came out again no you must go brian lumley back the way you came or at least give the city a wide berth before you continue on your quest yes well no sense in arguing said eldin you just put us down right without another word being spoken great creepers fell from on high wrapped about the adventurers where they stood with their packs lifted them from the great branch which they could now see was broad as the height of three tall menand lowered them dizzily into green wells of air they were passed creeper to creeper with never a pause and as they went so the great central stem of the treeits trunkrose up above them like a wall of brown bark more than a hundred feet through its center that huge trunk and at last they stood beside it on firm ground farewell said the tree and go quickly live long lives and be happy one day you may meet my lifeleaf grown into a great tree in his own right and then we shall talk again who said we were leaving eldin growled he faced hero and the two grinned their wolfish grins they shrugged their packs down onto the ground and then swords whispered from sheaths and adrenalin flowed in the veins of the dreamers like fiery quicksilver breathlessly aminza said david give me your long knife no one invited you girl said hero tree take her up again at once you are very brave and very foolish answered the tree as he snatched aminza off her feet but you are right about the girl yours is not the way she should go but i want to i want to cried aminza furiously as the trees tendrils quickly drew her up into the forest of branches above now then eldin rumbled when she was out of sight and sound where are these termen hero of dreams remember said hero we have to try reasoning with them first especially if theyre as many as the tree says he looked up into a vast leafy garden tree where are they on the other side of my trunk the trees fading voice answered as his tendrils withdrew i put you down on this side so that you could make your escape unseen the dreamers stared at one another and hero shrugged he slipped thinistors wand out from inside his jacket she still points to the south he grunted eldin the wanderer nodded if we hadnt met the tree wed be heading for thalarion anyway right lets have a look at the eidolons termen shall we they ran swiftly like large cats round the bole of the treeand pulled up in shock and astonishment on the other side whatever else they were lathis people were not the scurvylooking bunch of degenerates hero and eldin had expected on the contrary so these are lathis termen eh said eldin mouth agape and sword lowered some of em are aye hero answered bigeyed as for the others id guess they are her handmaidens and handylooking maidens they certainly appear to be and he gave a long low whistle for lathis termen were tall handsome and bronzed with a light yellowish tinge like sick gold and her handmaidens more than deserved heros whistle the termen clad only in papery loincloths saw hero and eldin where they stood they saw themand took no notice whatever to hell with that eldin snarled through clenched teeth i dont care how many they are ill not be ignored were not being ignored old lad said hero not at all look here will you more than a dozen of the handmaidens were flocking forward duskyyellow and lovely bran lumley all smiles and big brown eyes and bobbing bosoms they too were clad only in loincloths six or seven went straight to hero and approached him not at all shyly they took his hands and turned him round openly admiring him and touching him and one of them adroitly removed his sword and dropped it to the grass im not at all sure what aminza would say about this grunted eldin as he was given the same treatment now while the termen stood back blankfaced and with their arms crossed on their deep chests the luscious handmaidens laughed and danced and played with the two dreamers leading them a merry chase round and about and tumbling them in the grass soon when they were well away from the trees great trunk eldin made a strange discovery david he called to his friend im beginning to understand what the tree meant when he said the handmaidens werent real girls eh said hero flat on his back where five of the laughing nymphs held him pinned to the ground they look real enough to me he answered his delighted eyes not knowing which bobbing breast to inspect first praps said eldin a strange note in his gruff voice and right handsome toobut real breasts have nipples my lad hero quit his playful struggling and gazed at the naked bosom of the girl who straddled his chest a moment longer he stared then gasped painted on he managed to free an arm and snatched at the girls loincloth which tore like paper in his hand now she was completely naked heros gasp became a hiss of horror as he looked at her stared at her where she sat his chest and then he began to buck his body and thrash his limbs desperately fighting to be free hero of dreams eldin he managed to choke out his friends name nipples arent all theyre missing i know it the old dreamer groaned fighting his own furious fight the rest of the gears absent too now the handmaidens showing their true not inconsiderable strength held the dreamers firmly down those of them not engaged in this began to loosen and tear their clothes from them the termen previously passive now gathered round in a tripleranked circle two hundred strong those on the inside had produced sharp curved knives like scythes the smiles had disappeared now from the faces of the handmaidens and there was something hellish about their gaze as they stripped the dreamers the termen came closer lifting up their scythes and as heros shirt was ripped from him so thinistors wand fell out upon the grass at sight of the wand the halfwomen sprang up wailing from the dreamers and fled through the ranks of crowding termen the termen too had seen the wand and frowns furrowed their brows as their blank eyes stared one of them stepped forward gingerly picked up the wand retired holding it at arms length he immediately set off southward at a trot now the handmaidens came forward again unsmiling and yellow they were suddenly hideous to the eyes of their victims they motioned to hero and eldin that they should stand naked and unarmed the dreamers obeyed and under the watchful eyes of the thronging termen the handmaidens began to bind them this too was a shuddersome thing for the handmaidens used no ropes but bound the adventurers with threads of sticky fibrous fluid which they exuded from tiny pulsating orifices in their fingertips trembling like trapped flies the captives stood and in a very short time they were brian lumley firmly cocooned in shrouding threads as strong and cutting as spun silk when their enmeshment was complete without ceremony the dreamers were bundled over onto their sides and rolled to the outermost area of the trees shade left with four termen to guard them they lay in the grass and glumly watched the monstrous harvesting and as lathis halfpeople worked at the cutting and gathering of the trees great leaves so the two talked of course said eldin grinding his teeth his voice choked with fury and frustration i might have known it have you ever been able to keep your hands off a pretty girlor ghoul as the case may be me cried hero in amazed outrage myself i and who was it discovered that their breasts were pointless and how did he make that discovery i ask myself powers of observation eldin answered indignantly and if you ever mention that to aminza ill shh shushed hero and whispered great oafthey dont know of aminza ah eldin grunted lowing his voice an error but look i dont think these fellows are greatly interested in anythingcertainly not in our conversation they remind me of somethingbut i dont quite know what it is theyre like machines or insects maybe which have always looked like machines to me i know what you mean hero answered and youre right they do seem tike parts of some strange machine each with his own bit to do his own function to perform or a great carnivorous flower perhaps the handmaidens theyre the bright inner colors mat attract the insects the termen theyre the cruel jaws that snap shut what do you think no eldin disagreed more like insects id say he frowned strained and managed to turn his head an inch or hero of dreams two to peer at hero where he lay termen he snorted ltetmites if you ask me termites it was heros turn to frown damn me you could be right humanor halfhumantermites and their queen were told rules a hive of horror but what of the handmaidens undeveloped queens dyou think dunno eldin replied i suppose in a real termites nest theyd be killed off but we cant liken lathis people too much to their insect counterparts i mean theyre a totally different race also this is earths dreamland and you cant go by natural laws and rules here still i think were on pretty much the right track yes i agree said the younger dreamer i mean look at the way theyre segregated there are the gatherers plucking off the trees leaves where hes bowed down his branches and the handmaidens who do their own damned deceptive thing and the guards or soldiers who seem to just stand around with their arms crossed as for the last i imagine theyd be a pretty fierce lot if it ever came to a fight hmm mused eldin drones workers queens and warriors eh a damned funny lot whichever way you look at em here said hero as a thought struck him we know about the socalled handmaidens but what about their blokes i wonder what theyve got up their kiltsif anything eldin shuddered in his cocoon nothing he answered ive already looked its a nasty sight old son i can tell you but how in hell do they they dont not these lads anyway if i knew more about termites i could probably supply the answers pre brian lumley sumably lathi has certain bulls who come equipped so to speak with a bit of luck said hero we might even live long enough to find out actually we might be better off than we think i mean didnt the tree tell us that lathis people were vegetarians ive a friend in ulthar whos a vegetarian eldin answered hes also the finest butcher in the city with that the two lapsed into an uneasy silence and watched the termen at their work while this was going on a pair of tendrils snaked down from the trees outermost branches and reached for the dreamers where they lay the termen who guarded them saw the tendrils however and threatened with meir scythes reluctantly the sensitive green creepers drew back the rest of the morning passed quickly and now the sun stood on high the termen brought up many teams of beasts like tiny shetland ponies and loaded deep piles of huge leaves onto their travois hero and eldin too were bundled onto one such platform and soon the column of termen maids and beasts was heading south in a little less than an hour the tree was left behind and the column wound through a pass in the last range of low domed hills emerging on the southern side where the dreamers found themselves within sight and sound of the sea there between hills and shore where the slope gentled down over earth which was gray leprous and dead stood thalarion at first from afar the few glimpses the dreamers had of the city were blurred and indistinct with the jolting of their travois but as the column neared the city so its structure began to stand out more clearly and now they could see how thalarions legend had grown at least the legends of its architecture and design certainly from afarfrom passing ships perhapsthe shunned city would seem a place of towering spires and hero of dreams awesomely carved turrets but in fact its spires were thin and unevenly built and they only seemed of a great height by virtue of their slender construction close up they looked pitted and crumbly and not at all safe the lower areas of the city were gray sprawling humped and oddly hybrid so that the whole gave the impression of having been designed by men but built by termites said eldin and hero managed to nod his agreement well the older dreamer continued that may answer one question but it most certainly leads to another ohr said hero eldin nodded in his turn what do they want with us hero fought against his bonds for a moment uselessly then did his best to shrug well soon find out old lad he said too damned soon i fancy in a little while the column passed under a domed arch into thalarions musty maze of covered streets and passageways the ponylike beasts with their loads of leaves were led away separately and the handmaidens disappeared along strangely sculpted tunnels toward unknown destinations as for the dreamers they were taken into the very heart of the hive and as they went hero commented on the citys inner illumination a pale blue light which flickered from the domed paperylooking ceilings see he said there are no real lightsno burning lights that is the place is lit by the luminous glow of fungi its quite obvious that the lathis brood dont much care for fire they wouldnt eldin grunted hell the place is built of paper look mere one of the walls of the tunnel had developed a crack from floor to ceiling specialized termen were at work exuding a paste from hugely enlarged fingertips filling the crack with stuff which quickly hardened into a sort of brian lumlev papiermache that explains their lack of good old asses said eldin no waste in thalarion asses hero looked blank eh didnt i tell your eldin asked theyre not only short on marriagetackle theyve also missed out in waste disposal as we know it anyway hero grimaced you mean to tell me this place is built of yes of a sort eldin cut him off if you want to put it that way and because this place is made ofer paperthey cant use fire they know fire however and fearing it mightily they use it as a threat against the tree we should burn this damned place down to the ground hero snarled in answer to which eldin gave a frustrated grunt oh yesand well snap the sparks from our fingers shall we before hero could answer the older dreamer said ah now we appear to have arrived at our destination wherever that may be they were dragged from the travois and the beasts were led away now termen came up and employed their fingertips in melting away the dreamers cocoons they were then given loincloths which they gratefully donned four more termen warriors by their looks herded them through an archway into a large room which positively glowed with fungous light just inside the archway the termen paused to hurl hero and eldin to the floor then they themselves fell to their knees bowing their heads to the floor in seeming obeisance from their kneeling positions the dreamers looked about the room each of them risking a crack on the head from the scythes in the hands of the termen the place was thronging with handmaidens and a wide flight of spongy steps led up to a dais against the far wall hero of dreams there atop the dais and flanked by curtained passages the eidolon lathi gazed out across her royal chamber and lathi was no cold idol bathing in a warm glow which had its source at the top of her high thrones backrest she looked at the dreamersparticularly at herofor long moments then said welcome strangers welcome to thalarion now get up upand come to me we so rarely have visitors her voice however alien was full of strange promise and heavy with dreamlands accents but her face her bodyor at least those parts the dreamers could see of itwas young and indescribably beautiful as they climbed the wide flight of steps hero was unable to take his eyes off her at last he was prompted to whisper well old lad and what do you make of this i mean if those are painted on why ill stick to twiddling my thumbs in future heros horror chapter vi at the top of the steps the dreamers halted before lathis throne but while heros eyes feasted on the beauty of her face and form his companions were busy elsewhere it was the source of the golden glow in which she bathed which fascinated him he had known that strange soft light beforein that secret room in the keep of die first ones and sure enough when he stared at its source he saw that the glows center was a wand of power where its rod had been thrust like a pin into the high back of lathis throne now only the knob protruded and it was this which gave off that rare steady goiden effulgence ah said lathi smiling at the older dreamer you have seen lathis light it is indeed a wondrous light is it not giving no warmth at all still it burns like molten gold yes and you offer lathi as a gift this second rod of magic which burns not she produced thinistors wand and waved it in her tiny hand doubtless it has its use but i have not discovered it perhaps she turned her eyes upon hero you would care to describe its powers to lathi and tell her how it came into your possession before hero could answer eldin growled he would brian lumley not and the wand was taken from us not freely given now give it back he reached out to snatch the wand from her hand but before his great fingers could touch it the flat of a scythe struck his skull a resounding thwack from behind eldin immediately crumpled and hero turned in a crouch his hand instinctively reaching for a sword which no longer was there cowardly dogs he snarled at the two termen who lifted up their scythes threateningly hold lathi cried and they froze her face still regal and beautiful no longer smiled take that roaring bull away she ordered and pen him where he will do no mischief as for you she gazed at hero and gradually her smile returned you may stay here with me for now but understand neither my termen nor my handmaidens will waver for a single instant if i am threatened i am their queen hero stood stilt but raged inwardly as eidins unconscious form was lifted up and borne down the steps across the room and out through the arched sculpted entrance now then said lathi in her sweet alien dialect tell me about yourself who you are what you are and how you came here i have been told that you are a complete man her eyes settled brieflysomewhat eagerly hero thoughton his loincloth then returned to his face i was born intact yes growled hero certainly ive got more going for me than your poor lads he looked down upon the handmaidens where they stood in groups or reclined upon the floor and frowned though what good that would do me here is hard to say lathi saw his meaning and laughed throatily and so infectious was her laugh that despite himself hero found his face twitching into a grin he stared openly at her body she was naked from the waist up but from there on down her form was hidden in voluminous frilly folds of soft pa hero of dreams per which were spread out over the whole surface of her wide throne not even her feet were visible hero could not help but wonder if the rest of her figure matched up to her naked half but you must not think she told him in another moment bringing his thoughts back to the present that all of my termen are impotent indeed not she clapped tiny delicate hands and the fine paper curtain to the left of her throne was drawn back four huge naked termen stepped into view paraded before the throne bowed low to lathi and hastily returned whence they had come the curtain swished shut behind them at the sight of the fourwho had been built like statues of real heroes and more so in certain areasheros eyes had widened but he had noted a furtive frightened light in their eyes though certainly they had not been frightened of him now that they were gone he forced a couldntcareless expression onto his face and waited you are not impressed said lathi presently hero remembered one of eldins favorite sayings i have a friend in ulthar with very large ears he answered unfortunately hes deaf lathis smile grew warm as the heart of a sun ah you are wise and among my termen wisdom is so rare as to be extinct come sit beside me and she patted the frillcovered seat of her great throne deciding to play along with her for the moment hero sat she offered him a hand and he took it and in no time at all his natural instincts had him stroking her warm elegant fingers lathi sighed and for a moment her eyes became halfclosed but then she petulantly started up and still you have not told me of yourself my name is hero he answered david hero he deepened his voice to what he hoped was a seductive purr im a man of the waking worldan adventurer in earths iso brian lumley dreamlanda swordsmaster keepclimber and wizardslayer all of these things her eyes opened appreciatively perhaps a little mockingly hero thought he remembered something eldin had told the keeperhow long ago and added and im a halfdecent singer too a singer of songs cried lathi delightedly and a murmur of anticipation went up from her handmaidens where they now gathered at the foot of the dais slowly and deliberately she rubbed her naked shoulder against heros where he sat beside her her great eyes eating him as she gazed into his own and will you sing for me david hero and shall we then discuss other ways in which you might serve lathi of thalarion now while eldin might definitely argue the fact hero was no fool though occasionally he felt like one he felt like one now but at the same time he saw at least a means of prolonging his sudden friendship with the queen of this hive and thus maintaining his freedom his mind had been working overtime since entering the royal chamber and many small pieces of the puzzle were beginning to fall into place this was to heros liking for he firmly believed that to find a solution one must first be aware of the problem in its entirety the longer he remained a free man the greater his chance of solving the problem escaping and rescuing eldin you wish me to sing he said playing for time indeed lathi answered for the songs of dreamers are so sad and strange and we so rarely hear them again he looked round the room at the termen where they stood among reclining handmaidens their arms folded but their strange eyes never leaving him for a moment ah but im jealous about who hears my songs he said on sudden inspiration i dont sing them for men and i certainly wont sing them for halfmen hero of dreams for a moment he thought hed gone too far lathis eyes clouded for a second or so and her handmaidens uttered oohs and aahs of disappointment then lathi spoke if i send my termen away she said and if you should be so foolish as to do anythinguntowardthe handmaidens would very quickly bind you and then i would have them fil you up with their threads until your stomach throat and mouth were stuffed with them that would be a very unpleasant death david hero he gulped and agreed indeed it would then we understand one another good and she clapped her hands the termen immediately left the room going out through the sculpted arch of the great door and now hero was alone with lathi and herfemales slowly he began to sing a lullaby learned in nir from the matron of a house where once he lodged for two nights that mother had cared for seven children singing each and every one of mem to sleep in their turn every night thus hero had heard the song fourteen times aye and now he remembered how it had put him to sleep too as he sang so he turned over in his mind the things he had noticed things which were odd even for a race of people as strange as this one for instance the lack of young termen and maids there were no children he had not seen a single child in all of this great hive were the termen born fullgrown he doubted it and then there was lathis obvious interest in his manhood and her hint of a way other than singing in which he might serve her and what of those prize stallions she had shown him were they in reality as useless as geldings still singing he started as lathis head fell softly against his shoulder it was almost sufficient to bring his song to an abrupt halt but not quite instead gently turning his head to look at her he saw that she was fast brian lumley asleep moreover the handmaidens had all curled up where they lay and were now sleeping it was unbelievable more than hero had dared hope for and he quickly stifled the whoop of victory he felt welling deep in his lungs no for victory was still very far away but certainly his was a tremendous stroke of luck softly crooning he eased himself off the throne and peered wildly about for a weapon preferably one of the sharp scythes used by the termen in that respect however he was out of luck and so turned his attention to the curtains which flanked lathis throne the four great termen he had seen had not been armed and so this might be a possible escape route on the run there were few in earths dreamland could outdistance david hero gradually he let his song fade into silence then moved soundlessly to the curtain and drew it open a little way holding his breath he looked into the room beyond at first he could see very little for the light beyond the curtain was less bright than that of the throne room then as his eyes grew accustomed to the blueglowing gloom so he saw a pair of naked handmaidens slowly and luxuriously rubbing fragrant oil onto a large cylindrical object whose surface gleamed like old leather the cylinder seemed to protrude from the wall and was all of ten feet long big as a barrel at its thickest part it tapered to a blunt point like a huge chisel as hero watched the thing seemed to shudder in a sort of ecstasy alive the cylinder was alive but what in all the dreamlands was it he could see a little better now and so turned hjs attention to the activities of the four termen where they crowded together in one corner incredibly they seemed to be gamblinga peculiar sort of relaxation which hero would not have expected of their speciesand he saw the hero of dreams white flash of dice as they rose in air and fell to the hardpacked paper floor quickly breathlessly the termen scrutinized the dice where they lay and three of them turned their heads to peer at the fourth for his part he leapt wildly to his feet the winner hero thought then rapidly changed his mind as the others rose up and grabbed hold of the fourth before he could flee they held him down while one of the handmaidens left her work on the cylinderthing to weave a web of silk over his mouth then the three dragged him to the blunt end of the morbidly heaving cylinder and held him while more threads were used to bind his legs together and his arms to his sides trussed up like this he was unable to get his fingers to the threads and melt themif his type was equipped for that task now the handmaidens began to stroke and massage the cylinder about one third of its length up from the blunt chiselpoint by this time hero could see quite clearly and he noted once again the undulant ecstatic motion of the thing as the handmaidens worked on it his hand began to tremble a little on the curtain as he tried to fathom the meaning of what he was seeing something horrible was happening hereor was about to happenand it seemed to hero that he should know what it was or that he should flee before he found out what it was then his eyes widened and the hair rose up at the back of his neck as he saw that the cylinderthing was was opening at the subtle and practiced urging of the naked handmaidens a long slit had appeared in the leathery surface of the vast sausageshape and now it seemed to pulse that gash and in a monstrous spasm it opened wider still hero found himself shuddering almost uncontrollably as the three termen picked up their former colleague and brian lumley held him horizontally in the air now what in the name of somehow hero stifled his gasp of horror as the termen placed the head of their luckless fellow in the pulsing gash and pushed and shoved until he had fully entered the cylinder and only his feet protruded those feet twitched jerked spastically twitched again and finally were still and suddenly the massive cylinder convulsed contracted convulsed again in a loathsome rippling of nameless flesh which tailed off into a sort of nearinert exhausted palpitation the termen waited a moment longer men tugged at the motionless protruding feet of their excomrade and pulled his bodyor what was left of itclear of the gash which now began to close the body looked like a timeravaged mummy shrivelled and bloodless a dry skin full of dry bones and at last hero knew it all in his mind he had measured up the thickness of the wall and had positioned the queens throne behind it he need wonder no longer about lathis lower body so carefully hidden from view while her upper torso was so lusciously displayed no for this cylinderthing this vast leathery trunk this was the eidolon lathis body and now hero knew just exactly what she had meant by another way in which he might serve her the curtain tore in his hand as he stumbled backward away from the entrance to that awful nuptial chamber but his low moan of uttermost terror was completely drowned out by lathis shriek as she was awakenedby her own passion perhapsto discover his deception seeing him where he stood with the torn curtain in his hand at the top of the steps she began furiously to clap her hands and in the next moment there sounded a veritable tumult of shouting and rushing feet from beyond the hero of dreams sculpted archway as if this were not enough there was something else something which seemed as much a surprise to the denizens of the hive as it was to hero a series of massive subterranean thumps that shook the ground as by the tread of some striding giant he had little enough time to ponder these tremors however but rather worried about more pressing matters namely the dozen or so termen who came bursting in through the archway to rush at him up the dais steps the doom that came to thalarion chapter vii carried on the shoulders of three termen eldin was not unconscious when he was borne from lathis throne room he could feel an egg rising on the back of his head true but that was only a temporary thing he had come to his senses as soon as he was picked up and now he was taking particular note of the route his bearers took through the paperbuilt maze to to where was he to be simply disposed of he wondered or would it be a grandiose thing whichever he wouldnt go quietly but for the moment it were best that he lie still and firmly fix in his minds eye the tortuous ways that led back to the throne room and his fellow adventurer david hero herohah thought eldin and he was almost tempted to snort and the eidolon lathi luscious little plum making eyes at the young idiot why by now he was bound to be making eyes right back at her before eldin had time to conjure more than two or three erotic pictures of heros present pursuits with the queen of the hive he was tossed rudely into the black throat of a deep welllike pit some twenty feet down he struck brian lumley bottoma mercifully spongy bottom though sprinkled here and there with hard bitsand lay still while he got his wind back the place was lighted with the same fungous blue glow of the upper tunnels which light was supplemented by the rather more rotten luminescence of decaying corpses eldin quickly scrambled away from a pile of stinking cadavers and miscellaneous bones only to be drawn back a moment later as his curiosity got the better of him the stench was terrible and while his fall hadnt harmed him certainly this reeking atmosphere soon would gingerly with his naked foot he turned over skeletons and kicked aside leering skulls the place was a veritable ossuary a boneyard and it was plain to see that thalarions termen had no favorites when it came to unwanted visitors no for the bones and cadavers were of almost every sort and species of dreamlands denizens there were the skulls and tattered loincloths of the tiny brown people of kled and the larger bigboned corpses of rangy men of inquanok there were recently dead softlyrounded remains of black men of pargdoubtless escaped slaves from some galley on the southern seaand even homed skulls of the evil squat widemouthed denizens of lengs forbidden plateau how they had come here and whythat was anybodys guess but plainly they had all ended up the same way yes and now it seemed that eldin the wanderer was to share a like fate he was not ready to give in so easily however and so tried scaling the walls but the stuff of the walls simply would not take his weight it came down in handfuls whenever he got a good grip so that it seemed if he continued he must surely bury himself just then as he paused to think again he felt a tremor in the pulpy paper foundations of the place he stood stock still and silent waiting and after a moment there hero of dreams came another subterranean shock a small earthquake perhaps a series of them or had a couple of thalarions fretted spires rotted through and toppled down onto the city eldin hoped so and also that a good many termen had been crushed or smothered but he doubted it he was still pondering the mystery when a moment later there echoed from on high the sounds of a struggle and a voice he had thought never to hear again shouting her defiance gasping and crying all at the same time aminza was giving someone an awful lot of trouble up there the sounds came closer and with one last shriek of defiance aminza was pitched down into the hole eldin directly beneath her was able to catch hold of her arms and so cushion her fall a little but still they were both dashed down to the pulpy floor then quick as a flash aminza had elbowed him in the ribs was up on her feet and had her back to the wall eyes blazing in the blueglowing gloom she cried come on then whoever or whatever you are come and get your eyes scratched out and she held up her hands before her fingers crooked and ready to strike damn me girl eldin wheezed getting his breath back where he sat on a broken skull im not sure i want to marry you after all eldin she gasped eldin aye its me all right he said climbing wearily to his feet and staggering as a third tremor set the whole city shaking but what the devils happening girl are you in some way responsible for these shocks that keep rocking the place not me she cried flinging herself into his arms i dont know what it isbut it feels like the citys about to fall down about our ears well at least well be together if it does he an brjan lumley swered now then youd best tell me how you come to be here breathlessly she explained how from the heights of the tree she had seen the dreamers taken prisoner and how then she had slipped away from the tree and followed the column of termen to thalarion from the hills she had watched them enter the city had then sneaked closer and crept inside she bore no weapon with her no plan of action in her head but only knew that she must rescue her friends if that were at all possible if not then she would share their fate a body of termen had picked her up almost immediately and had obviously deemed it wisest not to take her to the eidolon lathi the queen would not tolerate another whole female in her hive thus she had been dumped into the pit there to starve and join the bones of them who went before brave but foolish eldin growled hugging her to him in the gloom it seems the old tree was right about us eh she nodded her head against his chest in agreement and a little sob escaped her trembling lips oh eldin she whispered dont be frightened girl he patted her abstractedly things will turn out all righti think she looked about at the contents of the pit staring hard as her eyes grew accustomed to the shadows then once more buried her face in eldins chest if only it wasnt so gloomy she sobbed theneldinl she cried and danced away from him in a sudden fever of excitement eh what he cried whats up lass your pouch she answered ive brought your pouch id forgotten about it till now here and digging a hand into her shirt she came out with eldins waterproof pouch he took it from her thumbed its contents through the outer skin and slowly shook his head i know what hero of dreams youre thinking girl but forget it if i struck a light down here with all these rotten gases swirling about whooshlthe place would go up like tinder and us trapped in the middle of it no i can think of better ways to die here put the pouch away as she took back the pouch the ground shook yet again and this time the piled bones and mummies literally erupted in a cloud of decaying debris something groped upward from the floor swayed in the bluish light fell writhingly against the pair where they crouched beside the wall what the devil eldin snarled then relaxed with a great sigh of relief as a voice in his mind said ive found youat last the tree cried aminza her hand on the shuddering root part of him at least said eldin and to the tree was that you shaking the city indeed did i not tell you that my roots had already discovered thalarion finding the soil beneath the city dry and dead it offers them little or no resistance i only hope ive strength enough to complete my taskwhich is to bring demoncursed thalarion to the ground well do more than that old friend cried eldin out loud but firstcan you get us out of this pit wait answered the voice in his head as the root withdrew a moment later it reappeared bursting through the wall close to the very top of the pit down it snaked to where eldin and aminza could grasp it climb climb cried the trees voice in their heads you first lass said eldin pushing her from behind up you go to the tree he said how much damage do you think you can do as eldin began to climb the tree answered i can destroy thalarionthough that will be the end of me there brian lumlev are bound to be survivors and i know what theyll do to me at least ill go in a blaze of glory very brave and very foolish answered eldin with a savage grin as he climbed out of the pit directly behind aminza tree what prompted you to do this you and hero were willing to give up your lives for me and aminza was willing to die for you and so so youre willing to bum in order to give us a chance eh but what if thalarion has no survivors how can that be you just do your bit old twig grinned eldin and leave the rest to me what else may i do to help you asked the tree you can try to find hero and see if he needs a helping handor root the scarfaced dreamer answered and youd best be on your way now so that i can get this thing started how many of youer much of youis there under the city anyway a lot of me answered the tree and for now farewell the root withdrew was gone in an instant and now the two stood alone at the edge of the pit for a second only for as the tremors began again stronger now and more insistent so a pair of termen emerged at a run from the mouth of a nearby passageway for a moment it looked as if they might go on their way but then they saw eldin and aminza at the edge of the pit they had scythes and lifted them up as they rushed upon the pair without ceremony eldin shoved aminza to one side he snatched at the first termans scythe arm pulled ducked and lifted all in one flowing motion drawing his attacker up onto his brawny back they were after all not used to fighting these termen and eldin held his victim across his shoulders in a wrestling hold as he spun knocking his second assailant flying then tossing the dizzy creature hero of dreams from his shoulders into the pit he turned and kicked the second terman in the throat as he made to get to his feet with a gurgle that told of a smashed windpipe the terman fell back eldin snatched up his fallen scythe pounced on him and dispatched him with a single stroke here lass he grunted turning to aminza take this she gingerly accepted the crescent blade twisting her mouth at sight of the thin yellow fluid which served the termen as blood no good going all squeamish now aminza eldin told her theres some damned rough work ahead and ive no doubt youll need to do your bit now then give me back my pouch will you i think well have a little more light on the scene he tore fragments of paper from a wall struck sparks from his firestones tossed the makeshift brand into the pit behind him with a rush and a roar that hurled both of them flat a huge column of flame instantly gouted up from the pit and rivers of fire ran rapidly across the high ceiling i told you it would be a hot one eldin yelled gathering up the girl come on lets go with eldin slightly in the lead they ran along the passage which led back to the throne room as they went the glow of the fire behind them lit the way ahead for a short distance panicking three termen where they already stumbled to the now continuous shuddering of the foundations without pause eldin snatched the scythe from one of them cut down the second and knocked aside the third then grabbed aminzas hand once more and ran as fast as his legs could carry him whenever they came to a junction of passageways there they would halt for a few seconds while eldin set fire to die walls but now at last they approached the throne room proper brian lumlev here in die maze of passages corridors and tunnels which surrounded lathis chambers a large number of termen and maids were rushing aimlessly about in a frenzy of panic eldin and aminza for all that they stood out like sore thumbs found themselves almost totally ignoredbut die scarfaced dreamer was never one to be ignored for very long with a whoosh and a roar he set fire to one last junction of burrows then dragged aminza after him under the high sculpted archway which he recognized as the entrance to lathis throne room they came to a breathless halt just inside the room and took in the scene at a glance the place was awash with a sea of milling termen and maids and atop the dais steps hero battled desperately against huge odds using catlike speed and brute strength to hold the steps against a crush of scythewielding termen hero catch roared eldin and sent a scythe whirling through air straight to the hand of the younger dreamer and after that confusion turned to chaos within seconds die archway was blazing and eldin and aminza were battling their way through lathis dazed and disbelieving minions toward hero by the time they reached the foot of the dais its steps were already awash in the yellow blood of slain termen atop the steps berserk as any viking ancestor of die waking world hero was drenched with the stuff where he stood astride a pile of termen bodies what with the siime on the steps and the now crazed heaving and bucking of die floor it was hard work on the part of aminza and eldin to make it to heros side but at last all three stood together and up through the floor burst the trees roots writhing and wriggling adding to the chaos flinging papery debris everywhere as they tore out the very foundations of ladiis domain hero of dreams eldin deliberately grasped at a root that broke from the wall close by and was immediately in communication with the tree tree he yelled out loud were finished here now how do we get out my creepers the tree responded at once i have two of them directly above you just let me give this place one last shakethere the throne room was wracked by tremendous tremors which had the three clinging together for support and a moment later a great jagged crack appeared in the floor and ran up the wall huge areas of die ceiling began to cave in and daylight at once flooded the place down from above snaked a pair of tough green creepers which pounced on eldin and aminza and hauled them aloft in another second the creepers were back this time to lift hero out onto the citys sagging sliding roof in one hand he now carried two wands one of which glowed with a golden light behind him as he alighted on the treacherous roof a great gush of flame sent a mushroom of smoke into dreamlands lateafternoon sky tree cried hero where he hung onto the creepers its time we all got out of here i dont quite know how you eldin and aminza managed all this but i do know were in for a scorching if we dont get moving i can still help answered the tree just hang onto my creepers all three of you and run as hard as you can you run and ill pull and with luck youll be out of the city before it falls flat they needed no second urging but hung on grimly as the trees stout creepers dragged them across thalarions shuddering crumbling roof and all about them the spindly spires of the city were falling into ruin and sending up clouds of dust and rags of shredded paper flames gouted up from a dozen points raced over the roof licked at the brian lumley three where they leaped and stumbled through sinking settling acres of disintegrating paper and at last they were sliding down the outer domes stumbling over dead dry soil running for the hills as behind them roaring its deathagonies to the darkening sky thalarion became a mighty raging inferno part flight of the lifeleaf chapter i creepers chuckled eldin when the three stood in the hills and watched the trees tendrils rapidly retreat northward drawn back by their mighty master i reckon he should call them runners how can you be humorous in a charred loincloth hero asked then shrugged and decided that perhaps eldin was right he turned back to face thalarion holding his hands out to the distant blaze cozy little fire isnt it he said eldin you were wonderful said aminza standing on tiptoe to kiss the older dreamer um eldin grunted in agreement thatll teach them to fool around with eldin the wanderer not to mention david hero said hero slightly miffed who mentioned david hero eldin asked what did you do that was so wonderful hohum yawned hero examining his rather grimy nails carelessly with an air of itdoesntreallymatter he held out the wands for inspection and who was it risked his neck in the middle of all that was going on to take back thinistors wand and lift lathis at the same brian lumley time after all thats what we came foramong other things personally said aminza i think the tree deserves more thanks than all three of us put together and the dreamers could find no fault with her statement so they stood together and watched thalarion burn and soon the city was reduced to a fine white ash which the night winds would quickly disperse the eidolon lathis city was no more the menace of the termen and maids and their monstrous queen was removed forever from the land of earths dreams why eidolon aminza thought to ask as they began to make their weary way back to the tree under dreamlands starstrewn skies eldin frowned and shook his head hero said an eidolon is an image or a representation not the real thing well neither was lathi the real thing and remembering what he had seen in that hideous bridalchamber behind the throne room he shuddered and fell silent in the morning they found a stream and bathed washing away all of their accumulated aches and pains afterward they got their things together and aminza did a little repair work on the mens clothing through the early afternoon they laughed joked and talked with the tree he would soon begin to walk again to turn and head east now that the threat was past his strength would rapidly return and he would live to a ripe old age as the day wore on the adventurers played hide and seek amongst the trees leaves and great branches and later they made a fine meal of fish caught in the stream but in the late afternoon their massive host began to sense their restlessness and it was then that he sprang his big surprise he broached the subject as they lay side by side hero of dreams on their backs with their hands under their heads across one of his mightiest branches hero sat up at once what was that tree did i hear you right certainly before i attacked thalarion i prepared the lifeleaf i knew that if i failed to rescue youeven if i succeededlathi would destroy me i believed i would be destroyed burned down therefore long before his time i prepared the lifeleaf once i had fed him the special juices he required to begin his separate life then there was no stopping the process before morning in only a few short hours the lifeleaf will detach himself and fly free he will be a complete being in his own right the lifeforce from which a new tree shall grow a clone rumbled eldin eh whats a clone asked hero eldin frowned and after a moment said dunno but i once knewi think hero and aminza snorted simultaneously and gave their attention back to the tree aminza asked and are you seriously suggesting that your lifeleaf should carry us on the next leg of our journey why not he is the largest and loveliest leaf i shall ever produce and unique in his ability to fly normally he would seek out his own place find a land of warm suns soft rains and fertile soil but this time you will do it for him somewhere between here and your destination there must be such a place there shall the lifeleaf take root and grow into a great tree and we can er ride him in safety questioned eldin a trifle uncertainly assuredly i should perhaps state however that lifeleaves are full of the natural joys of youth the journey may well be a littleexhilarating the more i hear of this said hero enthusiastically brian lumley the more i like the idea to ride a lifeieaf through the nightskies of dreamland why its the chance of a lifetime something no one ever did before or ever will again said the tree exhilarating eldin repeated the word thoughtfully a little worriedly hes not likely to go looping the loop is he nothing like that answered the tree with a mental chuckle not with you three aboard and hell follow the route we wish him to take asked aminza of course that shall be my last instruction to him amazing observed eldin godparents to a tree to a great tree the tree reminded eh oh of course yes mumbled the older dreamer apologetically tree said hero some time ago you offered to show us this lifeleaf of yours now id like to take advantage of your offer me too said aminza and me added eldin it grows late answered the tree and soon youll feel the effects of my sleep pollens theres time enough said hero and light enough too and he produced lathis wand from inside his shirt the golden glow of the wand was like the light of some mighty firefly guiding them through the gloom as the tree immediately swept them aloft to that secret heartplace where grew the lifeleaf and they were properly hushed when the tree gently deposited them in that network of protective branches in his uppermost regions where the lifeleaf lay unfurled huge and softedged his pockets filling with buoyant gases from the parent trees great trunk his tracery of veins athrob with those special juices which had awak hero of dreams ened him big as a large carpet the lifeleafbig and beautiful and alivea pulse of joy which drew its strength its seeds of knowledge its ancient ancestral heritage from the great tree whose pride was a tangible thing in the night silently the three stared for long and long and the glow of lathis wand lent the scene a properly magical air finally almost as one person the three spoke to the tree not wishing to destroy the moment they spoke in whispers even eldin tree the older dreamer said its dme for bed yes aminza agreed a little sleep wont go amiss especially added hero pleased that he was to have the last word since were to go ariding tomorrow two hours before dawn the tree awakened them it was time he lifted the three and their packs back to that secret place in his highest branches and there invited them to step aboard the lifeleaf gingerly at first then putting their faith in their gigantic host one at a time they stepped onto the wide ribbed platform and settled down in the carpet of long soft hairs which covered it the leafs surface gave to their weight with a gentle resilience its gassacks molding to their shapes and its furred edges curling up a little to form a shallow boat shape hero sat in the prow thinistors wand in hand holding it lightly and allowing its knob to point westward westward along the coast of the southern sea the faces of the three glowed golden in the light of lathis wand which aminza held in her lap like some cold wonderful torch they were tense now and a little afraid each looked to be on the verge of speaking but no one said anything then its time said the tree there came a great soughing of leaves as he lowered his brian lumley closest branches downward from his trunk to form a sort of ramp and the adventurers held their breath as a soft tearing sound reached them from the spot where the lifeleaf grew from its massive parent body the sound came again and the lifeleaf gave a shudder and tilted slowly downward ah said the tree farewell my friends farewell the three would later argue whether or not they actually answered him but not one of them would know for sure for now they were in motion feeling the flow of air against their faces as the lifeleaf launched himself down a ramp of branches hearing the swish of soft leaves giving way beneath them to ease the lifeleafs passage more steeply yet the living carpet tilted and faster its forward downward rush until with the very gentlest of bumps they were airborne and no sooner were they in the air than the lifeleaf moved beneath them shifting and balancing its mass to form an amazingly efficient airfoil a light wind blew off the sea to greet the oncoming dawn and the lifeleaf sought out its currents and rode them rode high until soon the hills valleys and rivers were left far far below round and round in a wide rising spiral flew the lifeleaf and his passengers sat hair streaming flesh tingling and gazed down wideeyed on all the vastly improbable lands of earths dreams far out over the southern sea they spotted the lonely fights of fishing boats and other craft and away to the east the first rays of the sun were dusting the edge of dreamland with a glow to challenge that of lathis wand somewhere in the dark distant curve of the west a citys lights showed momentarily and in the north the writhing wraiths of aurora borealis performed their ghostly dances but by now they had reached those uppermost limits of atmosphere beyond which the lifeleaf dare not ascend for hero of dreams to do so would be to penetrate realms inhabited by the flopping shapeless and namelessly monstrous larvae of the other gods here the flight of the lifeleaf levelled out and gradually his prow came round to point westward then following the way pointed out by thinistors wand the lifeleaf began the long gentle downward glide which would take the three adventurers to their destination now because of their altitude the sun seemed like a blade of blinding light on the horizon far behind them and as they drifted lower so its dawning rays turned dreamlands rivers and streams to ribbons of silver their speed was enormous and towns cities and mountain ranges passed beneath almost as quickly as they could be counted as yet neither the light nor their orientation was such that the adventurers could name for a certainty the territories over which they passed though certainly there was something very familiar about many of the bays and ports of the southern sea it was only when they sailed lower still and the mountains reached up toward them that they began to pick out specific places remembered of earlier wanderings then in the dawny distance the men of the waking world spied that winding flashing snake of water which could only be the tross and they saw near its mouth the mistwreathed city of theelys why this was where it had all started for them right here in theelys down down floated the lifeleaf its buoyancy gases streaming out from pockets which emptied themselves and as if to match or guide the leafs descent so the knob of the wand in heros hand dipped lower and lower twice they circled high over the turrets of a castle on theelys outskirts then tilted steeply toward the great gardens within the castles low outer walls the adventurers held on grimly as the lifeleaf skimmed brian lumley trees and tall shrubs gritted their teeth as it stalled and slipped sideways and finally sighed in unison as it gentled to the ground and came at last to rest as they climbed shakily from the settled leaf slender coiled tendrils like long white worms fell from its stem burrowed deep into the soil and immediately took root not the sunniest place in earths dreamland said hero peering closely at the leaf where it now began to wilt upon the grass still i suppose he knows what hes doing i shouldnt worry too much about him my lad said eldin the hint of a warning in his deep growi not just yet at least i think weve one or two problems of our own look where your wands pointing hero lookedand his hand instinctively flew to the hilt of his sword for the knob of thinistors wand pointed directly at the massive gates of the looming castle and atop the high inner wall stood a figure in runeinscribed gown and conical cap his eyes fixed firmly upon his visitors and the shadow of a strange smile upon his wizards lips the tale of nyrass of theelys chapter ii the wizard beckoned with a runeclad arm and called out welcome to the castle of nyrass of theelys i welcome all three of you and what a singular honor to be borne here on the lifeleaf of a great tree now enter enter and fear not no harm will come to you in the house of nyrass the magenone of my doing at any rate the voice was thin and reedy with age but the welcome it extended seemed earnest enough cautiously the three approached the castles moat crossed it over on a drawbridge of oak passed under the stone arch of a massively thick wall and so into the cobbled courtyard nyrass came slowly down a flight of stone steps from the wall to where they waited for him his hair and moustache were white as driven snow as was his waistlong beard now in the dawn light they could see that he was very old and such was the weary smile on his wrinkled but friendly face that their apprehension quickly went out of them mighty adventurers indeed he said his rheumy eyes upon the wands which hero and aminza still carried since you have that wand he pointed an agued finger at heros rod it may be supposed that my cousin thinistor is no more he turned to aminza and while brian lumley you have that wand again he pointed the same must be believed of lathi youre right old man growled eldin both thinistor udd and the eidolon lathi are dead and youd have us believe that such news pleases you would you pleases me the wizard answered at once no it saddens me for it means that a little more of magic and mystery has gone out of earths dreamland oh ill agree it was probably necessary but still both dead you say and by your hands he peered at each of the three in turn my my theyll sing songs of this one day in celephais and ulthar wizard hero now spoke up weve come a long way and faced many terrors to get here were questers and since youve already seen and recognized these wands weve won well im sure youll know mat weve come to you for the third oh i know that well enough nyrass answered but im sorry for i cant help you what scowled eldin but the wands here we know it is nyrass nodded indeed it isbut still i say to you that you cant have it be warned old man said aminza nimbly stepping between her suddenly tense companions and the wizard these are desperate fellows when their bloods up if you have the wand youd do well to hand it over i have it he answered taking her hand and patting it and i dont have it youll understand presently my dear but come along lets not stand out here all day well breakfast together and then you can tell me your story after that if you wish ill tell you mineand then youll know why i cant give you the third wand well are you coming hero and eldin looked at one another for a moment or hero of dreams two then shared a shrug they followed nyrass and aminza where they walked slowly ahead the wizard leaning a little on the girls arm through a great oaken door and into the castle proper in a room high in an eastfacing turret where the sun flooded through great arched windows tfiey breakfasted on honey and bread washed down with scented tea from kikuran simple but satisfying fare as they ate so the adventurers told their tale and nyrass listened attentively occasionally nodding his head he was done with eating before his guests and after daintily dabbing at his lips he said well most of what youve told me is as i divined it indeed i followed part of your flight on the lifeleaf in my shewstone that however was quite by accident and i assure you i havent been spying on you no for i have my own problems and little enough time these days for wizardly pursuits he chuckled a little but sadly they thought very well he continued after a while youve told your tale so now ill tell mineand may you find it just as interesting let me think now ah yes id best start back at the very beginning in an age undreamed of by anyone living or dreaming in earths dreamland today now then youve repeated to me what the keeper of the keep told you of the tenth first one how he went mad and fled the keep taking with him the three wands of power well let me start my part of the story at that point in time when dreams were very young and the dreamlands full of a primal magic so the mad tenth first one klarekyam by name stole the wands and made off with them now these wands were the tools of the first oneskeys you might call themthe keys of those great gates of space and time brian lumley through which the first ones came and went at will and when the keys were stolen then those gates were locked forever and die cthulhumaddened klarekyam knew that he could not keep the wands not all of them for the other first ones had instruments by use of which they would quickly discover their whereabouts if all three were kept together so as he fled the mad one hid the first wand away in a deep cave in the mountains where long ages later thinistor found it one day and the second he tossed into that mighty lake behind the great bleak mountains so that it was finally washed down into thalarion and eventually came into the hands of the eidolon lathi but the third wand that one he kept for himself now of the wands themselves let me explain something you have told how thinistors wand points the way aye and i may tell you that it has the power to do many other things as well but indeed pointing the way is its primary function it is the instrument by use of which the first ones guided their mighty ships amongst the stars and down the timestreams and lathis wand you have seen how it glows with a cold golden everlasting light that is the essence of the ultimate power which propels the ships of the first ones upon their voyagings and as for the third wand ah but that one is the strangest wand of all by use of the third wand the first ones are able to slip into and out of this plane of existence or any other such plane at willor they were before it was stolen it cancels space and time utterly as if they never were and reconstructs them to suit itself or rather to suit its masters now it has only one master klarekyam himself and he is locked in a place where even he cannot use the third and last wand hero of dreams here nyrass paused and held up a finger to keep the three silent this too shall i explain he presently told them and eventually after a little thought he continued with his tale in those primal days of dream there dwelt here beside the tross in this very castle my ancestor soomus the seventh of the seventh now as his name and title implies he was the seventh son of the seventh son of dreamlands very first wizard and as such he was mightier in magic than all other men how easily he could have made the dreamlands in their entirety his own had he so desired he was a good man however as have been all of his descendants with very few exceptions one of those exceptions being thinistor udd eldin cut in a trifle sarcastically er aye even so nyrass agreed and quickly went on now soomus kept in the castles apartments some of dreamlands most ancient and esoteric writings direful tomes whose very titles may not be spoken by sane or human tongues i myself have inherited certain of those volumes and i may tell you that even i dare not look into all of them suffice it to say that upon the least potent pages one may find koths sign explained and his essence delineated the runic keys to the pnakotic manuscripts spells for conjuring the myriad minions of maggab and numerous other terrible thaumaturgies whose purposes i will not even name well the crazed first one had heard of soomus and knew him for a mighty magician he determined to seek him out and ask his aid in the performance of the blackest rite of all which were it performed would surely doom earths dreamland in its entiretynot to mention the rest of space and time in short he wished to free cthulhu and the great old ones from their immemorial prisonsnot only here but brian lumley also in the waking world need i say more on that subject of course not and so he came to soomus with his wand and his blasphemous proposition in the wand you see he already controlled the power to seek out and find cthulhu and his ilk so that all he needed from soomus was a key to their prisons with which to undo in a moment all the work of the great gods of eld of course soomus and klarekyara they themselves would not be harmed no for they would be firstloved amongst all cthulhus human priests and acolytes and immortal they would walk in wonder and glory forever nyrass uttered a dry chuckle but who i ask you would willingly become an immortal madman certainly not my ancestor soomus the seventh of the seventh you may be sure and so he asked for time to consider the mad ones madder proposal and instead prepared a potent spell and a trap fit for one so wily as that lunatic first one and indeed the poor mad creature fell into soomuss trap for which we can all be thankful and soomus shrank him down him and his wand and all and prisoned him in a glass sphere no bigger than a shewstone and there he remains to this daybut for how much longer no man can say to this day repeated hero alive aye for my ancestor had not the heart to take the first ones life they are longlived the first ones as you know and this coupled with soomus spell made klarekyam nearimmortal and the third wand is locked in the shewstone with him questioned eldin indeed it is and many books of magic also for they were in the rooms which soomus shrank he shrank entire rooms as many as a great house the better to ease the mad first ones bitter imprisonment hero of dreams the three looked at each other and back at nyrass its a strange story for sure grunted eldin and we certainly dont wish to seem ungrateful for your hospitality but but you dont believe me anyway is that it the wizard smiled his sad smile very well you shall see for yourselves he stood up and beckoned them to follow leading the way down spiral steps from the turret and out across the courtyard to an ironbound door of ageblackened oak there they paused while he took out a great key from his wizards robe turning it in the lock of the massive door you seem to take good care of this shewstone nyrass said hero as they descended dank steps into deep bowels of earth is that where were goingto see the shewstone yes to both questions answered nyrass i do take good care of it and you are going to see it of course i take good care of it for if ever klarekyam should escape and he shrugged that would be the end of it now aminza spoke up asking and is he likely to escape i fear so nyrass nodded but if your ancestor soomus locked him up all those centuries ago she pressed why shouldnt you do the same soomus took him by surprise child and after all thesenot centuries my dear but eonsdyou really think hed allow himself to be taken so easily again aminza had no answer and in another moment the way had grown so dark that she held up lathis wand to light the way the steps wound interminably down and the air quickly grew colder nitrous patches gave the walls a leprous appearance and the footsteps of the party echoed loudly now eldin thought to inquire you said the mad first brian lumley one is likely to escape but you didnt say how hed go about it is someone trying to free him he is trying to free himself as he has tried ever since soomus locked him away nyrass answered thats what puzzles me about your story eldin returned in his rumbling growl if this crazy klarekyam has the third wand with him in his fishbowl world how come hes still in there at all i thought the thing was a key to alien dimensions times and places so it is said nyrass nodding his white head and calling a halt as they reached the foot of the stone staircase indeed it isbut its powers were reduced along with its size what cried eldin are we fools that we should believe all this nyrass paused before a door which was strong as the one at the top of the steps he turned to eldin and frowned dreamer he said you persist in doubting my word fortunately for you i love my fellow men even unlovely ones what would you do if i struck you eh said eldin surprised why with my temper id probably strike you back and if you were only one inch tall an inch again eldin was taken aback why idid and if you were less than a grain of sand nyrass pressed dont you see just as the mad first one was made tiny so was his power and so was the power of his wand hero was frowning heavily and that was a sign that something bothered him mightily nyrass he said you may well find that klarekyam has an ally in a certain ossaran one ebraim borak youll remember we told you it was borak sent us into the mountains in the first place hero of dreams to bring back thinistorb wand could it be that borak plots to release the first one ah no replied nyrass though i can see why you might think so but no i myself enlisted boraks aid in attempting to recover the first wand i thought the wand might help me to prevent the inevitable escape of the mad first one do you see but as an agent the ossaran was not a good choice he was too devious untrustworthy i later discoveredeven as you discoveredthat he was in league with thinistor udd himself aye eldin grunted and weve still a score to settle with borak no longer nyrass smiled his wan smile all such scores were settled when borak ran afoul of the taw in theelys he came to me for help and when i would have hidden him away he attempted to murder me he had determined you see to make himself the next great wizard of theelys with all of my books charms spells and other devices he just might have succeeded you killed him eldin seemed disappointed no for that is not my way well it may not be your way nyrass hero cut in impatient now but we dont have your benevolent nature wheres borak now come answered the ancient magician the answerall answerslie within the rooms beyond this door if you see for yourself then you will know and understand then too youll fear the madness of the tenth first one as much as i do the tenth first one chapter iii from the cold nitrous foot of the stone steps nyrass led the questers into brightly lighted sumptuous subterranean apartments which would rival in their opulence any of the wizards own rooms in the castle far above they would never have suspected that such a place could exist down here and by the neatness of the rooms it was obvious that they were occupied but by whom hero asked this of nyrass as he led them through one wellkept room after another why by my good and faithful servant ebraim borak of course for this is where i keep my most precious books my instrumentsall of the many appurtenances of wizardryand im too old to keep the place neat and tidy for myself ebraim does it for me and his payment is that i keep him here safely hidden away from the forces of law and order wizard eldin rumbled youve made a big mistake bringing me here for when i meet up with borak ill youll do nothing my large friend said nyrass unperturbed now save your breath and dont argue for youll see soon enough that this ebraim borak is not the same man who sent you on your fools quest brian lumley eldin might have argued for all the wizards words but at mat moment a door opened and a greenclad man bustled in smiling broadly as he saw the four and bowing to them then without a word being spoken he set about to fill the wells of the rooms many lamps where they stood in niches in the walls all the while he hummed to himself and smiled exuding an air of pleased satisfaction which was very nearly tangible for a long moment the questers stared at the man where he busied himself then eldin stepped forward and spun him about borak the scarfaced dreamers face was a mask of anger as he spat out the others name ebraim borak the smile never left the ossarans face for a moment as eldin scowled so borak smiled and gradually it dawned on the brawny adventurer that indeed diis was not the man he had met in hymat zorathins tavern on the street of rats so many nights ago the same body and face certainly but not the same mind not any mind to speak of for boraks smile was blank as his eyes and no slightest sign of recognition showed upon his face eldin might be the man in the moon for all the ossaran knew or cared slowly the burly dreamer released borak who immediately returned to his task of filling the lamps aghast eldin turned his suddenly pale face to nyrass and the wizard smiled his sad wan smile and said and are you satisfied now eldin the wanderer or would your punishment have been greater than mine no answer came neither from eldin nor from the others and so nyrass nodded and said very well now men if you will please follow me into the final chamber and here at last you shall see the shewstone prison of the mad first one the final room had nothing of the opulence of the oth hero of dreams ers it was the wizards workshop and made no pretense to be anything else benches littered with complicated apparatus were set against two of the cold stone walls the flags of the floor were of unadorned stone the ceiling had been blackened in places by strange fires and several supporting columns were stained with oddlycolored marks and splashes one wall was covered with scrawled signs and symbols while another was hung with a great mirror whose bronze frame was of rearing krakens but in the very center of the roomupon a stone table whose base was bolted to the floorthere stood the shewstone of which nyrass had spoken and without preamble he led his guests to it the glass globe was smokyblue big as a large skull perfectly roundand completely opaque what grunted eldin peering into the veiled heart of die globe and seeing nothing what and is this the supposed home of the tenth first one letting eldin peer nyrass turned to hero and aminza your friend is a hard man to convince he wryly commented but i can understand his disappointment it must be very hard to have come so far only to be thwarted at the last he turned back to eldin would you truly spy upon klarekyam in his globe he asked that i would replied eldin if only to be sure hes in there very well it shall be done i long ago devised a means by use of which i might know what klarekyam was about lately i have not used it frankly ive feared to learn what fresh marvels he has discovered toward making his escape but now since your curiosity demands it he went to a bench and took up a slender runecarved rod of wood more nearly the shape and size that the adventurers would expect of a true wand and with this in hand turned to the great mirror where it hung on its wall brian lumley the mirror is my window on the tiny world of the mad first one he explained and my wand is the cord with which i draw the curtains and he tapped gently upon the krakenadorned glass with the wands tip a thin beam of light so intense as to seem almost a solid shaft of silver leapt the distance from the shewstone to the mirror which in the same instant was no longer a mirror but a picture of such marvelous clarity that it seemed the glass itself had become a doorway through which nyrass and his guests might step into the scene beyond the scene itselfwhen the adventurers had recovered their senses sufficiently to lookwas of a room much like the very room in which they stood with benches and books chemical and alchemical apparatus and walls literally covered with scrawled glyphs and symbols of every esoteric connection and yet no one was present in that room and nothing stirred oh said eldin after a while his voice less blustery than normal and wheres klarekyam you see those arched doorways answered nyrass klarekyam is in one of the many rooms beyond try not to be impatient for he rarely absents himself from his experiments for very long he has only one ambitionto be out of the shewstone and about his insane taskwhich means that he must constantly try and try again to find a means by which to free himself you see all of those great books there that was soomus one oversight that those tomes of magic were locked in the sphere with klarekyam as nyrass finished speaking something moved in the shadow of a doorway to the right of the scene at which the adventurers crowded closer a figure manlike in outline or so it seemed clad in a hooded robe like the cowled cassock of some monkish order entered the picture and hero of dreams turned toward a bench whereon a massive blackbound book lay open at a page of glowing symbols eldin moving still closer to the mirror accidentally disturbed a small glass flask where it stood upon a bench the flask fell to the floor and shattered loudly nyrass guests froze on the instant but the wizard seemed not at all perturbed he cant hear you he told them though certainly hell see us if he turns mis way he too has a mirror you see so that this room of mine is transparent to him as his is to me he looks much like a man this klarekyam said hero his voice a whisper despite nyrass assurance that the first one could not hear him i did not picture the first ones as being so manlike they are not said nyrass with a shudder be thankful he wears his robe for beneatii it is a monsterat least in our eyes be thankful too that with this sole exception the first ones are good as their aspect is evil even as nyrass spoke the grayrobed figure in the mirrorroom turned and looked directly at the four where they stood eldin took a hasty step to the rear as aminza threw her arms about his burly neck and gave a little shriek heros eyes went wide and the flesh began to crawl on his arms and back only nyrass remained unmoved and he nodded an accustomed greeting to the creature who gazed out of the mirror at him klarekyam nodded back an almost imperceptible movement of his hooded head and continued to stare they could only see the first ones eyes but that was quite sufficient they flared and sputtered like yellow pits of hell those eyeslike great gaping sockets in a skull and the intensity of their gaze was such that it gnawed at the very souls of the adventurers where they stared back well said nyrass after a moment shattering the si brian lumley lence and causing his guests to start in shock and shall we try a little experiment of our own for i didnt come all the way down here simply to satisfy your curiosity my young friends no indeed this may be the end of your quest but its only the beginning of mine what do you mean nyrass asked hero his voice a little croaky from the sudden clamminess of his mouth why simply that youve brought me the wands i need to strengthen soomus barrier about klarekyam of course at least that is how i plan to use them in the very near futurewith your permission hero and aminza at once reached inside their shirts and produced their wands and so swift was their reaction to nyrass request that he was given no chance to check them in any case his interest still centered upon the figure of klarekyam where the first one stood in his mirrorroom and so he only became aware of their deadly blunder through the immediate change in the visage of the monster beyond the mirror not just now cried nyrass staggering back away from the krakenglass his mouth falling open in horror as he saw the wands in heros and aminzas hands but already he was far too late for as each new descendant of soomus had become klarekyams keeper down the eons so had the mad first one sworn vengeance on the whole human racein the dreamlands and in the waking world alike and in all those countless years he had dreamed of this moment many thousands of times when at last he would be able to use his eonwon dark knowledge to the full through the medium of the wands of power thus in that instant before nyrass cried out klarekyam had ripped from his robe the third wandhad produced it and held it up to the mirror in his microscopic hero of dreams apartments in the shewstoneand at his command there commenced a rapid and irreversible sequence of events beams of silver light flashed from his wand thwugh the mirror and sped to the wands in the hands of the two adventurers hero and aminza were hurled backward across the room the wands snatched from them by an irresistible force and as the silver beams withdrew through the mirror so the wands went with them now klarekyam once more possessed all three wands and now too he could use them in his eonplotted fashion lathis wand would provide the power needed by his own rod to melt the spacetime barrier which surrounded him and thinistors wand would guide him through me warp and into the land of earths dreams the crazed first one seemed to swell outward then filled with a terrible strength he threw off his robe held up the wands in triumph and for one mad moment stood fully revealeda gray upright slug with corrugated skin and tentacles for armsbefore the mirror shivered into a thousand fragments as that occurred so nyrass shewstone also disintegrated with a roar that shook the room and tossed wizard and dreamers alike against the walls like so many rag dolls and when the reverberations of that great blast died away there stood klarekyam free at last amidst shattered stone fragments where once the prison crystal had stood upon its table his tentacles writhed namelessly and his eyes blazed hideously in his slugs head as he peered about the still smoking room and in a moment his gaze alighted upon the figure of the wizard nyrass where he struggled to his feet in a uttered corner nyrass came a great croak like the massed grunting of toads spawn of soomus now feel the wrath of klarekyam now journey where no being or thing ever journeyed before and never shall again brian lumley the alien abomination pointed all three tentaclewrapped wands at the halfstunned stumbling wizard and in that same instant a greenclad figure entered the room took in the scene at a glance threw himself headlong between the crazed first one and the helpless form of his master unsmiling for once ebraim borak took the full burst of eerie energy which klarekyam now released for a single instant the ossarans outline seemed to pulse and glowand then his empty green robe crumpled formlessly to the floor by now hero and eldin were on their feet swords drawn their faces feardrained masks as they staggered toward klarekyam in their shocked condition they were no threat to the first one and he knew it he ignored them and realigned his wands upon nyrass then klarekyam uttered a single astonished croaking shriek as the tentacle which held the wands withered blackened and turned to ashes and smoke in an instant his other appendages immediately followed suit and the circular mouth in his rubbery head was all set to frame a second cry when the incredibly swift corruption caught up with it also turning his head to motes of colored dust and only a column of writhing vilesmelling smoke remained where the maniac first one had stood the entiredecompositionof klarekyams being had been so rapid that the falling wands had not yet clattered to the floor when the thing was over and done with it was soomus saved us nyrass told them much later when they had returned to the higher less claustrophobic regions of the castle and to think i have underrated my ancestor all these many years i might have known hed foresee klarekyams eventual escape and take precautions against it his method was simple really so long as klarekyam remained within his shewstone prison he was nearimmortal but if ever he left it hero of dreams all of those unnumbered centuries would catch up with him eh guessed hero exactly and so ancient was the mad first one that he should have been dust a quarterbillion years ago but what of the rest of the first ones queried aminza the nine who lie sleeping in the great keep high in the mountains will they too decay and fly into dust when the keeper rouses them up no child not them nyrass shook his old head the magic which holds them in thrall is the magic of science that of my ancestor soomus he shrugged that was onlymagic well well said eldin so klarekyams bottleworld was nothing really but a miniature shangrila eh shangrila frowned hero as at hearing the name of some dimly distant all but forgotten place er yes said eldin knowledgeably but he nevertheless matched heros frown its er a valley that lies beyond the onyx columns of the south you think cried hero and aminza together and they all three laughed out loud when the skepers wake chapter iv they stood atop the castles tallest turret in the morning sunlight all three of them clean bright and rested after four days and nights of leisurely living as nyrass guests and at his expense the wizard would have it no other way for in his own words the adventurers had given him a new lease on life truth to tell they had given all of earths dreamland a new lease on life or at least extended indefinitely the one it already had dreamlandthe waking worldthe universe itself owed them a debt which probably never would be acknowledged and certainly never repaid the least nyrass could do was to offer them his hospitality which they had gladly accepted for four nearidyllic days the season of mists was past and the spring sun warm the castles gardens were expansive and its grass soft and lush their apartments had been more than adequately appointed and their food the very best that nyrass could conjure indeed they believed he had conjured it from somewhere for never before in all the towns and cities of their wanderings had they known the like of such wonderful meats fruits and wines now replete and revitalized packs upon their backs brian lumley they were ready to move on but the last teg of their journeytheir mode of conveyancewas to be the strangest yet their nightmare nde on the reedtree raft even their flight on the great trees lifeleaf would be as nothing by comparison for this time with nyrass aid their trip would be sheer magic not the magic of wizards and sorcerers no but the magic of science the science of the first ones quite simply they would return to the great keep in the mountains via the three wands of power as to how this could be achieved nyrass gave die adventurers his complete assurance that the trip would be painless trouble free and instantaneous one second they would be here atop this high turret and the next all that was required of hero and eldin was that they close their eyes open their minds and think of that secret room deep in the heart of the keep nyrass would do his bit of course and the wandsthey would do the rest now the three said their farewells to nyrass and formed a triangle they linked arms each holding tight to a wand and witii a final glance at the old magician closed their eyes the men concentrated on the keeps inner room aminza simply centered her mind upon staying with them and nyrass unified the forces ah three adventurers felt a moments dizziness they staggered a little opened their eyes and staggered again but much more violently this second time who dares enter the keep unbidden roared the keeper the lights of his panel tinged red with anger and moving in jerky agitation oh not you again eldin roared back almost as loudly diough more from shock than bravado hero of dreams for goodness sake relax keeper cried hero his ears ringing its only us oh and aminza too for a moment there was a sort of stunned silence as die lights on the voicepanel rapidly ran dirough the entire range of the color spectrum then david hero and eldin the wanderer said the keeper in a kind of halfmechanical astonishment and the girl of whom you spoke aminza anz youve returned and not through the door which means and the keepers voice rose almost to a whine which means aminzas eyes were wide and worried as she stared all about youll do yourself an injury she was moved to cry whoever you are an injury the keeper cried in a delirium of color do myself an injury you will she asserted nodding her head that doesn t matter answered the keeper nothing matters except you have the wands we have the wands yes said hero a sudden hiss of compressed air heralded the opening of a small door in the rooms central control panel in the opening thus revealed electrical fires like miniaturized bolts of forked lightning crackled continuously in a darkness deep as the spaces between the stars just inside the door however where the metal frame ended and the alien darkness began three evenlyspaced empty sockets were visible holes that merged with die inner nothingness and went nowhere the wands urged the keeper in a blaze of gold and green place the wands in the sockets one at a time starting at the left first thinistors wand almost of its own accord as if the wand moved hero and not the reverse thinistors wand slotted into its hole and was instantly gripped and held fast hero released its knob jumped back stood well away from that bottomless brian lumley pool of darkness and its lightningflash denizens and immediately those small lightnings lost something of their aimlessness and crackled more certainly wow the sourcewand cried the keeper in a throbbing pulse of purple the wand with the golden glow aminza stepped forward her hand trembling as she placed the naked end of lathis wand into its socketuntil she too felt the stem gripped as the wand was accepted hero caught her as she stepped backward a little off balance finally the keepers voice was now a whisper of dull red and yellow the warpwand no answered eldin backing away with klarekyams wand gripped tight in his hand not yet keeper do it nowat once the keeper roared in a blaze of white anger and what of your promise shouted eldin in return what of our reward more to the point what happens when i place this last wand in its socket why then i wake the sleepers said the keeper as for your rewardsyou shall have them never fear now the wand eldin looked at hero and they both turned to the girl its what were here for she said again hero and eldin exchanged searching looks but at last the older dreamer stepped forward approached the open door and held out the third wand the alien energies were alive now and full of purpose crackling in their cave of ultimate darkness the weird lightnings seemed to guide the stem of klarekyams wand into its slot almost snatching it from eldins fingers the door in the control panel hissed shut with an impossible speed and eldin falling back away from it was grabbed hold of and steadied by his friends a tremendous rumbling purr now welled up in that room of strange hero of dreams metal setting the softtextured floor athrob beneath their feet in the wall of the room the great entrance gave a hiss which the dreamers remembered of old and now the exit gaped open as it had when the keeper first sent them upon their quest go said the keeper leave the keep at once what howled eldin outraged almost beyond reason what of your promise ask no questionssimply obey ordered the keeper his voice full strong and sure damn you to hell keeper cried hero as he and aminza dragged eldin forcibly toward the open portal you lied and cheated and robbed us fools came the keepers answer my masters are stirring would you wish to be here when they start awake now the anger went out of the faces of the dreamers in an instant was replaced by the pallid mask of fear to be here when the sleeping first ones awakened to see them walk abroad benevolent they may well bebut on whose authority the word of the keeper of an old friendly wizard in theelys and their almost limitless power their otter alienage go roared the keeper again as they crossed the doors threshold and it hissed shut behind them and in the exterior tunnel the echo of that final command comingled with the steadily increasing hum and throb came back to them again and again where they trembled in darkness stand still both of you grunted eldin recovering from his rage he slipped out of his pack found his firestones and quickly fashioned a torch of rags tied to the blade of his straight sword then by the uneven light of eldins makeshift brand the three set about to make their exit from the keep knowing the wayurged on by a rumbling which set brian lumley the entire keep shaking and by the thought of the first ones probably awake and moving in the keep even nowthey made light work of the maze of pitfalls and traps suddenly speed was of the essence and the faster they went the faster they wanted to go mercifully the gravitypit had lost its dreadful pull so that they were able to cross its bonestrewn previously musclewrenching valley at a run and eldins expertise with a tossed grapple never faltered when they reached the far wall then more of the maze and the lighting of a second torch more pitfalls and pivoting slabs and echoing rockcut tunnels and the rumbling growing to a roar of barelyconstrained power and pictures in the minds of the three of sentient corrugated upright gray shapes with yellow pits for eyes andwhatfor souls and at last the blessed light and the vertiginous climb down to the surface of the plateau and for all their haste never a slip or a foot wrongly placed as they completed the climb and set off at a breathless stumbling run for the cave under the overhang where once they had battled thinistor udd and the monstrous living idol he worshipped and finally as they ran so hero gasped out what all three were thinking were fools fools what did we ever really know eh the tenth first one mad well he may have beenbut who can say for certain what is madness to a first one anyway youre right lad eldin grunted for all we know klarekyam might have been the only sane one and mad or sane how do we know how the nine feel about klarekyam gasped aminza i meani mean we know what you mean aminza said hero we killed himor at least we had a hand in it now where the overhang of the cliffs sheltered them they stopped running and turned to look back at the keep of the first ones even at that distance the rumbling could hero of dreams be heard and faint tremors reached the adventurers through the plateaus rock great boulders were dislodged from the keeps face and thundered down onto the shuddering plateaus shelf like so many pebbles the very air seemed to jounce and tremble and dustdevils rose up everywhere in weirdlydancing spirals look gasped aminza a moment later but her companions were already looking and the hair on their heads pnckled in preternatural dread as down from the keep snaked something which they had thought never to see again something last seen here in this very spot at die end of the running battle with yibbtstll it was a greenly weaving ribbon of light a snakelike stream of glowing phosphorescent particles that moved like a blindworm over and across the vast rocky shelf nodding the head of the eerie stream came to an abrupt halt as it crossed the path taken by the adventurers when they ran from the keep then the throats of the three grew dry for like some great hound on the trail of blood the blindly glowing snake of green light began to follow their track moving faster as it sped toward them across the plateau in another moment it reared over them dippedenveloped them you are fearful said a voice from nowhere a voice sweet and gentle as klarekyams had been harsh and evil an ethereal yet vibrant voice which seemed to have its source all about them and inside them at one and the same time we do not wish you to be afraid the keeper made certain promises they shall be kept eldin the wanderer what do you most desire me eldin licked his lips and nervously thumbed his chest you want to know what i come come eldin name your reward commanded the voice brian lumley slowly the older dreamers eyes widened and a grin spread over his face i want he began riches prompted the voice no he slowly shook his head ive no real use for riches i want a city at my feet where the people will love me the lords greet me as an equal and the younger men envy me is that all then you shall have itsoon and you aminza anz what is your wish only to go back where i belong she answered immediately and in a small voice where you belong home she nodded you too shall have your wishsoon and you david hero how may we reward youbut be quick for we may not linger here now i want a dreamname said hero nothing more nothing he shook his head im sick of being just just any old dreamer i feel im a part of earths dreamland now and so want to belong for a moment there was only the weaving of the green glow all around and then that allenveloping voice said you are three rare people and through your actions all of your dreamland is safe once more you are adventurers but more than that you are heroes real heroes you desire a dreamname david very well you shall have one the voice paused for a moment and hero waited expectantly occasionally rarely a man from the waking world is allowed to keep his waking name for proper use in earths dreamland so be it henceforth you shall be david herohero of dreams the green light disappeared blinked out in a moment and left the three stumbling on a plateau which trembled hero of dreams and shook as if in the grip of an earthquake they hung onto each other gazed at the keep saw the gigantic crack that widened all along the sides of its base more boulders tumbled loose and fell thunderously from keep to rockstrewn shelf and the keepthat entire titanic cube of rocklifted slowly into the air in a massive shimmering of energy one moment it was there clear of the ground by at least a quarter of its own height and still rising and the next gone gone hero gasped back through the gates they used the wands growled etdin the keys we brought them gone whispered aminza but gone where although they stood for a long while and stared across the flat and empty plateau aminzas question remained unanswered i epilogue hero rode from ilekvad along the shore of the twilight sea he rode alone and sadly sad for all that his yak was a fine strong beast and its saddle of tooled leather with silver trappings and despite the fact that his robe was new and rich his saddle bags fully provisioned and his purse crammed with gold he was a man alone whose only desire had been to belong he cast back in his thoughts remembering the journey which had brought him and his friends through the spring and into the summer and all across dreamland to ilekvad there aminzas foster family had greeted their longlost child deliriously eldin with open arms and hero with the greatest kindness and hospitality then eldin had received his reward with all ilekvad at his feet and his name on the lips of die citys thousands eldin the wanderer who had brought back aminza anz one of ilekvads rarest flowers longstolen by a nightgaunt and aminza she had received her reward too hadnt she she was home now back where she belonged hero had not stayed for the wedding he found reasons enough to refuse the honor of being best man and no one had seen him slip away at least he had his dreamname brian lumley and a name to be proud of at that hero of dreams cold comfort he reined in and stared a while down from silicon cliffs into the deep waters of the twilight sea the bearded and finny gnorri swam down there flitting shadows that worked unceasingly on their submarine labyrinths they were strange and they were silent but they were not alone hero turned his yaks head back to the trail and as he did so a distant stirring of dust attracted his eyes way back on the track he had taken from the city heading his way a rider stood up in the saddle and waved frantically a fellow traveler most likely who sought company along the way hero desired no company companions were insubstantial things that came and went like moonshadows on a cloudy night he looked ahead not back and spurred his yak to greater speed then a cry reached his ears on the still noonday air and he quickly reined in he still didnt look back at the distant speck which grew larger behind him he didnt look didnt believe his ears were playing him false they must be and again the cry a hoarse distancethinned shout now recognizing the voice his heart gave a great leap inside him he turned at last screwed up his eyes against the bright summer sun and yes he was right it couldnt be but it was eldin officer commanding traffic section edinburgh central major traffic accident addendum to police report ta
