born in shame by nora roberts prologue amanda dreamed dreadful dreams colin was there his sweet wellloved face crushed with sorrow mandy he said he never called her anything but mandy his mandy my mandy darling mandy but thered been no smile in his voice no laugh in his eyes mandy we cant stop it i wish we could mandy my mandy i miss you so but i never thought youd have to come so soon after me our little girl its so hard for her and itll get harder you have to tell her you know he smiled then but it was sad so sad and his body his face that had seemed so solid so close that shed reached out in sleep to touch him began to fade and shimmer away you have to tell her he repeated we always knew you would she needs to know where she comes from who she is but tell her mandy tell her never to forget that i loved her i loved my little girl oh dont go colin she moaned in her sleep pining for him stay with me i love you colin my sweet colin i love you for all you are but she couldnt bring him back and couldnt stop the dream oh how lovely to see ireland again she thought drifting like mist over the green hills she remembered from so long ago see the river gleam like a ribbon all silver and bright around a gift without price and there was tommy darling tommy waiting for her turning to smile at her to welcome her why was there such grief here when she was back and felt so young so vibrant so in love i thought id never see you again her voice was breathless with a laugh on the edges of it tommy ive come back to you he seemed to stare at her no matter how she tried she could get no closer than an arm span away from him but she could hear his voice as clear and sweet as ever i love you amanda always never has a day passed that i havent thought of you and remembered what we found here he turned in her dream to look out over the river where the banks were green and soft and the water quiet you named her for the river for the memory of the days we had shes so beautiful tommy so bright so strong youd be proud i am proud and how i wish but it couldnt be we knew it you knew it he sighed turned back you did well for her amanda never forget that but youre leaving her now the pain of that and what youve held inside all these years makes it so hard you have to tell her give her her birthright and let her know somehow let her know that i loved her and would have shown her if i could i cant do it alone she thought struggling out of sleep as his image faded away oh dear god dont make me do it alone mom gently though her hands shook shannon stroked her mothers sweaty face mom wake up its a dream a bad dream she understood what it was to be tortured by dreams and knew how to fear wakingas she woke every morning now afraid her mother would be gone there was desperation in her voice not now she prayed not yet you need to wake up shannon theyre gone theyre both of them gone taken from me ssh dont cry please dont cry open your eyes now and look at me amandas lids fluttered open her eyes swam with grief im sorry so sorry i did only what i thought right for you i know of course you did she wondered frantically if the delirium meant the cancer was spreading to the brain wasnt it enough that it had her mothers bones she cursed the greedy disease and cursed god but her voice was soothing when she spoke its all right now im here im with you with an effort amanda drew a long steadying breath visions swam in her headcolin tommy her darling girl how anguished shannons eyes werehow shattered they had been when shed first come back to columbus its all right now amanda would have done anything to erase that dread in her daughters eyes of course youre here im so glad youre here and so sorry darling so sorry i have to leave you ive frightened you im sorry i frightened you it was truethe fear was a metallic taste in the back of her throat but shannon shook her head to deny it she was almost used to fear now it had ridden on her back since shed picked up the phone in her office in new york and been told her mother was dying are you in pain no no dont worry amanda sighed again though there was pain hideous pain she felt stronger needed to with what she was about to face in the few short weeks shannon had been back with her shed kept the secret buried as she had all of her daughters life but she would have to open it now there wasnt much time could i have some water darling of course shannon picked up the insulated pitcher near the bed filled a plastic glass then offered the straw to her mother carefully she adjusted the back of the hospitalstyle bed to make amanda more comfortable the living room in the lovely house in columbus had been modified for hospice care it had been amandas wish and shannons that she come home for the end there was music playing on the stereo softly the book shannon had brought into the room with her to read aloud had fallen where shed dropped it in panic she bent to retrieve it fighting to hold on when she was alone she told herself there was improvement that she could see it every day but she had only to look at her mother see the graying skin the lines of pain the gradual wasting to know better there was nothing to do now but make her mother comfortable to depend bitterly on the morphine to dull the pain that was never completely vanquished she needed a minute shannon realized as panic began to bubble in her throat just a minute alone to pull her weary courage together im going to get a nice cool cloth for your face thank you and that amanda thought as shannon hurried away would give her enough time please god to choose the right words chapter one amanda had been preparing for this moment for years knowing it would come wishing it wouldnt what was fair and right to one of the men she loved was an injustice to the other whichever way she chose but it was neither of them she could concern herself with now nor could she brood over her own shame there was only shannon to think of shannon to hurt for her beautiful brilliant daughter who had never been anything but a joy to her a pride to her the pain rippled through her like a poisoned stream but she gritted her teeth there would be hurt now for what would happen soon from what had happened all those years ago in ireland with all her heart she wished she could find some way to dull it she watched her daughter come back in the quick graceful movements the nervous energy beneath moves like her father amanda thought not colin dear sweet colin had lumbered clumsy as an overgrown pup but tommy had been light on his feet shannon had tommys eyes too the vivid moss green clear as a lake in the sun the rich chestnut hair that swung silkily to her chin was another legacy from ireland still amanda liked to think that the shape of her daughters face the creamy skin and the soft full mouth had been her own gifts but it was colin bless him who had given her determination ambition and a steady sense of self she smiled as shannon bathed her clammy face i havent told you enough how proud you make me shannon of course you have no i let you see i was disappointed you didnt choose to paint that was selfish of me i know better than most that a womans path must be her own you never tried to talk me out of going to new york or moving into commercial art and i do paint still she added with a bolstering smile ive nearly finished a still life i think youll like why hadnt she brought the canvas with her damn it why hadnt she thought to pack up some paints even a sketchbook so that she could have sat with her mother and given her the pleasure of watching thats one of my favorites there amanda gestured to the portrait on the parlor wall the one of your father sleeping in the chaise in the garden gearing himself up to mow the lawn shannon said with a chuckle setting the cloth aside she took the seat beside the bed and every time we said why didnt he hire a lawn boy hed claim that he enjoyed the exercise and go out and fall asleep he never failed to make me laugh i miss that she brushed a hand over shannons wrist i know you miss him too i still think hes going to come busting in the front door mandy shannon hed say get on your best dresses ive just made my client ten thousand on the market and were going out to dinner he did love to make money amanda mused it was such a game to him never dollars and cents never greed or selfishness there just the fun of it like the fun he had moving from place to place every couple of years lets shake this town mandy what do you say we try colorado or memphis she shook her head on a laugh oh it was good to laugh to pretend for just a little while they were only talking as they always had finally when we moved here i told him id played gypsy long enough this was home he settled down as if hed only been waiting for the right time and place he loved this house shannon murmured so did i i never minded the moving around he always made it an adventure but i remember about a week after wed settled in sitting up in my room and thinking that i wanted to stay this time she smiled over at her mother i guess we all felt the same way hed have moved mountains for you fought tigers amandas voice trembled before she steadied it do you know shannon really know how much he loved you yes she lifted her mothers hand pressed it to her cheek i do know remember it always remember it ive things to tell you shannon that may hurt you make you angry and confused im sorry for it she drew a breath thered been more in the dream than the love and the grief there had been urgency amanda knew she wouldnt have even the stingy three weeks the doctor had promised her mom i understand but theres still hope theres always hope its nothing to do with this she said lifting a hand to encompass the temporary sickroom its from before darling long before when i went with a friend to visit ireland and stayed in county clare i never knew youd been to ireland it struck shannon as odd to think of it all the traveling we did i always wondered why we never went there with you and dad both having irish roots and ive always felt this connection this odd sort of pull have you amanda said softly its hard to explain shannon murmured feeling foolish for she wasnt a woman to speak of dreams she smiled ive always told myself if i ever took time for a long vacation thats where id go but with the promotion and the new account she shrugged off the idea of an indulgence anyway i remember whenever i brought up going to ireland youd shake your head and say there were so many other places to see i couldnt bear to go back and your father understood amanda pressed her lips together studying her daughters face will you stay here beside me and listen and oh please please try to understand there was a new and fresh frisson of fear creeping up shannons spine what could be worse than death she wondered and why was she so afraid to hear it but she sat keeping her mothers hand in hers youre upset she began you know how important it is for you to keep calm and use productive imagery amanda said with a hint of smile it can work mind over matter so much of what ive been reading i know even the wisp of a smile was gone now when i was a few years older than you i traveled with a good friendher name was kathleen reillyto ireland it was a grand adventure for us we were grown women but we had both come from strict families so strict so sure that i was more than thirty before i had the gumption to make such a move she turned her head so that she could watch shannons face as she spoke you wouldnt understand that youve always been sure of yourself and brave but when i was your age i hadnt even begun to struggle my way out of cowardice youve never been a coward oh but i was amanda said softly i was my parents were lacecurtain irish righteous as three popes their biggest disappointmentmore for reasons of prestige than religionwas that none of their children had the calling but you were an only child shannon interrupted one of the truths i broke i told you i had no family let you believe there was no one but i had two brothers and a sister and not a word has there been between us since before you were born but why shannon caught herself im sorry go on you were always a good listener your father taught you that she paused a moment thinking of colin praying that what she was about to do was right for all of them we werent a close family shannon there was a a stiffness in our house a rigidness of rules and manners it was over fierce objections that i left home to travel to ireland with kate but we went as excited as schoolgirls on a picnic to dublin first then on following our maps and our noses i felt free for the first time in my life it was so easy to bring it all back amanda realized even after all these years that shed suppressed those memories they could swim back now as clear and pure as water kates giggling laugh the cough of the tiny car theyd rented the wrong turns and the right ones theyd made and her first awed look of the sweep of hills the spear of cliffs of the west the sense of coming home shed never expected and had never felt again we wanted to see all we could see and when wed reached the west we found a charming inn that overlooked the river shannon we settled there decided we could make it a sort of base while we drove here and there on day trips the cliffs of mohr galway the beach at ballybunnion and all the little fascinating places you find off the roads where you least expect them she looked at her daughter then and her eyes were sharp and bright oh i wish you would go there see feel for yourself the magic of the place the sea spewing like thunder up on the cliffs the green of the fields the way the air feels when its raining so soft and gentleor when the wind blows hard from the atlantic and the light its like a pearl just brushed with gold here was love shannon thought puzzled and a longing shed never suspected but you never went back no amanda sighed i never went back do you ever wonder darling how it is that a person can plan things so carefully all but see how things will be the next day and the next then some small something happens some seemingly insignificant something and the pattern shifts its never quite the same again it wasnt a question so much as a statement so shannon simply waited wondering what small something had changed her mothers pattern the pain was trying to creep back cunningly amanda closed her eyes a moment concentrating on beating it she would hold it off she promised herself until she had finished what shed begun one morningit was late summer now and the rain came and went fitfulkate was feeling poorly she decided to stay in rest in bed for the day read a bit and pamper herself i was restless a feeling in me that there were places i had to go so i took the car and i drove without planning it i took myself to loop head i could hear the waves crashing as i got out of the car and walked toward the cliffs the wind was blowing humming through the grass i could smell the ocean and the rain there was a power there drumming in the air even as the surf drummed on the rocks i saw a man she continued slowly now standing where the land fell away to the sea he was looking out over the water into the rainwest toward america there was no one else but him hunched in his wet jacket a dripping cap low over his eyes he turned as if hed only been waiting for me and he smiled suddenly shannon wanted to stand to tell her mother it was time to stop to rest to do anything but continue her hands had curled themselves into fists without her being aware there was a larger tighter one lodged in her stomach he wasnt young amanda said softly but he was handsome there was something so sad so lost in his eyes he smiled and said good morning and what a fine day it was as the rain beat on our head and the wind slapped our faces i laughed for somehow it was a fine day and though id grown used to the music of the brogue of western ireland his voice was so charming i knew i could go on listening to it for hours so we stood there and talked about my travels about america he was a farmer he said a bad one and he was sorry for that as he had two baby daughters to provide for but there was no sadness in his face when he spoke of them it lit his maggie mae and brie he called them and about his wife he said little the sun came out amanda said with a sigh it came out slow and lovely as we stood there sort of slipping through the clouds in little streams of gold we walked along the narrow paths talking as if wed known each other all our lives and i fell in love with him on the high thundering cliffs it should have frightened me she glanced at shannon tentatively reached out a hand it did shame me for he was a married man with children but i thought it was only me who felt it and how much sin can there be in the soul of an old maid dazzled by a handsome man in one morning it was with relief she felt her daughters fingers twine with hers but it wasnt only me whod felt it we saw each other again oh innocently enough at a pub back on the cliffs and once he took both me and kate to a little fair outside of ennis it couldnt stay innocent we werent children either of us and what we felt for each other was so huge so important and you must believe me so right kate knewanyone who looked at us could have seen itand she talked to me as a friend would but i loved him and id never been so happy as when he was with me never once did he make promises dreams we had but there were no promises between us he was bound to his wife who had no love for him and to the children he adored she moistened her dry lips took another sip from the straw when shannon wordlessly offered the glass amanda paused again for it would be harder now i knew what i was doing shannon indeed it was more my doing than his when we became lovers he was the first man to touch me and when he did at last it was with such gentleness such care such love that we wept together afterward for we knew wed found each other too late and it was hopeless still we made foolish plans he would find a way to leave his wife provided for and bring his daughters to me in america where wed be a family the man desperately wanted family as i did wed talk together in that room overlooking the river and pretend that it was forever we had three weeks and every day was more wonderful than the last and more wrenching i had to leave him and ireland he told me he would stand at loop head where wed met and look out over the sea to new york to me his name was thomas concannon a farmer who wanted to be a poet did you shannons voice was rusty and unsteady did you ever see him again no i wrote him for a time and he answered pressing her lips together amanda stared into her daughters eyes soon after i returned to new york i learned i was carrying his child shannon shook her head quickly the denial instinctive the fear huge pregnant her heart began to beat thick and fast she shook her head again and tried to draw her hand away for she knew without another word being said she knew and refused to know no i was thrilled amandas grip tightened though it cost her from the first moment i was sure i was thrilled i never thought i would have a child that i would find someone who loved me enough to give me that gift oh i wanted that child loved it thanked god for it what sadness and grief i had came from knowing i would never be able to share with tommy the beauty that had come from our loving each other his letter to me after id written him of it was frantic he would have left his home and come to me he was afraid for me and what i was facing alone i knew he would have come and it tempted me but it was wrong shannon as loving him was never wrong so i wrote him a last time lied to him for the first time and told him i wasnt afraid nor alone and that i was going away youre tired shannon was desperate to stop the words her world was tilting and she had to fight to right it again youve talked too long its time for your medicine he would have loved you amanda said fiercely if hed had the chance in my heart i know he loved you without ever laying eyes on you stop she did rise then pulling away pushing back there was a sickness rising inside her and her skin felt so cold and thin i dont want to hear this i dont need to hear this you do im sorry for the pain it causes you but you need to know it all i did leave she went on quickly my family was shocked furious when i told them i was pregnant they wanted me to go away give you up quietly discreetly so that there would be no scandal and shame i would have died before giving you up you were mine and you were tommys there were horrible words in that house threats ultimatums they disowned me and my father being a clever man of business blocked my bank account so that i had no claim on the money that had been left to me by my grandmother money was never a game to him you see it was power i left that house with never a regret with the money i had in my wallet and a single suitcase shannon felt as though she were underwater struggling for air but the image came clearly through it of her mother young pregnant nearly penniless carrying a single suitcase there was no one to help you kate would have and i knew shed suffer for it this had been my doing what shame there was was mine what joy there was was mine i took a train north and i got a job waiting tables at a resort in the catskills and there i met colin bodine amanda waited while shannon turned away and walked to the dying fire the room was quiet with only the hiss of embers and the brisk wind at the windows to stir it but beneath the quiet she could feel the storm the one swirling inside the child she loved more than her own life already she suffered knowing that storm was likely to crash over both of them he was vacationing with his parents i paid him little mind he was just one more of the rich and privileged i was serving he had a joke for me now and again and i smiled as was expected my mind was on my work and my pay and on the child growing inside me then one afternoon there was a thunderstorm a brute of one a good many of the guests chose to stay indoors in their rooms and have their lunch brought to them i was carrying a tray hurrying to one of the cabins for there would be trouble if the food got cold and the guest complained of it and colin conies barreling around a corner wet as a dog and flattens me how clumsy he was bless him tears burned behind shannons eyes as she stared down into the glowing embers he said that was how he met you by knocking you down so he did and we always told you what truths we felt we could he sent me sprawling in the mud with the tray of food scattering and ruined he started apologizing trying to help me up all i could see was that food spoiled and my back aching from carrying those heavy trays and my legs so tired of holding the rest of me up i started to cry just sat there in the mud and cried and cried and cried i couldnt stop even when he lifted me up and carried me to his room i couldnt stop he was so sweet sat me down on a chair despite the mud covered me with a blanket and sat there patting my hand till the tears ran out i was so ashamed of myself and he was so kind he wouldnt let me leave until id promised to have dinner with him it should have been romantic and sweet shannon thought while her breath began to hitch but it wasnt it was hideous he didnt know you were pregnant amanda winced as much from the accusation in the words as she did from a fresh stab of pain no not then i was barely showing and careful to hide it or i would have lost my job times were different then and an unmarried pregnant waitress wouldnt have lasted in a rich mans playground you let him fall in love with you shannons voice was cold cold as the ice that seemed slicked over her skin when you were carrying another mans child and the child was me she thought wretched id grown to a woman amanda said carefully searching her daughters face and weeping inside at what she read there and no one had really loved me with tommy it was quick as stunning as a lightning bolt i was still blinded by it when i met colin still grieving over it still wrapped in it everything i felt for tommy was turned toward the child wed made together i could tell you i thought colin was only being kind and in truth at first i did but i saw soon enough that there was more and you let him maybe i could have stopped him amanda said with a long long sigh i dont know every day for the next week there were flowers in my room and the pretty useless things he loved to give he found ways to be with me if i had a tenminute break there he would be still it took me days before i understood i was being courted i was terrified here was this lovely man who was being nothing but kind and he didnt know i had another mans child in me i told him all of it certain it would end there and sorry for that because he was the first friend id had since id left kate in new york he listened in that way he had without interruption without questions without condemnations when i was finished and weeping again he took my hand youd better marry me mandy he said ill take care of you and the baby the tears had escaped ran down shannons cheeks as she turned back they were running down her mothers cheeks as well but she wouldnt allow herself to be swayed by them her world was no longer tilted it had crashed as simple as that how could it have been so simple he loved me it was humbling when i realized he truly loved me i refused him of course what else could i do i thought he was being foolishly gallant or just foolish altogether but he persisted even when i got angry and told him to leave me alone he persisted a smile began to curve her lips as she remembered it it was as if i were the rock and he the wave that patiently endlessly sweeps over it until all resistance is worn away he brought me baby things can you image a man courting a woman by bringing her gifts for her unborn child one day he came to my room told me we were going to get the license now and to get my purse i did it i just did it and found myself married two days later she looked over sharply anticipating the question before it was asked i wont lie to you and tell you i loved him then i did care it was impossible not to care for a man like that and i was grateful his parents were upset naturally enough but he claimed he would bring them around being colin i think he would have but they were killed on their drive home so it was just the two of us and you i promised myself i would be a good wife to him make him a home accept him in bed i vowed not to think of tommy again but that was impossible it took me years to understand there was no sin no shame in remembering the first man id loved no disloyalty to my husband not my father shannon said through lips of ice he was your husband but he wasnt my father oh but he was for the first time there was a hint of temper in amandas voice dont ever say different bitterness edged her voice youve just told me different havent you he loved you while you were still in my womb took both of us as his without hesitation or false pride amanda spoke as quickly as her pain would allow i tell you it shamed me pining for a man i could never have while one as fine as was ever made was beside me the day you were born and i saw him holding you in those big clumsy hands that look of wonder and pride on his face the love in his eyes as he cradled you against him as gently as if you were made of glass i fell in love with him i loved him as much as any woman ever loved any man from that day till this and he was your father as tommy wanted to be and couldnt if either of us had a regret it was that we couldnt have more children to spread the happiness we shared in you you just want me to accept this clinging to anger was less agonizing than clinging to grief shannon stared the woman in bed was a stranger now just as she was a stranger to herself to go on as if it changes nothing i want you to give yourself time to accept and understand and i want you to believe that we loved you all of us her world was shattered at her feet every memory she had every belief shed fostered in jagged shards accept that you slept with a married man and got pregnant then married the first man who asked you to save yourself to accept the lies you told me all my life the deceit youve a right to your anger amanda bit back the pain physical emotional anger do you think what im feeling is as pale as anger god how could you do this she whirled away horror and bitterness biting at her heels how could you have kept this from me all these years let me believe i was someone i wasnt who you are hasnt changed amanda said desperately colin and i did what we thought was right for you we were never sure how or when to tell you we you discussed it swamped by her own churning emotions shannon spun back to the frail woman on the bed there was a horrible shocking urge in her to snatch that shrunken body up shake it is today the day we tell shannon she was a little mistake made on the west coast of ireland or should it be tomorrow not a mistake never a mistake a miracle damn it shannon she broke off gasping as the pain lanced through her stealing her breath tearing like claws her vision grayed she felt a hand lift her head a pill being slipped between her lips and heard the voice of her daughter soothing now sip some water a little more thats it now lie back close your eyes shannon the hand was there to take hers when she reached out im here right here the painll be gone in a minute itll be gone and youll sleep it was already ebbing and the fatigue was rolling in like fog not enough time was all amanda could think why is there never enough time dont hate me she murmured as she slipped under the fog please dont hate me shannon sat weighed down by her own grief long after her mother slept she didnt wake again chapter two an ocean away from where one of tom concannons daughters dealt with the pain of death others celebrated the joys of new life brianna concannon thane cradled her daughter in her arms studying the gorgeous blue eyes with their impossibly long lashes the tiny fingers with their perfect tiny nails the rosebud of a mouth that no one in heaven or on earth could tell her hadnt curved into a smile after less than an hour shed already forgotten the strain and fatigue of labor the sweat of it and even the prickles of fear she had a child shes real grayson thane said it reverently with a hesitant stroke of a fingertip down the babys cheek shes ours he swallowed kayla he thought his daughter kayla and she seemed so small so fragile so helpless do you think shes going to like me peering over his shoulder his sisterinlaw chuckled well we domost of the time she favors you brie maggie decided slipping an arm around grays waist for support her hair will be your color its more russet now but ill wager it turns to your reddish gold before long delighted with the idea brianna beamed she stroked the down on her daughters head found it soft as water do you think maybe shes got my chin gray said hopefully just like a man maggie winked at her husband as rogan sweeney grinned at her across the hospital bed a woman goes through the pregnancy with its queasiness and swollen ankles she waddles about like a cow for months then suffers through the horrors of labor dont remind me of that gray didnt bother to suppress a shudder brianna might have put that aspect of the event behind her but he hadnt it would live in his dreams he was sure for years transition he remembered with horror as a writer hed always thought of it as a simple move from scene to scene hed never think of the word the same way again unable to resist maggie tucked her tongue in her cheek her affection for gray made her honor bound to tease whenever the opportunity arose how many hours was it lets see eighteen eighteen hours of labor for you brie brianna couldnt quite hide a smile as gray began to pale more or less certainly seemed like more at the time with everyone telling me to breathe and poor gray nearly hyperventilating as he demonstrated how i was to go about it a man thinks nothing of whining after putting in eight hours at a desk maggie tossed back her mop of flamecolored hair and still they insist on calling us the weaker sex you wont hear it from me rogan smiled at her being part of kaylas birth had reminded him of the birth of his son and how his wife had fought like a warrior to bring liam into the world still no one thinks of what a father goes through hows your hand doing grayson brows knit gray flexed his fingersthe ones his wife had vised down on during a particularly rough contraction i dont think its broken you held back a yelp manfully maggie remembered but your eyes crossed when she got a good grip on you at least she didnt curse you rogan added lifting a dark elegant brow at his wife the names margaret mary here called me when liam was born were inventive to be sure and unrepeatable you try passing eight pounds sweeney and see what names come to mind and all he says when he takes a look at liam maggie went on is how the boy has his nose and so he does but youre okay now in sudden panic gray looked at his wife she was still a little pale he noted but her eyes were clear again that terrifying glaze of concentration was gone right im fine to comfort she lifted a hand to his face the face she loved with its poets mouth and goldflecked eyes and i wont hold you to your promise never to touch me again as it was given in the heat of the moment with a laugh she nuzzled the baby did you hear him maggie when he shouted at the doctor weve changed our minds he says were not having a baby after all get out of my way im taking my wife home fine for you gray took another chance and skimmed a fingertip over the babys head you didnt have to watch it all this childbirth stuffs rough on a guy and at the sticking point were the least appreciated rogan added when maggie snorted rogan held out a hand for her weve calls to make maggie that we do well look back in on you shortly when they were alone brianna beamed up at him we have a family grayson an hour later grayson was anxious and suspicious when a nurse took the baby away i should go keep an eye on her i dont trust the look in that nurses eyes dont be a worrier da da grinning from ear to ear he looked back at his wife is that what shes going to call me its easy she can probably just about handle it already dont you think oh im sure chuckling brianna cupped his face in her hands as he leaned over to kiss her shes bright as the sun our kayla kayla thane he tried it out grinned again kayla margaret thane the first female president of the united states weve already had a woman president in ireland he added but she can choose whichever she wants you look beautiful brianna he kissed her again surprised all at once that it was absolutely true her eyes were glowing her rosegold hair tumbled around it her face was still a bit pale but he could see that the roses in them were beginning to bloom again and you must be exhausted i should let you sleep sleep she rolled her eyes and pulled him down for another kiss you must be joking i dont think i could sleep for days ive so much energy now what i am is starved half to death id give anything and more for an enormous bookmakers sandwich and a pile of chips you want to eat he blinked at her astonished what a woman maybe after youd like to go out and plow a field i believe ill skip that she said dryly but i havent had a bite in more than twentyfour hours ill remind you do you think you could see if they could bring me a little something hospital food no way not for the mother of my child what a kick that was he realized hed hardly gotten used to saying my wifenow he was saying my child my daughter im going to go get you the best bookmakers sandwich on the west coast of ireland brianna settled back with a laugh as he darted out of the room what a year it had been she thought it had been hardly more than that since shed met him less since shed loved him and now they were a family despite her claims to the contrary her eyes grew heavy and she slipped easily into sleep when she awakened again drifting hazily out of dreams she saw gray sitting on the edge of her bed watching her she was sleeping too he began and since hed already taken her hand in his he brought it to his lips they let me hold her again when i harassed them said a few interesting things about the yank but were pretty indulgent all in all she looked at me brie she looked right at me she knew who i was and she curled her fingersshes got gorgeous fingersshe curled them around mine and held on he broke off a look of sheer panic replacing the dazzled joy youre crying why are you crying something hurts ill get the doctor ill get somebody no sniffling she leaned forward to press her face to his shoulder nothing hurts its only that i love you so much oh you move me grayson looking at your face when you speak of her it touches so deep i didnt know it would be like this he murmured stroking her hair as he cuddled i didnt know it would be so big so incredibly big im going to be a good father he said it with such fervor and such a sweet hint of fear that she laughed i know how could he fail he wondered when she believed in him so completely i brought you a sandwich and some stuff thanks she sat back sniffling again and wiping at her eyes when the tears cleared she blinked again then wept again oh grayson what a wonderful fool you are hed crammed the room with flowers pots and vases and baskets of them with balloons that crowded the ceiling with vivid color and cheerful shapes a huge purple dog stood grinning at the foot of the bed the dogs for kayla he told her pulling out tissues from a box and stuffing them into her hand so dont get any ideas your sandwich is probably cold and i ate some of the chips but theres a piece of chocolate cake in it for you if you dont give me a hard time about it she brushed the fresh tears away i want the cake first you got it whats this feasting already maggie strolled in a bouquet of daffodils in her arms her husband came in behind her his face hidden behind a stuffed bear hello mum rogan sweeney bent over the bed to kiss his sisterinlaw then winked at gray da she was hungry gray said with a grin and im too greedy to share my cake brianna forked up a mouthful of chocolate weve just come from having another peek maggie plopped down on a chair and i can say without prejudice that shes the prettiest babe in the nursery she has your hair brie all rosy gold and grays pretty mouth murphy sends his love and best wishes rogan put in setting the bear beside the dog we called him just a bit ago to pass the news he and liam are celebrating with the tea cakes you finished making before you went into labor its sweet of him to mind liam while youre here maggie waved off briannas gratitude sweet had nothing to do with it murphyd keep the boy from dawn to dusk if id let him theyre having a grand time and before you ask things are fine at the inn mrs omalleys seeing to your guests though why youd accept bookings when you knew youd be having a baby i cant say the same reason you kept working with your glass until we carted you off to have liam i imagine brianna said dryly its how i make my living have mother and lottie gone home then a short time ago for briannas sake maggie kept her smile in place their mother had been complaining and worrying about what germs she might pick up in the hospital that was nothing new they looked in and saw you were sleeping so lottie said shed drive mother back and theyd see you and kayla tomorrow maggie paused glanced at rogan his imperceptible nod left the decision to share the rest of the news up to her because she understood her sister and briannas needs maggie rose sat on the side of the bed opposite gray and took briannas hand its as well shes gone no dont give me that look i mean no harm in it theres news to tell you that it isnt time for her to hear rogans man his detective thinks hes found amanda now wait dont get too hopeful weve been through this before but this time it could be real brianna closed her eyes a moment more than a year before shed found three letters written to her father by amanda dougherty love letters that had shocked and dismayed and finding in them that there had been a child had begun a long and frustrating search for the woman her father had loved and the child hed never known it could be not wanting to see his wife disappointed yet again gray spoke carefully brie you know how many dead ends weve run into since the birth certificate was found we know we have a sister brianna said stubbornly we know her name we know that amanda married and that they moved from place to place its the moving thats been the trouble but sooner or later well find them she gave maggies hand a squeeze it could be this time perhaps maggie had yet to resign herself to the possibility nor was she entirely sure she wanted to find the woman who was her half sister hes on his way to a place called columbus ohio one way or the other well know something soon da would have wanted us to do this brianna said quietly he would have been happy to know we tried at least to find them with a nod maggie rose well weve started the ball on its roll so we wont try to stop it she only hoped no one was damaged by the tumble in the meantime you should be celebrating your new family not worrying over one that may or may not be found youll tell me as soon as you know something brianna insisted one way or the other so dont fidget about it in the meantime a glance around the room had maggie smiling again would you like if we took some of these flowers home for you brie set them around so theyd be there when you bring the baby home with some effort brianna held back the rest of the questions circling in her head there were no answers for them yet id be grateful gray got carried away anything else youd like brianna with cheerful good humor rogan accepted the flowers his wife piled in his arms more cake she glanced down flushed i ate every crumb didnt i thanks just the same but i think thatll do go home both of you and get some sleep so we will ill call maggie promised the worry came back into her eyes as she left the room with rogan i wish she wasnt so hopeful and so sure that this longlost sister of ours will want to be welcomed into her open arms its the way shes made maggie saint brianna maggie said with a sigh i couldnt bear it if she was hurt because of this rogan youve only to look at her to see how shes building it up in her head in her heart no matter how wrong it might be of me i wish to god shed never found those letters dont fret over it since maggie was busy doing just that rogan used his elbow to press the elevator button its not my fretting thats the problem maggie muttered she shouldnt be worrying over this now she has the baby to think of and gray may be going off in a few months on his book tour i thought hed canceled that rogan shifted tilting blooms back to safety he wants to cancel it shes badgering him to go wants nothing to interfere with his work impatient annoyed she scowled at the elevator doors so damn sure she is that she can handle an infant the inn all those bleeding guests and this amanda dougherty bodine business as well we both know that briannas strong enough to handle whatever happens just as you are prepared to argue she looked up rogans amused smile smoothed away the temper you may be right she sent him a saucy look for once soothed a little she took some of the flowers from him and its too wonderful a day to be worrying about something that may never happen weve ourselves a beautiful niece sweeney that we do i think she might have your chin margaret mary i was thinking that as well she stepped into the elevator with him how simple it was really she mused to forget the pain and remember only the joy and i was thinking now that liams beginning to toddle about we might start working on providing him with a sister or a brother with a grin rogan managed to kiss her through the daffodils i was thinking that as well chapter three i am the resurrection and the light shannon knew the words all the priests words were supposed to comfort to ease perhaps inspire she heard them on this perfect spring day beside her mothers grave shed heard them in the crowded sunwashed church during the funeral mass all the words familiar from her youth and she had knelt and stood and sat even responded as some part of her brain followed the rite but she felt neither comforted nor eased nor inspired the scene wasnt dreamlike but all too real the blackgarbed priest with his beautiful baritone the dozens and dozens of mourners the brilliant stream of sunlight that glinted off the brass handles of the coffin that was cloaked in flowers the sound of weeping the chirp of birds she was burying her mother beside the fresh grave was the neatly tended mound of another and the headstone still brutally new of the man she had believed all of her life to be her father she was supposed to cry but shed already wept she was supposed to pray but the prayers wouldnt come standing there with the priests voice ringing in the clear spring air shannon could only see herself again walking into the parlor the anger still hot inside her shed thought her mother had been sleeping but there had been too many questions too many demands racing in her head to wait and shed decided to wake her gently she remembered thank god she had at least been gentle but her mother hadnt awakened hadnt stirred the rest had been panic not so gentle nowthe shaking the shouting the pleading and the few minutes of blankness blessedly brief that she knew now had been helpless hysteria thered been the frantic call for an ambulance the endless terrifying ride to the hospital and the wait always the wait now the waiting was over amanda had slipped into a coma and from a coma into death and from death so said the priest into eternal life they told her it was a blessing the doctor had said so and the nurses who had been unfailingly kind the friends and neighbors who had called had all said it was a blessing there had been no pain no suffering in those last fortyeight hours she had simply slept while her body and brain had shut down only the living suffered shannon thought now only they were riddled with guilt and regrets and unanswered questions shes with colin now someone murmured shannon blinked herself back and saw that it was done people were already turning toward her she would have to accept their sympathies their comforts their own sorrows as she had at the funeral parlor viewing many would come back to the house of course she had prepared for that had handled all the details after all she thought as she mechanically accepted and responded to those who walked to her details were what she did best the funeral arrangements had been handled neatly and without fuss her mother would have wanted the simple she knew and shannon had done her best to accommodate amanda on this last duty the simple coffin the right flowers and music the solemn catholic ceremony and the food of course it seemed faintly awful to have such a thing catered but she simply hadnt had the time or the energy to prepare a meal for the friends and neighbors who would come to the house from the cemetery then at last she was alone for a moment she simply couldnt thinkwhat did she want what was right still the tears and the prayers wouldnt come tentatively shannon laid a hand on the coffin but there was only the sensation of wood warmed by the sun and the overly heady scent of roses im sorry she murmured it shouldnt have been like that between us at the end but i dont know how to resolve it or to change it and i dont know how to say goodbye to either of you now she stared down at the headstone to her left colin alan bodine beloved husband and father even those last words she thought miserably carved into granite were a lie and her only wish as she stood over the graves of two people she had loved all of her life was that she had never learned the truth and that stubborn selfish wish was the guilt she would live with turning away she walked alone toward the waiting car it seemed like hours before the crowd began to thin and the house grew quiet again amanda had been well loved and those who had loved her had gathered together in her home shannon said her last goodbye her last thanks accepted her last sympathy then finally finally closed the door and was alone fatigue began to drag at shannon as she wandered into her fathers office amanda had changed little here in the eleven months since her husbands sudden death the big old desk was no longer cluttered but she had yet to dispose of his computer the modem the fax and other equipment hed used as a broker and financial adviser his toys hed called them and his wife had kept them even when shed been able to give away his suits his shoes his foolish ties all the books remained on the shelvestax planning estate planning accounting texts weary shannon sat in the big leather chair shed given him herself for fathers day five years before hed loved it she remembered running a hand over the smooth burgundy leather big enough to hold a horse hed said and had laughed and pulled her into his lap she wished she could convince herself that she still felt him here but she didnt she felt nothing and that told her more than the requiem mass more than the cemetery that she was alone really alone there hadnt been enough time for anything shannon thought dully if shed known before she wasnt sure which she meant her mothers illness or the lies if shed known she thought again training her mind on the illness they might have tried other things the alternative medicines the vitamin concentrates all the small and simple hopes shed read of in the books on homeopathic medicine shed collected there hadnt been time to give them a chance to work there had been only a few weeks her mother had kept her illness from her as shed kept other things she hadnt shared them shannon thought as bitterness warred with grief not with her own daughter so the very last words she had spoken to her mother had been in anger and contempt and she could never take them back fists clenched against an enemy she couldnt see she rose turned away from the desk shed needed time damn it shed needed time to try to understand or at least learn to live with it now the tears came hot and helpless because she knew in her heart that she wished her mother had died before shed told her and she hated herself for it after the tears drained out of her she knew she had to sleep mechanically she climbed the stairs washed her hot cheeks with cool water and lay fully clothed on the bed shed have to sell the house she thought and the furniture there were papers to go through she hadnt told her mother she loved her with that weighing on her heart she fell into an exhausted sleep afternoon naps always left shannon groggy she took them only when ill and she was rarely ill the house was quiet when she climbed out of bed again a glance at the clock told her shed slept less than an hour but she was stiff and muddled despite the brevity she would make coffee she told herself and then she would sit down and plan how best to handle all of her mothers things and the house shed loved the doorbell rang before shed reached the base of the stairs she could only pray it wasnt some wellmeaning neighbor come to offer help or company she wanted neither at the moment but it was a stranger at the door the man was of medium height with a slight pouch showing under his dark suit his hair was graying his eyes sharp she had an odd and uncomfortable sensation when those eyes stayed focused on her face im looking for amanda dougherty bodine this is the bodine residence shannon returned trying to peg him salesman she didnt think so im her daughter what is it you want nothing changed on his face but shannon sensed his attention sharpening a few minutes of mrs bodines time if its convenient im john hobbs im sorry mr hobbs its not convenient i buried my mother this morning so if youll excuse me im sorry his hand went to the door holding it open when shannon would have closed it ive just arrived in town from new york i hadnt heard about your mothers death hobbs had to rethink and regroup quickly hed gotten too close to simply walk away now are you shannon bodine thats right just what do you want mr hobbs your time he said pleasantly enough when its more convenient for you id like to make an appointment to meet with you in a few days shannon pushed back the hair tumbled from her nap ill be going back to new york in a few days ill be happy to meet with you there her eyes narrowed as she tried to shake off the disorientation from her nap did my mother know you mr hobbs no she didnt ms bodine then i dont think we have anything to discuss now please excuse me i have information which i have been authorized by my clients to discuss with mrs amanda dougherty bodine hobbs simply kept his hand on the door taking shannons measure as he held it open clients despite herself shannon was intrigued does this concern my father hobbss hesitation was brief but she caught it and her heart began to drum it concerns your family yes if we could make an appointment to meet ill inform my clients of mrs bodines death who are your clients mr hobbs no dont tell me its confidential she snapped you come to my door on the day of my mothers funeral looking for her to discuss something that concerns my family im my only family now mr hobbs so your information obviously concerns me who are your clients i need to make a phone callfrom my car would you mind waiting a few moments all right she agreed more on impulse than with a sense of patience ill wait but she closed the door when he walked toward the dark sedan at the curb she had a feeling she was going to need that coffee it didnt take him long the bell rang again when she was taking her first sip carrying the mug with her she went back to answer ms bodine my client has authorized me to handle this matter at my own discretion reaching into his pocket he took out a business card offered it doubleday investigations she read new york shannon lifted a brow youre a long way from home mr hobbs my business keeps me on the road quite a bit this particular case has kept me there id like to come in ms bodine or if youd be more comfortable i could meet you wherever you like she had an urge to close the door in his face not that she was afraid of him physically the cowardice came from something deeper and because she recognized it she ignored it come in ive just made coffee i appreciate it as was his habit long ingrained hobbs scanned the house as he followed shannon took in the subtle wealth the quiet good taste everything hed learned about the bodines in the last few months was reflected in the house they werehad beena nice closely knit upperincome family without pretensions this is a difficult time for you ms bodine hobbs began when he took the chair at the table shannon gestured toward i hope i wont add to it my mother died two days ago mr hobbs i dont think you can make it more difficult than it already is cream sugar just black thanks he studied her as she prepared his coffee selfpossessed he mused that would make his job easier was your mother ill ms bodine it was cancer she said shortly no sympathy wanted he judged and offered none i represent rogan sweeney hobbs began his wife and her family rogan sweeney cautious shannon joined him at the table i know the name of course worldwide galleries has a branch in new york theyre based in she trailed off setting down her mug before her hands could shake ireland she thought in ireland you know then hobbs read the knowledge in her eyes that too would make his job easier my clients were concerned that the circumstances might be unknown to you determined not to falter shannon lifted her cup again what does rogan sweeney have to do with me mr sweeney is married to margaret mary concannon the oldest daughter of the late thomas concannon of clare county ireland concannon shannon closed her eyes until the need to shudder had passed i see when she opened her eyes again they were bitterly amused i assume they hired you to find me i find it odd that there would be an interest after all these years i was hired initially to find your mother ms bodine i can tell you that my clients only learned of her and your existence last year the investigation was initiated at that time however there was some difficulty in locating amanda dougherty as you may know she left her home in new york suddenly and without giving her family indication of her destination i suppose she might not have known it as shed been tossed out of the house for being pregnant pushing her coffee aside shannon folded her hands what do your clients want the primary goal was to contact your mother and to let her know that mr concannons surviving children had discovered letters she had written to him and with her permission to make contact with you surviving children hes dead then she rubbed a hand to her temple yes you told me that already hes dead so are they all well you found me mr hobbs so your jobs done you can inform your clients that ive been contacted and have no interest in anything further your sisters her eyes went cold i dont consider them my sisters hobbs merely inclined his head mrs sweeney and mrs thane may wish to contact you personally i cant stop them can i but you can forward the fact that im not interested in reunions with women i dont know what happened between their father and my mother some twentyeight years ago doesnt change the status quo so she broke off eyes sharpening again margaret mary concannon you said the artist yes she is known for her glass work thats an understatement shannon murmured shed been to one of m m concannons showings at worldwide new york herself and had been considering investing in a piece the idea was almost laughable well thats amusing isnt it you can tell margaret mary concannon and her sister brianna brianna concannon thane she runs a b and b in clare you may have heard of her husband as well hes a successful mystery writer grayson thane at hobbss nod shannon did nearly laugh they married well it seems good for them tell them they can get on with their lives as i intend to do she rose if theres nothing else mr hobbs im to ask if youd like to have your mothers letters and if so if you would object to my clients making copies for themselves i dont want them i dont want anything she bit back on a sudden spurt of venom letting out a sigh as it drained what happened is no more their fault than mine i dont know how they feel about all of this mr hobbs and dont care to if its curiosity misplaced guilt a sense of family obligation you can tell them to let it go hobbs rose as well from the time effort and money theyve spent trying to find you id say it was a combination of all three and perhaps more but ill tell them he offered a hand surprising shannon into taking it if you have second thoughts or any questions come to mind you can reach me at the number on the card ill be flying back to new york tonight his cool tone stung she couldnt say why i have a right to my privacy you do he nodded ill see myself out ms bodine thanks for the time and the coffee damn him was all she could think as he walked calmly out of her kitchen damn him for being so dispassionate so subtly judgmental and damn them damn thomas concannons daughters for searching her out asking her to satisfy their curiosity offering to satisfy her own she didnt want them didnt need them let them stay in ireland with their cozy lives and brilliant husbands she had her own life and the pieces of it needed to be picked up quickly wiping at tears she hadnt realized were falling she stalked over and snatched up the phone book she flipped through quickly ran her finger down the page then dialed yes i have a house i need to sell immediately a week later shannon was back in new york shed priced the house to sell and hoped it would do so quickly the money certainly didnt matter shed discovered she was a rich woman death had given her nearly a half a million dollars in the investments her father had made over the years added to her earlier inheritance she would never have to worry about something as trivial as money again shed only had to become an orphan to earn it still she was enough colin bodines daughter to know the house had to be sold and that it would bring in considerable equity some of the furnishings she hadnt had the heart to sell or give away were in storage surely she could wait a little longer before deciding what to do with every vase and lamp shannon had boxed only a few sentimental favorites to bring back with her to new york among them were all of the paintings shed done for her parents over the years those she couldnt part with though her supervisor had offered her the rest of the week off shed come back to work the day after returning from columbus shed been certain it would help that work was the answer she needed the new account needed to be dealt with shed hardly begun to work on it when shed been called away shed barely had two weeks to become used to her promotion the new responsibilities and position shed worked most of her adult life for that position for those responsibilities she was moving up the ladder now at the brisk and steady pace shed planned for herself the corner office was hers her weekataglance was tidily filled with meetings and presentations the ceo himself knew her name respected her work and she knew had an eye on her for bigger things it was everything shed always wanted needed planned for how could she have known that nothing in her office seemed to matter nothing about it mattered in the least not her drafting table her tools not the major account shed snagged on the very day shed received the call from columbus and had been forced to turn over to an associate it simply didnt matter the promotion shed broken her back to secure seemed so removed from her just then just as the life shed led with all its tidiness and careful planning seemed to have belonged to someone else all along she found herself staring at the painting of her father sleeping in the garden it was still propped against the wall rather than hung for reasons she couldnt understand she simply didnt want it in her office after all shannon the woman who poked her head in the door was attractive dressed impeccably lily was her assistant a casual friend among what shannon was beginning to realize was a lifetime of casual friends i thought you might want a break i havent been doing anything i need a break from hey lily stepped in crossing over to her desk to give shannons shoulders a brisk rub give yourself a little time youve only been back a few days i shouldnt have bothered in an irritable move she pushed back from the desk im not producing anything youre going through a rough patch yeah why dont i cancel your afternoon meetings i have to get back to work sometime she stared out the window at the view of new york shed dreamed would one day be hers but cancel the lunch with tod im not in the mood to be social lily pursed her lips and made a note of it trouble in paradise lets just say im thinking that relationship isnt productive eitherand theres too much backlog for lunch dates your call yes it is shannon turned back i havent really thanked you for handling so much of my work while i was gone ive looked some things over and wanted to tell you that you did a terrific job thats what they pay me for lily flipped a page in her book the mincko job needs some finishing touches and nothings satisfied the suits at rightway tilghmanton thinks you can he sent down a memo this morning asking you to look over the drafts and come up with something newby the end of the week good she nodded and pushed up to her desk again a challenge like that might be just what i need lets see rightway first lily you can fill me in on mincko later you got it lily headed for the door oh i should tell you rightway wants something traditional but different subtle but bold sexy but restrained of course they do ill get my magic wand out of my briefcase good to have you back shannon when the door closed shannon let out a deep breath it was good to be back wasnt it it had to be rain was pelting the streets after a miserable tenhour day that had concluded in a showdown with a man shed tried to convince herself shed been in love with shannon watched it from the cab window on the way back to her apartment maybe shed been right to go back to work so quickly the routine the demands and concentration had helped shake some of the grief at least temporarily she needed routine she reminded herself she needed the outrageous schedule that had earned her her position at rytilghmanton her job the career shed carved out was all she had now there wasnt even the illusion of a satisfying relationship to fill a corner of her life but shed been right to break things off with tod theyd been no more than attractive props for each other and life shed just discovered was too short for foolish choices she paid off the cab at the corner dashed toward her building with a quick smile for the doorman out of habit she picked up her mail flipping through the envelopes as she rode the elevator to her floor the one from ireland stopped her cold on an oath she shoved it to the bottom unlocking her door tossing all the mail on a table though her heart was thudding she followed ingrained habit she hung her coat slipped out of her shoes poured herself her usual glass of wine when she was seated at the little table by the window that looked out over madison avenue she settled down to read her mail it took only moments before she gave in and tore open the letter from brianna concannon thane dear shannon im so terribly sorry about your mothers death youll be grieving still and i doubt if any words i have will ease your heart from the letters she wrote to my father i know she was a loving and special woman and im sorry i never had the chance to meet her and tell her for myself youve met with rogans man mr hobbs from his report i understand that you were aware of the relationship between your mother and my father i think this might cause you some hurt and im sorry for it i also think you may not appreciate hearing from me but i had to write to you at least once your father your mothers husband surely loved you very much i dont wish to interfere with those emotions or those memories which im sure are precious to you i wish only to offer you a chance to know this other part of your family and your heritage my father was not a simple man but he was a good one and never did he forget your mother i found her letters to him long after his death still wrapped in the ribbon hed tied around them id like to share him with you or if that isnt what you want to offer you a chance to see the ireland where you were conceived if you could find it in your heart i would very much like you to come and stay with me and mine awhile if nothing else the countryside here is a good place for easing grief you owe me nothing shannon and perhaps you think i owe you nothing as well but if you loved your mother as i did my father you know we owe them perhaps by becoming friends if not sisters well have given them back something of what they gave up for us the invitation is open if ever you wish to come youll be welcome yours truly brianna shannon read it twice then when she had tossed it aside picked it up and read it again was the woman really so simple so unselfish so willing to open heart and home she didnt want briannas heart or her home shannon told herself and yet and yet was she going to deny even to herself that shed been considering just this a trip to ireland a look into the past she toyed with the idea of going over without contacting any of the concannons because she was afraid she wondered yes maybe because she was afraid but also because she didnt want any pressure any questions any demands the woman who had written the letter had promised none of those and had offered a great deal more maybe ill take her up on it shannon thought and maybe i wont chapter four i dont know why youre fussing so much maggie complained youd think you were preparing for royalty i want her to be comfortable brianna centered the vase of tulips on the dresser changed her mind and took it to the fluteedged table by the window shes coming all this way to meet us i want her to feel at home as far as i can see youve cleaned the place from top to bottom twice brought in enough flowers for five weddings and baked so many cakes and tarts it would take an army to eat them all as she spoke maggie walked over twitching the lace curtain aside and staring out over the hills youre setting yourself up for a disappointment brie and youre determined to get no pleasure out of her coming her letter accepting your invitation wasnt filled with excitement and pleasure was it now brianna stopped fluffing bed pillows shed already fluffed and studied her sisters rigid back shes the odd one out maggie weve always had each other and will still when shes gone again added to that she lost her mother not a month ago i wouldnt have expected some flowery response im happy enough shes decided to come at all she told rogans man she didnt want anything to do with us ah and youve never in your life said something you reconsidered later that brought a smile tugging at maggies lips not that i can recall at the moment when she turned back the smile remained how much time do we have before we pick her up at the airport a bit i need to nurse kayla first and i want to change she blew out a breath at maggies expression im not going to meet the sister ive not yet set eyes on in my apron and dusty pants well im not changing maggie shrugged her shoulders inside the oversized cotton shirt shed tucked into old jeans suit yourself brianna said lightly as she started out of the room but you might want to comb that rats nest on your head though maggie curled her lip she took a glance at herself in the mirror above the dresser an apt description she thought with some amusement as she noted her bright red curls were snarled and tousled ive been working she called out quickening her pace to catch up with brianna at the bottom of the steps my pipes dont care if my hairs tidy or not its not like i have to see people day and night like you do and its grateful those people are that you dont fix yourself a bit of a sandwich or something margaret mary she added as she breezed into the kitchen youre looking peaked i am not grumbling but hungry maggie headed for the bread drawer im looking pregnant brianna froze in midstride what oh maggie and its your fault if i am maggie muttered brows knitted as she sliced through the fresh brown bread laughing brianna swung over to give her sister a hard hug well now thats an intriguing statement and one im sure medical authorities worldwide would be interested in maggie tilted her head and there was humor in her eyes who just had a baby i ask you and who had me holding that beautiful little girl barely minutes after she was born so that i went a bit crazy in the head youre not upset really that you might be having another baby brianna stepped back worrying her lip rogans pleased isnt he i havent told him yet im a ways from being sure but i feel it instinctively she pressed a hand to her stomach and no im not upset im only teasing you im hoping she gave brianna a quick pat on the cheek and went back to her sandwich building i was queasy this morning oh tears sprang to briannas eyes thats wonderful with a grunt maggie went to the refrigerator im just loony enough to agree with you dont say anything yet even to gray until im sure of it i wontif youll have that sandwich sitting down and drink some tea with it not a bad deal go on feed my niece change your clothes or well be late to the airport picking up the queen brianna started to snap back drew a deep breath instead and slipped through the door that adjoined her rooms with the kitchen those rooms had been expanded since her marriage the year before the second floor of the main house and the converted attic were for the guests who came and went in blackthorn cottage but here off the kitchen was for family the little parlor and bedroom had been enough when it had only been brianna now a second bedroom a bright sunwashed nursery had been added on with its wide double windows facing the hills and overlooking the young flowering almond murphy had planted for her on the day kayla was born above the crib catching pretty glints of sunlight was the mobile the glass menagerie maggie had made with its unicorns and winged horses and mermaids beneath the dance staring up at the lights and movements the baby stirred theres my love brianna murmured and the rush still came the flood of emotions and wonder her child at last her child are you watching the lights darling so pretty they are and so clever is your aunt maggie she gathered kayla up drawing in the scent absorbing the feel of baby youre going to meet another aunt today your aunt shannon from america wont that be grand with the baby curled in one arm brianna unbuttoned her blouse as she settled in the rocker she glanced once at the ceiling smiling knowing gray was above in his studio writing she thought of murder and mayhem there you are she cooed thrilling as kaylas mouth rooted then suckled at her breast and when youre all fed and changed youll be good for your da while im gone just a little while youve grown so already its only a month you know a month today gray watched them from the doorway overwhelmed and humbled no one could have told him no one could have explained how it would feel to see his wife his child to have a wife and child kaylas fist rested on the curve of her mothers breast ivory against ivory the sun played gently on their hair nearly identical shade for shade they watched each other linked in a way he could only imagine then brianna glanced up smiled i thought you were working i heard you on the intercom he gestured to the small monitor hed insisted they put them throughout the house he crossed to them crouched beside the rocker my ladies are so beautiful with a light laugh brianna leaned forward kiss me grayson he did lingering over it then shifted to brush his lips over kaylas head shes hungry has her fathers appetite which turned her thoughts to more practical matters i left you some cold meat and the breads fresh this morning if theres time ill fix you something before i go dont worry about it and if any of the guests come back from their ramblings before you do ill put out the scones and make tea youre becoming a fine hotelier grayson still i dont want you to interrupt your work the works going fine i can tell that youre not scowling and i havent heard you pacing the floor upstairs for days theres a murdersuicide he said with a wink or what appears to be its cheered me up idly he traced a finger over her breast just above his daughters head since his eyes were on briannas he had the satisfaction of seeing the quick jolt of pleasure reflected in her eyes when i make love with you again brianna its going to be like the first time she let out an unsteady breath i dont think its fair to seduce me when im nursing our daughter its fair to seduce you anytime he held up his hand letting the sunlight glint off the gold of his wedding ring were married put your glands on hold grayson thane maggie called out from the next room weve less than twenty minutes before we have to leave for the airport spoilsport he muttered but grinned as he rose i suppose ill have two of your sisters hounding me now but gray was the last thing on shannons mind she could see ireland below from the window of the plane the green of its fields the black of its cliffs it was beautiful awesomely so and oddly familiar she was already wishing she hadnt come no turning back she reminded herself foolish to even consider it it might have been true that shed made the decision to come on impulse influenced by the drag of her own guilt and grief and the simple understanding in briannas letter but shed followed the impulse through taking a leave of absence from her job closing up her apartment and boarding a plane for a threethousand mile journey that was minutes away from being complete shed stopped asking herself what she expected to find or what she wanted to accomplish she didnt have the answers all she knew was that shed needed to come to see perhaps what her mother had once seen the doubts plagued herworry that she was being disloyal to the only father shed ever known fears that she would suddenly find herself surrounded by relatives she had no desire to acknowledge with a shake of her head she took her compact from her purse shed been clear enough in her letter shannon reminded herself as she tried to freshen her makeup shed edited and revised the text three times before shed been satisfied enough to mail a response to brianna it had been polite slightly cool and unemotional and that was exactly how she intended to go on she tried not to wince when the wheels touched down there was still time she assured herself to work on her composure years of traveling with her parents had made her familiar with the routine of disembarking customs passports she moved through it on automatic while she calmed her mind confident now assured that she once again felt slightly aloof to the circumstances she joined the crowd moving toward the main terminal she didnt expect the jolt of recognition the absolute certainty that the two women waiting with all the others were the concannons she could have told herself it was the coloring the clear creamy skin the green eyes the red hair they shared some features though the taller of the two had a softer look and her hair was more gold while the other was pure flame but it wasnt the coloring or the family resemblance that had her zeroing in on only two when there were so many people weeping and laughing and hurrying to embrace it was a deep visceral knowledge that was surprisingly painful she had only an instant to sum them up the taller neat as a pin in a simple blue dress the other oddly chic in a baggy shirt and tattered jeans and she saw her recognition returned with a glowing smile by one a cool measured stare by the other shannon shannon bodine without hesitation or plan brianna hurried forward and kissed shannon lightly on the cheek welcome to ireland im brianna how do you do shannon was grateful her hands were gripped on the luggage cart but brianna was already neatly brushing her aside to take the cart herself this is maggie were so glad youve come youll want to get out of the crowd i imagine reserving judgment on the aloof woman in the expensive slacks and jacket maggie inclined her head its a long trip across the water im used to traveling its always exciting isnt it though her nerves were jumping brianna talked easily as she pushed the cart maggies done a great deal more than i have of seeing places every time i get on a plane i feel as though im someone else was it a pleasant trip for you it was quiet a little desperate now as it seemed she would never draw more than one short declarative sentence from shannon at a time brianna began to talk of the weather it was fineand the length of the trip to the cottage mercifully short on either side of her shannon and maggie eyed each other with mutual distrust well have a meal for you brianna went on as they loaded shannons luggage in the car or you can rest a bit first if youre tired i dont want to put you to any trouble shannon said so definitely that maggie snorted going to trouble is what brie does best youll take the front she added coolly as the guest quite the bitch shannon decided and jerked up her chin much as maggie had a habit of doing as she slid into the passenger seat brianna set her teeth she was used much too used to family discord but it still hurt youve never been to ireland then shannon no because the word had been curt and made her feel as bitchy as shed concluded maggie was she deliberately relaxed her shoulders what i saw from the air was lovely my husbands traveled everywhere but he says this spot is the loveliest hes seen brianna tossed a smile at shannon while she negotiated her way out of the airport but its his home now and hes prejudiced youre married to grayson thane aye for a year come the end of june he came to ireland to clare to research a book itll be out soon of course hes working on another now and having a fine time murdering people right and left i like his books a safe topic shannon decided a simple one my father was a big fan and that brought a moment of thick uncomfortable silence it was hard for you brianna said carefully losing both your parents so close together i hope your time here will help ease your heart a little thank you shannon turned her head and watched the scenery and it was lovely there was no denying it just as there was no denying there was something special in the way the sun slanted through the clouds and gilded the air rogans man said youre a commercial artist maggie began more from curiosity than manners thats right so what you do is sell things market them shannons brow lifted she recognized disdain when she heard it however light it was in a manner of speaking deliberately she turned leveled her gaze on maggies you sell things market them no maggies smile was bland i create them someone else has the selling of them its interesting dont you think brianna put in quickly that both of you are artists odd more like maggie muttered and shrugged when brianna aimed a warning glance in the rearview mirror shannon merely folded her hands she at least had been raised with manners how close is your home to a town brianna i thought i would rent a car were a bit of a way from the village you wont find a car to let there but youre welcome to the use of this one when you like i dont want to take your car it sits idle more often than not and gray has one as well so youll want to do some sightseeing i imagine one of us will be happy to guide you about if you like sometimes people just like to wander on their own this is our village she added it was no more than that shannon mused more than a little downcast a tiny place with narrowing sloping streets and shops and houses nestled charming certainly and quaint and she thought with an inner sigh inconvenient no theater no galleries no fast food no crowds a man glanced up at the sound of the car grinned around the cigarette clinging to his bottom lip and lifted a hand in a wave as he continued to walk brianna waved in return and called out the open window good day to you matthew feeney dont stop for christs sake brie maggie ordered even as she waved herself hell talk from now till next week if you do im not after stopping shannon wants a rest not village gossip still i wonder if his sister colleen is going to marry that brit salesman better had from what ive heard maggie said scooting up to rest her hands on the back of the front seat for hes sold her something already shell be paying for in nine months time colleens carrying the brit planted one in her belly and now her fathers got one hand around his throat and the other seeing the banns are read i got the whole of it from murphy a night or two ago in the pub despite herself shannon felt her interest snagged are you telling me theyll force the man to marry her oh force is a hard word maggie said with her tongue in her cheek encourage is better firmly encourage pointing out the very reasonable choices between marriage vows and a broken face its an archaic solution dont you think after all the woman had as much to do with it as the man and shell be stuck with him just as hes stuck with her and the best of it theyre bound to make until they have six more children and divorce shannon said shortly well we all take our chances on such matters dont we maggie settled back again and we irish pride ourselves on taking more of them and bigger ones than most didnt they just shannon thought as she lifted her chin again with their ira and lack of birth control alcoholism and nowayout marriages thank god she was just a tourist her heart gave a quick lurch as the road narrowed the winding needle threaded through a thick tunnel of hedge planted so close to the edge of the road the car brushed vegetation from time to time occasionally there was an opening in the wall of green where a tiny house or shed could be viewed shannon tried not to think just what might happen if another car came by then brianna made a turn and the world opened without being aware of it shannon leaned forward her eyes wide her lips parted in surprised delight the valley was a painting for surely it couldnt be real roll after green roll of hill unfolded before her bisected here and there by rock walls sliced by a patch of brown turned earth a sudden colorful spread that was meadows of wildflowers toy houses and barns had been placed in perfect spots with dots of grazing cattle meandering clothes waving cheerfully on lines castle ruins tumbling stones and a sheer high wall stood in a field as if that spot were locked in a time warp the sun struck it all like gold and glinted off a thin ribbon of silver river and all of it every blade of grass was cupped under a sky so achingly blue it seemed to pulse for the first time in days she forgot grief and guilt and worry she could only stare with a smile blooming on her face and the oddest feeling in her heart that she had known this just exactly this would be there all along it is beautiful isnt it brianna murmured and slowed the car to give shannon another moment to enjoy yes ive never seen anything more beautiful i can see why my mother loved it and that thought brought the grief stabbing back so that she turned her gaze away again but the new view was no less charming blackthorn cottage waited to welcome windows glinting stone flecked with mica that sparkled a glory of a garden spread beyond the hedges that were waiting to burst into a bloom of their own a dog barked in greeting as soon as brianna pulled up behind a spiffy mercedes convertible thatll be concobar my dog she explained and laughed when shannons eyes widened as con raced around the side of the house hes big is con but hes harmless you havent a fear of dogs have you not normally sit now brianna ordered when she stepped out of the car and show your manners the dog obeyed instantly his thick gray tail pounding the ground to show his pleasure and his control he looked over at shannon as she cautiously alighted then he lifted a paw okay shannon took a deep breath and accepted the canine handshake handsome arent you a little more confident she patted his head she glanced over and saw that maggie and brianna were already unloading her luggage ill get those its no problem no problem at all with surprising ease for such a slender woman brianna hauled suitcases toward the door of the house welcome to blackthorn cottage shannon i hope youll be comfortable here with this she opened the front door and pandemonium come back here you little devil i mean it liam shes going to have my scalp as shannon watched a blackhaired toddler scrambled down the hall on short but surprisingly quick legs trailing crumbs from a handful of cookies his gutbusting laughter echoed off the walls not far behind was a very harassedlooking man with a small wailing baby tucked in one arm spotting company the boy grinned showing an angelic face smeared with food he tossed up his chubby arms mum mum indeed with an expert swipe maggie had her son scooped into one arm look at you liam sweeney not a clean spot to be found on you and eating biscuits before tea he grinned blue eyes dancing kiss just like your father kisses fix everything but she obliged him before turning to aim a killing look at gray so what have you to say for yourself grayson thane i plead insanity he shifted the baby patting soothing even as he dragged his hair out of his eyes its not my fault rogan got called into the gallery and murphys out plowing something so i was drafted to watch that twentypound disaster then the baby was crying and liam got into the cookies ah the kitchen brie you dont want to go in there is that a fact trust me on this and the parlors kind of well we were just playing around ill buy you a new vase her eyes narrowed dangerously not my waterford ah taking help where he could find it gray turned his attention to shannon hi sorry about this im gray nice to meet you she jerked a little as con rushed past her legs to take advantage of the crumbs littering the floor then jerked again when liam leaned over and took a handful of her hair kiss he ordered oh shannons heart sank a little gingerly she pecked his pursed and smeared lips chocolate chip i made them yesterday taking pity on her husband brianna slipped kayla into her arms and from the looks of it theres none left but for the crumbs i was just distracting the kid gray said in his own defense kayla needed to be changed and the phone was ringing jesus brie how can two of them be more than twice as much work as one its just one of those unfathomable mysteries redeem yourself grayson and take shannons bags to her room if you please no problem its really a quiet place he assured her usually ah brie ill explain about that spot on the parlor rug later brows knit brie took a few steps forward viewed the chaos of the room shed left meticulously neat be sure you will shannon im sorry its all right in fact it was more so the noisy welcome had done more to relax her than any smooth manners could have this is your baby our daughter kayla she stepped back so that shannon could have a better look shes a month old today shes beautiful a little more stiffly she turned back to maggie and your son such as he is liam say good day to she trailed off stumped to miss bodine she decided shannon determined not to be awkward shannon offered a smile good day to you liam he responded with something that would have required an interpreter but the grin needed no translation im going to clean him up brie let me have kayla and ill tend them while you show shannon her room im grateful she passed kayla over so that maggie headed toward the kitchen with a child in each arm chocolate liam demanded quite clearly not on your life boyo was his mothers response well brianna lifted her hand to her hair which was slipping out of its pins lets get you settled ive put you in the loft room its two floors up but its the most private and the most special she glanced over as they started upstairs if youd rather not have so many stairs to deal with i can change it in no time i dont mind the stairs she found herself uncomfortable again odd she mused how much easier it was to deal with maggies abrasive challenge than briannas open welcome the rooms only been ready for a few months i had the attic converted you see its a beautiful house thank you some of the changes to it i made after my father died and left it to me thats when i started the b and b then when i married grayson we needed more room still for a studio for his writing and a nursery our rooms are on the first floor off the kitchen wheres kayla gray wanted to know when he met them on the stairs on his way down maggie has her in a move so natural and of such long habit she barely noticed brianna lifted a hand to his cheek you should go for a walk grayson clear your head a bit i think i will its nice to have you here shannon thank you she lifted her brow when gray kissed his wife it didnt seem quite the casual kiss a husband might give before going off on a walk ill be back for tea he promised and trooped off brianna led the way to the next floor where a door was already open wide in invitation the room was more than anything shannon could have expected wide and airy with a charming window seat set under the sloping eaves of one wall and a big brass bed tucked beneath the other skylights and pretty arched windows let in the sun and the spring air the lacy curtains billowed and matched the creamy spread fresh flowers were waiting to be sniffed and every surface gleamed she smiled as she had when shed seen the valley its lovely really lovely brianna i had it in mind for a kind of special place you can see to murphys farm and beyond from the windows there murphy oh hes a friend a neighbor murphy muldoon his land starts just beyond my garden wall youll be meeting him hes around the house quite a bit brianna roamed the room as she spoke fussing with lamp shades twitching at the bedspread and this rooms more private than the other rooms a little bigger than most as well the bath is just here grayson read some books and he and murphy designed it between them i thought this murphy was a farmer he is yes but hes handy about all manner of things oh shannons smile widened at the small gleaming room with its clawfoot tub and pedestal sink and fussy fingertip towels hanging over brass rods its like a doll house it is yes nervous as she would have been with no other guest brianna linked her hands together shall i help you unpack or would you rather have a rest first i dont need help thank you i might make use of that tub be at home then theres extra towels in that little trunk and i think youll find everything else youd be needing she hesitated again would you want me to bring you up a tray at teatime it would have been easier to agree shannon thought she could have snuggled into the room alone and blocked out everything else no ill come down take all the time you need brianna laid a hand on shannons arm to let her know the statement didnt refer only to having tea ill be just downstairs if you want anything thank you when the door closed behind brianna shannon sat on the edge of the bed in private she could let her shoulders droop and her eyes close she was in ireland and hadnt a clue what to do next chapter five so whats she like this yank sister of yours as at home as he would have been in his own kitchen murphy muldoon helped himself to one of the cream tarts brianna was arranging on a tray he was a tall man who tended toward lankiness hed taken off his cap when hed come into the kitchen as his mother had taught him and his dark hair was tousled from the fingers hed raked through them and in need of a trim keep your fingers off she ordered swatting at them wait until im serving i might not get all i want then he grinned at her dark blue eyes dancing before stuffing the tart in his mouth is she as pretty as you brie flattery wont get you another tart before tea but there was a laugh at the edge of her voice pretty isnt the word for her shes beautiful her hairs calmer than maggies more like the hide on that chestnut mare you love so her eyes are like das werethough she wouldnt like to hear thatthe clearest of greens shes about my height slim and sleek i suppose youd say even after the traveling she hardly looked rumpled at all maggie says shes a cold one since brianna was guarding the tarts like a hen with one chick murphy settled for tea shes reserved brianna corrected its that maggie doesnt want to like her and theres a sadness about her she hides with coolness and that brianna understood perfectly but she smiled really smiled when we came up over the road where the valley spreads out its a fair sight that murphy moved his shoulders as he poured his tea his back was aching a bit for hed been plowing since dawn but it was a good ache a solid dayswork ache she wouldnt see the like of it in new york city you always speak of new york as if it were another planet instead of across the sea its as far as the moon as far as im concerned with a laugh brianna glanced over her shoulder at him he was more handsome than even hed been as a boy and the women of the village had talked of his angel face in those days now there was a good bit of the devil as well to add impact to those vivid blue eyes and quick crooked smile the outdoor life he led suited him and over the years his face had fined down to a kind of sculpted leanness that drew womens eyes a fact that he didnt mind a bit his unruly thatch of black waves defied proper combing his body was tough with muscled arms broad shoulders narrow hips brianna knew first hand that he was as strong as one of his beloved horses and a great deal more gentle despite the strength and ruggedness there was something poetic about him a dreaming in the eyes she thought with affection what are you looking at he wiped a hand over his chin have i cream on my face no i was thinking what a shame it is you havent found a woman to share your pretty face with though he grinned he shifted with some embarrassment why is it whenever a woman marries she thinks everyone should do the same because shes happy she looked down to where kayla sat contentedly in her infant chair dont you think shes looking more like grayson shes the image of you arent you kayla love he bent over to tickle the babys chin what are you doing about your mother brie nothing at the moment wishing she didnt have to think of it she gripped her hands together shell have to be told of course but i want to give shannon time to relax before that storm hits itll be a gale of some proportion are you sure she knows nothing about the matter has no idea there was another woman or a child because of her as sure as i am of my own name brianna sighed and went back to setting up family tea you know how things were between them if mother had known shed have hounded him to death over it thats true enough brie murphy skimmed his knuckles down her cheek until she looked back at him again dont take it all on yourself youre not alone in this i know that but its worrying murphy things are still strained between mother and me and theyve never been smooth between her and maggie i dont know how much worse this will make it yet theres nothing else we could do da would have wanted her to come and have a chance to know her family then rest easy for a while with his cup still in one hand he cuddled her with the other and bent to touch his lips to her cheek then his world turned upside down the vision stood in the doorway watching through cool and glorious green eyes her skin was like the alabaster hed read of and looked as soft as fresh milk her hair shone as it followed the lines of her face to sweep the chin that was lifted high the fairy queen was all he could think and the spell was on him oh shannon a flush heated briannas cheeks as she spotted her half sister how much had she heard brianna wondered and how to handle it teas nearly ready i thought wed have it in here ill serve the guests in the parlor the kitchens fine shed heard plenty and would take time to decide just how to handle it herself just now her attention was focused on the man who was gaping at her as though hed never seen a female before shannon bodine this is our good friend and neighbor murphy muldoon how do you do coherent speech seemed to have deserted him he nodded only dimly aware that he probably resembled a slowwitted fool murphy would you tell the others teas ready when she received no response brianna glanced up at him murphy what he blinked cleared his throat shuffled aye ill tell them he tore his eyes from the vision and stared blankly at brianna tell who what with a laugh brianna gave him a shove toward the door you cant go to sleep on your feet like one of your horses go out and tell grayson and maggie and liam were having tea one last push and he was out of the door with her shutting it behind him hes been working since sunrise ill wager and tuckered murphys usually a bit sharper than that shannon doubted it hes a farmer hes a fine one and hes breeding horses too hes like a brother to maggie and me her eyes leveled with shannons again theres nothing i cant share with murphy and trust it stays with him i see shannon stayed where she was just on the other side of the threshold so you felt you could tell him about this particular situation with a quiet sigh brianna brought the teapot to the table you dont know me shannon nor murphy nor any of us it isnt fair for me to ask you to trust people youve only just met so i wont instead ill ask you to sit down and enjoy your tea intrigued shannon tilted her head you can be a cool one maggies got all the fire she doesnt like me not at the moment shannon had the oddest urge to laugh and gave in to it thats fine i dont like her either whats for tea finger sandwiches cheese and a bit of pate sugar biscuits scones cream tarts apple cake shannon stepped in surveying the spread you do this every afternoon i like to cook smiling again brianna wiped her hands on her apron and i wanted your first day to be special for you youre determined arent you theres a stubborn streak in the family ah here they come maggie see the lads wash their hands would you i have to serve in the parlor cream tarts gray pounced whered you hide them youll not eat my food with dirty fingers brianna said calmly as she finished loading a rolling tea tray help yourself shannon ill be back as soon as ive seen to my guests sit maggie waved to the table as soon as shed washed her son off in the sink she plopped liam down in a high chair gave him a toast finger to munch on will you have sugar in your tea no thank you shannon returned equally stiff just black youre in for a treat gray said as he piled his plate new york may have some of the best restaurants in the world but youve never eaten anything like briannas cooking youre with rytilghmanton he asked taking it on himself to heap shannons plate himself yesoh not so muchive been there over five years theyve got a good rep top of the line happily he bit into a sandwich whered you train carnegie mellon mmm cant do better theres this bakery in pittsburgh maybe a half mile from the college little jewish couple runs it they make these rum cakes i know the place it made her smile to think of it and easy to talk to another american i hit it every sunday morning for four years since maggie was busy with liam and all murphy seemed capable of doing was staring at her shannon felt no qualms about ignoring them in favor of gray brianna told me you came here to research a book does that mean your next ones set here yeah its coming out in a couple of months ill look forward to it i enjoy your books very much ill see you get an advanced copy when the baby began to fuss gray lifted her out and into the curve of his arm where she fell cozily silent again shannon nibbled on her sandwichwhich was good certainly and filled the hole she hadnt realized hunger had dug satisfied but not overly impressed she nipped into a tart her whole system signaled pleasure of the most acute and sinful gray merely grinned when her eyes drifted half closed who needs heaven right dont interrupt she murmured im having an epiphany yeah theres something religious about bries pastries all right gray helped himself to another pig maggie wrinkled her nose at him leave some for me to take home to rogan at least why dont you learn to make your own why should i smug maggie licked cream from her thumb ive only to walk up the road to have yours you live nearby shannon felt her pleasure dim at the idea just down the road maggies thin smile indicated she understood shannons sentiments completely rogan drags her off periodically gray put in to dublin or one of their galleries things are more peaceful then he snuck liam a sugar cookie but im here often enough to keep an eye on things and to see that brianna isnt overtaxed brianna can keep an eye on herself said the woman in question as she came back into the kitchen gray leave some of those tarts for rogan see gray merely sneered at maggie and pulled his wife down in the chair beside him arent you hungry murphy because that unblinking stare was beginning to annoy her shannon drummed her fingers on the table mr muldoons too busy staring at me to bother eating clod maggie muttered and jabbed murphy with an elbow i beg your pardon murphy snatched up his teacup hastily enough to have it slop over the rim i was woolgathering is all i should get back and maybe when he returned to his own fields hed find his sanity waiting thank you brie for the tea welcome to ireland miss bodine he grabbed his cap stuffed it on his head and hurried out well never did i think to see the day that murphy muldoon left his plate full baffled maggie rose to take it to the counter ill just take it for rogan yes do brianna said absently do you think hes coming down with something he didnt look himself shannon thought hed looked healthy enough and with a shrug forgot the odd mr muldoon and finished her tea later when the sky was just losing its bloom of blue and edging toward gray shannon took a tour through briannas back gardens her hostess had wanted her quite clearly to vacate the kitchen after the familys evening meal no particular fan of washing dishes shannon had agreed to the suggestion that she take some air and enjoy the quiet of evening it was certainly the place to do nothing shannon decided intrigued as she strolled around the outside of a greenhouse though it appeared brianna rarely took advantage of comfortable laziness what didnt the woman do shannon wondered she cooked ran the equivalent of a small exclusive hotel cared for an infant gardened enticed a very attractive man and managed to look like some magazine shot of irish country times while she was at it after circling the greenhouse she spotted a picturesque sitting area on the edge of a bed of impatiens and violas she settled into the wooden chair found it as comfortable as it looked and decided she wouldnt think about brianna or maggie or the household she was a temporary part of she would for just a little while think of nothing at all the air was soft and fragrant there was a pretty chiming from a copper hanging of fairies near a window close by she thought she heard the low of a cow in the distancea sound as foreign to her world as the legend of leprechauns or banshees murphys farm she supposed she hoped for his sake he was a better farmer than conversationalist a wave of fatigue washed over her the jet lag her nerves had held at bay for hours she let it come now cocoon her and blur the edges of too many worries and she dreamed of a man on a white horse his hair was black and streaming behind him and his dark cloak whipped in the wind and was beaded with the rain that spewed like fury from an irongray sky lightning split it like a lance speared its flash over his face highlighting the high celtic bones the cobalt eyes of the black irish and the warrior there was a copper broach at the cloaks neck an intricate twist of metal around a carving of a stallions reared head as if in sympathy his mount pawed the chaotic air then pounded the turf they drove straight for her man and beast both equally dangerous equally magnificent she caught the glint of a sword the dull sheen of armor sprayed with mud her heart answered the bellow of thunder and the rain slapped icily at her face but there wasnt fear her chin was thrust high as she watched them bullet toward her and her eyes narrowed against the rain gleamed green in a spray of mud and wet the horse swerved to a halt no more than inches from her the man astride it peered down at her with triumph and lust shining on his face so she heard herself say in a voice that wasnt quite hers youve come back shannon jerked awake shaken and confused by the strangeness and the utter clarity of the dream as if she hadnt been asleep at all she thought as she brushed the hair back from her face but more remembering she barely had time to be amused at herself by the thought when her heart tripped back to double time there was a man standing not a foot away watching her i beg your pardon murphy stepped forward out of the shadows that were spreading i didnt mean to startle you i thought you were napping miserably embarrassed she pulled herself upright in the chair so you came to stare at me again mr muldoon nothat is i he blew out a frustrated breath hadnt he talked to himself sternly about just this behavior damn if hed find himself all thicktongued and softheaded a second time around her i didnt want to disturb you he began again i thought for a minute youd come awake and had spoken to me but you hadnt he tried a smile one hed found usually charmed the ladies the truth of it is miss bodine id come back around to apologize for gaping at you during tea it was rude fine forget it and go away she thought irritably im thinking its your eyes he knew it was more hed known exactly what it was the moment hed looked over and seen her the woman hed waited for the breath she huffed out was impatient my eyes youve fairy eyes clear as water green as moss and full of magic he didnt sound slowwitted now she realized warily his voice had taken on a musical cadence designed to make a woman forget everything but the sound of it thats interesting mr muldoon murphy if its the same to you were in the way of being neighbors no were not but murphys fine with me now if youll excuse instead of rising as shed intended she shrank back in the chair and let out a muffled squeal something sleek and fast came charging out of the shadows and it growled con it took no more than the single quiet syllable from murphy to have the dog skidding to a halt and flopping his tail he didnt mean to scare you murphy laid a hand on the dogs head hes been for his evening run and sometimes when he comes across me he likes to play he wasnt growling so much as talking talking she shut her eyes as she waited for her heart to stop thudding talking dogs thats all the evening needed then con padded over and laying his head in her lap looked soulfully into her face even an iceberg would have melted so now youre apologizing i suppose for scaring me out of my skin she lifted her gaze to murphy the two of you are quite a pair i suppose we can both be clumsy at times in a graceful move that belied the words he drew a clutch of wildflowers from behind his back welcome to the county of clare shannon bodine may your stay be as sweet and colorful as the blooms and last longer flabbergasted and damn it charmed she took the cheerful blossoms from him i thought you were an odd man murphy she murmured it seems i was right but her lips were curved as she rose thank you now thats something ill look forward to your smile he told her when she only lifted her brows its worth waiting for good night shannon sleep well he walked away turned again into a shadow when the dog began to follow he said something soft that had con holding back and turning to wait by shannons side as the fragrance of the blossoms she held teased her senses the man called murphy melted into the night so much for first impressions shannon said to the dog then shook her head i think its time to go in i must be more tired than id thought chapter six storms and white horses brutally handsome men and a circle of standing stones pursued by dreams shannon had not spent a peaceful night and she woke freezing that was odd she thought as the coals in the little fireplace across the room still glowed red and she herself was buried to the chin under a thick downy quilt yet her skin was icy to the point of making her shiver to warm it what was odder still was that she wasnt merely cold until she felt her face for herself she would have sworn she was wetas if shed been standing out in the middle of a rainstorm she sat up in bed dragging her hands through her hair never before in her life had she experienced dreams with such clarity and wasnt sure she wanted it to become a habit but dreams and restless nights aside she was awake now from experience she knew there would be no cuddling back into the pillow and drifting off back in new york that wouldnt have been so frustrating there were always dozens of things that needed to be done and she typically woke early to get a jump on the day there was always an account to work on paperwork to deal with or simple domestic chores to accomplish before heading to the office those done shed have checked her electronic organizer to see what appointments and duties were scheduled for the daywhat social entertainments were on line for the evening the morning show on television would provide her with a weather update and any current news before she picked up her briefcase and her gym bag depending on the day of the week and set off for the brisk sixblock walk to her office the satisfied organized life of the young professional on the way up the corporate ladder it had been precisely the same routine for over five years but here with a sigh she looked toward the window where the western sky was still dark there were no deadlines no appointments no presentations to be given shed taken a break from the structure that was so familiar and therefore comforting what did a person do in the irish countryside at dawn after crawling out of bed she went over to poke at the fire then padded over to the window seat to curl on its cushions she could make out the fields the shadows of stone walls the outline of a house and outbuildings as the sky gradually lightened from indigo to a softer blue with some amusement she heard the crow of a rooster maybe she would take brianna up on the offer of the use of her car and drive somewhere anywhere this part of ireland was famed for its scenery shannon thought she might as well get a look at it while she was here perhaps shed use the location and the vacation time to paint if the mood struck her in the bath she pulled the circular curtain around the clawfoot tub and found with pleasure the water from the shower was hot and plentiful she chose a dark turtleneck and jeans and nearly picked up her purse before she realized shed have no need for it until she made transportation arrangements deciding to take briannas invitation to make herself at home to heart she started downstairs to brew coffee the house was so quiet she could almost believe she was alone she knew there were guests on the second floor but shannon heard nothing but the quiet creak of the stair under her own feet as she walked down to the first floor it was the new view that stopped her the window facing east that framed the stunning break of dawn the roll of clouds on the horizon was thick layered and shot with swirling red the bold color spread into the sky beating back the more soothing blues and tamer pinks with licks of fire even as she watched the clouds moved sailing like a flaming ship as the sky slowly lightened for the first time in months she found herself actively wanting to paint it had been habit more than desire that had had her packing some of her equipment she was grateful now and wondered how far she would have to drive to buy what other supplies she might need pleased with the idea and the prospect of a genuine activity she wandered back toward the kitchen finding brianna already there and wrist deep in bread dough was more of a surprise than it should have been i thought i would be the first up good morning youre an early riser brianna smiled as she continued to knead her dough sos kayla and she wakes hungry theres coffee or tea if you like ive already brewed it for grayson hes up too so much shannon thought for a solitary morning oh he got up hours ago to work he does that sometimes when the storys worrying him ill fix you breakfast once i set the bread to rise no coffees fine after shed poured a cup shannon stood awkwardly wondering what to do next you bake your own bread i do yes its a soothing process youll have toast at least theres a hunk of yesterdays still in the drawer a little later i was thinking i might drive around a bit see the cliffs or something oh sure youll want to see the sights competently brianna patted the dough into a ball and turned it into a large bowl the keys are on that hook there you take them whenever youve a mind to ramble did you have a good night actually i she broke off surprised shed been about to tell brianna about her dreams yes the rooms very comfortable restless again she took another sip of coffee is there a gym anywhere around brianna covered her dough with a cloth then went to the sink to wash off her hands a jim several of them are you looking for anyone in particular shannon opened her mouth then closed it again on a laugh no a gyma health club i work out three or four times a week you know treadmills stair climbers free weights oh brianna set a cast iron skillet on the stove as she thought it through no weve none of that just here a treadmill thats for walking yeah weve fields for that you can have a fine walk across the fields and the fresh airs good for exercising its a lovely morning for being out though well have rain this afternoon youll want a jacket she continued nodding toward a light denim jacket hanging on a peg by the back door a jacket its a bit cool out brianna set bacon to sizzling in the pan the exercise will give you an appetite youll have breakfast when you get back frowning shannon studied briannas back it looked as if she was going for a walk a little bemused she set down her cup and picked up the jacket i dont guess ill be long take your time brianna said cheerfully amused at each other they parted company shannon had never considered herself the outdoor type she wasnt a fan of hiking she much preferred the civilized atmosphere of a wellequipped health club bottled water the morning news on the television set machines that told you your progress she put in fifty minutes three times a week and was pleased to consider herself strong healthy and well toned but shed never understood people who strapped on heavy boots and backpacks and hiked trails or climbed mountains still her discipline was too ingrained to allow her to forfeit all forms of exercise and one day at blackthorn had shown her that briannas cooking could be a problem so shed walk shannon tucked her hands into the pockets of her borrowed jacket for the air was chilly there was a nice little bite in the morning that shook away any lingering dregs of jet lag she passed the garden where primroses were still drenched with dew and the greenhouse that tempted her to cup her hands and peer in through the treated glass what she saw had her mouth falling open shed visited professional nurseries with her mother that were less organized and less well stocked impressed she turned away then stopped it was all so big she thought as she stared out over the roll of land so empty without being aware she hunched her shoulders defensively in the jacket she thought nothing of walking down a new york sidewalk dodging pedestrians guarding her own personal space the blare of traffic blasting horns raised voices were familiar not strange like this shimmering silence not exactly like jogging in central park she muttered comforted by the sound of her own voice because it was less daunting to go on than to return to the kitchen she began to walk there were sounds she realized birds the distant hum of some machine the echoing bark of a dog still it seemed eerie to be so alone rather than focus on that she quickened her pace strolling didnt tone the muscles when she came to the first stone wall she debated her choices she could walk along it or climb over it into the next field with a shrug she climbed over she recognized wheat just high enough to wave a bit in the breeze and in the midst of it a lone tree though it looked immensely old to her its leaves were still the tender green of spring a bird perched on one of its high gnarled branches singing its heart out she stopped to watch to listen wishing shed brought her sketch pad shed have to come back with it it had been too long since shed had the opportunity to do a real landscape odd she thought as she began to walk again she hadnt realized she wanted to yet anyone with even rudimentary skills would find their fingers itching here she decided the colors the shapes and the magnificent light she turned around walking backward for a moment to study the tree from a different angle early morning would be best she decided and climbed over the next wall with her attention still focused behind her only luck kept her from turning headfirst into the cow jesus christ she scrambled backward came up hard against stone the cow simply eyed the intruder dispassionately and swished her tail its so big from her perch on top of the wall shannon let out an unsteady breath i had no idea they were so big cautious she lifted her gaze and discovered that bossie wasnt alone the field was dotted with grazing cows large placideyed ladies with blackandwhite hides since they didnt seem particularly interested in her she lowered slowly until she was sitting on the wall rather than standing on it i guess the tour stops here arent you going to moo or something rather than oblige the nearest cow shifted her bulk and went back to grazing amused now shannon relaxed and took a longer more comprehensive look around what she saw had her lips bowing babies with a laugh she started to spring up to get a firsthand look at the spindly calves romping among their less energetic elders then caution had her glancing back into the eyes of her closest neighbor she wasnt at all sure if cows tended to bite or not guess ill just watch them from right here curiosity had her reaching out warily her eyes riveted on the cows face she just wanted to touch though she leaned out she kept her butt planted firmly on the wall if the cow didnt like the move shannon figured she could be on the other side any woman who worked out three times a week should be able to outrun a cow when her fingers brushed she discovered the hair was stiff and tough and that the cow didnt appear to object more confident shannon inched a little closer and spread her palm over the flank she doesnt mind being handled that one murphy said from behind her shannons yelp had several of the cows trundling off after some annoyed mooing they settled down again but murphy was still laughing when they had and his hand remained on shannons shoulder where he gripped to keep her from falling face first off the wall steady now youre all nerves i thought i was alone she wasnt sure if she was more mortified to have screamed or to have been caught petting a farm animal i was heading back from setting my horses to pasture and saw you in a comfortable move he sat on the wall facing the opposite way and lighted a cigarette its a fine morning her opinion on that was a grunt she hadnt thought about this being his land and now it seemed she was stuck again you take care of all these cows yourself oh i have a bit of help now and then when its needed you go ahead pet her if you like she doesnt mind it i wasnt petting her it was a little late for dignity but shannon made a stab at it i was just curious about how they felt youve never touched a cow the very idea made him grin you have them in america im told of course we have cows we just dont see them strolling down fifth avenue very often she slanted a look at him he was still smiling looking back toward the tree that had started the whole scenario why havent you cut that down its in the middle of your wheat its no trouble to plow and plant around it he said easily and its been here longer than me at the moment he was more interested in her she smelled faintly sinfulsome cunning female fragrance that had a man wondering and wasnt it fine that hed been thinking of her as hed come over the rise there shed been as if shed been waiting youve a fine morning for your first in clare therell be rain later in the day brianna had said the same shannon remembered and frowned up at the pretty blue sky why do you say that didnt you see the sunrise even as she was wondering what that had to do with anything murphy was cupping her chin in his hand and turning her face west and there he said gesturing the clouds gathering up from the sea theyll blow in by noontime and bring us rain a soft one not a storm theres no temper in the air the hand on her face was hard as rock gentle as water she discovered he carried the scents of his farm with himthe horses the earth the grass it seemed wiser all around to concentrate on the sky i suppose farmers have to learn how to gauge the weather its not learning so much you just know to please himself he let his fingers brush through her hair before dropping them onto his own knee the gesture the casual intimacy of it had her turning her head toward him they may have been facing opposite ways with legs dangling on each side of the wall but they were hip to hip and now eye to eye and his were the color of the glass her mother had collectedthe glass shannon had packed so carefully and brought back to new york cobalt she didnt see any of the shyness or the bafflement shed read in them the day before these were the eyes of a confident man one comfortable with himself and one she realized with some confusion of her own who had dangerous thoughts behind them he was tempted to kiss her just lean forward and lay his lips upon hers once quietly if shed been another woman he would have then again he knew if shed been another woman he wouldnt have wanted to quite so badly you have a face shannon that plants itself right in the front of a mans mind and blooms there it was the voice she thought the irish in it that made even such a foolish statement sound like poetry in defense against it she looked away back toward the safety of grazing cows you think in farming analogies thats true enough theres something id like to show you will you walk with me i should get back but he was already rising and taking her hand as though it were already a habit tisnt far he bent plucked a starry blue flower that had been growing in a crack in the wall rather than hand it to her as shed expected he tucked it behind her ear it was ridiculously charming she fell into step beside him before she could stop herself dont you have work i thought farmers were always working oh ive a moment or two to spare theres con murphy lifted a hand as they walked rabbitting the sight of the sleek gray dog racing across the field in pursuit of a blur that was a rabbit had her laughing then her fingers tightened on murphys in distress hell kill it aye if he could catch it likely he would but chances of that are slim hunter and hunted streaked over the rise and vanished into a thin line of trees where the faintest gleam of water caught the sun hell lose him now as he always does he cant help chasing any more than the rabbit can help fleeing hell come back if you call him shannon said urgently hell come back and leave it alone willing to indulge her murphy sent out a whistle moments later con bounded back over the field tongue lolling happily thank you murphy started walking again there was no use telling her con would be off again at the next rabbit he scented have you always lived in the city in or near we moved around a lot but we always settled near a major hub she glanced up he seemed taller when they were walking side by side or perhaps it was just the way he had of moving over the land and have you always lived around here always some of this land was the concannons and ours ran beside it toms heart was never in farming and over the years he sold off pieces to my father then to me now whats mine splits between whats left of the concannons leaving a piece of theirs on either side her brow furrowed as she looked over the hills she couldnt begin to estimate the acreage or figure the boundaries it seems like a lot of land its enough he came to a wall stepped easily over it then to shannons surprise he simply put his hands at her waist and lifted her over as if shed weighed nothing heres what i wanted to show you she was still dealing with the shock of how strong he was when she looked over and saw the stone circle her first reaction wasnt surprise or awe or pleasure it was simple acceptance it would occur to her later that she hadnt been surprised because shed known it was there shed seen it in her dreams how wonderful the pleasure did come and quickly now tilting her head over her eyes to block the angle of the sun she studied it as an artist would for shape and texture and tone it wasnt large and several of the stones that had served as lintels had fallen but the circle stood majestic and somehow magically in a quiet field of green where horses grazed in the distance ive never seen one except in pictures hardly aware that shed linked her fingers with murphy and was pulling him with her she hurried closer there are all sorts of legends and theories about standing stones arent there spaceships or druids giants freezing or fairies dancing do you know how old it is old as the fairies id say that made her laugh i wonder if they were places of worship or sacrifice the idea made her shudder pleasantly as she reached out a hand to touch the stone just as her fingers brushed she drew them back sharply and stared thered been heat there too much heat for such a cool morning murphy never took his eyes off her its an odd thing isnt it to feel it ifor a minute it was like i touched something breathing feeling foolish she laid a hand firmly on the stone there was a jolt she couldnt deny it but she told herself it came from her own sudden nerves theres power here perhaps in the stones themselves perhaps in the spot they chose to raise them in i dont believe in that sort of thing youve too much irish in you not to very gently he drew her through the arch of stone and into the center of the dance determined to be practical she folded her arms over her chest and moved away from him id like to paint it if youd let me it doesnt belong to me the land around its mine but it belongs to itself you paint it if it pleases you it would relaxing again she wandered the inner circle i know people back home whod pay for a chance to stand here the same ones who go to sedonna looking for vortexes and worry about their chakras murphy grinned as he scratched his chin ive read of that interesting dont you think there are some places and some things that hold old memories in them and the power that comes from them she could nearly could standing there if she let herself i certainly dont think hanging some pretty rock around my neck is going to improve my sex life amused she looked back at him and i dont think a farmer believes it either well i dont know about wearing a necklace to make things more interesting in bed id rather depend on myself for that i bet you do shannon murmured and turned away to stroke one of the stones still theyre so ancient and theyve stood here for longer than anyone really knows thats magic in itself i wonder she broke off holding her breath and listening hard did you hear that he was only a pace away now and waited and watched what did you hear shannon her throat was dry she cleared it must have been a bird it sounded like someone crying for a second murphy laid a hand on her hair let it run through as he had before ive heard her so have some others your sisters dont stiffen up he murmured turning her to face him bloods blood and its useless to ignore it she weeps here because she lost her lover so the story goes it was a bird shannon insisted they were doomed you see he continued as if she hadnt spoken he was only a poor farmer and she was the daughter of the landlord but they met here and loved here and conceived a child here so its said she was cold again and fighting back a shiver spoke lightly a legend murphy id expect thered be plenty about a spot like this so there are this ones sad as many are he left her here to wait for him so they could run off together but they caught him and killed him and when her father found her the next day she was as dead as her love with tears still on her cheeks and now of course she haunts it he smiled then not at all insulted by the cynicism she loved him she can only wait murphy took her hands to warm them in his gray thought of doing a murder here but changed his mind he told me it wasnt a place for blood so instead of being in his book itll be on your canvas its more fitting if i get to it she should have tugged her hands away but it felt so good to have his around them i need more supplies if i decide to do any serious painting while im here i should get back im keeping you from your work and briannas probably holding breakfast for me but he only looked at her enjoying the way her hands felt in his the way the air blushed color in her cheeks enjoyed as well the unsteady pulse he felt at her wrists and the quick confusion in her eyes im glad i found you sitting on my wall shannon bodine itll give me something to picture the rest of my day annoyed with the way her knees were melting she stiffened them and cocked her head murphy are you flirting with me it seems i am thats flattering but i dont really have time for it and youve still got my hands so i do with his eyes on hers he lifted them pressed his lips to her knuckles his smile was quick and disarming when he let her go come walking with me again shannon she stood a moment when he turned and stepped out of the dance then because she couldnt resist she darted to one of the arches and watched him walk with a whistle for the dog over his field not a man to underestimate she mused and she watched until hed disappeared behind a rise unconsciously rubbing her warmed knuckles against her cheek chapter seven shannon didnt know how to approach her first visit to an irish pub it wasnt that she didnt look forward to it she always enjoyed new things new places new people and even if shed been resistant briannas obvious pleasure at the idea of an evening out would have pushed her into going yet she couldnt quite resolve herself to the idea of taking a baby to a bar oh youre ready brianna glanced up when shannon started down the stairs im sorry im running behind the baby was hungry then needed changing she swayed as she spoke kayla resting in the crook of one arm a tray with two cups of tea balanced in the other then the sisters complained about itchy throats and asked for some hot toddies the sisters the freemonts in the blue room oh you probably missed them they just came in today seems they got caught in the rain and took a chill brianna rolled her eyes theyre regulars are the freemonts so i try not to mind their fussing but they spend the three days a year they have here doing little else gray says its because theyve lived with each other all their lives and neither ever had a decent tumble with a man she stopped herself flushed then managed a weak smile when shannon laughed i shouldnt be talking that way about guests but the point is im a little behind things so if you wouldnt mind waiting of course not can i oh and theres the phone blast it let it ring wheres gray oh hes investigating a crime scene or killing someone else he snarled when i poked into his studio so hell be no help at the moment i see well can i do something id be grateful if you could take the baby for a few minutes just while i run this tray upstairs and pamper the sisters a bit briannas eyes gleamed it wont take long i used a free hand with the whiskey sure ill take her warily shannon shifted kayla into her arms the baby felt so terrifyingly small there and fragile i havent had a lot of practice most of the women i know are concentrating on their career and putting off having children a pity isnt it that its still so much easier for men to do both if youd just walk her a bit shes restlessas anxious i think to get out and have some music and company as i am with an enviable grace brianna darted up the steps with her tray and doctored tea restless kayla shannon strolled down the hall and into the parlor i know the feeling charmed she skimmed a finger down the babys cheek and felt that quick jolt of pleasure when a tiny fist gripped it strong arent you youre no pushover i dont think your mothers one either indulging herself she snuck a kiss then another delighted when kayla bubbled at her pretty great isnt she still starryeyed shannon looked up and smiled as gray strode into the room shes just beautiful you dont realize how tiny they are until youre holding one shes grown he bent down grinned at his daughter she looked like an indignant fairy when she was born ill never forget it she looks like her mother now speaking of which briannas upstairs drugging the freemont sisters good gray seemed to find that no surprise and nodded i hope she does a good job of it otherwise theyll keep her busting her ass for three days she seems to do that pretty well on her own thats brie want a drink before we go or would you rather wait for a pint at the pub ill wait thanks youre going with us i thought you were killing someone not tonight theyre already dead gray considered a whiskey opted against he was more in the mood for a guinness brie said you wanted to do some painting while youre here i think i do i brought some things with me enough to get started anyway unconsciously she was mimicking briannas movements by swaying the baby she said i could use the car and try ennis for more supplies youd do better in galway but you might find what you need there i dont like to use her car shannon blurted out worried about driving on the left there is thatbut it just doesnt feel right to borrow it considering gray eased down on the arm of the sofa want some advice from a fellow yank maybe the people around here are a world unto themselves offering to give to lend to share everything themselves included is second nature when brie hands you the keys to her car she isnt thinkingis she insured does she have a driving recordshes just thinking someone needs the car and thats all there is to it it isnt as easy from my end i didnt come here to be part of a big generous family why did you come because i dont know who i am furious that it had come out that it had been there to come out she handed him the baby i dont like having an identity crisis cant blame you gray said easily ive been there myself he caught the sound of his wifes voice patient soothing why dont you give yourself a little time pal enjoy the scenery gain a few pounds on briannas cooking in my experience the answers usually come when you least expect them professionally or personally he rose gave her a friendly pat on cheek both hey brie are we going or not i just have to get my bag she hurried in smoothing her hair oh gray are you going then do you think id miss an evening out with you with his free hand he circled her waist and swept her into a quick waltz her face was already glowing i thought you were going to work i can always work even as her lips curved he was lowering his to them shannon waited a beat then another before clearing her throat maybe i should wait outside in the car with my eyes closed stop it grayson youre embarrassing shannon no im not shes just jealous and he winked at the woman he already considered his sisterinlaw come on pal well find a guy for you no thanks i just got rid of one yeah always interested gray handed the baby to his wife so that he could circle shannons waist tell us all about it we live for gossip around here leave her be brianna said with an exasperated laugh dont tell him anything you dont want to find in a book this wouldnt make very interesting reading shannon decided and stepped outside into the damp air it had rained and was raining still just as predicted i can make anything interesting gray opened the car door for his wife with some gallantry then grinned so whyd you dump him i didnt dump him it was all just absurd enough to brighten her mood shannon slid into the backseat and shook back her hair we parted on mutually amenable terms yeah yeah she dumped him gray tapped his fingers on the back of the seat as he eased into the road women always talk prissy when they break a guys heart okay ill make it up shannon flashed gray a smile in the rearview mirror he crawled he begged he pleaded i believe he even wept but i was unmoved and crushed his stillbleeding heart under my heel now hes shaved his head given away all his worldly goods and joined a small religious cult in mozambique not too shabby more entertaining than the truth which was we didnt really share any more than a taste for thai food and office space but youre welcome to use either version in a book youre happier without him then brianna said complacently and thats whats important a little surprised at how simple it was shannon raised a brow yes youre right just as it was a great deal more simple than she had supposed to sit back and enjoy the evening omalleys pub it was shannon decided as she stepped inside an old blackandwhite movie starring pat obrien the air faintly hazed from cigarettes the murky colors the smokesmudged wood the men hunkered at the bar over big glasses of dark beer the laughter of women the murmuring voices the piping tune in the background there was a television hung behind the bar the picture on some sort of sporting event the sound off a man wearing a white apron over his wide girth glanced up and grinned broadly as he continued to draw another brew so youve brought the little one at last he set the pint down to let it settle bring her by brie let us have a look at her obliging brianna put kayla carrier and all atop the bar shes wearing the bonnet your missus brought by tim thats a sweet one he clucked kayla under the chin with a thick finger the image of you she is brianna i had something to do with it gray put in as people began to crowd around the baby sure and you did tim agreed but the good lord in his wisdom overlooked that and gave the lass her mothers angel face will you have a pint gray i will of guinness whatll you have shannon she looked at the beer tim omalley finished drawing something smaller than that a pint and a glass gray ordered and a soft drink for the new mother shannon this is tim omalley building your guinness brianna laid a hand on shannons shoulder tim this is my guest shannon bodine from new york city new york city with his hands moving with the ease and automation of long experience tim beamed into shannons face ive cousins to spare in new york city you dont happen to be knowing francis omalley the butcher no im sorry bodine a man on the stool beside shannon took a deep considering drag from his cigarette blew out smoke with a thoughtful air i knew a katherine bodine from kilkelly some years back pretty as fresh milk was she kin to you maybe shannon gave him an uncertain smile not that i know of its shannons first trip to ireland brianna explained there were nods of understanding all around i knew bodines from dublin city a man at the end of the bar spoke in a voice cracked with age four brothers whod sooner fight than spit the mad bodines we called them and every man son of them ran off and joined the ira thatd be back in thirtyseven thirtyfive the woman beside him corrected and winked at shannon out of a face seamed with lines i went out walking a time or two with paddy bodine and johnny split his lip over it a mans got to protect whats his old john conroy took his wifes hand and gave it a bony squeeze there was no prettier lass in dublin than nell obrian and now shes mine shannon smiled into the beer gray handed her the couple were ninety if they were a day she was sure and they were holding hands and flirting with each other as if they were newlyweds let me have that baby a woman came out of the room behind the bar wiping her hands on her apron go get yourself a table she said gesturing brianna aside im taking her back with me so i can spoil her for an hour knowing any protest was useless brianna introduced shannon to tims wife and watched the woman bundle kayla off we might as well sit then she wont let me have the baby back until we leave shannon turned to follow and saw murphy hed been sitting near the low fire all along watching her while he eased a quiet tune out of a concertina looking at her had fuddled his mind again slowed his tongue so he was glad hed had time to gather his wits before gray led her to his table are you entertaining us tonight murphy brianna asked as she sat myself mostly he was grateful his fingers didnt fumble like his brain when gray nudged shannon into a chair all he could see for a heartbeat of time were her eyes pale and clear and wary hello shannon murphy thered been no gracious way to avoid taking the chair gray had pulled out for herthe one that put her nearly elbow to elbow with murphy she felt foolish that it would matter whered you learn to play oh i picked it up here and there murphy has a natural talent for instruments brianna said proudly he can play anything you hand him really his long fingers certainly seemed clever enough and skilled enough on the complicated buttons of the small box still she thought he must know the tune well as he never glanced down at what he was doing he only stared at her a musical farmer she murmured do you like music he asked her sure who doesnt like music he paused long enough to pick up his pint sip he supposed hed have to get used to his throat going dry whenever she was close is there a tune youd like to hear she lifted a shoulder let it fall casually but she was sorry hed stopped playing i dont know much about irish music gray leaned forward dont ask for danny boy he warned in a whisper murphy grinned at him once a yank he said lightly and ordered himself to relax again a name like shannon bodine and you dont know irish music ive always been more into percy sledge aretha franklin with his eyes on hers and a grin at the corners of his mouth he started a new tune the grin widened when she laughed its the first time ive heard when a man loves a woman on a mini accordion tis a concertina he glanced over at a shout ah theres my man young liam sweeney scrambled across the room and climbed into murphys lap he aimed a soulful look candy you want your mum to scrape the skin off me again but murphy looked over noted that maggie had stopped at the bar he reached into his pocket and took out a wrapped lemon drop pop it in quick before she sees us it was obviously an old routine shannon watched liam cuddle closer to murphy his tongue caught between his tiny teeth as he dealt with the wrapping so its family night out is it maggie crossed over laid her hands on the back of briannas chair wheres the baby diedre snatched her automatically brianna scooted over so that maggie could draw up another chair hello shannon the greeting was polite and coolly formal before maggies gaze shifted narrowed expertly on her son what have you there liam nothing he grinned over his lemon drop nothing indeed murphy youre paying for his first cavity then her attention shifted again shannon saw the tall dark man come toward the table two cups stacked in one hand a pint glass in the other shannon bodine my husband rogan sweeney its good to meet you after setting down the drinks he took her hand smiling with a great deal of charm whatever curiosity there was was well hidden are you enjoying your visit yes thank you she inclined her head i suppose i have you to thank for it only indirectly he pulled up a chair of his own making it necessary for shannon to slide another inch or two closer to murphy hobbs tells me you work for rytilghmanton weve always used the pryce agency in america shannon lifted a brow were better rogan smiled perhaps ill look into that this isnt a business meeting his wife complained murphy wont you play something lively he slipped easily into a reel pumping quick complicated notes out of the small instrument conversation around them became muted punctuated by a few laughs some hand clapping as a man in a brimmed hat did a faststepping dance on his way to the bar do you dance murphys lips were so close to her ear shannon felt his breath across her skin not like that she eased back using her glass as a barrier i suppose you do thats part of it right he tilted his head as amused as he was curious being irish you mean sure you dance she gestured with her glass drink brawl write melancholy prose and poetry and enjoy your image as suffering hardfisted rebels he considered a minute keeping time with the tap of a foot well rebels we are and suffering weve done it seems youve lost your connection i never had one my father was third or fourthgeneration and my mother had no family i knew about that brought a frown to her eyes and though he was sorry for it murphy wasnt ready to let it go but you think you know ireland and the irish someone else had gotten up to dance so he picked up a new tune to keep them happy youve watched some jimmy cagney movies on the latenight telly or listened to pat obrien playing his priests when her frown deepened he smiled blandly oh and thered be the saint patricks parade down your fifth avenue so so it tells you nothing does it you want to know the irish shannon then you listen to the music the tune and the words when there are words to hear and when you hear it truly you might begin to know what makes us musics the heart of any people any culture because it comes from the heart intrigued despite herself she glanced down at his busy fingers then im to think the irish are carefree and quick on their feet one tune doesnt tell the whole tale though the child was dozing now in his lap he played on shifting to something so suddenly sad so suddenly soft shannon blinked something in her own heart broke a little as brianna began to quietly sing the lyrics others joined in telling the tale of a soldier brave and doomed dying a martyr for his country named james connolly when hed finished rogan took the sleeping boy into his own lap and murphy reached for his beer its not all macnamarras band is it shed been touched deeply and wasnt sure she wanted to be its an odd culture that writes lovely songs about an execution we dont forget our heroes maggie said with a snap in her voice isnt it true that in your country they have tourist attractions on fields of battle your gettysburg and such shannon eyed maggie coolly nodded touché and most of us like to pretend wed have fought for the south gray put in for slavery maggie sneered we know more about slavery than you could begin to imagine not for slavery pleased a debate was in the offing gray shifted toward her for a way of life that should keep them happy rogan murmured as his wife and brotherinlaw dived into the argument is there anything youd particularly like to do or see while youre here shannon wed be pleased to arrange things for you his accent was different she noted subtly different smoother with a hint of what she would have termed prep school i suppose i should see the usual tourist things and i dont suppose i could go back without seeing at least one ruin grays put one nearby in his next book murphy commented he did yes brianna glanced behind her trying not to fret because diedre had yet to return the baby he did a nasty murder there im just going to go back and see how kaylas fairing would you have another pint murphy i wouldnt mind thanks shannon with some surprise shannon noted her glass was empty yes i suppose ill get the drinks after passing liam to his wife rogan rose giving brianna a pat on the cheek go fuss with the baby do you know this one murphy asked as he began to play again it only took her a moment scarborough fair it meant simon and garfunkel to her on the oldies station on the radio do you sing shannon as much as anyone who has a shower and a radio fascinated she bent her head closer how do you know which buttons to push first you have to know what song youve a mind to play here no i but he had already slipped an arm around her and was drawing her hands under the straps beneath his you have to get the feel of it first he guided her fingers to the buttons pressed down gently as he opened the bellows the chord that rang out was long and pure and made her laugh thats one if you can do one you can do another to prove it he pushed the bellows in and made a different note it just takes the wanting and the practice experimentally she shifted some fingers around and winced at the clash of notes i think it might take some talent then she was laughing again as he played his fingers over hers and made the instrument come to life and quick hands how can you see what youre playing with the laugh still in her eyes she shook back her hair and turned her face to his the jolt around her heart was as lively as the tune and not nearly as pleasant its a matter of feeling though her fingers had gone still he moved his around them changing the mood of the music yet again wistful and romantic what do you feel like im being played every bit as cleverly as this little box her eyes narrowed a bit as she studied him somehow their positions had shifted just enough to be considered an embrace the hands those hardpalmed limber hands were unquestionably possessive over hers you have some very smooth moves murphy it occurs to me you dont mean that as a compliment i dont its an observation it was shocking to realize the pulse in her throat was hammering his gaze lowered to her mouth lingered so that she could feel the heat and his intention as a tangible thing no she said very quietly very firmly as you please his eyes came back to hers and there was a subtle and simple power in them that challenged id rather kiss you the first time in a more private place myself where i could take my time about it she thought he wouldtake his time that is he might not have been the slow man shed originally perceived but she had a feeling he was thorough id say that completes the lesson determined to find some distance she tugged her hands from under his well have another whenever youve a mind to and indeed taking his time he lifted his arm from around her then set down the concertina to drink the last of his beer youve got music in you shannon you just havent let yourself play it yet i think ill stick to the radio thanks more agitated than she cared to admit she rose excuse me she went off in search of the rest room and time to settle down murphy was smiling to himself when he set his empty glass down his brow lifted when he caught maggies frowning stare what are you about murphy she demanded im about to have another beeronce rogan gets back with it dont play games with me boyo she wasnt sure herself if it was temper or worry brewing in her but neither was comforting i know youve an eye for the ladies but ive never seen that look in them before havent you stop hounding him maggie gray kicked back in his chair murphys entitled to test the waters shes a looker isnt she close your mouth grayson and no youve no right to be testing these waters murphy muldoon he watched her murmuring a thanks when rogan set fresh drinks on the table youve an objection to me getting to know your sister maggie mae eyes bright and sharp she leaned forward ive an objection to seeing you walking toward the end of a cliff that youll surely fall off shes not one of us and shes not going to be interested in a west county farmer no matter how pretty he is murphy said nothing for a moment knowing maggie would be simmering with impatience as he took out a cigarette contemplated it lighted it drew in the first drag its kind of you to worry about me maggie but its my cliff and my fall if you think im going to sit by while you make an ass of yourself and get your heart tromped on in the bargain youre mistaken its none of your business margaret mary rogan said and had his wifes wrath spewing on him none of mine damn if it isnt ive known this softheaded fool all of his life and loved him though god knows why and this yank wouldnt be here if it werent for me and brianna the yanks your sister gray commented which means shes probably as prickly and stubborn as you before maggie could bare her teeth at that murphy was holding up a hand shes the right of it its your business maggie as im your friend and shes your sister but its more my business the hint of steel under the quiet tone had her temper defusing and her worry leaping murphy shell be going back soon where she came from not if i can persuade her otherwise she grabbed his hands now as if the contact would transfer some sense into him you dont even know her some things you know before its reasonable he linked his fingers with hers for the bond there was deep and strong ive waited for her maggie and here she is thats it for me because she could see the unarguable certainty of it in his eyes she closed her own youve lost your mind i cant get it back for you you cant no not even you she only sighed all right then when youve had your fall and lay broken at the bottom ill come around and nurse your wounds i want to take liam home now sweeney she rose bundling the sleeping boy into her arms i wont ask you to talk sense to him she added to gray men dont see past a comely face when she turned she saw that shannon had come out of the rest room and been waylaid by the conroys she sent shannon a hard look was answered in kind then strode out of the pub with her son theyve got more in common than either one of them realizes gray watched shannon stare at the pub door before giving her attention back to the old couple its the common ground thats between them as much as under their own feet gray nodded before looking back at murphy are you stuck on that comely face murphy more out of habit than design murphy fiddled out a tune thats part of it his lips curved but the look in his eyes was distant and deep its the face ive been waiting to see again she wasnt going to let maggie get under her skin shannon promised herself that as she readied for bed later that night the woman had set detectives on her had her researched and reported and now that shed tried to be open minded enough to meet with the concannons facetoface maggie treated her like an intruder well she was staying as long as she damn well pleased a couple of weeks shannon mused three at the outside no one was going to chase her away with cold looks and abrasive comments margaret mary concannon was going to come to realize that america bred tougher nuts to crack and the farmer wasnt going to spook her either charm and good looks werent weapons that worried her shed known plenty of charming goodlooking men maybe shed never met one with quite murphys style or that odd something flowing so placidly under it all but it didnt concern her not really she climbed into bed tugged the covers up to her chin the rain had made the air just a little cooler than comfortable still it was snug and almost childishly pleasant to be bundled into bed with the sound of the rain pattering and the steaming cup of tea brianna had insisted she take with her cooling on the nightstand tomorrow shed explore shannon promised herself she would swallow her pride and take the car shed find her art supplies maybe some ruins a few shops shed done enough traveling with her parents not to be concerned about knocking about a foreign country on her own and on her own is where she wanted to be for a day without anyone watching her movements or trying to dissect them snuggling down lower in the bed she let her mind drift to the people shed become involved with brianna the homebody a new mother new wife and a businesswoman shannon reminded herself efficient talented warm hearted certainly but with something like worry behind her eyes grayher fellow yank easygoingon the surface at any rate friendly sharp witted dazzled by his wife and daughter content apparently to shrug off the high life he could be living in a major city with his fame maggie the scowl came automatically suspicious by nature hotheaded frank to the point of rudeness shannon considered it too bad that she respected those particular traits unquestionably a loving wife and mother indisputably a major talent and shannon though overly protective and fiercely loyal rogan was cultured smooth the ingrained manners as much a part of him as his eyes organized she would guess and shrewd sophisticated and sharp enough to run an organization that was respected around the world and she thought grimly he had to have a sense of humor and the patience of job to live with maggie then there was murphy the good friend and neighbor the farmer with a talent for music and flirtation strikingly handsome and unpretentiousyet not nearly as simple as it appeared at first glance she didnt think shed ever met a man as completely in tune with himself he wanted to kiss her she thought as her eyes grew heavy some place private where he could take his time about it it might be interesting the man controlled the impatient horse with no visible effort rain continued to pelt icily so that it sounded like pebbles striking the ground the white stallion snorted sending out frosty clouds of smoke as man and woman watched each other you waited she could feel the heavy thud of her own heart and the need the terrible need was as strong as her pride walking in my own field has nothing to do with waiting he laughed a full reckless sound that rolled over the hills at the crest of one of those hills stood the stone circle watching you waited in a move as graceful as a dance he leaned down and scooped her off her feet with one arm he lifted her then set her in the saddle in front of him kiss me he demanded twining gloved fingers in her hair and make it count her arms dragged him closer until her breasts were flattened against the traveling armor over his chest her mouth was as hungry as desperate and rough as his on an oath he flung out a hand so that his cloak enfolded her by christ its worth every cold filthy mile for a taste of you then stay damn you she pulled him close again pressed her starving lips to his stay in sleep shannon murmured rocked between pleasure and despair for even in sleep she knew he wouldnt chapter eight shannon took a day for herself and was better for it the morning was damp but cleared gradually so that as she drove the landscape surrounding her seemed washed and skillfully lit furze lining the road was a blur of yellow blossoms hedges of fucshia hinted at droplets of blood red gardens were drenched with color as the flowers sunned themselves in the watery light hills the vivid green of them simply shimmered she took photographs toying with the idea of using the best of them as a basis for sketches or paintings it was true enough that she had some trouble negotiating the irish roads and the leftside drive but she didnt intend to admit it she shopped for postcards and trinkets for friends back home along the narrow streets of ennis friends she mused who thought she was simply taking a long overdue vacation it was lowering to realize there was no one back home she felt intimate enough with to have shared her connection here or her need to explore it work had always come firstwith the ambition scrambling behind it and that she decided was a sad commentary on her life work had been a huge part of who she was or considered herself to be now shed cut herself off from it purposely so that she felt like a solitary survivor drifting alone in an ocean of self doubt if she was not shannon bodine by birth and the hot young commercial artist by design who was she the illegitimate daughter of a faceless irishman whod bedded a lonely woman whod been on her own personal oddessy that was a painful thought but one that kept worrying at her mind she didnt want to believe that she was so unformed so weak hearted that the bald fact of her birth should matter to the grown woman yet it did she stood on a lonely strand of beach with the wind whipping through her hair and knew it did if shed been told as a child had somehow been guided through life with the knowledge that colin bodine was the father who chose her if not the father whod conceived her she felt she couldnt be so hurt by the truth now she couldnt change itnot the facts or the way shed learned of them the only option left was to face them and in facing them face herself rough seas today shannon looked around startled by the voice and the old woman who stood just behind her she hadnt heard anyone approach but the breakers were crashing and her mind had been very far away yes it is shannons lips curved in the polite distant smile reserved for strangers its a beautiful spot though some prefer the wildness the woman clutched a hooded cloak around her staring out to sea with eyes surprisingly bright in such a welllined face some the calm theres enough of both in the world for everyone to have their choice she looked at shannon then alert but unsmiling and enough time for any to change their mind puzzled shannon tucked her hands in her jacket she wasnt used to having philosophical discussions with passersby i guess most people like a little of each depending on their mood what do they call this place does it have a name some that call it morias strand for the woman who drowned herself in the surf when she lost her husband and three grown sons to a fire she didnt give herself time to change her mind you see or to remember that nothing good or ill stays forever its a lonely name for such a beautiful spot it is yes and its good for the soul to stop and take a long look now and again at what really lasts she turned to shannon again and smiled with great kindness the older you are the longer you look ive taken a lot of long looks today shannon smiled back but i have to get back now aye youve a ways to travel yet but youll get where youre going lass and not forget where youve been an odd woman shannon thought as she started the climb up the gentle slope of rocks toward the road she supposed it was another irish trait to make an esoteric conversation out of something as simple as a view as she reached the road it occurred to her that the woman had been old and alone and perhaps needed a ride to wherever shed been going she turned back with thoughts of offering just that and saw nothing but an empty strand the shiver came first then the shrug the woman had just gone about her business that was all and it was past time that she turn the car around and take it back to its owner she found brianna in the kitchen sitting alone for once and nursing a solitary cup of tea ah youre back with an effort brianna smiled then rose to pour another cup did you have a nice drive yes thanks meticulously shannon returned the car keys to their pegs i was able to pick up some of the supplies i needed too so ill do some sketching tomorrow i noticed another car out front guests just arrived this afternoon from germany your inns a regular un briannas absent response had her lifting a brow shannon might not have known the other woman well but she recognized worry when she saw it is something wrong brianna twisted her hands together caught herself in the habitual gesture and let them fall would you sit for a minute shannon id hoped to give you a few days before talking of this but im cornered all right shannon sat lets have it do you want something with your tea ive biscuits or youre stalling brianna brianna sighed and sat im a born coward i need to speak with you about my mother shannon didnt move but she brought her shields down it was instinctive covering both defensive and offensive and her voice reflected the shift all right we both know im not here to take in the sights what do you want to say about it youre angry and i cant blame you for it youll be angrier yet before its over brianna stared down into her tea for a moment bad feelings are what im most cowardly about but theres no putting this off shes coming by ive run out of excuses to stop her i cant lie to her shannon and pretend youre no more than a guest here why should you she doesnt know about this any of this eyes troubled brianna looked up again nothing about my father and your mother nothing about you shannons smile was cool and thin do you really believe that from what ive seen wives generally have an instinct about straying husbands straying wasnt what happened between our parents and yes i believe it completely if my mother had known it would have been her finest weapon against him it hurt to admit it shamed her to speak of it but she saw no choice now never once in my life did i see any love between them only duty the coldness of that and the heat of resentment it wasnt something shannon wanted to hear and certainly nothing she chose to care about she picked up her cup then why did they stay married theres a complicated business brianna mused church children habit even my mothers resentment for him was greatand to be fair she had some reason he could never hold on to his money nor had he any skill in the making of it money and what it buys wasis important to her she had a career in singing and an ambition when she met him she never wanted to settle for a house and a little piece of land but there was a flash you could say between them the flash became maggie i see it appeared she and her half sister had more in common than shannon had realized he made a habit of being careless with sex briannas eyes went hot and sharp a phenomenon that had shannon staring in fascination you have no right to say that no even you have no right for you didnt know him he was a man of great kindness and great heart for more than twenty years he put his own dreams behind him to raise his children he loved maggie as much as any father could love any child it was my mother who blamed him and maggie for the life she found herself faced with she lay with him to make me out of duty duty to the church first i cant think of a colder bed for a man to come to you cant know what was between them before you were born shannon interrupted i know very well she told me herself i was her penance for her sin her reparation and after she knew she was carrying me there was no need to be his wife beyond the bedroom door shannon shook her head it had to be as humiliating for brianna to speak of such matters as it was for her to hear it yet brianna didnt look humiliated she noted brianna looked coldly furious im sorry its almost impossible for me to understand why two people would stay together under those conditions this isnt america tis ireland and more than twenty years ago in ireland im telling you this so youll understand there was pain in this house some of it da brought on himself theres no denying that but theres a bitterness in my mother and something inside her makes her cleave to it if she had known even suspected that hed found happiness and love with another shed have driven him into the ground with it she couldnt have stopped herself nor seen a reason to and now shell have to know now shell have to know brianna agreed shell see you as a slap and shell try to hurt you she cant hurt me im sorry if it seems callous to you but her feelings and her way of displaying them just dont matter to me that may be true brianna took a long breath shes better more content than she used to be weve set her up in her own house near to ennis its more what makes her happy we found a wonderful woman to live with her lotties a retired nursewhich comes in handy as mother sees herself suffering from all manner of illnesses the grandchildren have mellowed her a bit too though she doesnt like to show it and youre afraid this will blow things out of the water again im not afraid it will i know it will if i could spare you from her anger and embarrassment i would shannon i can handle myself briannas face relaxed into a smile then ill ask a favor dont let whatever she says or does turn you away weve had such little time and i want more i planned to stay two or three weeks shannon said evenly i dont see any reason to change that im grateful now if she broke off distressed when she heard the sound of the front door opening and the raised female voices oh theyre here already and youd like to talk to her alone first i would if you dont mind id just as soon not be around for the first act feigning a calmness she no longer felt shannon rose ill go outside she told herself it was ridiculous to feel as though she were deserting a sinking ship it was briannas mother shannon reminded herself as she started along the garden path briannas problem thered be a scene she imagined full of irish emotions temper and despair she certainly wanted no part of that thank god shed been raised in the states by two calm reasonable people who werent given to desperate mood swings drawing a deep breath she turned a circle and saw murphy crossing the closest field coming toward the inn he had a wonderful way of walking she noted not a strut not a swagger yet his stride had all the confidence of both she had to admit it was a pleasure to watch him the raw masculinity of movement an animated painting she mused irish man yes that was it exactly she decidedthe longmuscled arms with the work shirt rolled up to the elbows the jeans that had seen dozens of washings the boots that had walked countless miles the cap worn low to shade the eyes that couldnt dim that rich startling blue the almost mythically handsome face a capital m man she reflected no polished executive could exude such an aura of success striding down madison avenue in a thousanddollar suit with a dozen sterling roses in his manicured hand as murphy muldoon strolling over the land in worn boots and a spray of wildflowers its a pleasant thing to walk toward a woman whos smiling at you i was thinking you looked like a documentary irish farmer walking his land that disconcerted him my land ends at the wall there doesnt seem to matter amused by his reaction she glanced down at the flowers he held isnt that what we call bringing coals to newcastle but these are from my land since i was thinking of you i picked them along the way theyre lovely thanks she did what any woman would do and buried her face in them is it your house i see from my window the big stone one with all the chimneys it is yes a lot of house for one man and all those other buildings a farm needs a barn or two and cabins and such if youll walk over one day ill show you about maybe i will she glanced back toward the house at the first shout shannon doubted it would be the last one maeves come then murphy murmured mrs concannon shes here a sudden thought had her looking back at murphy studying his face and so are you just happening by i wouldnt say that maggie called to tell me things would be brewing the resentment came as quickly as the unexpected protective instinct she should be here herself and not leave this whole mess up to brie shes there thats her you hear shouting in an easy gesture one more sheltering than it seemed he took shannons hand and led her farther from the house maggie and her mother will go at each other like terriers maggie see that she does to keep maeve from striking out too close to brianna why should the woman fight with them shannon demanded they had nothing to do with it murphy said nothing a moment moving off a little ways to examine the blossoms on a blackthorn did your parents love you shannon of course they did and never did you have any cause to doubt it or to take the love aside and examine it for flaws impatient now for the house had grown ominously silent she shook her head no we loved each other i had the same as if time were only there to be spent he drew her down on the grass then leaned back on his elbows you didnt think about being lucky because it just was every cuff or caress my mother ever gave me had love in it one the same as the other idly he picked up shannons hand toyed with her fingers i dont know as id have thought about it overmuch but there was maggie and brie nearby and i could see that they didnt have the same with tom they did murphys eyes lighted with the memory his girls were his greatest joy maeve didnt have that kind of giving in her and im thinking the more he loved them the more she was determined not to to punish them all herself included she sounds like a horrible woman shes an unhappy one he lifted her hand brushing his lips over the knuckles in an absent gesture of long intimacy youve been unhappy shannon but youre strong and smart enough to let the sadness pass into memories i dont know if i am i know he rose then holding out a hand ill go in with you its been quiet long enough so its time she let him pull her to her feet but no further this isnt my affair murphy it seems to me everyone would be better off if i stayed out of it his eyes stayed on hers dark and level and tough stand with your sisters shannon dont disappoint me or yourself damn it his unblinking stare made her feel weak and ashamed of the weakness damn it all right ill go in but i dont need you with me im with you just the same keeping her hand in his he led her toward the house it was foolish to dread it shannon told herself the woman could do or say nothing that would have any affect but her muscles were coiled and her shoulders stiff when she stepped through the kitchen door with murphy behind her her first thought was that the woman seated at the table didnt look like anyones victim her eyes were hot her face set in the unforgiving lines of a judge whod already passed sentence her hands were ringless gripped together on the tabletop in what might have been an attitude of prayer had the knuckles not been white the other woman seated beside her was rounder with a softer look offset by worried eyes shannon saw that the concannon sisters were standing shoulder to shoulder with their husbands on either side in an unyielding and united wall maeve pinned her with one furious look and her lips curled you would bring her here into this house while im in it the house is mine brianna said in a voice that was frigidly calm and shannon is welcome in it as you are mother as i am youd throw her in my face this spawn of your fathers adultery this is how you show your respect your loyalty to me the woman who gave you life and resented every breath of it we took thereafter maggie tossed out id expect it from you maeves wrath turned to roll over her eldest daughter youre no different than she born in sin oh save your bible thumping maggie waved the fury away you didnt love him so youll get no sympathy i took vows with him and vows i kept the words but not the heart of them brianna murmured whats done is done mother maeve lottie reached out a hand the girls not to blame dont speak to me of blame what kind of woman sneaks anothers husband into her bed one who loved i imagine shannon stepped forward unconsciously moving closer to that united wall love makes it all right to sin to defile the church maeve would have stood but her legs felt shaky and something inside her heart was burning id expect no less from the likes of you a yank raised by an adulteress dont speak of my mother shannon warned in a low dangerous voice ever she had more courage more compassion more sheer goodness in her than you can possibly imagine in your narrow little world you curse the fact of my existence all you want but you dont speak of my mother you come all the way from america to give me orders in my house ive come because i was invited to come shannons anger was too blinding for her to realize that murphys hand was on her shoulder grays on her arm and because it was one of the last things my mother wished me to do before she died if it disturbs you it cant be helped maeve rose slowly the girl had the look of him was all she could think what kind of penance was it that she had to look into the girls face and see tom concannons eyes the sins planted in you girl thats your only legacy from tom concannon like the snap of a whip she shot her gaze to murphy and you murphy muldoon standing with her brings shame to your family youre showing yourself as weak natured as any man for youre thinking shell be as free with herself as she was born in sin murphys hand tightened on shannons arm before she could step forward and attack take care mrs concannon his voice was mild but shannon could feel the strength of his temper through his tensed fingers youre saying things youll need to repent when you speak of my family and of shannon in such a way the shame is yours her eyes narrowed so that no one could see the tears swimming behind them so youll all stand against me every one of you were of one mind on this maeve subtly rogan blocked his wife when your minds calmer well talk again theres nothing to talk of she snatched her purse from the table youve chosen you have a choice too gray said quietly holding on to the past or accepting the present no one here wants to hurt you i expect nothing but duty and even that isnt offered by my own flesh and blood ill not come into this house again while shes under its roof she turned and walked stiffly away im sorry lottie gathered her own bag she needs time and talking out with an apologetic look at shannon she hurried after maeve after one long minute of silence gray let out a breath well that was fun despite the lightness of tone his arm had gone around his wife and he was rubbing his hand up and down her arm what do you say shannon ill go out and find a nice pointed stick to jab in your eye id rather have a drink she heard herself say then her gaze focused on brianna dont apologize she said in a shaky voice dont you dare apologize she wont determined to fight back the one that was looming in her own throat maggie gave her sister a nudge toward the table sit down all of you were having whiskey murphy put on the kettle with his hand still on shannons shoulder he started to turn i thought we were having whiskey you are ill have tea it was a good time she decided the perfect time for such news she looked straight at rogan a gleam of unholy amusement in her eyes its not wise to have spirits when youre carrying he blinked once then the grin started and spread youre pregnant so the doctor said just this morning planting her hands on her hips she tilted her head are you just going to stand there gawking like a fool no the laughter burst out as he swept her off her feet and spun her around the kitchen by christ margaret mary i love you pour the whiskey gray weve something to celebrate im pouring it but he stopped long enough to give maggie a kiss she did that for you murphy murmured as shannon stood beside him watching the lightning shift of mood what she told him here told all of us here he measured out tea as he spoke that was for her sisters to ease the heaviness around their hearts for brianna shannon began but murphy cut her off with a look dont close yourself off from a gift when its offered darling her telling made you smile just as she wanted it to shannon stuffed her hands in her pockets you have a way of making me feel very small he tipped her chin up with a gentle finger maybe i have a way of helping you look one level deeper i think i enjoyed being shallow but she turned away from him and walked to maggie congratulations she took the glass gray offered and stood awkwardly i dont know any irish toasts try slainte o dhia duit maggie suggested shannon opened her mouth closed it on a laugh i dont think so just slaintes enough murphy said as he brought the teapot to the table shes just tormenting you slainte then shannon lifted her glass then remembered something from her childhood oh and may you have a dozen children maggie just like you a toast and a curse gray snickered well done pal aye maggies lips curved shes done well enough chapter nine the hours murphy spent with his horses was his purest pleasure working the land was something he had always done always would do there was joy in it and frustration and disappointment and pride he enjoyed the soil in his hands under his feet and the scent of growing things weather was equal parts his friend and his enemy he knew the moods of the sky often better than he knew his own his life had been spent plowing the earth planting it reaping it it was something he had always known yet it was not all he knew the fine spring that the west was enjoying meant his work was hard and long but without the bitter sorrow of root crops that rotted in soaked earth or grains that suffered from the bite of frost or the plague of pests he planted wisely combining the ways of his father and grandfather with the newer and oftenexperimental means he read of in books whether he rode his tractor toward the brown field with its rows of dark green potato plants or walked into the shadowy dairy barn at dawn to start the milking he knew his work was valuable but his horses were for him he clucked to a yearling watching as the widechested bay gave a lazy swish of tail they knew each other these two and the game of long standing murphy waited patiently enjoying the routine a glossy mare stood farther out in the field cropping grass patiently while her colt nursed others including the mare who was mother to the yearling and murphys prize the chestnut filly perked up their ears and watched the man murphy patted his pocket and with equine pride the yearling tossed his head and approached youre a fine one arent you good lad he chuckled stroking the yearlings flank as the horse nuzzled at the pocket and the others walked his way not above bribery here then he took a chunk of the apples hed quartered and let the colt eat out of his hand im thinking youre going on a fine adventure today ill miss you he stroked automatically checking the colts knees damned if i wont but lazing in pasture all day isnt what you were born for and all of us have to do what we were meant to do he greeted the other horses sharing the bits of apple then with his arm slung around the yearlings neck he gazed over the land harebells and bluebells were springing up wild and the madwort was beginning to bloom yellow beside the near wall he could see his silo and the barn the cabins the house beyond looking like a picture against a sky of layered clouds past noon he judged and considered going in for a cup of tea before his business appointment then he looked west just beyond the stone dance away by the wall that separated grazing from grain and there she was his heart stumbled in his chest he wondered if it would always be so when he saw her it was a stunning thing for a man who had gone more than thirty years without feeling more than a passing interest in a woman to see one once and know without doubt that she was his fate the wanting was there a churning deep that made him long to touch and taste and take he thought he could with a careful and patient approach for she wasnt indifferent to him hed felt her pulse leap and seen the change that was desire slip into her eyes but the love was there deeper yet than the wanting and stranger he thought now as it seemed to have been there always waiting so it would not be enough to touch to taste to take that would only be a beginning but you have to begin to go on dont you murphy gave the yearling a last caress then walked over the pasture shannon saw him coming indeed shed been distracted from her work when hed come among the horses it had been like a play she thought the man and the young horse both exceptional specimens passing a few moments together in a green field shed known too the exact moment when hed seen her the distance hadnt kept her from feeling the power of the look what does he want from me she asked herself as she went back to the canvas shed started what do i want from him hello murphy she continued to paint as he came to the wall that separated them brianna said you wouldnt mind if i worked here for a while youre welcome for as long as you like is it the dance youre painting yes and yes you can take a look she changed brushes clamping one between her teeth as he swung over the wall she was catching the mystery of it murphy decided as he studied the canvas that was set on an easel the entire circle was sketched in with a skill he admired and envied though both back and foregrounds were blank still shed begun to add color and texture to the stones its grand shannon though it pleased her she shook her head it has a long way to go before its close to being grand and ive nearly lost the right light today though she knew somehow she could paint the standing stones in any light from any angle i thought i saw you earlier on your tractor likely he liked the way she smelled when she workedpaint and perfume have you been at it long not long enough frowning she swirled her brush in paint shed smeared on her palette i should have set up at dawn to get the right shadows therell be another dawn tomorrow he sat on the wall tapping a finger against her sketchbook that shirt youre wearing what does cm stand for she set down her brush took a step back to examine the canvas and smeared more paint from her fingers to the sweatshirt carnegie mellon its the college i went to you studied painting there umm the stones werent coming to life yet she thought she wanted them alive i concentrated on commercial art is that doing pictures for advertisements more or less he considered picking up her sketchbook and leafing through why would you want to draw up pictures of shoes or bottles of beer when you can do this she picked up a rag dampened it from her jar of turpentine i like making a living and i make a good one for some reason she found it imperative to remove a smudge of gray paint from the side of her hand i just copped a major account before i took my leave of absence im likely to get a promotion thats fine isnt it he flipped another page smiled over a sketch of brianna working in her garden what sort of account is it bottled water she muttered it because it seemed so foolish a thing out here in the wide fields and fragrant air water he did exactly what shed expected he grinned at her the fizzy kind why do you suppose people want to drink water that bubbles or comes in bottles because its pure not everyone has a well in their backyard or a spring or whatever the hell it is designer waters an enormous industry and with pollution and urban development its only going to get bigger he continued to smile i didnt ask to rile you i was just wondering he turned the sketchbook toward her i like this one she set her rag aside and shrugged it was a drawing of him in the pub holding his concertina a halffinished beer on the table you should i certainly flattered you it was kind of you he set the book aside ive someone coming by shortly to look at the yearling so i cant ask you in for tea will you come tonight for dinner instead to dinner when he rose she took an automatic step in retreat you could come early half six so i could show you about first a new light came into his eyes one of dangerous amusement as he caught her hand why are you walking backward im not or she wasnt now that he had hold of her im thinking brianna might have plans bries a flexible woman a light tug on the hand brought shannon a step closer come spend the evening with me youre not afraid of the two of us being alone of course not that would be ridiculous i dont know if you can cook come find out dinner she reminded herself it was just dinner in any case she was curious about him how he lived all right ill come by good with one hand still holding hers he cupped the back of her head inched her closer her nerves were already sizzling when she remembered to lift a protesting hand to his chest murphy im only going to kiss you he murmured there was no only about it his eyes stayed open aware alive on hers as his mouth lowered they were the last thing she saw that vivid stunning blue before she went deaf dumb and blind it was barely a whisper of a touch at first a light brush of mouth to mouth he was holding her as if they might slide into a dance at any instant she thought she might sway so soft and sweet was that first meeting of lips then they left hers surprising a sigh out of her as he took his mouth on a slow luxurious journey of her face the quiet explorationher cheeks her temples her eyelidsweakened her knees the trembling started there and moved up so that she was breathless when his mouth covered hers a second time deeper now slowly her lips parted and the welcome sounded in her throat her hand slid up to his shoulder gripped then went limp she could smell horses and grass and something like lightning in the air hed come back was all she could think before her head went swimming into dreams she was everything hed wanted to hold her like this to feel her tremble with the same need that shook inside him was beyond glorious her mouth seemed to have been fashioned to meld with his and the tastes he found there were dark mysterious and ripe it was enough somehow it was enough to hold back to suffer the gnawing teeth of a less patient need he could see how it would be feel how it would be to lie down in the warm grass with her to pin her beneath him body to body and flesh to flesh how she would move under and against him willing and eager and fluid and at last at long last to bury himself inside her but this time her mouth was enough he let himself linger and savor and possess drawing away gently and with the promise of more his hands wanted to shake to soothe them he skimmed them over her face and into her hair her cheeks were flushed making her to his eye even lovelier how could he have forgotten how slim she was like a willow or how much truth and beauty could shine from her eyes his hand paused in her hair and his brows drew together as image shifted over image your hair was longer then and your cheeks were wet from rain her head was spinning actually spinning she had always believed that was a ridiculous romantic cliche but she had to put a hand to her temple to steady herself what another time we met here he smiled again it was easy for him to accept such things as visions and magic just as he could accept that his heart had been lost long before that first lovely taste of her ive wanted to kiss you for a long time we havent known each other a long time we have shall i do it again and remind you i dont think so no matter how foolish it made her feel she held up a hand to stop him that was a little more potent that id expected and i think wed both be better off pacing ourselves as long as were after getting to the same place she let her hand drop if she could be sure of anything it was that he wouldnt press or make awkward or unwanted moves still she took only an instant to study him and less to look inside herself i dont know that we are its enough that one of us knows ive an appointment to keep he brushed his fingers down her cheek so that he could take that last touch with him ill look for you tonight he caught the expression on her face before he swung over the wall youre not so faint of heart youll make excuses not to come just because you liked kissing me it wasnt worth the effort to be annoyed that hed seen she was about to do so instead she turned away to pack up her equipment im not faint of heart and ive liked kissing men before sure and you have shannon bodine but youve never kissed the likes of me he went off whistling she made sure he was out of earshot before she let the laughter loose it shouldnt have felt odd to go on a datenot when a woman had recently turned twentyeight and had experienced her share of firsts and lasts in the game of singles maybe it had been the way brianna had fussedbustling around like a nervous mother on prom night shannon could only smile to think on it brianna had offered to press a dress or lend her one and had twice come up to the loft room with suggestions on accessories and shoes shannon supposed shed been a great disappointment to brianna when shed appeared downstairs in casual slacks and a plain silk shirt that hadnt stopped brianna from telling her she looked lovely to have a wonderful time and not to worry about when she got in if gray hadnt come along and dragged his wife out of the hall she might never have gotten away it was shannon supposed sisterlike behavior and didnt make her as uncomfortable as shed expected she was grateful both brianna and gray had insisted she take the car it wasnt a long trip to murphys but the road would be dark after sunset and it looked like rain only minutes after pulling out of the driveway she was pulling in to a longer one that squeezed between hedges of fuchsia that had already begun to bloom in bloodred hearts shed seen the farmhouse from her window but it was larger and undoubtedly more impressive up close three stories of stone and wood that looked as old as the land itself and equally well tended rose up behind the hedge and before a tidy plot of mixed flowers there were flat arches of dressed stone above the tidy square windows of the first floor she caught a glimpse of a side porch and imagined there were doors leading to it from the inside two of the chimneys were smoking puffing their clouds lazily into the still blue sky a pickup truck was in the drive ahead of her splashed with mud beside that was an aged compact raised onto blocks she couldnt claim to know much about cars but it certainly had seen better days but the shutters and the front porch of the house were freshly painted in a mellow blue that blended softly with the gray stone there was no clutter on the porch only a pair of rockers that seemed to invite company the invitation was completed by the door that was already open still she knocked on the jamb and called out murphy come in and welcome his voice seemed to come from up the stairs that shot off from the main hallway ill be a minute im washing up she stepped inside and closed the door behind her to satisfy her curiosity she walked a little farther down the hall and peeked into the first room where again a batten door was open in welcome a parlor of course she noted every bit as tidy as briannas if lacking some of her feminine touches old sturdy furniture was set on a wide planked floor that gleamed a turf fire simmered in a stone hearth bringing its ancient and appealing scent into the room there were candlesticks flanking the thick wood mantel bold sinuous twists of emerald certain they were maggies work she went in for a closer look they looked too fluid too molten to be solid yet the glass was cool against her fingers there was a subtle fascinating hint of ruby beneath as though there were heat trapped inside waiting to flame out youd think you could poke your fingers straight into the heart of it murphy commented from the doorway shannon nodded tracing the coils again before she turned shes brilliant though id prefer you not tell her i said so her brow lifted when she studied him he didnt look so very different from the man who walked his fields or played his music in pubs he was without his cap and his hair was thick curled and a bit damp from his washing his sweater was a soft gray his slacks shades darker she found it odd that she could picture him as easily on the cover of gq as on agricultural monthly you wash up well he grinned selfconsciously you look at things people more as an artist does once youre used to them i didnt mean to keep you its no problem i like seeing where you live her gaze glanced off him and focused on a wall of books thats quite a library oh thats just some of them he stayed where he was when she crossed over joyce yeats shaw those were to be expected oneill swift and grayson thane of course but there was a treasure trove of others poe steinbeck dickens byron the poetry of keats and dickinson and browning battered volumes of shakespeare and equally wellthumbed tales by king and macaffrey and mcmurtrey an eclectic collection she mused and theres more i keep them here and there around the house so if youre in the mood you dont have to go far a books a pleasant thing to have nearby my father wasnt much on reading unless it had to do with business but my mother and i loveloved to in the end she was so ill i read to her you were a comfort to her and a joy i dont know she shook herself and tried a bright smile so am i getting a tour a child knows when shes loved murphy said quietly then took her hand and yes youll have a tour well go outside first before it rains but she made him stop a half a dozen times before theyd traveled from the front of the house to the back he explained the raftered ceiling and the little room off the right where his mother still liked to sew when she came to visit the kitchen was as big as a barn and as scrupulously clean as any shed ever seen still it surprised her to see colored jars of herbs and spices ranged on the counter and the gleam of copperbottomed pots hanging over it whatever youve got in the oven smells wonderful tis chicken and needs some time yet here try these he brought a pair of wellingtons out of an adjoining room and had shannon frowning were not going to go tromping around in more than likely he crouched down to slip the first boot over her shoe when youve got animals youve got dung youll be happier in these i thought you kept the cows out in the field delighted he grinned up at her you dont go milking them in the fields darling but in the milking parlor thats done for the night he led her out the back where he stepped easily into his own wellies i kept you waiting as one of the cows took sick oh is it serious no im thinking its not just needed some medicating do you do that yourself dont you have a vet not for everyday matters she looked around and found herself smiling again another painting she thought stone buildings neatly set among paddocks woolly sheep crowded together near a trough some huge and wickedly toothed machine under a leanto and the bleat and squawk of animals not ready to call it a day there was con sitting patiently beside the near paddock thumping his tail brie sent him id wager to see i behaved myself with you i dont know he seems as much your dog as hers she looked over at him as murphy bent to greet the dog id have thought a farmer would have at least one or two hounds of his own i had one died seven years ago this winter coming with the ease of mutual love murphy stroked cons ears i think of getting another from time to time but never seem to get around to it youve got everything else i didnt realize you raised sheep just a few my father now he was one for sheep he straightened then took her hand as he walked im more a dairy man myself brianna says you prefer horses the horses are a pleasure in another year or two they may pay their way today i sold a yearling a beautiful colt the entertainment of horse trading nearly balances out the losing of him she glanced up as murphy opened the barn door i didnt think farmers were supposed to get attached a horse isnt a sheep that you butcher for sunday dinner the image of that made her just queasy enough to let the subject stand you milk in here aye he led the way through a scrubbed milk parlor with glistening stainless machines and the faint scent of cow and milk drifting through the air tisnt as romantic as doing it by handand i did that as a boybut its faster cleaner and more efficient every day shannon murmured twice daily its a lot of work for one man the lad at the farm next helps with that we have an arrangement as he showed her through the parlor the barn outside again to the silo and the other sheds she didnt think one boy would make much difference in the expanse of labor but it was easy to forget all the sweat the muscle that had to go into every hour of the day when he took her into the stables to show his horses oh theyre even more beautiful close up too enchanted to be wary she lifted her hand and stroked the cheek of the chestnut filly thats my jenny ive had her only two years and she ill never sell theres a lass it took only the sound of his voice to have the horse shifting her attention to murphy if shannon had believed such things possible shed have sworn the filly flirted with him and why not she mused what female would resist those wide skilled hands the way they stroked caressed or that soft voice murmuring foolish endearments do you ride shannon hmm the lump that had abruptly lodged in her throat caused her to swallow hard no i never have in fact i guess this is as close as ive ever been to a horse but youre not afraid of them so itll be easier for you to learn if youve a mind to he took her through letting her coo her fill and pet and play with the foals newly born that spring and watched her laugh at the frisky colt who would have nibbled on her shoulder if murphy hadnt blocked the muzzle with his hand it would be a wonderful way to grow up she commented as they walked back to the house all this room all the animals she laughed as she stopped at the rear door to toe off her boots and the work of course but you must have loved it since you stayed i belong to it come in and sit ive some wine youll like companionably she washed her hands at the kitchen sink with him didnt any of your family want to stay and work the farm im the oldest son and when me father died it fell to me my older sisters married and moved away to start families of their own he took a bottle from the refrigerator a corkscrew from a drawer then my mother remarried and my younger sister kate as well i have a younger brother but he wanted to go to school and learn about electrical matters her eyes had widened as he poured the wine how many are there of you five there were six but my mother lost another son when he was still nursing my father died when i was twelve and she didnt marry again until i was past twenty so there were only five only she chuckled shook her head and would have raised her glass but he stayed her hand may you have warm words on a cold evening a full moon on a dark night and the road downhill all the way to your door sliante she said and smiled at him as she drank i like your farm murphy im pleased you do shannon he surprised her by leaning down and pressing his lips to her brow rain began to patter softly as he straightened again and turned to open the oven door the scents that streamed out had her mouth watering why is it i always thought irish cooking was an oxymoron he hefted out the roaster set it on the stove top well its the truth that its more often a bit bland than not i never noticed myself as a lad but when brie started experimenting and trying out dishes on me i began to see that my own dear mother had a certain lack in the kitchen he glanced over his shoulder which i would deny unto death if you repeated such slander shell never hear it from me she rose too intrigued not to take a closer look the chicken was golden beaded with moisture flecked with spices and surrounded by a browned circle of potatoes and carrots now thats wonderful its bries doing she started me an herb garden years back hounded me till i took the time to tend it shannon leaned back on the counter eyeing him werent you a little miffed when gray came along and beat your time he was well and truly baffled for a minute then grinned as he transferred chicken from pan to platter she was never for me nor i for her weve been family too long tom was a father to me when mine died and brie and maggie were always my sisters he carved off a small slice at the breast not that its a brotherly feeling i have toward you shannon ive waited for you long enough alarmed she shifted but hed moved smoothly to box her in back to the counter still all he did was lift the bite of chicken to her lips and his thumb grazed lightly seductively over her bottom lip when she accepted his offer its good really but her chest felt thick and alarm increased when he skimmed a hand over her hair she made her tingling spine straighten until they were eye to eye what are you doing murphy well shannon he touched his lips to hers lightly almost breezily im courting you chapter ten courting flabbergasted shannon gaped at him it was ridiculous a foolish word that had nothing to do with her or her lifestyle yet it had certainly tripped off his irish tongue easily she had to make him swallow it again and fast thats crazy its absurd his hands were on her face again fingertips just skimming her jawline why well because in defense she moved back gestured with her glass in the first place you hardly know me but i do know you more amused than offended at her reaction he turned back to carve the chicken i knew you the minute i saw you dont start that celtic mysticism with me murphy she strode back to the table topped off her wine and gulped it im an american damn it people dont go around courting people in new york that might be part of whats wrong with it he carried the platter to the table sit down shannon youll want to eat while its hot eat she rolled her eyes before closing them in frustration now im supposed to eat you came to eat didnt you taking on the duties of host he filled the plate by her chair then his own before lighting candles arent you hungry yes im hungry she plopped down in her chair after flicking her napkin onto her lap she picked up her knife and fork for the next few minutes she did eat while her options circled around in her head im going to try to be reasonable with you murphy all right he sliced into the chicken on his plate sampled and was pleased hed done a good job be reasonable then number one youve got to understand im only going to be here another week two at the most youll stay longer he said it placidly as he ate you havent begun to resolve the problems and feelings that brought you here you havent once asked about tom concannon her eyes went cold you know nothing about my feelings i think i do but well leave that for now since it makes you unhappy but youll stay shannon because there are things for you to face and to forgive youre not a coward theres strength in you and heart she hated that he was seeing in her things shed refused to admit to herself she broke open one of the biscuits hed brought to the table watched the heat steam out whether i stay a week or a year it doesnt apply to this it all applies to this he said mildly does the meal suit you its terrific did you paint more today after i left you yes i she swallowed another bite jabbed her fork at him youre changing the subject what subject you know very well what subject and were going to clear the air here and now i dont want to be courted by anyone i dont know how things are around here but where i come from women are independent equal ive some thoughts on that myself idly he picked up his wine considering his words as he drank its true enough that in general your irishman has a difficult time with seeing women as equals now theres been some changes in the past generation but its a slow process he set his wine aside and went back to his meal there are many id call mate who wouldnt agree with me in full but it may be because ive done a lot of reading over the years and thought about what ive read i feel a woman has rights same as a man to what he has what he does thats big of you shannon muttered he only smiled its a step of some proportion for someone raised as i was raised now in truth i dont know just how id react to it if you wanted to court me i dont there you are he lifted a hand smiling still as if shed made his point for him and my courting you has nothing to do with rights or equality doesnt make you less or me more its just that ive the initiative so to speak youre the most beautiful thing ive seen in my life and ive been fortunate enough to see a great deal of beauty flummoxed by the quick spurt of pleasure she looked down at her plate there was a way to handle this to handle him she was certain she just had to find it murphy im flattered anyone would be youre more than flattered when i kiss you shannon we both know what happens then she jabbed a piece of chicken all right im attracted youre an attractive man with some charm but if id been considering taking it any further i wouldnt now wouldnt you christ but she was a pleasure to converse with he thought and why would that be when you want me as much as i want you she had to rub her dampening palms on her napkin because its an obvious mistake were looking at this from two different angles and theyre never going to come together i like you youre an interesting man but im simply not looking for a relationship damn it i ended one only weeks ago i was practically engaged inspiration struck she leaned forward her smile smug i was sleeping with him murphys brows quirked was seems to be the key you must have cared for him of course i cared for him i dont jump into bed with strangers hearing herself she hissed out a breath how had he managed to turn that around on her its past tense as i see it ive cared enough about a woman or two to lie with her but i never loved one before you panic had the color draining out of her face youre not in love with me i loved you from the moment i set eyes on you he said it so quietly so simply that she believedfor a moment completely believed before that somehow ive waited for you shannon and here you are this isnt happening she said shakily and pushed away from the table now you listen to me you put this whole insane business out of your mind its not going to work youre romanticizing the situation hallucinating all youre going to accomplish is to embarrass both of us his eyes narrowed but she was too busy fuming to notice the change or the danger in it my loving you is an embarrassment to you dont twist my words around she said furiously and dont try to make me seem small and shallow because im not interested in being courted jesus courted even the words ridiculous theres another youd prefer no theres not another id prefer what i prefer and expect is for you to drop it he sat quietly a moment dealing with a slowly building anger because you have no feelings for me thats right and because it was a lie her voice sharpened do you really have some deluded idea that id just fall in meekly with whatever absurd plans youre cooking up marry you live here a farmers wife for gods sake do i look like a farmers wife ive got a career a life he moved so quickly she only had time to suck in one shocked breath his hands were on her arms fingers dug in his face was a study of the pale and dark of fury and my lifes beneath you he demanded what i have what ive worked for even what i am is something less something to be scorned her heart was beating like a rabbits in quick bumpy jerks she could only shake her head who could have guessed he had such temper in him ill accept that you dont know you love me wont clear your eyes to see that were meant but i wont have you disparage what i am and spurn everything i and my family for generations has struggled for thats not what i meant you think the land just sits pretty as a picture and waits to be reaped the candlelight threw shadows over his face making it as fascinating as it was dangerous theres blood spilled for it and more sweat than can be weighed keeping its hard and keeping its not enough if youre too proud to accept it as yours then you shame yourself her breath was shuddering out she had to force herself to draw it in slowly youre hurting me murphy he dropped his hands as if her flesh had burned them he stepped back his movements jerky for the first time since shed known him i beg your pardon it was his turn for shame he knew his hands were large and knew their strength it appalled him that he would have used them even in blind fury to put a mark on her the selfdisgust on his face kept her from giving in to the urge to rub at the soreness on her arms however huge her lack of understanding of him she knew instinctively he was a gentle man who would consider hurting a woman the lowest form of sin i didnt mean to offend you she said slowly i was angry and upset and trying to make the point that were different who we are what we want he slipped his hands into his pockets what do you want she opened her mouth then shut it on the shock of finding the answer wasnt there ive had a number of major changes in my life over the past couple of months so i still need to think about that but a relationship isnt one of them are you afraid of me his voice was carefully neutral i didnt mean to hurt you no im not afraid of you she couldnt help herself she stepped forward laid a hand on his cheek temper understands temper murphy almost certain the crisis had passed she smiled lets forget all of this and be friends instead he stopped her heart by taking her hand sliding it around until his lips pressed tenderly into the palm my bounty is as boundless as the sea my love as deep the more i give to thee the more i have for both are infinite shakespeare she thought as her body softened he would quote shakespeare in that gorgeous voice dont say things like that to me murphy its not playing fair were past games shannon were neither of us children or fools here now i wont hurt you his voice was soothing as it was when he gentled a horse for shed gone skittish when hed slipped his arms around her tell me what you felt when i kissed you the first time it wasnt a difficult question to answer as she was feeling it again tempted he smiled pressed his curved lips to her temple thats not all of it there was more wasnt there a kind of remembering her body was refusing her very sensible order to stay rigid and aloof i dont believe in those things i didnt ask what you believed his lips cruised from temple to jaw patient but what you felt through the thin barrier of silk her skin was wanning he thought he might go mad holding himself from stripping that barrier away and finding all of her it wasnt just now he indulged himself a few miserly degrees sliding into the kiss savoring the way her mouth yielded for his it was again thats nonsense but her own voice seemed to come from a long way off and this is crazy even as she spoke her hands were fisting in his hair to hold him close closer until the pleasure bounded past reason we cant do this the purr of delight sounded in her throat rippled wonderfully into his mouth its just chemistry god bless science nearly as breathless as she he dragged her to her toes and tortured himself only for a moment he vowed and plundered explosions burst inside of her one after another until her system was battered by color and light on a wild spurt of greed she all but clawed at him in a fight for more touch me damn you the order erupted in her head but his hands did no more than hold while her body ached to be possessed she knew how his hand would feel she knew and could have wept from the power of the knowledge hard palm gentle strokes that would build and build into brands with a feral instinct she hadnt known lurked inside her she dug her teeth into his lip baiting him daring him at his violent oath she flung her head back her face glowing with triumph then she paled degree by degree for his eyes were warriors eyes dark deadly and terrifyingly familiar god the word burst out of her as she struggled away fighting for air for balance she pressed her hands to her breast stop god this has to stop teetering on the thin edge of control murphy fisted his hands at his sides i want you more than i want to take the next breath its killing me shannon this wanting i made a mistake she dragged her trembling hands through her hair i made a mistake here im sorry im not going to let this go any further she could feel herself being pulled toward himnegative to positive power to power stay away from me murphy i cant you know i cant we have a problem determined to calm down she walked unsteadily to the table and picked up her wineglass we can solve it she said to herself and sipped theres always a way to solve a problem dont talk to me she ordered holding up a hand like a traffic cop let me think the oddest thing was she never considered herself a very sexual creature there had been a few pleasant moments now and again with men she cared for had respect for pleasant was a ridiculously pale description of what had erupted in her with murphy that was sex she thought nodding that was allowed that was all right they were both adults both unencumbered she certainly cared for him and respected him even admired him on a great many levels what was wrong with one wild fling before she settled down and decided what to do with the rest of her life nothing she decided except that foolish courting business so she sipped her wine again set it down theyd just have to get rid of the obstacle we want to sleep together she began well id find sleeping with you a pleasant thing but id prefer making love with you a few dozen times first dont play semantic games murphy but she smiled relieved that the humor was back in his eyes i think we can resolve this in a reasonable and mutually satisfying manner youve a wonderful way of speaking sometimes his voice was full of admiration and delight even when what you say is senseless its so dignified you know and classy shut up murphy now if youll just agree that the idea of a longterm commitment isnt feasible when he only continued to smile at her she huffed out a breath okay ill put it simply no courting i knew what you meant darling i just like listening to you ive no problem with the feasibility of living the rest of my life with you and ive hardly begun courting you i havent even danced with you yet at her wits end she rubbed her hands over her face are you really that thickheaded so my mother always said murphy shed say once you get an idea in that brain of yours nothing knocks it loose he grinned at her youll like my mother im never going to meet your mother oh you will im working that out but as you were saying as i was saying she repeated baffled how can i remember what i was saying when you keep throwing these curves you do it on purpose just to cloud things up when they should be perfectly simple i love you shannon he said and stopped her dead thats simple i want to marry you and raise a family with you but thats getting ahead of things ill say im going to be as clear and concise about this as i can i dont love you murphy and i dont want to marry you her eyes went to slits and if you keep grinning at me im going to belt you you can take a swing at me and we can wrestle a bit but then were likely to resolve the first part of this right here on the kitchen floor he stepped closer delighted when she jerked up her chin because darling once i get me hands on you again i cant promise to take them off till im finished im through trying to be reasonable thanks for dinner it was interesting youll want a jacket against the rain i dont dont be foolish hed already taken one of his own off a peg youll just get that pretty blouse wet and chill your skin she snatched it from him before he could help her into it fine ill get it back to you bring it with you if you think of it when you come to paint in the morning ill be walking by i may not be there she shoved her arms into the soft worn denim stood with the sleeve flopping past her fingertips good night ill walk you to the car even as she started to object he took her arm and led her out of the kitchen and down the hall youll just get wet she protested when they reached the front door i dont mind the rain when they reached the car he wisely swallowed a grin its the wrong side darling unless youre wanting me to drive you home she merely scowled and shifted direction so that she veered toward the rightside drive measuring her mood he opted to kiss her hand rather than her mouth when hed opened the car door for her dream within a dream he murmured poe had some lovely lines on that youll dream of me tonight shannon and i of you no i wont she said it firmly as she slammed the door after shoving up the sleeves of his jacket she backed out of the drive and headed up the rainwashed road the man had to have a screw loose somewhere she decided it was the only explanation her only choice was to give him absolutely no encouragement from this point on no more cozy dinners in the kitchen no music and laughter in the pub no easy conversations or staggering kisses in the fields damn it shed miss it all of it she pulled up in briannas drive and set the brake hed gone and stirred up feelings and desires she hadnt known she was capable of then left her with no other option but to squelch them pinheaded idiot she thought slamming her door before racing toward the house shannon fought off a scowl as she opened the door and found brianna beaming smiles down the hallway oh good he lent you a jacket i didnt think of it till after youd left did you have a nice time then shannon opened her mouth surprised when the usual platitudes simply werent there the man is insane brianna blinked murphy who else im telling you hes got something corked around in his head theres no reasoning with him in a move so natural neither of them noticed brianna took shannons hand and began to lead her back toward the kitchen did you have a quarrel a quarrel no i wouldnt say that you cant quarrel with insanity hey shannon when the kitchen door opened gray glanced up pausing with a huge spoon of trifle half way to a bowl how was dinner got any room for trifle brie makes the worlds best shes had a todo with murphy brianna informed him urging shannon into a chair before going for the teapot no kidding intrigued gray dumped the trifle then went for another bowl what about oh nothing much he just wants me to marry him and have his children brianna bobbled the teacup barely saving it from shattering on the floor youre joking she said and nearly managed a laugh its a joke all right but im not making it absently she dug into the bowl gray set in front of her he claims to be courting me she snorted took a swallow of trifle can you beat that she demanded of gray ah he ran his tongue around his teeth nope very slowly her eyes wide brianna took her seat he said he was wanting to court you he said he was shannon corrected and spooned up more trifle he has this wild idea of love at first sight and that were meant or some ridiculous thing all this about remembering and recognition bull she muttered and poured out the tea herself murphys never courted anyone never wanted to with her eyes narrowed shannon turned to brianna i wish everyone would stop using that antiquated word it makes me nervous the word gray put in or the deed both she propped her chin on her fist as if things werent complicated enough are you indifferent to him brianna asked not indifferent shannon frowned exactly the plot thickens gray only grinned at the heated look shannon shot at him youd better understand the irish are a stubborn race im not sure if the irish of the west arent the most stubborn if murphys got his eye on you its going to stay there dont make light of it gray in automatic sympathy brianna laid her hand over shannons shes upset and there are hearts involved no there are not about that at least shannon could be firm considering going to bed with a man and spending the rest of your life with him are two entirely different things and as for him hes just a romantic with her brows knit she concentrated on scraping the last of the trifle from her bowl its nonsense the idea that a couple of odd dreams have anything to do with destiny murphys had odd dreams distracted again shannon glanced at brianna i dont know i didnt ask you have gray couldnt have been more delighted he leaned forward tell meespecially the sexy parts stop it grayson but shannon found herself laughing odd she thought that here should be the big brother shed always wished for its all sexy she told him and licked her lips yeah he leaned closer start at the beginning dont leave anything out no detail is too small dont pay him any mind shannon its all right more than full she pushed the empty bowl aside you both might find it interesting ive never had a recurring dream before actually its more like vignettes in random order or what seems to be now youre really driving me crazy gray complained spill it okay it starts off in the field where the stone circle is funny its like i dreamed it was there before i saw it but thats not possible anywayshe waved that awayits raining cold theres frost it sounds like glass grinding when i walk on it not me she corrected with a half laugh the woman in the dream then theres a man dark hair dark cloak white horse you can see the steam rising off them and the mud thats splashed on his boots and his armor he rides toward me herfull out and she stands there with her hair blowing and she broke off shed caught the quick startled look in briannas eyes and the silent exchange between her and gray what is it she demanded sounds like the witch and the warrior grays eyes had darkened focused intently on shannons face what happens next shannon put her hands under the table and linked them together you tell me all right gray glanced at brianna who gestured for him to tell the tale legend has it that there was a wise woman a witch who lived on the land here she had the sight and burdened with it as much as blessed lived apart from the rest one morning when she went to the dance to commune with her gods she found the warrior in the circle wounded his horse beside him she had the gift of healing and treated his wounds nursing him until he was strong again they fell in love became lovers he paused to add tea to the cups picked up his own he left her of course for there were wars to be fought and battles hed pledged to win he vowed to come back and she gave him a broach to pin to his cloak and remember her by and did he shannon cleared her throat come back its said he did riding to her across the field in a storm that shook the sky he wanted to take her to wife but he wouldnt give up his sword and shield they fought over it bitterly it seemed no matter how much they loved there was no compromise in either next time he left he gave her the broach to remember him until he returned but he never came back again its said he died in another field and with her gift of sight she knew it the moment it happened its just a story because they were suddenly chilled shannon wrapped her hands around her cup i dont believe in that kind of thing you cant tell me you do gray moved his shoulders yes i can i can believe those two people existed and that there was something strong between them that lingers what im curious about is why youd dream of them i had a couple of dreams about a man on a horse shannon said impatiently which im sure any number of psychiatrists would have a field day with one has nothing to do with the other im tired she added rising im going to bed take your tea brianna said kindly thanks when shannon left brianna laid a hand on grays shoulder dont poke at her too much grayson shes so troubled shed feel better if she stopped holding so much inside with a half laugh he turned his head to press his lips to briannas hand i ought to know she needs time as you did she sighed long and deep murphy who would have thought it chapter eleven it wasnt as if shannon was avoiding going out to the standing stones shed simply overslept and if shed had dreams she thought as she picked at her late breakfast of coffee and muffins it was hardly a surprise trifle before bed and a legend by a master story spinner equaled a restless night still the clarity of them worried her alone she could admit shed felt the dream not just envisioned it she felt the rough blanket at her back the prickle of grass the heat and weight of the mans body on hers in hers she blew out a long breath pressing a hand to her stomach where the memory of the dream brought an answering tug of longing shed dreamed of making love with the man with murphys faceyet not his face theyd been in the stone circle with the stars swimming overhead and the moon white like a beacon shed heard the hoot of an owl felt warm breath coming quickly against her cheek her hands knew the feel of those muscles bunching and straining and shed known even as her body had erupted in climax that this would be the last time it hurt to think of it hurt so that now awake aware the tears still threatened and burned bitterly behind her eyes she lifted her coffee again she was going to have to snap out of it she warned herself or join the ranks of her associates in the line at the therapists office the commotion at the back door had her composing her face whoever it was shannon was grateful for the diversion but not grateful enough to be pleased when she saw it was maggie im letting you in arent i maggie said to con you neednt push the dog burst through the open door raced under the table then dropped down with a longsuffering sigh im sure youre welcome maggies easy smile chilled several degrees when she spotted shannon alone in the kitchen morning ive brought some berries by for brie she had some errands grays working upstairs ill leave them at home maggie crossed to put the bag in the refrigerator did you enjoy your meal with murphy news certainly travels shannon couldnt keep the annoyance at bay im surprised you dont know what he served with a smile as thin as her own temper maggie turned back oh it would have been chicken he has a hand at roasting not that he makes a habit of cooking for women she took off her cap stuffed it in her pocket but hes taken with you isnt he id say that was his business and mine youd say wrong and ill warn you to mind your step with him im not interested in your warnings or your nasty attitude maggie tilted her head in a gesture that had much more to do with disdain than curiosity just what are you interested in shannon bodine do you find it amusing to dangle yourself in front of a man one you have no intention of doing more than toying with youd come by that naturally enough the red haze of fury was blinding she was on her feet in a snap fists bunched goddamn you you have no right to cast stones at my mother youre right absolutely and if she could have bitten her tongue maggie would have taken the words and the unfairness behind them back i apologize for that why you sounded exactly like your own mother maggie could only wince you couldnt have aimed that shaft better i did sound like her and i was as wrong as she so ill apologize again for that but not for the rest to calm herself or try she turned to heat the kettle but ill ask you and you might be honest since its only us two if you havent thought close to the same of my father as i just said of your mother the accuracy of the question had shannon backing off if i did at least i was too polite to articulate it seems to me politeness and hypocrisy run too often hand in hand pleased by the quick hiss that drew out of shannon maggie reached for the canister of tea so lets have neither between us circumstances mean we share blood a fact that doesnt please either of us overmuch youre not a tender woman from what i can see neither am i but brianna is so youre going to protect her from me too if need be if you hurt one of mine ill hound you for it face set she turned back understand me there its clear to see bries already opened her heart and if murphy hasnt he will and youve already closed yours and your mind havent you maggie strode to the table slapped her palms down havent you come with your heart and mind made up tight you dont care what da suffered its only yourself youre thinking of it doesnt matter to you that he never had a chance to take his happiness never had she trailed off as her vision grayed swearing she leaned against the table fighting for balance even as she swayed shannon was grabbing her shoulders sit down for gods sake im all right sure the woman was pale as death and her eyes had nearly rolled back in her head well go another round but maggie slid bonelessly into the chair making not even a token protest when shannon firmly pushed her head between her knees breathe just breathe or something shit she gave maggies shoulder an awkward pat and wondered what to do next ill get gray well phone the doctor i dont need the doctor fighting the dizziness maggie groped out until she found shannons hand dont bother him its just being pregnant is all it was the same when i was carrying liam the first few weeks shaky and disgusted with herself maggie sat back she knew the routine and kept her eyes closed drew air in slow and steady her eyes fluttered open in surprise when she felt the cool cloth on her head thanks drink some water hoping it was the right move shannon urged the glass shed just filled into maggies hand youre still awfully pale it passes just natures way of reminding you youve a lot worse ahead in nine months cheerful thought shannon sat again keeping her eyes glued to maggies face why are you having another i like challenges and i want more childrenwhich was a big surprise to me as i never knew id want the first its an adventure really a little dizziness getting queasy of a morning growing fat as a prize hog ill take your word for it your colors coming back then you can stop staring at me as though i were going to sprout wings she slid the cloth from her brow set it on the table between them thank you relieved shannon leaned back in her chair dont mention it since you bring it up maggie plucked at the damp cloth id be grateful if you wouldnt mention to brie or anyone that i had a bit of a spell shed fuss you see then rogan would start hovering and you do better at protecting than being protected you could say that thoughtful shannon drummed her fingers on the table theyd crossed some line she thought without either of them realizing it maybe she would take the next deliberate step you want me to keep quiet about it i do yes whats it worth to you taken off guard maggie blinked worth we could call it an exchange of favors brows knit maggie nodded we could what favor are you after i want to see where you work where i work suspicion slipped into her voice and her eyes inside my glass house nothing could have been sweeter shannon decided i hear you really hate when people come into your glass house ask questions poke around thats what i want to do she rose to take her cup to the sink otherwise it might just slip out about you nearly fainting in the kitchen i didnt faint maggie muttered body cant even have a little spell in peace she continued as she pushed back from the table people are supposed to be tolerant of a woman with child come on then obviously displeased she took her cap back out of her pocket and stuffed it on her head i thought id drive just like a yank maggie said in disgust were walking fine shannon grabbed murphys jacket from the peg and followed wheres liam she asked as they headed over the back lawn with his da rogan had the idea i needed a liein this morning and took him off to the gallery for a few hours id like to see it the gallery ive been in worldwide in new york this ones not as posh rogans goal was to make it more a home for art than a display we feature only irish artists and craftsmen its been a year since it opened and hes done what he set out to do but thenhe always does agile she swung over the first wall have you been married long two years soon that was something else he set out to do it made her smile to think of it to remember how shed fought him every step of the way youve no thoughts of marriage a man waiting for you to come back no as if on cue she heard the sound of a tractor then saw murphy riding in the far field im concentrating on my career i know how that is maggie lifted her hand in a wave hell be going back to his bog to cut turf its a fine day for it and he prefers peat to wood or coal peat fires and bogs shannon thought but god didnt he look fine riding over his land with the sun streaming down on him will he do it all alone no therell be help its rare that a man cuts turf by himself not many do it now it takes such time and effort but murphy always makes use of what he has maggie paused a minute to turn a slow circle hell have a fine crop this year after his father died he put everything he is into this place and hes made it shine like his father and mine never could as they walked again she slanted shannon a look this was concannon land once murphy mentioned that hed bought it they went over the next wall they were close to the farmhouse now and shannon could see chickens scratching in the yard was this your house then before yes but not in my memory we grew up at blackthorn if you go back a few generations the muldoons and concannons were related there were brothers you see who inherited all the land here and split it between them one couldnt but plant a seed that it would spring out of the earth and the other seemed to grow nothing but rocks but its said he drank more than he plowed there was jealousy and temper between them and their wives wouldnt speak if they met face to face cozy shannon commented and was too intrigued to remember to put the borrowed jacket on the back stoop and one fine day the second brother the one who preferred beer to fertilizer disappeared vanished in the way of the inheritance the first brother owned all the land now he let his brothers wife and children stay in the cottagewhich would be my house now some said he did so out of guilt for it was suspected that he did away with his brother killed him surprised shannon glanced over whats this cain and abel a bit like i suppose though the murdering brother inherited the garden rather than being banished from it their name was concannon and as time passed one of the daughters of the missing brother married a muldoon they were given a slice of land by her uncle and worked it well and over the years the tide turned now its muldoon land and the concannons have only the edges and you dont resent that why should i its fair justice and even if it werent even if that long ago brother fell into some bog in a drunken stupor its murphy who loves the land as my own da never did here we are this is whats mine its a lovely house and it was she mused studying it a bit more than a cottage she decided though that was certainly the heart of it the pretty stone that was so typical of the area rose up two floors there was an interesting jog in the line of it what she assumed was an addition and the artists touch she thought in the trim that was painted a peacock purple we added to it so that rogan could have office space and thered be a room for liam maggie shook her head as she turned away and of course the man insisted we add another room or two while we were about it already planning a brood though that slipped past me at the time looks like youre accommodating him oh hes blissful at the idea of family is rogan comes from being an only child perhaps and ive discovered i feel much the same ive a knack for motherhood and a pride in it strange how one person can change everything i dont think i realized how much you love him shannon said quietly you seem so individual whats one to do with the other maggie let out a breath and frowned at the stone building that was her solitude her sanctuary her shop well lets do this then but the deal says nothing about you putting your hands all over things the famed irish hospitality bugger it maggie said with a grin and crossed over to open the door the heat was a shock it explained the rumbling roar shannon had begun to hear a full field away the furnace was lit realizing it made her feel guilty for keeping maggie from work im sorry i didnt realize id be holding you up ive nothing pressing the guilt didnt have a chance against fascination benches shelves were stacked with tools scattered sheets of paper works in progress there was a large wooden chair with wide arms slots and dips carved and sanded into the sides buckets filled with water or sand in a corner like lances stacked were long metal poles are those pipes pontils you gather the glass on the end of them do melts in the furnace you use the pipe to blow the bubble maggie lifted one you neck it with the jacks a bubble of glass engrossed shannon studied the twists and columns the bowls and tapers maggie had setting helterskelter on shelves and you make whatever you want with it you make what you feel you have to do a second gather roll and chill it to form what we call a skin you do a lot of the work sitting down in your chair getting up countless times to go back to the furnace you have to keep the pontil or the pipe moving using gravity fighting it maggie tilted her head you want to try it too enthralled to be surprised by the invitation shannon grinned you bet i do something simple maggie muttered as she began to set things up a ball flat on the bottom like a paperweight in moments shannon found her hands encased in heavy gloves with a pontil in her hand following instructions she dipped the tip into the melt turned it dont be so greedy maggie snapped takes time and effort shannon discovered it wasnt work for a weakling sweat trickled down her back and went unnoticed when she saw the bubble begin to form on the end of the pipe i did it no you havent but maggie guided her hands showing her how to make the second gather to roll it over the marble she explained each step neither of them fully aware they were working in tandem and enjoying it oh its wonderful giddy as a child shannon beamed at the glass ball look at those swirls of color in it no use making something ugly youll use this to flatten the base careful now thats good youve got smart hands she shifted the pipe showing shannon how to attach the other end to a pontil now strike it sharp there shannon blinked when the ball detached from the pipe holding now to the pontil back in the furnace first maggie instructed impatient now to heat the lip thats it not too much into the oven it goes to anneal now take that file strike it again when the ball landed on a thick pad of asbestos maggie closed the oven in a businesslike manner and set the timer that was wonderful you did well enough maggie bent down to a small refrigerator and took out two cold drinks youre not hamhanded or stupid thanks shannon said dryly she took a long drink i think the handson lesson overbalanced the bargain maggie smiled then you owe me dont you apparently casually shannon brushed through the sketches littering a workbench these are excellent i saw some of your sketches and paintings in new york im not a painter rogan isnt one to let any bit of business pass by so he takes what he likes from them has them mounted i wont argue that your glasswork is superior to your drawing maggie swallowed the soft drink before she choked wont you no but rogan has an excellent eye and im sure he culls out your best oh to be sure youre the painter arent you im sure it takes tremendous talent to draw advertisements challenged shannon set down her drink you dont really think youre better at it than i am well i havent seen anything of yours have i unless i flipped by in a magazine waiting to have my teeth cleaned shannon set her own and snatched up one of maggies hunks of charcoal it took her longer to find a sketch pad and a clean sheet while maggie leaned her hip idly on the edge of the bench shannon bent over her work she started with fast strokes annoyance pushing her then she began to find the pleasure in it and the desire for beauty why tis liam maggies voice went soft as butter as she saw her son emerge shannon was drawing just the head and shoulders concentrating on that impishness that danced in his eyes and around his mouth the dark hair was mussed the lips quirked on the verge of a laugh he always looks as though hes just been in trouble or looking for it shannon murmured as she shaded he does yes hes a darling my liam youve caught him so shannon alarmed by the catch in maggies voice shannon glanced over youre not going to start crying please hormones maggie sniffled and shook her head now i suppose ill have to say youve a better hand than i at drawing acknowledgment accepted shannon dashed her initials at the corner of the page then carefully tore it off fair trade for a paperweight she said handing it to maggie no its not the balance has tipped again i owe you another boon shannon picked up a rag to wipe the charcoal dust from her hands she stared at her own fingers tell me about thomas concannon she didnt know where the need had come from and was no less surprised than maggie that she had asked the question hummed for several long seconds come inside maggies tone was suddenly gentle as was the hand she set on shannons arm well have tea and talk of it it was there brianna found them when she walked into maggies kitchen with kayla and a basket of soda bread oh shannon i didnt know you were here and she would never have pictured her there sitting at maggies table while maggie brewed tea i i brought you some bread maggie thanks why dont we slice some up im starving i wasnt going to stay i think you should maggie glanced over her shoulder met briannas eyes kaylas gone to sleep in her carrier brie why dont you put her down for a nap here all right all too aware of the tension in the room brianna set the bread down and took the baby out with her shes worried well start spitting at each other maggie commented bries not one for fighting shes very gentle she is yes unless you push the wrong spot then shes fierce always seems fiercer because its never quite expected it was she who found the letters your mother wrote hed kept them in the attic you see in a box where he liked to put things important to him we didnt go through it or some of his other things for a long time after hed died she brought the pot over sat it was difficult for us and my mother was living with brie in the house until a couple years ago to keep what peace could be kept brie didnt speak much of da were things really so bad between your parents worse than bad they came to each other late in life it was impulse and passion though he told me thered been love once at the start of it maggie brianna hesitated at the doorway come and sit she wants to talk of da brianna came in brushing a hand over shannons shoulder perhaps in support perhaps in gratitude before she joined them i know its hard for you shannon it has to be dealt with ive been avoiding it she lifted her gaze looked closely at each of her sisters i want you to understand i had a father i would think it would be a lucky woman who could say she had two maggie put in both who loved her when shannon shook her head she barreled on he was a loving man a generous one too generous at times as a father he was kind and patient and full of fun he wasnt wise nor successful and he had a habit of leaving a chore half done he was always there if you needed cheering brianna murmured he had big dreams outrageous ones and schemes that were so foolish he was always after making his fortune but he died more rich in friends than in money do you remember the time maggie when he decided we would raise rabbits for the pelts and he built pens for them and bought a pair of those longhaired white ones oh mother was furious at the money it costand the idea of it maggie snickered rabbits in the yard brianna chuckled and poured out the tea and soon they were once they bred he didnt have the heart to sell them off to be skinned and maggie and i were wailing at the idea of the little bunnies being killed so we went out one night maggie said picking up the story the three of us sneaking about like thieves and let them out the mother and father and the babies and we laughed like fools when they went bounding off into the fields she sighed and picked up her tea he didnt have the heart or the head for business he used to write poetry she remembered terrible stuff blank verse it was always a disappointment to him that he didnt have the words brianna pressed her lips together he wasnt happy he tried to be and he worked hard as any man could to see that maggie and i would be but the house was full of anger and as we found later his own sorrow went deeper than anyone could reach he had pride he was so proud of you maggie he was proud of both of us he fought a terrible battle with mother to see that i went to venice to study he wouldnt back down from that and what he won for me cost him and brianna it didnt it did maggie cut brianna off all of us knew it with me gone there was no choice but to lean on you to depend on you to see to the house to her to everything it was what i wanted too hed have given you the moon if he could maggie laid a hand over briannas you were his rose it was how he spoke of you the day he died how did he die shannon asked it was hard to put the picture together but she was beginning to see a man flesh and blood faults and virtues was he ill he was but none of us knew it was painful for maggie would always be to go back to that day i went looking for him in omalleys id just sold my first piece of glass in ennis we celebrated there it was a huge day for both of us it was cold threatening rain but he asked me to drive with him we went out to loop head as he often did loop head shannons heart stuttered clutched it was his favorite of all places maggie told her he liked to stand on the edge of ireland looking across the sea toward america no shannon thought not toward a place toward a person my mother told me they met there they met at loop head oh brianna folded her hands and looked down at them oh poor da he must have seen her every time he went there it was her name he said when he was dying maggie didnt mind the tears and let them fall it was cold bitter cold and windy with the rain just beginning to blow in i was asking him why why hed stayed all these years in unhappiness he tried to tell me to explain that it takes two people to make a marriage good or bad i didnt want to hear it and i wondered if thered ever been anyone else in his life and he told me hed loved someone and that it was like an arrow in the heart that hed had no right to her after a shaky breath she continued he staggered and went gray the pain took him to his knees and i was so scared shouting at him to get up and trying to pull him he wanted a priest but it was just the two of us alone there in the rain he was telling me to be strong not to turn my back on my dreams i couldnt keep the rain off him he said my name then he said amanda just amanda and he died abruptly maggie pushed the chair back and walked out of the room it hurts her brianna murmured she had no one to help had to get da into the truck by herself drive him all the way back i need to go to her no let me please without waiting for assent shannon stood and walked into the front room maggie was there staring out the window i was alone with my mother when she went into the coma she never revived from leading with her heart shannon stepped closer laid a hand on maggies shoulder it wasnt at the end of the earth and the sun was shining technically she was still alive but i knew id lost her there was no one there to help saying nothing maggie lifted her hand rested it over shannons it was the day she told me aboutmyself about her and tom concannon i was angry and hurt and said things to her i can never take back i know that she loved my father she loved colin bodine and i know she was thinking of her tommy when she left me do we blame them maggie said quietly i dont know im still angry and im still hurt and more than anything i dont know who i really am i was supposed to take after my father i thought i did her voice cracked and she fought hard to even it again the man you and brie described is a stranger to me and im not sure if i can care i know about the anger i feel it too and i know for different reasons what its like to not be sure who and what is really inside you he wouldnt have asked for more than you could give shannon brianna stepped into the room he never asked that of anyone she slipped her hand over shannons so that the three of them stood together looking out were family by the blood its up to us to decide if we can be family by the heart chapter twelve she had a great deal to think about and wanted the time to do it shannon knew shed turned one very sharp corner in maggies kitchen she had sisters she couldnt deny the connection any longer nor could she seem to stop the spread of emotion she cared about them their families their lives when she was back in new york she imagined the contact would continue with letters calls occasional visits she could even see herself returning to blackthorn cottage for a week or two now and again through the years shed have the paintings too her first study of the stone dance was finished when shed stepped back from the completed canvas shed been stunned that the power and scope of it the sheer passion of it had come from her shed never painted that vividly before or felt such a fierce emotional attachment to any of her work and it had driven her to start another even as the paint was drying on the first the sketch shed done of brianna in her garden was now a muted undeniably romantic watercolor nearly complete there were so many other ideas varied subjects how could she resist the luminescent light the varied shades of greenthe old man with the thick ash stick shed seen herding his cows down a twisting road all of it every thing and every face she saw cried out to be painted she didnt see the harm in extending her stay another week or two a busmans holiday she liked to think of it where she could explore a side of her art that had been largely ignored throughout her career her financial freedom was an excellent justification for lengthening her time in ireland if her record at rytilghmanton wasnt strong enough to hold for her sabbatical then shed simply find anotherbetterposition when she returned to new york now she walked down the road with murphys jacket over her arm shed meant to get it back to him before but as shed been working closer to the inn the last couple of days there hadnt been the opportunity and it had seemed too cowardly to pass such a petty chore onto brianna or gray in any case she was heading for the front of the house and imagined he would be out in the fields or in the barn leaving it on his porch with a quick note of thanks pinned to it seemed an easy way out but of course he wasnt in the fields or in the barn she supposed she should have known he wouldnt be with the way her luck ran when applied to him as she bypassed his garden gate for the driveway she could see his scarred worndown boots poking out from under the pitiful little car fuck me her eyes widened then danced with humor at the steady and imaginative stream of curses that flew from beneath the car bloody buggerin hell stuck like the cock of a cur in a bitch there was the ping of metal striking metal the crash of a tool falling biggest pile of shit outside of the pigsty with that murphy shoved himself from under the car his face smeared with grease fired with frustration underwent several rapid transformations when he spotted shannon consternation turned to embarrassment and that to a delightfully sheepish grin didnt know you were there he wiped the back of his hand over his chin smearing grease and a trace of blood id have taken a bit more care with my language ive been known to use a few of the same words she said easily though not with that nice rolling lilt having problems could be worse he sat where he was a moment then unfolded himself and rose in what was nearly balletic grace ive promised my nephew patrick id get it on the road for him but its going to take a bit longer than i thought she studied the car again if you can get that running youre working miracles its just the transmission i can fix that he gave the car one final scowl its not my job to make it pretty thank jesus i wont keep you i justyoure bleeding she closed the distance between them in a leap snagging his hand and fretting over the shallow slice in his thumb that was seeping blood tore it some on the bleedingon one of the bolts the one that was stuck like aye his color rose amusing her on that one youd better clean it up it was her turn to be embarrassed by the way shed clamped on to his hand she let it drop ill get to it watching her he took a bandanna out of his back pocket to staunch the flow i was wondering when youd come by youve been avoiding me no ive been busy i did mean to get this back to you before he took the jacket she handed him tossed it onto the hood of the car its no problem i have another with a half smile on his face he leaned against the car and took out a cigarette sure and looking lovely today shannon bodine and safe you are as well since im too filthy to bother you did you dream of me dont start that murphy you did he lighted a match cupping his hand over the tip of the cigarette i had dreams of you from now and from before theyd be comforting if you were in the bed beside me then youre going to be uncomfortable because thats not going to happen he only tugged on his ear and smiled at her i saw you a few days ago walking across the fields with maggie you looked more easy with her we were just going over to her shop i wanted to see it his brow shot up and she showed you thats right we made a paperweight we now his mouth fell open you touched her tools and your fingers arent broken i see how it was he decided you overpowered her and tied her up first feeling a bit smug shannon plucked at her sleeve it wasnt necessary to resort to violence must be those fairy eyes of yours he angled his head theres not as much sorrow in them now youre healing i think about her every day my mother i was away from her and dad so much the last few years its the nature of things shannon for children to grow and move out on their own i keep thinking i should have called more often made more time to go out there especially after my father died i knew how short life could be after that but i still didnt make the time she turned away to look at the flowers that were blooming riotously in the softness of spring i lost them both within a year and i thought id never get over the misery of that but you do the hurt dulls even when you dont want it to neither of them would want you to mourn too long those who love us want to be remembered but with joy she looked over her shoulder why is it so easy to talk to you about this it shouldnt be turning to face him she shook her head i was going to dump that jacket off figuring youd be off somewhere and i was going to stay away from you he dropped the cigarette on the drive crushed it out id have come after you when id reckoned youd had time to settle its not going to work part of me is almost sorry because im beginning to think youre one in a million but its not going to work why dont you come over here and kiss me shannon the invitation was light friendly and confident then tell me that nonsense again no she said it firmly then a laugh bubbled out that kind of cockiness should irritate the hell out of me she tossed her hair back im going come inside have a cup of tea ill wash up he stepped forward but took care not to touch her then ill kiss you the shout of joy had him checking looking around he spotted liam scrambling up the driveway with an effort murphy put desire on hold well heres a likely lad come to visit murphy crouched down for the noisy kiss hows it all going then liam id haul you up boyo he told liam as the child lifted his arms but your motherd have my skin for it how about me liam shifted affections and climbed happily into shannons arms she settled him onto her hip as rogan turned into the drive hes like a bullet out of a gun when he gets within ten yards of this place rogan lifted a brow as he scanned the little car hows this going a great deal more than slow shannon was just coming in for a cup of tea will you have a cup we wouldnt mind that would we liam tea liam said grinning and kissed shannon dead on the mouth its the idea of the cake that might go with it that makes him affectionate rogan said dryly its you i was coming to see shannon youve saved me a bit of a walk oh it looked as though she were stuck now taking it philosophically she carried liam into the house go on into the kitchen murphy told them i need to clean up while liam chattered in earnest gibberish shannon settled into the kitchen with rogan it surprised her to see him fill the kettle measure out tea heat the pot she supposed it shouldnt have but he was so smooth she decided his clothes might have been casual but everything about him spoke of money privilege and power can i ask you a question she said quickly before she could change her mind of course what is a man like you doing here he smiled so quickly so stunningly she had to fight to keep her mouth from dropping open that smile she realized was a major weapon not an office building he began not a theater or a french restaurant in sight exactly not that its not a beautiful spot but i keep expecting someone to say cut then the screen will go blank and ill realize ive been walking through a movie rogan opened a tin took out one of murphys biscuits to entertain liam my initial reaction to this part of the world wasnt quite as romantic as that the first time i came out here i was cursing every muddy mile christ it seemed it would never cease to rain and a long way from dublin is the west in more than miles here let me take him hell have crumbs all over you i dont mind shannon snuggled liam closer but you settled here she prompted rogan weve a home here and a home in dublin id wanted the new gallery been working on the concept of it before i met maggie and after i had her under contract fell in love with her badgered her into marrying me the concept became worldwide galleries clare you mean it was a business decision that was secondary shes rooted here if id torn her out it would have broken her heart so we have clare and dublin and it contents us he rose going to the kettle that was shooting steam to finish making the tea maggie showed me the sketch you did of liam it takes skill to put so much into a few lines and shadings charcoals simple and kind of a hobby of mine ah a hobby keeping his cards close to his vest rogan turned when murphy came in is your music a hobby murphy its my heart he stopped by the table to ruffle liams hair stealing my biscuits youll have to pay for that he snatched the boy up tickling his ribs and sending liam into squeals of laughter truck liam demanded you know where it is dont you go on then and get it murphy set liam down patted his butt sit on the floor in there and play with it if i hear anything i shouldnt im coming after you as liam toddled off murphy opened a cabinet for cups hes partial to an old wooden truck i had as a boy he explained partial enough that it can keep him quiet and out of trouble for ten or fifteen minutes at a go sit down rogan ill tend to the rest of this rogan joined shannon at the table smiled at her again i had a look at the painting youve finished the one of the standing stones i hope you dont mind no but her brow creased you do some and brie wasnt happy about my insisting on going up to look when she mentioned it to me she said i was to tell you myself id invaded your privacy and apologize for it it doesnt matter really she looked up at murphy as he filled cups thanks ill offer you a thousand pounds for it she was grateful shed yet to sip tea surely shed have choked on it youre not serious im always serious about art if youve anything else finished or in progress id be interested in having first look she was beyond baffled i dont sell my paintings rogan nodded sipped contentedly at his tea thats fine ill sell them for you worldwide would be pleased to represent your work speech was impossible at least until her mind stopped spinning she knew she had talent she would never have risen so far at rytilghmanton if shed been mediocre but painting was for saturday mornings or vacations wed very much like rogan went on knowing precisely how and when to press his advantage to feature your work in the clare gallery im not irish because her voice wasnt strong shannon frowned and tried again maggie said that you feature only irish artists there and im not irish that statement was met with respectful silence im american she insisted a little desperately his wife had told him shannon would react in precisely this way rogan was as he preferred to be two steps ahead of his quarry if you agree we could feature you as our american guest artist of irish extraction i have no problem buying your work outright on a piece by piece basis but i believe it would be to our mutual benefit to have a more formal agreement with precise terms thats how he got maggie murphy told shannon enjoying himself but i wish you wouldnt sell him that painting shannon until ive seen it for myself might be i could outbid him i dont think i want to sell it i dont know ive never had to think about this confused she pushed at her hair rogan im a commercial artist youre an artist he corrected and youre foolish to put limitations on yourself if you prefer to think about the standing stones its the dance she murmured i titled it just the dance it was then by the tone of her voice the look in her eyes that rogan knew he had her but he wasnt one to gloat if youd prefer to think about that particular work he continued in the same mild reasonable tone i wonder if youd let me take it on loan and display it in the gallery i well it seemed not only stupid but ungracious to object sure if youd like to i dont have a problem with that im grateful he rose half his mission complete i need to get liam home for his nap maggie and i are switching shifts about this time today shes been working this morning and now im going into the gallery shall i go by and pick up the painting on my way i suppose yes all right it isnt framed well take care of that im going to be drafting up a contract for you to look over confused she stared at him a contract but youll take all the time you need to read it through think it over and naturally well negotiate any changes you might want thanks for the tea murphy im looking forward to the ceili murphy only grinned at him then turned the grin on shannon when rogan went out to collect his son hes slippery isnt he she was staring straight ahead fumbling through the conversation that had just taken place what did i agree to depending on how you look at it nothing or everything hes cagey our rogan i was waiting for it watching and still i never saw him outflank you until it was done i dont know how to feel about this shannon muttered seems to me if i was an artist and a man who has a reputation around the world for being an expert on it and for having an affection and understanding of the best of it found my work of value id be proud but im not a painter patient murphy folded his arms on the table why is it shannon you make such a habit of saying what youre not youre not irish youre not sister to maggie and brie youre not a painter youre not in love with me because its easier to know what youre not than what you are he smiled at that now thats a sensible thing youve said do you always want it easier i never used to think so i was always smug about the fact that i went after the challenges confused and a little frightened she closed her eyes too much is changing on me i cant get solid footing every time i seem to it all shifts again and its hard to move with it when youre used to standing firm he rose then pulled her into his arms no dont worry his voice was quiet when she stiffened im not going to do anything but hold you just rest your head a minute darling let some of the care out of it my mother would have been thrilled you cant feel her feelings gently he stroked her hair hoping shed take the caress as it was meant in friendship do you know my mother once hoped id go off to town and make my living in music really she found her head nestled perfectly in the curve of his shoulder i would have thought your whole family would have expectedwantedyou to farm it was a hope she had when i showed an interest in instruments and such she wanted her children to go beyond what shed known and she loved me more you see than the farm and she was disappointed maybe some until she saw this was what i wanted he smiled into her hair maybe some even after tell me shannon are you happy in your work of course im good at it and ive got a chance to move up in a few years ill have the choice between top level at rytilghmanton or starting a business of my own mmm sounds more like ambition than happiness why do they have to be different i wonder he drew her away because he was tempted to kiss her again and it wasnt what she needed just then maybe you should ask yourself and think it through if drawing for somebody else puts the same feeling inside you that drawing what pulls you does he did kiss her but lightly on the brow meanwhile you should be smiling instead of worrying rogan takes only the best for his galleries you havent been out to ennistymon yet have you no she was sorry hed let her go is that where the gallery is near ill take you if you like i cant today he said with a wince at the wall clock ive got a bit to do around here yet and ive promised to go by feeneys and lend him a hand with the tractor no and ive kept you long enough anyway you can keep me as long as you want he took her hand running his thumb over her knuckles maybe youd come down to the pub tonight ill buy you a drink to celebrate im not sure what im celebrating but i might do that anticipating him she stepped back murphy i didnt come here to wrestle in the kitchen i never said you did youre getting that look in your eyes she muttered and thats my clue to leave my hands are clean now so i wouldnt muss you up if i kissed you im not worried about being mussed im worried about being never mind just keep your hands where i can see them i mean it obliging he lifted them palms out then felt his heart turn over when she rose on her toes and kissed his cheek thanks for the tea and the shoulder youre welcome to either anytime she sighed and made herself back up another step i know you make it hard to be sensible if youve a mind to be insensible feeney can wait she had to laugh no man had ever asked her to bed with quite such style go back to work murphy i think im in the mood to paint she went out the back accustomed now to the way over the fields shannon bodine yes laughing again she turned walking backward as she watched him come out the kitchen door will you paint something for me something that reminds you of me i might she tossed up a hand in a wave swiveled on her heel and hurried away toward blackthorn in the rear gardens of the inn kayla napped in a folding crib near the flowering almond murphy had planted for her her mother was weeding the perennial bed nearby and her father was doing his level best to talk brianna into indoor activities the place is empty gray trailed his fingers down briannas arm all the guests are off sightseeing the kids asleep he inched a little closer to nibble at the back of briannas neck encouraged by her quick shiver of reaction come to bed brianna ive work the flowers arent going anywhere neither are the weeds her system went haywire as he skimmed the tip of his tongue along her skin ah look i nearly pulled an aster go away now and i love you brianna he caught her hands pressing his lips to the back of each heart and body melted oh grayson her eyes fluttered closed when he rubbed his lips persuasively over hers we cant shannon could be back any time uhoh do you think shes guessed where kayla came from thats not the point but her arms were twining around his neck he slipped the first pin from her hair what is the point shed been sure she had one a very simple very valid point i love you grayson strolling into the yard shannon stopped short her first reaction was amused embarrassment at having stumbled across a very private scene the next tripping over the first was interest it was a lovely romantic picture she mused the infant sleeping under a pale pink blanket the flowers blooming clothes blowing on the line in the background and the man and woman kneeling on the grass wrapped in each other a pity she thought she didnt have a sketch pad she must have made some sound as brianna shifted saw her and blushed rosily sorry bye shannon even as shannon turned away brianna was struggling free dont be silly go ahead gray corrected when shannon hesitated be silly scram grayson shocked brianna batted his hands away and rose wei was just weeding the pansies shannon stuck her tongue in her cheek oh i could see that im going to take a walk youve just had a walk so let her take another one gray got up wrapped an arm around briannas waist and sent shannon a meaningful look a really long one ignoring his wifes halfhearted struggles he plucked another pin from her hair better yet take my car you can he let out a groan when kayla began to whimper she needs her nappie changed brianna slipped away to go to the crib amused and feeling wonderfully wanted she smiled over at her husband as she lifted the baby you might put some of that energy into weeding grayson i still have pies to bake right with obvious regret he watched his wife and his hopes for an intimate hour slip out of his reach pies to bake sorry shannon lifted her shoulders when brianna took the baby inside lousy timing youre telling me he hooked an arm around her neck now you have to help me weed its the least i can do companionably she settled on the grass beside him i take it none of the guests are around off to various points of interest we heard your news congratulations thanks i guess im still a little shellshocked rogan has a way of slipping around and through and over objections until youre just nodding and agreeing to everything he says he does intrigued gray studied her profile youd have objections to being associated with worldwide no i dont know she moved her shoulders restlessly it came out of the blue i like to be prepared for things i already have a career which she realized with a jolt she hadnt given a thought to in weeks im used to deadlines and a quick pace the confusion of working in a busy organization paintings this kind of painting is solitary and motivated by mood rather than marketing being used to one way of life doesnt mean you cant change gears if the rewards big enough he glanced toward the kitchen window it depends on what you want and how much you want it thats what i havent decided im floundering gray im not used to that ive always known what step to take next and was confident maybe overconfident about what i was made of thoughtful she brushed her fingers over the bright purple face of a pansy maybe it was because it was only my parents and meno other familythat i always felt able to stand on my own do exactly what i wanted i never made really close attachments as a kid because we moved around so much it made me easy with strangers and comfortable in new places and situations but i never felt any real connection with anyone but my parents by the time we settled in columbus id set my goals and focused on reaching them step by careful step now within a year ive lost my parents learned that my life wasnt what i thought it was suddenly im swimming in family i never knew i had i dont know how i feel about them or myself she looked up again managed a small smile wow that was a lot wasnt it it usually helps to sound the feelings out gently he tugged on her hair seems to me if someones good at going step by step shed be able to shift and keep doing just that in another direction you only have to be alone when you want to be alone it took me a long time to learn that he kissed her made her smile shannon me darling relax and enjoy the ride chapter thirteen in the morning she chose to paint in the garden putting the final touches on the watercolor of brianna from the house came the buzz of activity as a family from county mayo gathered themselves up to leave the inn for the next leg of their trip south she could smell the hotcross buns brianna had made for breakfast and the roses that had burst into bloom in their climb up the trellace nibbling on her knuckle shannon stepped back to examine the completed canvas well thats lovely with liam in tow maggie stepped across the lawn behind her of course she makes an easy subject does brianna she bent down and kissed liam on the nose your aunt brie has your buns darling go get them when he scrambled off slamming the kitchen door behind him maggie frowned over the painting rogans right then she decided its rare that hes not which is a trial to me he took your painting of the stones into the gallery before i had a chance to see and you wanted to check it out for yourself your sketch of liam was more than good maggie conceded but one charcoal isnt enough to judge i can tell you now hell want this and hell badger you until you agree he doesnt badger he demolishes bloodlessly maggies laugh was quick and rich oh thats the truth bless him what else have you without invitation she picked up shannons sketchbook and flipped through help yourself shannon said dryly maggie only made noises of approval and interest then let out another delighted laugh you must do this one shannon you must its murphy to the ground the man and his horses damn i wish i had the hands to do portraits like this id see him up there sometimes when i was painting the circle shannon tilted her head so that she could see the page herself it was irresistible when you paint it id be pleased to buy it for his mother she frowned then unless youve signed with sweeney by then if hes any say in it hell charge me half a leg and both arms the man asks the fiercest prices for things i wouldnt think that would bother you with care shannon took the finished canvas from the easel and laid it on the table when i went to your show in new york a couple years ago i lusted after this pieceit was like a sunburst all these hot colors exploding out of a central core not my usual style but god i wanted it fired dreams maggie murmured deeply flattered yes thats it i had to weigh desire against a years rentat new york rates and i needed a roof over my head he sold that piece if he hadnt id have given it to you at shannons stunned look maggie shrugged at the family rate touched and not sure how to respond shannon set a fresh canvas on her easel id say youre lucky to have a shrewd manager looking after your interests as disconcerted as shannon maggie jammed her hands in her pockets so hes always telling me hes got his mind set on doing the same for you i wont have as much time for painting once im back in new york taking up a pencil shannon sketched lightly on the canvas maggie only lifted a brow when a woman was an artist down to the bone she recognized another hes having contracts drafted up today he moves fast faster than you can spit hell want fifty percent she added grinning wickedly but you can drive him down to forty using the family connection shannons throat was suddenly uncomfortably dry i havent agreed to anything yet ah but you will hell harangue you and hell charm you hell be reasonable and businesslike youll say no thank you very much and hell skip right over that if reason doesnt work hell find some little weakness to twist or some private wish to tweak and youll be signing your name before you realize it do you always hold a pencil like that still frowning over the prediction shannon glanced down at her hand yes i keep the wrist loose mmm i keep a firmer grip but i might try it should give you this before you start mixing paints from her pocket she took out a ball of padded paper the moment shannon felt the weight she knew oh its great once the paper was pulled aside she held the globe up to the light you made it for the most part so you should have it shannon turned it so that the swirls of deep blue inside changed shape and tone its beautiful thank you youre welcome maggie turned back to the canvas she could see the outline of the man the horse how long will it take you to finish its a nasty question and i only ask as id love to give it to mrs brennan murphys mother when she comes up for the ceili if it starts to click itll only take a day or two shannon set the globe aside and took up her pencil again whens the ceili and what is it its saturday next and a ceilis a kind of partywith music and dancing and food she glanced over as brianna stepped out of the kitchen door im telling this poor ignorant yank what a ceili is wheres my whirlwind off to the village with grayson im told its mans business brianna stopped then beamed at the canvas on the table oh im so flattered what lovely work you do shannon she peeked at the new canvas wary experience with maggie had taught her artists had moods that flared like lightning its murphy isnt it it will be shannon murmured narrowing her eyes as she sketched i didnt realize you were having a party brie a party oh the ceili no murphys having it we were surprised at first since his family had just come a few weeks ago for kaylas baptism but the lot of them are coming again so they can meet you shannon dropped her pencil slowly she bent to retrieve it excuse me theyre anxious to get to know you brianna continued too engrossed in the canvas to notice that maggie was rolling her eyes and making faces its lovely murphys mother and her husband can make the trip from cork so soon again shannon turned why would they want to meet me because the warning registered just a beat too late fumbling brianna began to brush at her apron well its just that maggie dont look at me youve already put your foot in it its a simple question brianna shannon waited until brianna lifted her gaze again why would murphys mother and his family come back here to meet me well when he told them he was courting you they he what she threw the pencil down to cap the explosion is he crazy or just brain dead how many times do i have to tell him im not interested before he gets it through that thick skull several times more id wager maggie said with a grin theres a pool in the village thats leaning toward a june wedding maggie brianna said under her breath wedding shannon made a sound between a groan and a curse that tops it hes calling out his mother to inspect me hes got people betting fact is it was tim omalley who started the pool maggie put in he has to be stopped oh theres no stopping tim once a wagers made unable to find the humor shannon shot maggie a searing look you think its funny people i dont even know are betting on me maggie didnt have to think it over yes then with a laugh she grabbed shannon by the shoulders and shook oh cool yourself down no one can make you do what you dont want murphy muldoon is a dead man with less sympathy than amusement maggie patted her cheek seems to me youd not be so fired up if you were as disinterested as you claim what do you think of the matter brie i think ive said more than enough but her heart pushed the words out he loves you shannon and i cant help but feel for him i know what it is to tumble into love and not be able to find your way out no matter how foolish it makes you dont be too hard on him temper drained as quickly as it had flashed it would be harder wouldnt it for me to let this go on when it isnt leading anywhere maggie picked up the sketchbook then held out the page where murphy looked out isnt it when shannon said nothing maggie set the book aside again the ceilis more than a week away youll have some time to sort it out starting now shannon picked up the watercolor and carried it inside on the way up to her room she practiced exactly what she would say to murphy when she tracked him down it was a shame that she would have to break off their friendship just when shed begun to realize how much it meant to her but she doubted he would understand anything less than total amputation and hed brought it on himself the idiot with an effort she controlled herself long enough to prop the canvas carefully against the wall of her room going to the window she scanned the fields after a moment she caught sight of movement near the back of the house dandy shed beard the beast in his den her headlong rush took her down the stairs and outside she was halfway to the gate before she saw the car parked at the side of the road and brianna and maggie on either side of it she didnt have to see to know an argument was in full swing she could hear it in the sharp impatient tone of maggies voice it would have been easy to continue on her waybut she saw briannas face it was pale and rigidly controlled except for the eyes even from two yards away shannon could see the hurt in them she set her teeth it seemed it was her day for dealing with emotional crises and damn it she was in the perfect mood the angry words came to an abrupt halt as she strode to the car and looked down at maeve shannon brianna gripped her hands together i never introduced you to lottie lottie sullivan shannon bodine the woman with the round face and beleaguered expression continued the process of climbing out from the drivers side im pleased to meet you she said with a quick apologetic smile and welcome get in the car lottie maeve snapped were not staying drive yourself off then maggie snapped right back lotties welcome here and im not its you whos made that choice maggie folded her arms make yourself miserable if you like but you wont do this to brie mrs concannon shannon nudged maggie aside id like to speak with you ive nothing to say to you fine then you can listen out of the corner of her eye shannon caught lotties nod of approval and hoped to earn it we have a connection you and i whether we like it or not your daughters link us and i dont want to be the cause of friction between you no ones causing friction but herself maggie said hotly be quiet maggie shannon ignored her sisters hiss of temper and continued you have a right to be angry mrs concannon and to be hurt whether its your pride thats suffering or your heart it doesnt matter still the fact is you cant change what happened or the result of it any more than i can though maeve said nothing only continued to stare fiercely straight ahead shannon was determined to finish my part in this whole thing is rather indirect a result rather than a cause whether or not you were part of the cause doesnt really matter that brought maeves head around and the venom spewing youd dare to say that i caused your mother to commit adultery with my husband no i wasnt there my mother blamed no one certainly not you for her actions and what im saying is it doesnt matter what part you played some might say that since you didnt love him you shouldnt care that he found someone else i dont agree with that you have all the right in the world to care what they did was wrong maggies next protest was cut off by a cold look from shannon it was wrong she said again satisfied that no one interrupted whether you look at it morally religiously or intellectually you were his wife and no matter how dissatisfied either of you were in the marriage that should have been respected honored it wasnt and to find out it wasnt after all these years doesnt diminish the anger or the betrayal she took a quiet breath aware that maeves attention was centered fully on her i cant go back and not be born mrs concannon nothing either of us can do will break the connection so were going to have to live with it she paused again maeve was watching her now and intrigued her eyes narrowed my mother died with my hard words between us i cant fix that either and ill regret it all my life dont let something you cant change ruin what you have now ill be gone soon maggie and brie and your grandchildren are right here satisfied shed done her best shannon stepped back now if youll excuse me i have to go murder a man she started down the road had gotten no more than five paces when she heard the car door open girl shannon stopped turned and met maeves gaze levelly yes you made your point whatever effort it took to concede it maeve disguised in a brisk nod and you have some sense more than the man whose blood runs through you ever did shannon inclined her head in acknowledgment thank you while shannon continued on her way everyone else gaped at maeve as if shed sprouted wings well are you going to stand around outside all the day she demanded get a move on you lottie i want to go in and see my granddaughter not bad shannon decided and quickened her step if she had half that much luck getting through to murphy she could consider it an excellent days work when she reached the farm and circled to the back she saw murphy standing near the paddock of sheep beside a short bandylegged man who had his teeth clamped around a pipe they werent speaking but she would have sworn some sort of communication was going on suddenly the older man bobbed his head all right then murphy two pigs id be grateful if you could hold them for me mr mcnee for a day or two that i can do he shoved the pipe further into his mouth and had started toward the paddock when he spotted shannon youve company lad murphy glanced over and smiled broadly shannon im happy to see you just dont start with me you baboon she strode forward to shove a finger into his chest youve got a lot of explaining to do beside them mcnee perked up his ears is this the one then murphy gauging his ground murphy rubbed his chin she is you took your time picking one out but you picked a fair one temper bubbling shannon turned on mcnee if youve bet on this idiot you can kiss your money goodbye is there a pool mcnee asked offended why wasnt i told of it while shannon considered the satisfaction of knocking their heads together murphy patted her arm if youll excuse me just a minute darling do you need help getting the lamb you fancy mr mcnee no i can handle the job and it looks like youve enough on your hands at the moment with surprising agility the old man swung into the paddock and sent bleating sheep scattering well go inside well stay right here shannon shot back then swore at him when he took a firm grip on her arm well go in he repeated i prefer you do your shouting at me in private in his careful way he stopped at the stoop pulled off his muddy wellingtons he opened the door for her waited as any wellmannered man would for her to storm in before him will you sit no damn you to hell and back i wont sit he shrugged leaned back against the counter well stand then youve something on your mind his mild tone only fanned the fires how dare you how dare you call your family and tell them to come look me over like i was one of your horses going up for auction his face relaxed youre mistaken about that i asked if theyd come meet you thats entirely different it is not different and youre having them come on false pretenses you told them you were courting me so i am courting you shannon weve been through that and im not going through it again thats fine then can i offer you tea she was surprised she had any teeth left as hard as she was grinding them no you cant offer me tea i do have something else for you he reached behind him on the counter and picked up a box i was in ennis a day or so ago and bought this for you i forgot to give it to you yesterday in a gesture she recognized as childish she put her hands behind her back no absolutely no im not taking gifts from you this isnt even remotely amusing anymore murphy he simply opened the box himself you like to wear pretty things these caught my eye despite her best intentions she looked down at the open box they were prettyfoolishly pretty earrings of exactly the type she might have chosen herself citrine and amethyst hearts were nestled one atop the other murphy those are expensive take them back im not a pauper shannon if its my wallet youre worrying about thats a consideration but its secondary she forced herself to look away from the lovely stones im not taking gifts from you itll only encourage you he walked toward her until she found herself backed up against the refrigerator dont you dare youre not wearing any today he observed so well try them on hold still darling i dont know if ive the knack of it she batted at his hands as he started to fasten the first earring then yelped when he poked the post into her lobe you asked for it he muttered giving the job his full concentration im going to hit you she said between her teeth wait till im done this is clumsy work for a man why do they make these little clasp things so bloody small there like a man satisfied with the completion of a pesky chore he stepped back and studied the result they suit you you cant reason with the unreasonable she reminded herself murphy i want you to call your family and tell them not to come i cant do that theyre looking forward to the ceili and meeting you she bunched her hands into fists all right then call and tell them you made a mistake changed your mind whatever and that you and i are not an item his brow creased youre meaning i should tell them im not going to marry you thats it exactly she gave him a congratulatory pat on the arm youve finally got it i hate to say no to you about anything but i cant be lying to my family he was quick enough on his feet to dodge the first punch then the second the third nearly caught him as he was doubled over with laughter but he evaded by snagging her around the waist and swinging her in a giddy circle god youre for me shannon im crazy in love with you crazy she began but the rest was muffled against his mouth he stole her breath she couldnt get it back while she gripped his shoulders he continued to circle her adding dizziness to breathlessness his mouth added the heat even when he stopped the wild spinning the room continued to revolve and her heart with it there was a quick and stunning thought through the haze of desire that he was giving her no choice but to love him im not going to let this happen on a panicked flood of strength she shoved away her hair was tousled her eyes wide and stunned he could see the pulse hammering at her throat and the color the kiss had left blooming in her cheeks come to bed with me shannon his voice was thick rough and edgy christ jesus i need you every time you walk away theres a hole in me and a terrible fear you wont come back desperate he pulled her close again buried his face in her hair i cant keep watching you walk away and never having you dont do this she squeezed her eyes tight and fought a vicious battle with what was inside her you wont let it be anything as simple as going to bed and i cant let it be anything else it is something else its everything else he yanked her back remembering he dropped his hands before his fingers could bruise is it because i trip around you i get clumsy sometimes because i cant always think in a clear way when im close to you no its not you murphy its me its me and your idea of us and ive handled it much more clumsily than you she tried to take a deep breath but found her chest was painfully tight so im going to fix that im not going to see you again keeping her eyes on his cost her but she refused to back down thatll make it easier for both of us im going to start my arrangements to go back to new york thats running he said evenly but do you know if youre running from me or from yourself its my life i have to get back to it the fury crawling through him left no room even for fear with his eyes burning into hers he reached into his pocket and tossed what he had carried there onto the table her nerves began to stretch even before she lowered her gaze and saw it the circle of copper with the figure of a stallion embossed it would have a pin on the back she knew sturdy and thick enough to clamp together a mans riding cloak murphy watched her go as pale as glass her fingers reached out for it then drew back sharply curling into a defensive fist what is it you know what it is he swore with studied violence when she shook her head dont lie to yourself its poor spirited she could see it against dark wool both broach and cloak beaded with rain where did you get it i found it center of the dance when i was a boy i fell asleep with it in my hand right there and dreamed of you the first time she couldnt take her eyes from it even when her vision wavered that isnt possible it happened just as i told you he picked it up and held it out to her i dont want it panic snaked into her voice ive kept it for you half my life calmer now he slipped it back into his pocket i can keep it longer theres no need for you to leave before youve had the time youre wanting with your sisters i wont touch you in that way again or pressure you to give me what youre not willing to youve my word he would keep it she knew him now well enough not to doubt it how could she blame him for giving her a promise that made her feel small and weepy i care about you murphy i dont want to hurt you she couldnt have any idea how much she had done just that but he kept his voice neutral im a man grown shannon and can tend to myself shed been so sure she could walk away cold now she found she wanted to hold him again and be held i dont want to loose your friendship its come to mean a lot to me in a short time you couldnt lose it he smiled though he had to keep his hands close to his sides to keep from reaching for her you never have to worry over that she tried not to as she left and started up the road again and she tried not to think too deeply about why she needed to weep chapter fourteen murphy put his back into mucking out the stables physical labor was part of his life and he knew how to use strain and sweat to ease the mind it was a pity it wasnt working for him he drove his shovel into the soiled straw bedding tossed the load into the growing pile in his wheelbarrow you always had a good aim you did murphy maggie strolled up behind him she was smiling but her eyes were searching his face for signs and what she found tore at her heart why arent you working he spoke without looking over or stopping i hear your furnace im going to get to it she came closer resting a hand on the open stall door i didnt come by yesterday because i thought you might want a little breathing space so i waited till this morning shannon looked miserable when she came back after seeing you yesterday i did my best to put her at ease he bit off the words before taking his shovel into the next stall what about your ease murphy maggie laid a hand on his back leaving it lay despite his badtempered shrug i can see what you feel for her and i hate to know youre so upset then youd best be off as im planning on staying this way move back damn it youll have manure in your face instead she snatched at the handle of the shovel and had an angry and brief wrestle for it fine then she let go and brushed her hands together you can go on shoveling at shit all you please but youll talk to me im in no mood for company and since when have i been company damn it maggie go away he whirled on her temper hot in his eyes i dont want your pity i dont want your sympathy and i dont want any bloody advice she fisted her hands plopped them on her hips and went toe to toe with him if you think you can shake me off with nasty words and nastier temper youre mistaken lad of course he couldnt and because it would do him no good with her murphy did what he could do to bury the fury im sorry maggie mae i shouldnt swipe at you i need to be alone for a bit murphy shed break him if he didnt see her off and quickly its not that im not grateful youd come by and want to help im not ready for it i need to lick my wounds on my own be a friend darling and leave me be deflated she did the only thing she knew how and pressed her cheek to his will you come talk to me when you can sure i will go on now be off ive a lot to do today when she left him murphy drove his shovel into the straw and cursed softly viciously until he ran out of words he worked like a man possessed until the sun set then rose again when it did to repeat the process even his welltoned muscles ached by the time he settled down with a cold sandwich and a bottle of beer he was already thinking of bed though it was barely eight when the back door swung open rogan and gray came through it followed happily by con were on a mission murphy gray slapped him on the back then turned to the cupboards a mission is it automatically he scratched cons ears when the dog laid his head on his lap of what nature were ordered to draw off your black mood rogan set a bottle on the counter and broke the seal were neither of us allowed back home until weve accomplished it brie and maggie have had their heads together over you for two days gray put in theres no need for that or for this i was going up to bed you cant as an irishman turn your back on two mates and a bottle of jamisons gray slapped three glasses one by one on the table so were to get drunk are we murphy eyed the bottle he hadnt thought of that one the women havent been able to turn the tide rogan poured three hefty shots so theyve conceded its a mans job he seated himself comfortably at the table lifted his glass slainte murphy scratched his chin blew out a breath what the fuck he downed the first glass winced before slapping it down for a refill did you only bring one bottle laughing gray poured the next round when the bottle was half gone murphy was feeling more mellow a temporary fix he knew and a fools one but he felt very much the fool i gotta tell you already a little wobbly gray kicked back in his chair and puffed on one of the cigars rogan had provided i cant get drunk yes you can rogan studied the tip of his own cigar ive seen you you couldnt see anything you were too drunk finding that wonderfully funny gray leaned forward again and nearly upended but what i mean is i cant get so plowed i cant make love with my wife tonight oh thanks he picked up the glass murphy had refilled and gestured with it im making up for lost time deadly serious he rested his elbow on the table do you know how long you cant when a womans pregnant i do rogan nodded sagely i can say i do know precisely and it doesnt bother them much theyre gray gestured grandly nesting so im making it up and im not getting drunk too late murphy muttered and scowled into his glass you think we dont know whats wrong with you in fellowship gray punched murphy on the shoulder youre horny with a snorting laugh murphy tossed back another shot it should be so easy yeah on a windy sigh gray went back to his cigar when theyve got you theyve got you aint that the truth sweeney sterling truth shes painting up a storm you know murphy eyed him owlishly my misery your profit rogan only grinned well have her first show in the fall she doesnt know it but well work around that do you know she went head to head with maeve concannon what dya mean preferring his cigarettes to rogans cigars murphy lighted one they have a brawl no indeed shannon just marched up to the woman and said her piece when she was done maeve said she was a sensible woman then went along into the inn to see the baby and young liam is that a fact drenched in admiration and love murphy took another drink jesus shes something isnt she shannon bodine hard of head and soft of heart maybe ill go tell her myself right now he pushed himself up his constitution strong enough to keep him from swaying maybe ill just go on up there fetch her and bring her back where she belongs can i watch gray wanted to know no heaving a sigh murphy dropped back into the chair no i promised her i wouldnt i hate that he picked up the bottle filled his glass again until the whiskey danced to the rim im going to hate my head in the morning thats the truth of it but its worth it he drank deep to share my sorrow with two of the finest friends god gave a man damn right drink to it rogan im thinking i might be wise to make up that time you were speaking of before nowas ill be losing it in seven months gray leaned conspiratorially toward murphy this guy is so sharp its scary id appreciate it if the two of you would stop blabbering on about bedding women im suffering here its inconsiderate of us rogan agreed theres no need to talk of women at all did i hear your bay mares breeding hey gray held up a hand mare woman female damned if you arent right agreeably rogan cast around for another topic we got a fine sculpture in today from an artist in county mayo he used conemarra marble and its lovely work a nude shit rogan there you go again graysons exasperated disgust sent murphy off into gales of laughter being generous friends they poured murphy into bed when the bottle was finished then parted satisfied that theyd accomplished their mission staying away from her was difficult even with the demands of the farm murphy found it hard to go day after day and night after night knowing she was just across the fields and so far out of his reach it helped to think he was doing it for her nothing soothed the soul like martyrdom wellmeaning friends didnt help a week after hed watched her walk away he came into briannas rear yard and saw shannon standing at her easel she was wearing her college sweatshirt splattered and smeared with paint and a pair of baggy jeans that were torn at the knee he thought she looked like an angel with her eyes narrowed and the tip of her brush tapping against her lips she studied her work he knew the moment she sensed him from the change in her eyes her careful movement of lowering her brush before she turned her head he didnt speak he knew his tongue would tangle after an awkward moment he walked closer and stared hard at her painting it was the inn the rear view with its pretty stonework and open windows briannas gardens were flows of color and shape the kitchen door was open wide in welcome shannon wished she hadnt set her brush aside and picked up a rag more to keep her hands occupied than to worry off paint so what do you think its nice he couldnt think of the words it looks finished it is just well he shifted the cartons of eggs he carried its nice she turned fiddling with the tubes and brushes on the little stand gray had rigged for her i guess youve been busy i have yes she glanced up into his face and his brain seemed to disconnect busy furious with himself he scowled down at his cartons eggs he muttered brianna called for eggs said she needed them oh in turn shannon stared at the cartons i see from her perch at the inside corner of the kitchen window brianna rolled her eyes look at them the two of them acting like ninnies because they seemed so pathetic she changed her master plan of leaving them alone and hurried to the door ah there you are murphy and youve brought the eggs bless you come in and have a taste of this strudel ive made i need to but she had already hurried back into the kitchen leaving him staring disconcertedly at the door shifting the cartons again he looked at shannon ive ah damn his slow wits he thought why dont you take them in and ill be on my way murphy this had to stop shannon told herself and tested her ground by laying a hand on his arm he stiffened and she couldnt blame him you havent come around in a week and i know that youre used to dropping in to see brianna and gray often and easily he looked down at her hand then back at her face i thought it best to stay away im sorry for that i dont want you to feel that way i thought we were friends still his eyes stayed on hers you havent come into the fields anymore no i havent i thought it best to stay away and im sorry for that too she wanted to tell him shed missed him and was afraid to are you angry with me with myself more he steadied himself her eyes he thought and the quiet plea in them would undo any man do you want some strudel her smile spread slowly yeah i do when they went inside brianna stopped holding her breath thank you for the eggs murphy bustling now she took the cartons from him and went to the refrigerator i need them for a dish ill be making for the ceili did you see shannons painting its grand isnt it it is he took off his cap hung it on a peg this strudels from a recipe a german woman gave me last week when she was here you remember her shannon mrs metz the one with the big voice the stormtrooper shannon said with a smile she lined up her three children in the morning for inspection her husband too and neat as a pin they were every one of them youll tell me if the strudels as good as she claimed brianna was dishing it up when the phone rang shannon reached for the receiver on the wall phone ill get it blackthorn cottage she hesitated a moment brows lifting in surprise tod yes its me she laughed i do not sound irish unable to keep his lip from curling murphy sat down at the table tod he muttered when brianna set the strudel in front of him sounds more like an insect than a name hush brianna ordered and patted his arm its beautiful shannon continued very much like local hero remember burt lancaster she chuckled again right well im doing a lot of walking and eating and im painting that bored huh his voice was amused and faintly sympathetic no her brow creased not at all doesnt sound like your kind of deal anyway when are you coming back she caught the curling phone cord in her fingers and began to twist im not sure a couple of weeks probably christ shan youve been there a month already her fingers worried the cord twisting it tighter odd it hadnt seemed like a month i had three weeks coming she heard the defensiveness in the tone and hated it the rest is on me how are things going there you know how it is regular madhouse since we clinched the gulfstream account youre the golden girl there shan two major notches in your belt in six months between gulfstream and titus shed forgotten titus and frowned now thinking of the concept and art shed come up with to help sell tires gulfstreams yours now sure but the brass knows who initiated it hey you dont think id take credit for your work no of course not anyway i thought id let you know the guys upstairs are happy but our departments starting to feel the pinch with the fall and christmas campaigns getting underway we really need you back she felt the light throbbing in her temple the warning of a tension headache brewing i have things to work out tod personal things you had a rough patch i know you shannon youll have your feet back under you again and i miss you i know things were a little strained between us when you left and i wasnt as understanding as i should have been as sensitive to your feelings i think we can talk that out and get back on line have you been watching oprah come on shan you take a couple more days then give me a call let me know your flight number and eta ill pick you up at the airport and well cozy down with a bottle of wine and work this out ill get back to you tod thanks for calling dont wait too long the brass has a short collective memory ill keep that in mind bye she hung up discovered the cord was wrapped messily around her fingers she concentrated on meticulously straightening it again that was new york she said without turning around a friend of mine at work before she swung around she made sure she had a bright smile on her face so hows the strudel see for yourself brianna poured shannon tea to go with it her first instinct was to comfort she held back the urge trusting murphy to do the job i think i hear the baby she said and hurried through the adjoining door shannons appetite had fled she glanced listlessly at the strudel bypassed it for her tea my ah office is swamped he wants you back when shannons eyes lifted to his murphy inclined his head this tod wants you back hes handling some of my accounts while im gone its a lot of extra work he wants you back murphy said again and shannon began to poke her fork in the strudel he mentioned itin a noncommital sort of way we had a strained discussion before i left a discussion murphy repeated a strained discussion are you meaning a fight no she smiled a little tod doesnt fight debates she mused he debates hes very civilized and was he debating in a civilized way just now is that why youre all tangled up no he was just catching me up on the office and im not tangled up murphy put his hands over her restless ones stilling them until she looked at him again you asked me to be your friend im trying im confused about things a number of things she said slowly it doesnt usually take me so long to figure out what i want and how to get it im good at analyzing im good at angles my father was too he could always zero in on the bottom line i admired that i learned it from him impatient she jerked her hands from under murphys i had everything mapped out and i was making it work the position with the right firm the uptown apartment the highpowered wardrobe the small but tasteful art collection membership in the right health club an undemanding relationship with an attractive successful man who shared my interests then it all fell apart and it makes me so tired to think of putting it together again is that what you want to do have to do i cant keep putting it off that call reminded me ive been letting it all drift i have to have solid ground under me murphy i dont function well otherwise when her voice broke she pressed her hand to her lips it still hurts so much it still hurts to think of my parents to know ill never see them again i never got to say goodbye i never got to say goodbye to either of them he said nothing at all as he rose and went to her but simply lifted her to her feet to cradle her in his arms in his silence was an understanding so perfect so elemental it devastated she could weep and know that her tears would fall on a shoulder that would never shrug away from her i keep thinking im over it she managed then it sneaks up and squeezes my heart you havent let yourself cry it through go ahead darling youll feel better for it it ripped at him each shuddering sob and knowing he could do no more than be there i want them back i know darling i know you do why do people have to leave murphy why do the people who we love and need so much have to leave they dont not all the way you still have them inside and you cant lose them from there dont you hear your mother talking to you sometimes or your father reminding you of something you did together tired and achy from crying she turned her damp cheek so it could rest against his chest foolish she realized how foolish it had been to think it was stronger to hold in the tears than to let them go yes her lips curved in a watery smile i get pictures sometimes of things we did together even the most ordinary things like eating breakfast so they havent left all the way have they she closed her eyes comforted by the steady beat of murphys heart under her ear just before the mass my mothers funeral mass the priest sat down with me he was very kind compassionate as he was only months before when we buried my father still it was the standard lineeverlasting life mercy and the eternal rewards both my parents would reap having been devout catholics and good caring people she pressed against him one last time for herself then drew back it was meant to comfort me and perhaps it did a little what you just said helps a lot more faiths a kind of remembering shannon you need to prize your memories instead of being hurt by them he brushed a tear from her cheek with the side of his thumb are you all right now ill stay if you like or get brie for you no im okay thanks he tipped her chin up kissed her forehead then sit down drink your tea and dont clutter your mind with new york till youre ready thats good advice when she sniffled he took his bandanna out of his pocket blow your nose she laughed a little and obeyed im glad you came by murphy dont stay away again ill be around because he knew she needed time to herself now he turned to take his cap from the peg will you come to the fields again soon i like seeing you painting there in the sunlight yes ill come to the fields murphy she trailed off not sure how to put the question or why it seemed so important she ask never mind he paused at the doorway what its always better to say whats on your mind than to let it circle in there circling was exactly what it was doing i was wondering if wed been friends when my mother was ill and id had to go away to take care of her to be with her when she died if id told you i could handle all of it even preferred to handle all of it alone would you have respected that stayed away no of course not puzzled he settled his cap on his head thats a stupid question a friend doesnt stay away from a friend whos grieving thats what i thought she murmured then stared at him long enough hard enough to have him rubbing the back of his hand over his chin searching for crumbs what nothing i was she lifted her cup and laughed at both of them woolgathering more puzzled than ever he returned her smile ill see you then youll ah come to the ceili wont you i wouldnt miss it chapter fifteen music was pouring out of the farmhouse when shannon arrived with brianna and her family theyd brought the car as brianna had made too much food for the three of them to handle all of it and the baby on a walk shannons first surprise of the evening was the number of vehicles along the road their wheels tipped up onto the grass verge left just enough room from another car with a very brave or foolish driver to squeeze through from the looks of this hell have a houseful shannon commented as they began to unload briannas dishes and bowls oh the cars and lorries are only for those who live too far away to walk most come on foot to a ceili gray dont tip that pot youll spill the broth i wouldnt tip it if i had three hands hes cross brianna told shannon because his publishing people have added another city to his tour she couldnt quite keep the smugness out of her voice time was the man couldnt wait to go roving times change and if youd come with me you know i cant leave the inn for three weeks in the middle of summer come on now despite the load they both held brianna leaned forward to kiss him dont fret on it tonight ah look its kate she hurried forward her call of greeting floating on the air you could always cancel the tour shannon said under her breath as she and gray followed tell that to her youll not be neglecting your responsibilities toward your work because of me grayson thane ill be just where you left me when you get back well shannon would have patted his cheek if her hands hadnt been full she will cheer up gray if ive ever seen a man whos got it all its you yeah that lifted his spirits a little i do but its going to be hard to feel that way when im sleeping alone in cleveland next july suffering though room service inroom movies and the adulation of fans shut up bodine he gave her a nudge to send her through the door she hadnt realized there were so many people in the entire county the house was full of them alive with their voices crowded with their movements before she was ten paces down the hall she was introduced to a dozen and hailed by that many more shed already met music of flutes and fiddles streamed out of the parlor where some were already dancing plates of food were piled high balanced on knees while feet enthusiastically stomped the time glasses were lifted or being pressed into waiting hands still more people crowded into the kitchen where platters and bowls were jammed end to end along the counters and the center table brianna was there already empty handed as the baby was passed around and cooed over ah heres shannon brianna beamed as she began to unload the dishes from shannons arms shes not been to a ceili before wed have the music in the kitchen traditionally but theres no room for it but we can hear it just the same you know diedre omalley yes hello get yourself a plate lass diedre ordered before the horde leaves you nothing but crumbs lets have those grayson ill trade you for a beer i can do that for you she chuckled as she took platters theres plenty to be had out on the stoop there shannon sure she smiled as gray stepped out the door to fetch bottles it doesnt look like therell be much business at the pub tonight mrs omalley no indeed weve closed a ceili at murphys empties the village ah alice i was just talking of your boy with the bottle gray had given her halfway to her lips shannon turned to see a slim woman with softly waved brown hair come in the kitchen she had murphys eyes and his quick smile theyve shoved a fiddle in his hands so hell not get past the parlor for a time her voice was mellow with a laugh on the edge of it i thought id fix him up a plate dee in case he finds a moment to eat she reached for one then her smile brightened brie i didnt see you there wheres that angel of yours right here mrs brennan with a cocky grin gray stepped forward to kiss her go on with you devil is more like wheres that baby nancy feeney and young mary kate absconded with her deidre said uncovering the dishes brianna had brought youll have to find them then fight them for her and so i will ah listen to that lad play pride beamed into her eyes hes gods gift in his hands im pleased you could come from cork mrs brennan brianna began you havent met shannon my friend from america i havent no the shining pride shifted to caution and curiosity her voice didnt cool precisely but took on a hint of formality im pleased to meet you shannon bodine she offered her hand shannon caught herself wiping her palm on her slacks before accepting the greeting its nice to meet you mrs brennan what now murphy favors you thank you hes a handsome lad for certain and you live in new york city and draw for a living yes miserably uncomfortable she took a swig from her beer when maggie came noisily through the back door shannon could have kissed her feet were late maggie announced and rogans bursting to tell everyone it was my fault so ill say it first i had work to finish she plopped a bowl on the table then set liam down to toddle im starving to death too she snatched one of briannas stuffed mushrooms from a plate and devoured mrs brennan just the woman im after all that stiff formality melted out of alices face as she scooted around the table to give maggie a hard hug lord you were the same as a child always noisy as six drums youll be sorry you said so when i give you your present come along rogan a mans got a right to stop and get a beer with one in his hand he maneuvered himself and the wrapped package he carried through the door the entrance brought fresh greetings and chatter seeing it as a perfect escape shannon began to edge toward the hall no you dont coward amused gray blocked her way he slung an arm around her in a gesture of affection as firm as shackles give me a break gray not a chance stuck she watched as alice carefully removed the brown paper from the painting as people crowded around there were sounds of surprise and approval oh tis him to life alice murmured thats just the way he holds his head do you see and how he stands ive never had a finer gift maggie thats the truth i cant thank you enough for giving it to me or for painting it you can thank me for giving it but shannon painted it every head in the room shifted direction and measured its a fine talent you have alice said after a moment and the lilt came back in her voice and a heart for seeing your subject clearly im very proud to have this before shannon could think of a response a small blackhaired woman burst in from the hallway ma youll never guess whoswhats this spying the painting she elbowed her way to it why tis murphy with his horses shannon bodine painted it alice told her oh eyes bright and curious the woman turned to scan the room it took her only seconds to zero in well im kate his sister and im pleased to meet you youre the first hes courted ever shannon sagged a little against grays supporting arm its notwere notmurphy exaggerated she decided as several pair of eyes studied her were friends its wise to be friends when youre courting kate agreed do you think sometime you could draw my children maggie wont im a glass artist maggie reminded her and kept filling her plate and youll have to go through rogan hes managing her i havent signed the contract yet shannon said quickly i havent even maybe you can do it before you sign up with him kate interrupted i can gather them up and bring them to you whenever you say stop badgering the woman alice said mildly and what did you come bursting in here to tell me tell you kate looked blank for a moment then her eyes cleared oh you wont guess who just walked in the door maeve concannon she said before anyone could try big as life why maeves not been to a ceili in twenty years diedre said more i think well shes come and lottie with her brianna and maggie stared at each other speechless then moved quickly like a unit wed best go see if she wants a plate brianna explained wed best go see that she doesnt storm down the house maggie corrected why dont you come shannon you had a way with her last time well really i dont think but maggie grabbed her arm and dragged her out of the kitchen and down the hall musics still playing she said under her breath she hasnt put the stops to that look this is none of my business shannon protested shes your mother ill remind you of your own words about connections shit maggie but shannon had no choice but to grit her teeth and be propelled into the parlor sweet jesus was all brianna could say maeve was sitting liam in her lap tapping her foot to the rhythm of the reel her face might have been set mouth grim but that tapping foot gave her away shes enjoying herself astonishment had maggies eyes round and wide well for christs sake with an illtempered jerk shannon freed herself why shouldnt she shed never come around music brianna murmured not in all my memory as lottie swung by dancing a clare set in the arms of a neighbor brianna could only shake her head how did lottie get her to come but shannon had forgotten maeve across the room murphy stood hip shot a fiddle clamped between shoulder and chin his eyes were half closed so that she thought he was lost in the music his quick fingers and hands made then he smiled and winked what are they playing shannon asked the fiddler was joined by a piper and another who played an accordion thats saint stevens reel brianna smiled and felt her own feet grow restless ah look at them dance time to do more than look gray snatched her from behind and whirled her into the parlor why shes wonderful shannon said after a moment shed have been a dancer our brie if things had been different brows knit maggie shifted her gaze from her sister to her mother maybe things were different then than theyre beginning to be now after taking a long breath maggie stepped into the parlor after a moments hesitation she made her way through the dancing and sat beside her mother thats a sight i never thought to see alice stepped next to shannon maeve concannon sitting with her daughter at a ceili her grandson on her knee her foot tapping away and very close to smiling i suppose youve known her a long time since girlhood she made her life and toms a misery and those girls suffered for it its a hard thing to fight for love now it seems shes found some contentment in the life she leads and in her grandchildren im glad for that alice looked at shannon with some amusement i should apologize for my own daughter for embarrassing you in the kitchen shes always been one for speaking first and thinking last no its all right she was misinformed alice pursed her lips at the term well if theres no harm done theres my daughter eileen and her husband jack will you come meet them sure she met them and murphys other sisters his brother his nieces and nephews and cousins her head reeled with names and her heart staggered from the unquestioning welcome she received each time her hand was clasped she was given a full plate a fresh beer and a seat near the music where kate chattered in her ear time simply drifted unimportant against the music and the warmth children toddled or raced or fell to dreaming in someones willing arms she watched men and women flirt while they danced and those too old to dance enjoy the ritual how would she paint it shannon wondered in vivid and flashing colors or in soft misty pastels either would suit there was excitement here and energy and there was quiet contentment and unbroken tradition you could hear it in the music she thought murphy had been right about that every note every lovely voice lifted in song spoke of roots too deep to be broken it charmed her to hear old mrs conroy sing a ballad of love unrequited in a reedy voice that nonetheless held true she laughed along with others at the rollicking drinking song shouted out in awe and amazement she saw brianna and kate execute a complex and lyrical steptoe that had more people crowding into the parlor she clapped her palms pink when the music stopped then glanced over as murphy passed off his fiddle youre enjoying yourself he asked her im loving every minute she handed him her plate to share you havent had a chance to eat anything so do it quick she grinned at him i dont want you to stop playing theres always someone to fill in but he picked up half her ham sandwich what else can you playbesides the violin and concertina oh a little of this and that i saw you met my family there are so many of them and they all think the sun rises in murphys eyes she chuckled when he winced i think we should dance she shook her head when he took her hand as ive explained to several lovely gentlemen im very happy to watch no murphy she laughed again when he pulled her to her feet i cant do that stuffjigs or reels or whatever sure you can he was steadily drawing her out but theyre going to play a waltz like i asked them the first time we dance should be a waltz it was his voice that had her hand going limp the way it had softened over the words ive never waltzed in my life he started to laugh then his eyes widened youre joking no its not a popular dance in the clubs i go to so ill just sit this one out ill show you he slipped an arm around her waist changed his grip on her hand put your other hand on my shoulder i know the stance its the steps it was too enchanting a night not to accommodate him lowering her head she watched his feet you know the count surely he smiled at the top of her head so you go one and a quicker two and three and if you slide the back foot a bit on the last count youd glide into it aye thats it when he circled her she looked up again laughing dont get fancy im a fast study but i like plenty of practice you can have all you want its no hardship for me to hold you in my arms something shifted inside her dont look at me like that murphy i have to when im waltzing with you he whirled her in three long circles as fluid as wine the trick when youre waltzing is to look right into your partners eyes you wont get dizzy that way when youre turning round the idea of spot focusing might have had its merits but not shannon discovered when the focus was those dark blue eyes you have lashes longer than your sisters she murmured it was always a bone of contention between us such wonderful eyes her head was spinning around and around like the dance on the edge of giddy on the verge of dreams i see them in my sleep i cant stop thinking about you the muscles of his stomach twisted like iron then tightened darling im doing my best to keep a promise here i know everything was in slow motion now a drift a turn a note all of the colors and movements and voices seemed to fade mistily into the background until it was only the two of them and the music youd never break a promise whatever it cost you i havent before his voice was as tense as the hand holding hers but youre tempting me are you asking me to break it i dont know why are you always there murphy on the tip of my mind she closed her eyes and let her head fall to his shoulder i dont know what im doingwhat im feeling i have to sit down i have to think i cant think when youre touching me you drive a man past the end of his tether shannon with an effort he kept his hands gentle as he drew her away led her back to her seat he crouched in front of her look at me his voice was quiet below the music and the laughter i wont ask you again i swore i wouldnt it isnt pride that holds me back or that makes me tell you the next step whatever it is has to be yours no shannon thought it was honor as oldfashioned a word as courtship stop flirting with the lass tim stopped by to slap murphy hard on the back sing something for us murphy im busy now tim no shannon edged back found a smile go sing something murphy ive never heard you fighting to compose himself he stared down at the hands hed rested on his knees what would you like to hear your favorite in a gesture that was as much apology as request she laid her hand over his the song that means the most to you all right will you talk with me later later she smiled at him as he straightened certain she would feel more like herself later so how do you find your first ceili brianna sat down beside her hmm oh its great all of it we havent had such a grand big party since gray and i married last year the bacachs we had on the night we got back from our honeymoon the what oh a bacachs is an old tradition where people disguise themselves and come into the house after dark andoh murphys going to sing she gave shannons hand a squeeze i wonder what hell do his favorite four green fields brianna murmured and felt her eyes sting before the first note was played it took only that first note for voices to hush the room went still as murphy lifted his to the accompaniment of a single pipe she hadnt known he had that inside himthat pure clean tenor or the heart behind it he sang a song of sadness and hope of loss and renewal and all the while the house grew as quiet as a church his eyes were on hers it was a love song but the love was for ireland for the land and for family listening to him she felt that something that had moved inside her during the dance shift again harder firmer further the blood began to hum under her skin not in passion so much as acceptance anticipation every barrier she had built crumbled and fell soundlessly under the effortless beauty of the song his voice simply vanquished her there were tears on her cheeks warm freed by his voice and the heartbreaking words of the ballad there was no applause when he had finished the hush was acknowledgment of a beauty simple and grand murphys eyes stayed on shannons as he murmured something to the piper a nod and then a quick bright tune was played the dancing began again she knew he understood before hed taken the first step toward her he smiled she rose and took the hand he offered he couldnt get her out quickly there were too many people who stopped him for a word by the time hed led her outside he could feel her hand trembling in his so he turned to her be sure yes im sure but murphy this cant make any difference you have to understand he kissed her slow and soft and deep so that the words slid back down her throat keeping her hand in his he circled around the house toward the stables in here her eyes went wide and she felt a quick tugofwar between dismay and delight we cant all these people he found he could laugh after all well save a roll in the hay for another time shannon love im just getting blankets oh she felt foolish and not at all certain she wasnt disappointed blankets she repeated as he took two down from the line where theyd been airing where are we going he folded them laid them over his arm then took her hand again where we started the dance her heart began to drum again ican you just leave this way all those people are in your house i dont think well be missed pausing he looked down at her do you care if we are no she shook her head once quickly no i dont care if we are they crossed into the fields under the streaming light of the moon do you like counting stars he asked her i dont know automatically she looked up to a sky teeming with them i dont think i ever have you cant ever finish he brought their joined hands to his lips its not the sum of them that matter not the number its the wonder of it all thats what i see when i look at you the wonder of it all with a laugh he scooped her off her feet when he kissed her again it was full of young burgeoning joy can you pretend im carrying you up some fine curving staircase toward a big soft bed plumped with satin pillows and pink lace i dont need to pretend anything she pressed her face into his throat as emotion welled up and swamped her tonight i need only you and youre right here aye he brushed his lips over her temple until she shifted her head to look at him im here he nodded across the field were here the circle of stones stood waiting in the warm beam of the moon chapter sixteen under swimming stars and a moon that shone white like a beacon he carried her to the center of the dance she heard an owl hoot a long call that drifted through the air and faded to humming silence he set her on her feet then spread the first blanket letting the other fall before he knelt in front of her what are you doing where had the nerves come from she wondered she hadnt been nervous even a moment ago im taking off your shoes such a simple thing an ordinary thing yet the gesture was as seductive as black silk he took off his own setting them tidily beside hers his hands skimmed up her body from ankle to shoulders as he rose youre trembling are you cold no she didnt think she could ever be cold again with the furnace that was pulsing away inside her murphy i dont want you to think that this means anything but what it means i wouldnt be fair to he was smiling as he cupped her face gently in his hands and kissed her i know what it means beauty is its own reason for being still soft still tender his lips skimmed over her cheekbone thats emerson what manner of man was it she wondered who could quote poetry and plow fields youre beautiful shannon this is beautiful he would see to it giving her his heart as much as his body and taking hers so his hands were soft easy as he stroked herher shoulders her back through her hair while his mouth patiently persuaded hers to give more to take more just a little more she trembled still even as her body leaned more truly into his as the sound of quiet pleasure sighed through her lips then through his a faint breeze danced up through the grass then swirled like music around them he drew back his eyes on hers and slipped the mans vest she wore from her shoulders let it fall a murmur of surprise and longing whimpered in her throat as he kissed her again his hands on her face his fingers tracing shed thought shed understood the rules of seduction the moves and countermoves men and women executed in the path toward pleasure but this was new this quiet patient dance this savoring of each elemental step as with the waltz hed taught her she could do no more than hold fast and enjoy her breath caught released shakily when his fingers rested on the top button of her shirt oh she wished shed worn silk something flowing and feminine with some lacy fancy beneath to enchant him slowly he opened the shirt spread it then laid his palm lightly against her heart the thrill shot through her like a molten bullet murphy ive thought about touching you he took the hand she gripped at his shoulder brought it to his lips how your skin would feel and taste and smell watching her he slid the shirt from her shoulders ive rough hands no she could do no more than shake her head no his eyes were solemn as he traced a fingertip above the downward curve of her bra and up again hed known shed be soft but the way her flesh quivered under his lightest touch the way her head fell back in stunned surrender added sweetness to desire so he didnt takethough he could already feel the way her breasts would cup small and firm in his hands instead he bent his head and took her mouth again her lips were incredibly generous opening and welcoming his the dark potent tastes curled through his system hinting of more heated and more intimate flavors i want her hands shook as she gripped his shirt she steadied herself by staring into his eyes i want you more than i ever imagined now watching him she unbuttoned his shirt reaching up to tug it over his shoulders then her gaze lowered oh it was a sigh of delight and admiration this was a body hardened and defined by labor and sweat rather than machines experimentally she spread her hands over his chest where the skin was smooth over solid strength and his heartbeat jumped then hers leaped into her throat as he loosened the waistband of her slacks mesmerized she felt him take her hand balancing her as she stepped free but when she reached for him he shook his head even the patience of love had its limits lie with me he murmured come lie with me he lowered her to the blanket and captured her mouth he touched her with a terrifying tenderness molding her breasts giving himself the aching pleasure of slipping beneath the cotton to test and tease he needed the flavor that tempted him along her throat over her shoulders when his tongue skimmed as his fingers had under the material to lave her nipple she arched like a bow now her breath sobbed out for gods sake he only flicked open the front clasp of her bra and took her silkily into his mouth tormented exhilarated she pressed him closer beneath him her movements were frantic shameless he was undoing her with tongue and teeth and lips making her beg with stumbling breathless words the flash came so fast so hot she reared up gripping the blanket in defense the hard jittery climax had her shuddering shuddering until she fell limply back impossible fighting for breath she lifted a weighted hand to push at her hair it wasnt possible no one had ever made her feel so much on a groan of his own murphy pressed his lips to her flesh letting his hand roam lower now over the curve of her waist and hips shannon i love you ever and always i cant weak she laid a hand on his back it was damp she realized dimly the muscles tightly bunched i need a minute but his mouth was skimming over her rib cage god what are you doing to me pleasuring you and he intended to do more to her had to do more to her the need was building painfully inside him all hot blood and violent lust he knew he could only chain down for so long he tugged the skimpy panties over her hips and nipped pleasuring me her body was a treasure of dark delights he intended to explore fully but the time for leisure had passed greedy now he took reveling in her frenzied movements her gasps and cries he wanted her like this helplessly his clawing at him as he drove her ruthlessly into flame after flame and when she was writhing and wet and wild it still wasnt enough he was tearing at his jeans as he took his mouth on a sprinting journey up her torso over her heaving breasts and back to her trembling lips she arched urgently against him then her legs scissored to clamp hard around him he shook his head not in denial but to clear his hazed vision he wanted to see her and for her to see him look at me he demanded fighting to expel each word over the heart that pounded thick in his throat damn it look at me now she opened her eyes her focus wavered then sharpened until all she could see was his face i love you he said it fiercely his eyes lancing into hers do you hear me yes she gripped his hair yes then she cried out in triumph as he drove himself hard and deep into her the orgasm rolled through her like a wave of lava leaving her shaken and scorched as her eyes closed again he savaged her mouth while his body tirelessly plunged mindlessly she matched his pace leaping heedlessly into the storm they brewed between them she thought she heard thunder roll and lightning flare its wicked fingers across the sky her body exploded shattered then went glowingly limp her hands slid bonelessly from his back she heard him say her name felt him coil then shudder then drop his weight onto her he let himself wallow in her hair kept his face buried there while his system vibrated she was trembling again or still little bursts he knew were the aftershocks of good sex hed have stroked her to sootheif he could have moved ill get off you in a minute he murmured dont you dare he smiled and rubbed his face in her hair at least i can keep you warm this way i dont think ill ever be cold again on a little purr of pleasure she curled her arms around him youre probably going to get all smug when i tell you this but i dont think i can mind no ones ever made me feel like this before it wasnt smugness he felt but joy theres been no one before you she cuddled and laughed youre entirely too good at this murphy i imagine there are a lot of women they were all just practice he interrupted and made the effort to shift to his elbows so he could look at her the way she was smiling made him grin now i cant say there wasnt a time or two i enjoyed the practicing remind me to punch you later she laughed when he rolled her over and over again until they were at the edge of the blanket with her cradled against his chest im going to have to paint you she mused tracing her finger from biceps to pectorals i havent done a nude since art school but darling when you get me naked youll be much too busy for your brushes her grin flashed wickedly youre right she pressed her lips to his lost herself a moment in the lingering with a sigh she rested her head on his chest ive never made love outside before youre joking she lifted her head again and aimed a bland look its frowned upon in my neighborhood because her skin was chilling he reached for the spare blanket then its a night of firsts for you your first ceili he tossed the blanket over her fussing with the edges until he was satisfied she was covered your first waltz it was the waltz that did it no thats wrong she shook her head then shifted so that she could frame his face with her hands the waltz seduced me but it was when you sang when i listened to you i couldnt understand how why id ever said no ill have to remember to sing for you often he lifted a hand cupped the back of her neck pretty greeneyed shannon love of all my lives come and kiss me he woke her from a light doze just as the eastern sky was pearling he was sorry to for hed loved watching her sleep the way her lashes lay on her cheek with the light flush beneath them and he wished there was time for him to love her once again as dawn broke but there were obligations and family waiting for him shannon gently he stroked her cheek kissed it darling its nearly morning the stars are going out she stirred whimpering and clutched at his hand why wont you stay why how could you come back to me only to leave again ssh he drew her close pressed his lips to her brow im here right here tis only a dream if you loved me enough you wouldnt go again i do love you open your eyes now youre dreaming she followed the sound of his voice opened her eyes as hed asked for a moment she was lost between two worlds both of which seemed familiar and right dawn just before dawn she thought hazily and the smell of spring the stones rising up gray and cold in the waning dark and the feel of her lovers arms hard around her your horse she looked around blankly she should have heard the jingle of its bridle and the impatient stomp of hooves as it waited to ride theyre stabled yet firmly murphy cupped her chin and turned her face back to his where are you i she blinked and floated out of the dream murphy his eyes were narrowed on her face with a hint of frustration in them do you remember what happened then what did i do to lose you she shook her head the sense of despair and the fear were waning i was dreaming i guess thats all tell me what i did but she pressed her face to his shoulder relieved to find it warm and solid just a dream she insisted is it morning he started to argue then backed off nearly i need to get you back to the inn too soon id hold back the sun if i could he squeezed her once more then rose to get their clothes cuddled under the blanket shannon watched him and felt the little tingles of desire begin to spark again she sat up let the blanket pool to her waist murphy when he glanced back she had the satisfaction of seeing his eyes go dark and cloudy make love with me theres nothing id like better but my familys at the house and theres no telling when one of them he trailed off when she rose slim and beautifully naked the clothes slipped out of his hands as she walked toward him make love with me she said again and twined her arms around his neck fast and desperate like it was the last time there was a witch in her hed known it the first time hed looked in her eyes the power of it glowed out of them now confident and challenging though her breath hissed out when he dragged her head back by her hair the look never wavered like this then his voice was rough as he dragged her around he braced her back against the king stone and cupping her hips lifted her off her feet she clamped herself around him willing and eager the power burst when he thrust into her battering them both with the speed and desperation shed demanded they were eye to eye each violent stroke heating the gasping breaths they took her nails dug into his shoulders her lips curved in triumph as their bodies convulsed together his legs went weak and his palms had gone so damp he feared hed lose his hold on her and drop her he could hear his own breath panting out like a dogs jesus he blinked stinging sweat out of his eyes sweet jesus christ slumped against his shoulder she began to laugh it bubbled up through her full of joy and fascination he could only struggle to get back his breath and balance her as she threw her arms into the air oh i feel so alive a grin tugged at his mouth as he managed to keep her from tumbling both of them youre alive all right but you damned near killed me he kissed her hard then set her firmly on her feet get your clothes on woman before you finish me off i wish we could go running buck naked through the fields he blew out a breath and bent to pick up her bra oh my sainted mother would love that if she happened to take a turn around the yard and look out amused shannon slipped into her bra and plucked her panties out of the grass i bet your sainted mother knows just what youve been up to since you didnt come home last night knowing and getting a firsthand looks two different matters he gave her bottom a friendly pat when she bent over to pick up her shirt you look sexy in mens clothes i meant to tell you mens look shannon corrected buttoning the oversize shirt whats the difference he sat on the grass to put on his shoes would you go out with me tonight shannon if i come calling for you baffled and pleased she looked down at him that the man could ask so sweetly when theyd barely finished going at each other like animals charmed her well it may be id do that murphy muldoon she said giving her best shot at a west county brogue his eyes danced as he tossed her one of her shoes you still sound like a yank but i like ittis a darling accent she snorted have a darling accent right she reached down to pick up the blanket but he stayed her hand leave them if you will smiling she turned her hand so that their fingers twined yes i will then ill walk you to your door you dont have to i do have to he led her through the arch of stone and into the field where the light was just beginning to pearl the dewy grass and want to as well happy she leaned her head against his shoulder as they walked in the east morning was rising gently in pinks and golds like a painting washed by a pasteltipped brush she heard the crow of the rooster and the cheerful song of a lark when murphy stopped to pick a wildflower with creamy white petals she turned smiling so that he could slip it into her hair look theres a magpie she lifted her hand to point as the bird darted low over the field thats right isnt it brianna showed me thats right look there quick two more pleased at his luck he swung his arm around her shoulders one is for sorrow he told her two is for mirth three for a wedding and four for a birth she watched the flight and cleared her throat murphy i know you have very strong feelings and he lifted her up and set her over the next wall im in love with you he said easily if thats what youre meaning yes thats what i mean she had to be careful she realized as her own emotions had gone so much deeper than shed ever intended and i think i understand how you believe that should progress taking your personality your culture and your religion into account youve a wonderful way of cluttering things up with words what you mean is i want to marry you oh murphy im not asking you at the moment he pointed out what im doing is enjoying a morning walk with you and looking forward to seeing you again in the evening she slid him a glance saw he was studying her so we can keep it simple theres nothing simpler here let me kiss you before were in bries garden he turned her into his arms lowered his head and melted her heart one more she whispered and drew him back ill call for you he made the effort and released her id take you out to dinner but your familys here she finished i understand theyll be gone tomorrow if you wouldnt feel awkward with brie id like if youd spend the night with me then in my bed no i wouldnt feel awkward till later then he kissed her fingertips and left her on the edge of the garden where the roses were still damp with dew humming to herself she crossed the lawn let herself in the back door only to come up short when she saw brianna measuring up coffee at the stove oh hi unaware of the foolish grin on her face shannon stuck her hands in her trouser pockets youre up early brianna only lifted a brow shed been up half an hour the same time as she was up nearly every morning of her life kayla wanted breakfast shannon glanced at the clock in surprise i guess its a little later than i thought i was just out so i gathered didnt murphy want to come in for coffee no he she broke off blew out a breath i guess we werent very discreet you could say im not surprised to see you coming in now when i saw the way you looked when you walked out with him last night since the coffee was brewing brianna turned around you look happy do i she laughed then gave into impulse and rushed over to throw her arms around brianna i must be i must be idiotically happy i just spent the night with a man in a horse pasture me in a horse pasture its incredible im happy for you brianna held tight moved by this first free burst of affection of sister for sister for both of you hes a special man murphy ive hoped for a long time hed find someone as special shannon clung for another minute brianna it isnt quite like that i care for him i care for him very much i couldnt have been with him if i didnt i know i understand that very well but im not like you shannon stepped back hoping to explain to brianna what she needed to explain to herself im not like you or maggie im not looking to settle down here get married and raise a family i have other ambitions the trouble had already come into briannas eyes before she lowered them hes very much in love with you i know and im not sure that im not in love with him she turned away thinking to keep her balance in movement but love isnt always enough to build a life on you and i should understand that because of our parents ive tried to explain this to murphy and can only hope i have because the last thing i want to do is hurt him and you dont think youll hurt yourself by turning away from your heart i have my head to think about too brianna reached into a cupboard for cups and saucers thats true its all of you that has to decide whats right and its hard when one part of you tugs away from the other you do understand grateful shannon laid a hand on her shoulder you really do of course for murphy its easy he has no questions about his thoughts or feelings or needs theyre all you for you its not so simple so you have to take your happiness as it comes and not question every step of it thats what im trying to do not just with murphy im happy brianna she said softly with you it means more than i can say to hear you say that with the love easing gently through her brianna turned and smiled to know you could say it its a fine morning its a great morning shannon caught briannas hands and squeezed the best morning im going to go change take your coffee with you blinking at tears brianna poured a cup ill fix you breakfast before church no ill take the coffee shannon said and did so and ill go change then ill come back and help you fix breakfast but im not a guest here anymore this time briannas eyes filled before she could stop them no youre not well be smart about it then she ordered and turned briskly to pour herself tea those that are will be rising soon gray waited until shannon had left the kitchen before he stepped in himself he crossed over and gathered his quietly weeping wife into his arms go ahead honey he murmured and patted her back have a good one the two of you nearly had me bawling myself grayson rocked against him she sobbed happily into his shoulder shes my sister thats right he kissed the top of her head shes your sister chapter seventeen shannon hadnt attended sunday mass often in new york her parents had been quietly devout catholics and shed attended catholic schools gone through all the rites and rituals she considered herself a catholic a modern female catholic who was dissatisfied with many of the doctrines and laws that came through the vatican sunday mass was simply a habit shed slipped out of once shed established her life and pattern in new york but to the people in her small spot in county clare sunday mass wasnt a habit it was fundamental she had to admit she enjoyed the small church the smell of flickering votive candles and polished pews that brought back sensory memories from her youth the statues of mary and joseph the plaques that illustrated the stations of the cross the embroidered altar cloth were all symbols that were found across the world the little village church boasted small stainedglass windows through which softly colored light streamed the pews were scarred with age the kneelers worn and the old floor creaked at each genuflection however simple the setting the rite itself had a stirring pomp and grandeur here as it would in saint patricks magnificent cathedral on fifth avenue she felt solid and steady sitting beside brianna listening to the lyrical tone of the priest the murmured responses from the congregation the occasional cry or whimper of a child murphys family was across the narrow aisle taking up two pews and hersfor she was beginning to think of them as her familyranged together in one when they stood for the final blessing liam clambered over the pew and held up his arms to her she hoisted him onto her hip grinning when he pursed his lips pretty he said in a stage whisper when shed obliged him with a kiss his pudgy fingers went to the citrine and amethyst stones she wore at her ears mine nope mine she carried him out with her as the congregation emptied the pews and spilled out into the late morning sunshine pretty he said again so hopefully that she rooted through her purse to see if she could find something to please him she is that lad murphy snatched liam away tossing him high to make him laugh pretty as a may morning shannon felt a little thrill ripple up her spine only hours before theyd been naked sweaty and locked together now they were trimmed out for church and surrounded by people it didnt stop fresh need from curling in her gut pulling a small mirror out of her bag she aimed it at liam theres pretty delighted liam clutched at it and began to make faces at himself look ma nearby kate cradled her youngest on her shoulder they look like a little family together there did you ever think murphy would set his sights on a yank and such a fancy one no alice watched them her emotions mixed and muddled i didnt think it used to be i wondered if it would be one of tom concannons daughters for him but this i never expected kate glanced down to where her threeyearold was contentedly plucking at grass and checking its flavor you dont mind i havent decided yet shrugging off the mood alice bent and scooped up her grandson kevin grass isnt for eating unless youre a cow lets gather up the troops kate weve sunday dinner to cook hearing his name hailed murphy lifted a hand ive got to get along ill call for you later he passed liam back to her will you let me kiss you here kiss liam agreed and puckered up not you lad but murphy kissed him anyway before shifting up and letting his lips glide lightly over shannons till later yes she had to concentrate on not sighing like a schoolgirl when he walked off later want me to take your load there aunt shannon seeing the way was clear rogan stepped forward no ive got him looks as though he has you and it was a nice stroke of fate rogan thought to have the boy run interference for him i was hoping for a word with you would you come home with maggie and me wed be pleased to have you for tea as would liam tea liam lost interest in the mirror and bounced on shannons hip cake theres the bottom line rogan said with a chuckle just like his mother without waiting for her answer rogan took shannons elbow and began to steer her toward his car i should tell brie ive told her maggie he called out your boy wants tea and cake which boy maggie caught up with them just as shannon reached for the car door are you driving us shannon damn i do that nine times out of ten with liam in tow she rounded to the passenger side and bundled the boy in his car seat once a yank maggie commented and settled herself shannon only wrinkled her nose and entertained liam on the drive a short time later they were in the kitchen it was rogan shannon noted who brewed the tea you enjoyed the ceili he asked very much you left early with a wicked gleam in her eye maggie set out small slices of frosted cake shannon only lifted a brow and broke off a corner of a slice this is bries recipe she said after a sample tis bries cake be grateful very grateful rogan put in briannas too humane to let maggie poison us im an artist not a cook briannas far more than a cook shannon prepared to bristle shes an artist and it shows in every room of the inn well well amused and pleased maggie leaned back quick to jump in front of her arent you just as you do rogan said mildly as he brought pot to table brianna inspires loyalty the inns very welcoming isnt it expertly he smoothed feathers while he poured the tea i stayed there myself when i first came here to batter at margaret marys door the weather was filthy he remembered as was maggies temperament and the inn was a little island of peace and grace amid it all twas your temperament that was filthy as i remember maggie corrected he badgered me mercilessly she told shannon came here uninvited and unwanted and as you can see ive yet to rid myself of him tenacity has its rewards in an old habit he slid his hand over maggies our first rewards falling asleep in his tea he murmured maggie glanced over to see liam slackmouthed eyes closed head nodding with one hand fisted in cake hes a prize all right she chuckled as she rose to lift him from his high chair when he whined she patted his bottom and crooned there love you just need a bit of a lie down lets go see if your bears waiting for you i think he is hes waiting for liam to come shes a beautiful mother shannon said without thinking that surprises you yes she realized what shed said an instant too late and fumbled i didnt mean its not a problem it surprises her too she was resistant to the idea of having a family a great deal of that came from the fact that her childhood was difficult things mend in time even the oldest and rawest of wounds i dont know if shell ever be close to her mother but theyve made a bridge so the distance is spanned he set down his cup and smiled at her i wonder if youd come into the office for a moment or two your office here just through the next room he rose knowing manners would have her going with him hed wanted her on his own turf hed been in business long enough to know that home field advantage was a distinctive one and that the atmosphere of business suited some deals better than the informality of deals with meals with shannon hed already decided to make a cleave between business and family except when the nudge of family became useful curious shannon followed him into the living room and through an adjoining door on the threshold she stopped and stared with a combination of surprise and admiration they may have been in the middle of the country a stones throw away from grazing cows and clucking chickens but here was a professional work space worthy of any glossy highrise in any major city it was tastefully even elegantly decorated from the bokarra rug to the tiffany lamp to the gleaming antique mahogany desk maggie was in the rooma stunning fountain of sapphire glass rose halfway to the coffered ceiling a delicate tangle of shapes and colors sat alone on a marble column and made shannon think of briannas garden marching practically with style were the tools of the executivefax computer modem copier all sleek and high tech holy cow her grin started to spread as she moved in and skimmed her finger over the monitor of a topgrade pc i would never have guessed this was here thats the way maggie wanted it and i too rogan gestured to a chair this is home for a good part of the year but to keep it home i have to work i guess i thought you had an office at the gallery i do to establish the tone he wanted to set he sat behind his desk but we both have demanding careers and we both have a child when scheduling allows i can work here three days a week tending to liam in the mornings while maggies in her glass house it cant be easy for either of you juggling so much you make certain you only drop balls that are replaceable compromise is the only way i know to have all i thought wed talk about the other paintings youve done oh her brow creased ive done a couple more watercolors and another oil but ive seen the one of brianna he interrupted smoothly youve finished the one of the innthe back garden view yes i went out to the cliffs and did a seascape pretty typical i imagine i doubt that he smiled and made a quick note on a pad but well have a look youd have more in new york there are several in my apartment and of course the ones i brought back from columbus well arrange to have them shipped over but my manager at the new york gallery can take care of the detailsthe packing and so forth once you give me a list of inventory she made another attempt to speak and he rolled right over her weve only the one on display here in clare and i think well keep it that way until we have a more polished strategy in the meantime he opened his top drawer and drew out a neat stack of legalsize papers youll want to look over the contracts rogan i never agreed to contracts of course you havent his smile was easy his tone all reason you havent read them id be happy to go over the terms with you or i can recommend a lawyer im sure you have your own but youd want one locally she found a copy of the contracts dumped neatly in her hands i already have a job it doesnt seem to stop you from painting ill want my secretary to contact you in the next week or so for background the sort of color and information well need for a biography and press releases press releases she put a hand to her spinning head youll see in the contract that worldwide will take care of all publicity for you depending on your inventory in america we should be ready for a showing in october or possibly september a showing she left her supporting hand where it was and gaped at him you wanta showing she repeated numb in worldwide galleries id considered having it in dublin as wed had maggies first there but i think id prefer the gallery here in clare because of your connection here he tilted his head still smiling politely what do you think i dont think she mumbled i cant think rogan ive been to shows at worldwide i cant even conceive of having one there she asked herself that question again on the walk back to the inn then she changed gears and asked herself why why was she going along with this why was rogan pressuring her to go along yes she was talented she could see that for herself in her work and had been told by numerous art teachers over the years but art wasnt business and business had always come first agreeing to rogans deal meant inverting something shed pursued most of her lifeletting her art take the lead and allowing someone else to handle the details of business it was more than a little frightening certainly more than uncomfortable but she had agreed she reminded herself at least she hadnt refused outright and she could have shannon thought oh yes she recognized well the tactics rogan had used and used with bloodless skill he would be a difficult man to outmaneuver but she could have done so the fact was she hadnt really tried it was foolish she thought now a crazy complication how could she have a show in ireland in the fall when she would be three thousand miles away at her desk by then but is that really what you want she heard the little voice murmuring in her ear resenting it she hunched her shoulders and scowled down at the road as she walked you look mad as a hornet alice commented she was resting a hand on her sons front gate and smiled as shannons head shot up oh i was just with an effort she relaxed her shoulders i was going over a conversation and wondering why i lost the upper hand of it we always find a way to keep that upper hand in the replay alice tapped her finger to her temple then opened the gate wont you come in she pushed the gate wider when shannon hesitated my familys run off here and there and id like a bit of company you surprise me shannon stepped through and relatched the gate herself id think youd be desperate for a couple minutes of peace and quiet its as my mother used to sayyou have nothing but that when youre six feet under i was having a look at murphys front garden hes tending it well he tends everything well unsure of her moves or her position she followed alice back up onto the porch and settled in the rocker beside her that he does he does nothing unless he does it thoroughly and with care there were times when he was a lad and it seemed he would plod forever through one chore or another i might give him i would be set to snap at him and hed just look and smile at me and tell me he was figuring the best way about it that was all sounds like him where is he oh he and my husband are off in the back looking over some piece of machinery my colin loves pretending he knows something about farming and machinery and murphy loves letting him shannon smiled a little my fathers name was colin was it you lost him recently last year last summer and your mother this spring instinctively alice reached out to squeeze shannons hand its a burden that nothing but living lightens she began to rock again and so did shannon so that the silence was broken only by the creak of the chairs and the chatter of birds you enjoyed the ceili this time the question had a flush heating shannons cheeks yes ive never been to a party quite like it i miss having them since were in cork the citys no place for a ceili a real one your husbands a doctor there he is yes a fine doctor and ill tell you true when i moved there with him i thought id died and gone to heaven no more rising at dawn to see to cows no worrying if the crops would grow or the tractor run she smiled looking over the garden to the valley in the distance but parts of me miss it still even miss the worrying maybe youll move back when he retires no hes a city man my colin youd understand the lure of the city living in new york yes but she too was looking out over the valley the shimmer of green hills the living rise of them i like the crowds and the rush the noise it took me days to get used to the quiet here and the space murphys a man for space and for the feel of his own land under his feet shannon glanced back to see alice studying her i know i dont think ive ever met anyone as rooted and are you rooted shannon im comfortable in new york she said carefully we moved around a great deal when i was a child so i dont have the same kind of roots you mean alice nodded a mother worries about her children no matter how tall they grow i see murphys in love with you mrs brennan shannon lifted her hands let them fall what could she say youre thinking what does this woman want me to do how does she expect me to answer what wasnt even a question a hint of a smile played around alices mouth you dont know me anymore than i know you so i cant tell by looking into your eyes what your feelings are for my son or what youll do about them feelings there are thats plain but i know murphy youre not the woman i would have chosen for him but a man chooses for himself she glanced at shannon and laughed now ive insulted you no shannon said stiffly insulted you have a perfect right to speak your mind i do smiling still alice began to rock and would if i did or not but my meaning wasnt clear i thought for a time a short time it would be maggie for him as much as i love that girl it worried me fierce theyd have driven each other to murder within a year despite all common sense shannon felt a niggling tug of jealousy murphy and maggie oh nothing more than a passing thought and a little wondering between them then i thought it would be brianna ah now that i told myself was the wife for him shed make him a strong home murphy and brie shannon said between her teeth i guess he was making the rounds oh i imagine he made a few but not with brie he loved her as he loved maggie as he loves his sisters it was me planning in my head and wishing for him to be happy i worried you see because he was twentyfive and still showing no partiality for another of the girls hereabouts he was working the farm reading his books playing his music it was a family he needed id tell myself a woman beside him and children at his feet shannon moved her shoulders still irked by the images alice had conjured in her head twentyfive is young for a man to marry these days it is alice agreed in ireland men often wait years and years longer as they know once the vows are said theres no unsaying them divorce isnt a choice for us not by god and not by law but a mother wants her son fulfilled i took him aside this one day in his twentyfifth year and i sat him down and talked to him from my heart i told him how a man shouldnt live alone shouldnt work himself so hard and have no one to come home to of an evening i told him how the omalley girl had her eye on him and didnt he think she was a pretty thing alices smile had faded when she looked back at shannon again he agreed as she was but when i began to press him about thinking more deeply planning for the future taking a wife to complete his present he shook his head and took my hands in his and looked at me that way he has ma he said nell omalley isnt for me i know who is ive seen who is alices eyes grew dark with an emotion shannon couldnt understand i was pleased and i asked him who she was he told me he hadnt yet to meet her not in the flesh but he knew her just the same as hed seen her in his dreams since he was a boy he was only waiting for her to come shannon swallowed on a dry throat and managed to keep her voice level murphy has a tendency toward the romantic he does but i know when my boy is having a fancy and when he means just what he says he was speaking no more than the truth to me and he spoke nothing more than the truth when he called me a short time ago to tell me that shed come its not like that it cant be like that its hard to judge what can and cant be in the heart youre holding his shannon bodine the only thing ill ask of you is to take care great care with it if you find you cant keep it or dont want it after all hand it back to him gently i dont want to hurt him oh child i know that hed never choose a woman with meanness in her im sorry to have made you sad shannon only shook her head you needed to say it im sure i needed to hear it ill straighten things out darling with something close to a chuckle alice leaned forward again to take shannons hand you may try but hell tangle them up again you mustnt think i said all of this to put the burden on your shoulders alone its shared between you equal what happens between you joy or sorrow will be caused by both of you if your mother was here shed be telling murphy to take care with you she might the tension in shannons fingers relaxed a little yes she might hes lucky to have you mrs brennan and so i remind him often come now lets see if my daughters have finished cooking the lamb for dinner i should get back alice rose drawing shannon with her youll have your sunday meal with us surely murphyll want you so do i she opened the front door stepped back and welcomed shannon inside chapter eighteen as much as murphy enjoyed seeing shannon with his family dangling one of his nieces on her knee laughing over something kate said listening intently to his nephew explain about carburetors he wanted her alone it seemed the family he loved so well was conspiring to keep him from fulfilling that one simple and vital wish he mentioned very casually that it was a lovely night for a drive and he thought shannon would enjoy it whatever response she might have made was drowned out by his sisters chattering to shannon about fashions a patient man he waited a time then tried again suggesting a trip to the pubwhere he was sure he could slip shannon out in a wink but his stepfather pulled him aside and began to drill him on the workings of the new combine when the sun set and the moon began its rise he found himself dragooned into a game of uncle wiggly with some of the children while shannon was across the room having an intent discussion with his teenage niece about american music he saw his first clear shot when the children were being bundled up for bed moving fast he grabbed shannons hand well go put the kettle on for tea without breaking stride he pulled her toward the kitchen through it and out the back door the kettle the devil take the kettle he muttered and whirled her into his arms beside the coop where the hens brooded he kissed her as though his life depended on it i never noticed how many people there are in my family twentythree she murmured sliding into the next kiss twentyfour with you i counted and one of thems bound to be poking out the kitchen window any second come on were making a break for it he pulled her past paddock and pen and up the first rise until she was breathless and laughing murphy slow down theyre not going to set the dogs on us if we had dogs they might but he shortened his stride a little i want you alone do you mind no as a matter of fact ive been waiting for a chance to talk to you well talk all you like he promised after i show you what ive been thinking about doing to you all day and half the night heat balled a solid steaming weight in her stomach we should talk first we havent really set up the guidelines its important we both understand well where we stand before we get any deeper into this guidelines the word made him smile i think i can find my way without them im not talking about the physical aspect a thought intruded and turned her voice cool and casual you didnt ever have a physical aspect with maggie did you his first reaction was to roar with laughter but a twist of mischief made him hum in consideration well now that you mention it he let the sentence trail off as he pulled shannon into the stone circle she was abruptly far from cool and batted his hands away as he tugged off her jacket now that i mention it she repeated with steel in her voice we had a bit of an aspect he said ignoring her shoving hands as he worked at the buttons of her blouse i kissed her once in a bit more than what you might be calling a brotherly fashion he grinned into shannons eyes it was curious and it was sweet i was fifteen if memory serves oh the greeneyed monster was dwarfed by foolishness i managed to sneak one in on brie too but we ended up laughing at each other while our lips were still locked it took the romance right out of it oh she said again and pouted and that was it you neednt worry i never crossed any borders with either of your sisters so his tongue dried up as he slid her blouse aside she wore silk beneath tonight dark dangerous silk that dipped low and provocative at the curve of her breasts then draped down to shimmer beneath the waistband of her skirt i want to see the rest he managed and tugged down the zipper a breeze teased her hair as she stood in the shifting moonlight shed worn it for him had chosen it from her drawer that morning with the image in her mind of his face as he saw her in it it was a short deliberate seduction of silk and lace that clung to curves dazzled by it he skimmed a hand up her thigh and felt the tip of her stocking give way to warm flesh and his mouth watered its gods grace i didnt know what you had on under that little suit his voice was thick and ragged at the edges id never have made it through mass shed wanted to talk to him needed to but common sense was no defense against the hot spurt of lust she reached out tugged the sweater over his head i knew what was under here you cant imagine what i was thinking of during the offertory his laugh was weak well both do penance for it later he nudged a strap from her shoulder then the other so that the bodice shifted tenuously clung the goddess that guards the holy ground he murmured and the witch who came after his words made her shiver with fear and excitement im a woman murphy just a woman standing here wanting you more than eager she stepped forward into his arms show me show me what you thought about doing to me she crushed her mouth to his unbearably hungry then do more he could have eaten her alive consumed her inch by inch then howled at the moon like a rabid wolf so he showed her savaging her mouth letting his hands roam as urgently as they pleased the sounds in her throat grew stronger more feral he felt her teeth nip and tug at his lip took his own to her throat to devour the curving length of satin skin she was already wet when he cupped her if he drove her up ruthlessly if her moan shivered into something closer to a scream he was too far over the line to stop himself her legs simply buckled she felt herself falling felt the cushion of his body under her own then the weight of it as he rolled his mouth was everywhere gloriously suckling through silk then under it his hands were uncannily quick slicking here gripping there hers were no less urgent seeking flesh finding exploiting she tore and tugged at the button of his trousers muttering promises and pleas while they wrestled over the blanket gasping for breath she straddled him then in a move so lightning quick it staggered his senses took him deep while the stunning violent glory of it streamed through him he watched her bow back her body was sinuous and sleek her hair a rainfall of silk her face a carving of sheer triumph and carnal pleasures spellbound he reached out found her breasts watched his hands close over them he felt the weight the hot press of her nipples the wild thunder of her heart his he thought dimly while his body shuddered with unbearable need this time for all times his she began to rock slowly at first like a dance clouds shifted over and around and passed the moon so that her face was shuttered then revealed then shuttered again like a dream he couldnt quite capture the blood began to rage in his loins in his head so that he was sure it would explode and leave nothing but shattered bones he saw her arms lift rise witchlike toward the sky her movements quickened and he began to murmur to her the words desperate and gaelic it seemed she answered him with the same urgency in the same tongue then his mind hazed and his body erupted emptying him into her on a long shuddering moan she slid down to him visions danced in her head faded she must have slept for she awakened with her heart beating slow and thick and her skin shivering warm even as he cupped her breast her lips curved and welcomed his his touch was gentle now almost worshipful so she sighed and enjoyed and let her body be stroked tenderly back to arousal she opened for him felt him fill her delighting in the two sides of him she matched his leisurely pace until the last ember of need quieted later she lay beside him cozy in the blanket hed drawn over them darling he stroked her hair we cant sleep here tonight she felt his muscles jerk when she ran her hand low over his belly we dont have to sleep i mean we cant stay out here he turned his head for the simple pleasure of burying his nose in her hair its going to rain it is she opened one eye and looked up at the sky where did the stars go behind the clouds and theres rain coming soon hmm what time is it ive lost track wheres my watch you werent wearing one i wasnt in reflex she felt her wrist odd she never took a step without her watch never used to we dont need a watch to know its time i got you under roof with regret he tossed the blanket aside maybe youd ask me in for tea so i could spend a little more time looking at you she pulled the chemise over her head we could have tea in my room id feel as uncomfortable about that as i would taking you to mine while my familys in the house he watched her smooth on her stockings will you be after wearing something like that again she tossed back her hair as she buttoned her blouse i assume youre not talking about the suit no darling the under it i dont have much along these lines but ill see what i can do she rose to tug on her skirt maybe i can pick up a couple of things in dublin dublin are you going to dublin tuesday she shrugged into her jacket then took his outstretched hand somehow and im not entirely sure how it happened im going with rogan ah youve settled the contact then i havent even read the contract but apparently i have an appointment on wednesday to have publicity photos taken plus im supposed to give him a list of my inventory as he calls my paintings back in new york he seems to think im having a show in the fall thats grand delighted for her he swung her off her feet to kiss her why didnt you tell me before wed have celebrated if wed celebrated any more i dont think wed be alive to talk about it when he laughed she tucked her arm through his his unhesitating pleasure for her even though she was unsure of her own reactions touched deep in any case i dont know if celebrating is called for i havent signedthough the way rogan talks its a done deal you can trust him if thats whats worrying at you no not at all worldwides reputation is top notch and beyond that id trust rogan absolutely its a big decision for me and i like to make even small decisions after careful thought but youre going to dublin he pointed out that one got away from me one minute we were talking about maggie and liam and the next i had contracts in my hand and talk about shows and publicity ringing in my ears hes the cleverest of fellows is rogan murphy said admiringly ill miss you shannon will you be gone long i should be back thursday or friday from what he said they were nearly back at the inn when the first drops of rain fell i really wanted to talk to you murphy so you said guidelines was it yes theyll keep he nodded toward the window bries in the kitchen id like to come in but we wont be alone and i cant stay long theyll keep she agreed on tuesday morning shannon was packed and ready and wondering what shed gotten herself into shed wondered that quite a bit since coming to ireland she realized it seemed that every adjustment she made or considered making in her life required another still the idea of spending a few days in dublin wasnt a hardship it had been weeks since shed been in anything remotely resembling a city youve an umbrella brianna asked hovering over the bag shannon had set by the front door of the inn and an extra jacket in case the weather turns yes mom flushing a little brianna shifted the baby on her shoulder it drives maggie mad when i check her packing graysons given up and lets me do it for him believe me im an expert and its only for a couple of days heres rogans car now have a wonderful time brianna would have taken the bag herself if shannon hadnt beat her to it the dublin house is lovely youll see and rogans cook is a magician he says the same of you rogan commented as he stepped up to take shannons bag he gave brianna and kayla a kiss before stowing the suitcase dont forget to take your vitamins brianna told maggie then leaned into the car to kiss her and liam goodbye i didnt realize you were coming maggie nor did she know how she felt about it turning she gave brianna a quick embrace and kissed kayla on the tip of her nose fly safe brianna jiggled the baby watching the car until it was out of sight it was a short trip to the airport under leaden skies and drizzling rain shannon thought back to the day she had landed at the airport that shared her name shed been all nerves and repressed anger most of the anger had faded she realized but the nerves were still there jumping now as she considered what this short trip would change in her life there was little fuss on their arrival shannon decided rogan was a man who tolerated none when it came to business in short order they were seated on his private plane with liam bouncing at the window pointing out every truck or cart that came into view hes a traveling man is liam maggie settled back hoping theyd be airborne soon so that she could have a cup of tea shed been suffering a great deal more morning queasiness with this pregnancy than she had with her first and she didnt care for it its wonderful he can have the experience shannon commented i always appreciated it you did a lot of traveling with your parents rogan slipped a hand over maggies wishing every bit as strongly as she that the morning sickness would run its course my fathers favorite hobby one of my earliest memories is of arriving at the airport in rome the rush and the voices and the color of it i guess i was about five the plane began to taxi and liam hooted with delight he likes this part best maggie kept a smile glued to her face as the takeoff roiled her stomach damn damn damn she thought she would not throw up the pitiful dry toast shed choked down for breakfast me too shannon leaned over pressing her cheek to liams so they could share the excitement together there it goes liam were up with the birds birds bye byebye bye shannon sighed a little murphy was down there they hadnt had their full night together as theyd hoped between the trip and the rain and a horse with a split hoof theyd barely had an hour alone and time was running out she was going to have to think of that very soon new york wouldnt wait forever bloody hell as shannon looked back surprised maggie tore off her seat belt and bolted out of the cabin the lavatory door slammed behind her bloody hell liam repeated diction for once nearly perfect is she airsick shannon reached for her own belt wondering what if anything she should do morning sick rogan cast a troubled look toward the closed door its plaguing her this time should i go see if i can help or anything it only makes her madder when you try feeling helpless rogan moved his shoulders with liam she had a couple days of queasiness and that was the end of it shes more insulted than anything else that shes not sailing so easily through this one i suppose every pregnancy is different so were discovering shell want tea he said and started to rise ill make it really she got up quickly touched a hand to his shoulder dont worry she likes it brutally strong i know shannon went into the narrow galley the plane was very much like its owner she decided sleek efficient elegant and organized she found several different types of tea and considering maggies condition went for the chamomile she stopped what she was doing to look around when the door to the lavoratory opened steadier aye but maggies voice was grim somewhat like a warrior whod just survived another bloody battle that ought to do it for today go sit down shannon ordered youre still white a sight better than green maggie sniffed eyed the pot youre making flowers its good for you here she handed maggie a box of crackers shed found in a cabinet go sit down margaret mary and nibble on these too weak to argue maggie went back to her seat im sorry rogan murmured slipping an arm around her dont expect me to say its not your fault but she snuggled her head against him and smiled over at liam who was busy deciding whether he would draw with or eat the crayon his father had given him do you know what im thinking rogan what are you thinking margaret mary that i strolled through the worlds easiest pregnancy with that little demon there she aimed a steely look when liam lifted the crayon toward his mouth he grinned and began to attack the coloring book with it instead could be this ones a bit less comfortable because were going to have a sweettempered biddable child wholl never cause mischief hmmm he eyed his son and managed to grab the fat crayon before liam could draw on the wall of the plane the boy howled in protest and shoved the coloring book to the floor is that what youd like maggie laughed as liams temper rolled through the cabin not on your life brianna had spoken no less than the truth the dublin house was lovely tucked behind graceful trees and gardens it had a beautiful view of the green the furnishings were old with both the distinction and the elegance wealth could buy chandeliers dripped floors gleamed and servants moved with quick and silent efficiency shannon was given a room with a welcoming fourposter bed a muted aubusson and a stunning okeefe shed no more than freshened up in the bath before a maid had tidily unpacked her bag and set her toiletries on the chippendale bureau she found maggie waiting for her in the main parlor downstairs theyll be bringing a light meal in maggie told her i tend to be starving this time of day after my morning bout im glad youre feeling better god shannons eyes widened as they fixed on the sculpture dominating one side of the room mesmerized she walked toward it her fingers unable to resist one long stroke of the glass it was magnificent erotic and nearly human in its sinuous limbs and melting features she could almost see the man and woman fused together in absolute fulfillment do you like it maggies voice might have been casual but she couldnt prevent the quick spurt of pleasure at shannons dazzled reaction its incredible surrender i called it yes of course you could make this she murmured in wonder something like this in that little place in the country why not a real artist doesnt need fancy digs ah heres the food bless you noreen maggie was already involved in a chicken sandwich when shannon came over to join her wheres liam oh one of the maids has a crush on him shes whisked him off to the nursery to make him hot chocolate and spoil him better have one of these before i eat them all taking her at word shannon chose one of the little sandwiches this is a magnificent house its lovely to be sure but never empty having servants about still makes me twitchy she shrugged theres no doubt well need help after the new baby comes ill have to lock myself in the glass house for any privacy most people would be thrilled to be able to have housekeepers and cooks im not most people maggie bit off more chicken but im learning to live with it rogans on the phone she added hes mad for phones theres business at the paris branch he should be seeing to in person but he wont leave while im having this problem in the mornings doesnt even help to shout at him when the mans dug in his heels you cant budge him with a brick she moved on to the pasta curls and gave shannon a speculative look his minds set on having you well mines not set entirely first im going to tell you that when the man came after me i had no intention of being managed by anyone at all he has a way rogan does of seeing right into you finding those weaknesses and prides and secrets youd just as soon keep to yourself then he uses them with charm with ruthlessness with logic and with such organized planning that hes always one step ahead ive noticed he got me here when i had every intention of telling him thanks but no thanks its not just a business with him hed be easier to resist if it was he has a great love and affection for art and for the artist and what hes done in clare the pride for him came into her voice into her eyes hes made something important there for art for ireland hes done it because hes tied by his heart to both hes a very special man personally and professionally you dont have to know him long to see that no you dont so second maggie dusted her fingers with a napkin im going to ask what the hells wrong with you shannons brows shot up excuse me why the devil are you dragging your heels on this the mans offering you the moon and half the stars an artist dreams about the chance of having what youve got right in your hands and you keep bobbling it bobbling is not what im doing shannon corrected coolly considering is what do you have to consider at this point you have the paintings youll do more its the doing more im considering maggie gave a snort and forked up more pasta what nonsense you can sit there and tell me you could stop just set your brushes aside and leave your canvas blank when i get back to new york i wont be free to indulge myself as i have here indulge maggie set her fork down with a clatter and leaned forward you have some warped idea in your head that your painting is an indulgence my position at rytilghmanton oh fuck that is important to me shannon finished between her teeth and my responsibilities there leave me little time to paint for pleasuremuch less to paint for someone who youll agree is a demanding manager what of your responsibilities to yourself and your talent do you think you have the right to toss away what youve been given the very idea of it was an abomination in maggies mind and heart ive only seen your paintings of ireland but they show you have more than a good eye and a competent hand youve got a heart that sees and understands youve no right to toss that away so you can draw bottles of water youve been doing your homework shannon said quietly i have a right to do what works for me what satisfies me and thats just what ill do if rogan asked you to work on me youll not blame him because i speak my own mind they rose together boxers meeting in the center of the mat he asked me only to come along so youd have company when he was occupied im sure he thought that was considerate now get this straight this transaction however it works out isnt your concern its between me and rogan transaction on a sound of disgust maggie dropped back into her chair again you even talk more like a businesswoman than an artist shannon jerked up her chin and looked down her nose that fails to insult me now if youll excuse me i think ill go out and get some air chapter nineteen she was not going to let it get to her shannon promised herself that maggies opinionated outofline attitude was not going to sway her in any way or put a shadow over her visit to dublin the evening at least was companionable and pleasant thanks in shannons opinion to rogans flawless manners and hospitality not once through dinner or the easy evening that followed did he mention the contract or the plans he had in the making which she supposed was why she was so off guard the following morning when he escorted her into his library directly after theyd shared a quiet breakfast he shot straight from the hip you have an eleven oclock appointment with the photographer he told her the moment they were seated theyll tend to your hair and makeup so you neednt worry about it i had in mind something on the elegant side but not strictly formal jack thats the photographer will know what to do with you yes but now maggies having a bit of a liein this morning but shed like to go with you liam will stay here so you can have some time for the two of you to do some shopping or for maggie to show you around dublin that would be nice shannon drew a breath she shouldnt have im hoping youll come by the gallery have a tour you said youd been to our branch in new york yes and i think youll see we try to create different moods in different cities in order to reflect the ambience im going to be tied up a great deal of the day he glanced briefly at his watch starting almost immediately but id appreciate it if youd find a moment to come by the office maggie can bring you in about three we can go over whatever changes youd like in the contracts stop she held up both hands unsure if she wanted to scream or to laugh youre doing it again im sorry whats that oh dont apologize or look politely bemused you know exactly what youre doing youre the most elegant steamroller ive ever been flattened by he flashed a grin that had her shaking her head and thatthat quick charming smile is lethal i can see how even someone as stubborn as maggie crumbled that she didnt i had to batter away at her bit by bit and youre much more like her than you might like me to point out he smothered a fresh grin when shannons eyes flashed yes much more like her insulting me is not the way to win me over then let me say this he folded his hands on the desk as your brotherinlaw as much as the man who hopes to push forward your career you didnt come here because i outflanked you shannon thats part of it yes that pushed you to move when i pushed you to move but what ive done is plant an idea in your head all right you have its an idea i toyed with years ago and dismissed an impractical youre trying to convince me now that its not intrigued he leaned back and studied her is it money i have money more actually than i need my father was very good at making it she shook her head no its not money though its important to me to make my own to have the satisfaction of that i need security and stability and challenges i suppose that sounds contradictory not at all seeing he understood she continued the painting ive done on my own for myself has always been a habit a kind of obligation evensomething i worked into my schedule like well like an appointment with myself and youre hesitating on making it a focus yes i am ive done better work here than i have ever in my life and it pulls me in a direction i never seriously considered taking and now that shed said it she was more confused than ever but what happens when i go back to new york rogan pick up the life i left behind there if i sign a contract id have given you my word how can i do that when i cant be sure ill be able to keep it your integritys warring with your impulses he said putting his finger straight to the pulse and thats a difficult thing why dont we oblige them both how do you propose to manage that your contract with worldwide will encompass the work youve done in ireland and what you have ready in new yorkwith an option he continued running a pen through his fingers for a first look at what you may produce over the next two years whether its one piece or a dozen thats quite a compromise she murmured but you wanted a show i dont know if ive enough for that or if what i have will suit you were flexible on the size of a showing and ill let you know what doesnt suit me she met his eyes i bet you will later when hed gone shannon wandered back upstairs hed given her a great deal to think over somehow hed managed to open a door without forcing her to close another she could accept his terms and go back to her life without missing a beat she found it odd and more confusing than ever that she wished he had pressed her into a corner where shed be forced to make one clearcut choice but there wasnt time to brood on itnot if she wanted to see anything of the city before the photo shoot a photo shoot she thought chuckling to herself imagine that she wiped the smile away and knocked briskly on maggies bedroom door maggie rogan said to wake you hearing no response shannon rolled her eyes and knocked again its past nine margaret mary even pregnant women have to get out of bed sometime impatient shannon turned the knob and eased the door open she could see the bed was empty and thinking maggie might be dressing and ignoring her she pushed the door wider as she started to call out again she heard the unmistakable sounds of wretched illness from the adjoining bath it didnt occur to her to hesitate she simply hurried through to where maggie was heaving over the toilet get out damn you maggie waved a limp hand and fought the next wave of nausea cant a woman retch in private saying nothing shannon walked to the sink and dampened a thick washcloth with cool water maggie was too busy heaving to resist when shannon held the back of her head and pressed the cloth to her clammy brow poor baby shannon murmured when maggie sagged weakly horrible way to start the morning just rest a minute get your breath back im all right go away im all right sure you are can you handle some water without waiting for an answer shannon walked over to fill a glass then came back to crouch and ease it to maggies lips there you go nice slow sips it probably tastes like you swallowed a sewer this child best be a saint because it was there maggie leaned against shannons shoulder have you seen your doctor to soothe shannon took the cloth and ran it gently over maggies face isnt there something you can take ive seen the doctor bloody swine a couple more weeks he says and ill be right as rain couple more weeks she repeated shutting her eyes i nearly murdered him on the spot no jury in the worldif they were womenwould convict you here come on lets get you on your feet the floors cold too weak to argue maggie let herself be helped up and guided in toward the bed not the bed i dont need the bed i just want to sit a minute all right shannon led her to a chair want some tea oh desperately relieved the spell was over maggie let her head fall back and closed her eyes i would if you could call on the phone there down to the kitchen and ask if theyd mind sending some up and some toastdry id be grateful she sat still while her system leveled off and the chill faded from her skin well she said when shannon replaced the receiver that was pleasant for both of us a lot worse for you not quite sure maggie should be left alone yet shannon sat on the edge of the bed it was kind of you to help me through it i appreciate it it didnt sound that way when you were swearing at me a grin twisted maggies mouth ill apologize for that i hate being she gestured out of control of things me too you know ive only been drunk once in my whole life once the smile turned into a sneer and you irish as the rings of kerry nevertheless while it had its liberating aspects i found on hindsight that it was debilitating i couldnt quite hit the control button and there was the added delight of being sick as a dog on the side of the road on the way home and the wonder and glory of the morning after so i find it more practical to limit my intake one warms the soul two warms the brain da always said that so he had his practical side as well a narrow one you have his eyes she watched shannon lower them and struggled against her own sense of loss and impatience im sorry you mind hearing it and so shannon discovered was she both my mother and father had blue eyes i remember asking her once where she thought id gotten my green ones she looked so sad for just an instant then she smiled and said an angel gave them to me hed have liked that and hed have been glad and grateful that she found a man like your father must have been to love both of you she looked over as the tea was brought in theres two cups she said when shannon rose to go if youd like to have one with me all right would it bother you to tell me how they metyour parents no shannon took her seat again and discovered it far from bothered her to tell the story it warmed her when maggie burst into laughter at the idea of colin knocking amanda into the mud shannon joined her id like to have met them maggie said at length i think they would have liked meeting you a little embarrassed by the sentiment shannon rose listen if youd like to just kick back and rest i can take a cab to the photographer im fine now id like to go with youand see jack torture you the way he did me when rogan put me through this last thanks my pleasure and she set the tray aside and rose i think id enjoy spending some time with you i think id enjoy that too shannon smiled ill wait for you downstairs she loved dublin she loved the waterways the bridges the buildings the crowds and oh she loved the shops though she was impatient to do more see more shannon held herself back and indulged maggie in an enormous midday meal unlike her volatile sister shannon hadnt found the photography shoot anything but a pleasant interesting experience when shed pointed that out maggie had simply shuddered when they left the restaurant shannon calculated that theyd broken a record of being in each others company without harsh words or snide remarks she was soon to discover that she shared at least one trait with maggie the woman was a champion shopper zipping from store to store measuring considering and buying without all the wavering and wobbling that annoyed shannon in many of her friends no maggie shook her head as shannon held up a biscuitcolored sweater you need color not neutrals i like it pouting a little shannon turned toward a mirror spreading the sweater up to her neck the materials gorgeous it is and the color makes you look like a weekold corpse damn it with a half laugh shannon folded the sweater again it does you want this one maggie handed her one in mossy green she stepped behind shannon narrowing her eyes at their reflections definitely youre right i hate when youre right she draped the sweater over her arm and fingered the sleeve of the blouse maggie had over hers are you buying that why because im having it if youre not well i am smug maggie gathered up her bags and went to pay for it youd probably have put it back if i hadnt said i wanted it shannon complained as they left the shop no but it certainly adds to the satisfaction of the purchase theres a cookery shop nearby i want to pick up some things for brie fine still sulking over the blouse shannon fell into step whats that a music store maggie said dryly when shannon stopped to stare at a display window i know that whats that a dulcimer hammer dulcimer it looks more like a piece of art than an instrument its both thats a lovely one too murphy made one a few years back just as fine a beautiful tone it had his sister maureen fell in love with it and he gave it to her that sounds just like him do you think hed like it one someone else made maggie lifted her brow you could give him wind in a paper bag and hed treasure it but shannon had already made her decision and was marching into the shop delighted shannon watched the clerk take the dulcimer out of the window then listened as he gave her a skillful demonstration of the music it could make i can see him playing it cant you shannon asked maggie with that half smile on his face i can maggie waited until the happy clerk went in the back to find the right box for transport so youre in love with him stalling shannon reached in her purse for her wallet a woman can buy a gift for a man without being in love with him not with that look in her eyes she cant what are you going to do about it theres nothing i can do shannon caught herself frowned and selected her credit card im thinking it over hes not a man to take love casually or temporarily the words and the knowledge that they were fact frightened her dont push me on this maggie rather than the snap shed hoped for there was a plea in shannons voice its complicated and im doing the best i know how to do her eyes lifted in surprise when maggie laid a hand on her cheek its hard isnt it to fall where youve never been and never really thought youd be yes its terribly hard maggie let her hand slide down and rest on shannons shoulder well she said in a lighter tone hes going to trip over his tongue when you hand him this wheres the bloody clerk roganll skin me if i dont have you there at three on the damn dot yeah you look like youre terrified of him sometimes i let him think i am its a kiss on the ego so to speak shannon toyed with a display of harmonicas on the counter you havent asked me if im going to sign its been pointed out that its business not concerning me shannon gave a smile and her credit card to the clerk when he returned is that a kiss on my ego margaret mary be grateful its not a boot to your ass im signing shannon blurted out i dont know if i decided just this instant or the moment he asked but im doing it swallowing hard she pressed a shaky hand to her stomach now im queasy i had a similar reaction under the same circumstances youve just put your wheel in someone elses hands sympathetic she slipped an arm around shannons waist hell do right by you i know im not sure if ill do right by him she watched the clerk box up the dulcimer its a problem i seem to be having just lately with men ive come to care about i tell you how were handling this one shannon were going to rogans fine upstanding office and getting the business part over and done quick thats the worst part of it i can tell you okay she took the pen the clerk offered mechanically signed her name to the credit slip then were going back home and cracking open a bottle of sweeneys best champagne you cant drink youre pregnant youre doing the drinking a whole bottle of french bubbly just for you cause darling im of the opinion that youre going to get drunk for the second time in your life shannon blew out a breath that fluttered her bangs you could be right maggie couldnt have been more right a few hours later shannon found that all the doubts and worries and questions simply fizzed away with a bottle of dom perignon maggie was the overindulgers friend listening as shannon rambled making sympathetic noises as she complained and laughing at the poorest of jokes when rogan arrived home shannon was sitting dreamyeyed in the parlor contemplating the last glass that could be squeezed from the bottle what have you done to her margaret mary shes well fuddled satisfied maggie lifted her mouth for his kiss he lifted a brow at the empty bottle small wonder she needed to relax maggie said airily and to celebrate though youd never be able to tell her so youre feeling fine arent you shannon fine and dandy she smiled brilliantly hello rogan when did you get here they warned me about you yknow she went on before he could answer did they they certainly did rogan sweeneys slick as spit she tipped the glass back again swallowed hastily and you are take it as a compliment darling maggie advised thats how its meant oh it is shannon agreed theres not one shark in new york who could outswim you and youre so pretty too she hoisted herself up chuckling when her head revolved when he would have taken her arm to steady her she simply leaned in and gave him a loud smacking kiss ive got such cute brothers dont i maggie just as cute as buttons darling men maggies grin was wide and wicked both of them would you like a little nap now shannon nope beaming shannon snatched up her glass look theres more ill just take it with me while i make a call i need to make a call a private call if you dont mind and who are you after calling maggie asked im after calling mr murphy muldoon in county clare ireland ill just come along maggie suggested and dial the number for you im perfectly capable i have his number right in my trusty little electronic organizer i never go anywhere without it with the glass dangling dangerously from her hand she looked around the room whered it go no up and coming professional can survive without their organizer im sure its about with a wink for rogan maggie took shannons arm and led her away but it happens i have the number right in my head youre so clever maggie i noticed that about you right awayeven when i wanted to punch you thats nice

rogans is lovely too i can promise you it is here you talk into this end and listen in this one i know how to use a phone im a professional murphy i havent finished calling yet im an amateur thats all right its ringing now theres murphy hi murphy she cradled the phone like a lover and didnt notice when maggie slipped out shannon im glad you called i was thinking of you im always thinking of you its the damnedest thing you sound a bit strange are you all right im wonderful i love you murphy what his voice rose half an octave what im so buzzed youre what shannon go back two steps and start again the last time i was a freshman in college and it was homecoming and there was all this wine oceans of it i got so awful sick too but i dont feel sick at all this time i just feel she sent the chair spinning and nearly strangled herself with the phone cord alive christ what has maggie done to you he muttered are you drunk i think so to test she held up two fingers in front of her face pretty sure i wish you were here murphy right here so i could crawl in your lap and nibble you all over there was a moment of pained silence that would be memorable he said in a voice tight with strain shannon you said you loved me you know i do its all mixed up with white horses and copper broaches and thunderstorms and making love in the dance and cursing at the moon she let her head fall back in the chair as the visions flowed and circled in her head casting spells she murmured winning battles i dont know what to do i cant think about it well talk it through when you get back shannon have you called me from across the entire country drunk onwhat are you drunk on champagne rogans finest french champagne figures drunk on champagne he repeated to tell me for the first time that you love me it seemed like a good idea at the time you have a wonderful voice she kept her heavy eyes closed i could listen to it forever i bought you a present thats nice tell me again i bought you a present at his frustrated snarl she opened her eyes and laughed oh i get it im not stupid suma cum laude you know i love you murphy and it really messes things up all around but i love you good night shannon but she was aiming for the phone with one eye closed through more luck than skill she managed to jiggle the receiver in place then she leaned back yawned once and went to sleep chapter twenty and the next morning not a stagger not a wince while she sipped tea in briannas kitchen maggie shot shannon an admiring glance i couldnt have been more proud you have an odd sense of pride but shannon felt an odd flare of it herself through luck or gods pity shed escaped the punishment of a hangover after her romance with dom perignon twentyfour hours after the affair had ended she was safely back in clare and enjoying the questionable distinction of having a hard head you shouldnt have let her overdo brianna began to swirl a rich and smooth marshmallow frosting over chocolate cake shes a woman grown maggie objected and the youngest oh really shannon rolled her eyes at briannas back i hardly think thats an issue you and i were born in the same year so she trailed off as the full impact of what shed said struck her brows knit and she stared down at a spot on the table well she thought this is awkward busy year for da maggie said after a long silence shocked shannon looked up quickly and met maggies bland eyes the sound of her own muffled snort of laughter surprised her nearly as much as maggies lightning grin brianna continued to frost her cake an entire bottle maggie brianna went on in a quiet lecturing tone you should have had more care well i looked after her didnt i after shed passed out in the library i didnt pass out shannon corrected primly i was resting unconscious maggie reached over to pick up her niece when kayla began to fuss in her carrier and poor murphy ringing back like a man possessed who talked him out of hopping in his lorry and driving all the way to dublin if it wasnt me she asked kayla and didnt i take her upstairs and see that she ate a bowl of soup before she slept the rest of it off her ears pricked up theres liam awake she passed the baby to shannon then went through to briannas bedroom where shed laid him down for a nap brianna stepped back to judge the frosting job before she turned other than last evening did you enjoy your trip to dublin yes its a lovely city and the gallery thereits a religious experience ive thought so myself youve yet to see the one here in clare i was hoping we could all go a kind of outing soon id like that brianna she wasnt sure she was ready to ask far less sure she was ready for the consequences is something troubling you i thinkid like to see the letters she said it quickly before her courage evaporated the letters my mother wrote of course brianna laid a hand support and comfort on shannons shoulder ive kept them in my dresser why dont you come into the family parlor and you can read them but before shannon could rise there was a commotion in the hall voices fussed and clashed causing the hand on shannons shoulder to tense once briefly its mother she murmured and lottie its all right not at all sure if she was disappointed or relieved shannon patted briannas hand ill look at them later she braced for whatever form the confrontation would take maeve swept in first still arguing i tell you ill not ask if youve no pride yourself i cant stop you from it she caught sight of shannon holding her granddaughter and lifted her chin well youre very much to home i see yes i am brianna makes it impossible to be otherwise hello mrs sullivan oh lottie dear you just call me lottie like everyone and hows my angel today she bent over kayla cooing look here maeve shes smiling why shouldnt she shes being spoiled right and left briannas an incredibly loving mother shannon shot back before she could stop herself maeve merely sniffed the baby cant so much as whimper that someones not snatching her up including you lottie put in oh brie what a lovely cake resigned that shed have to bake another now for her guests dessert brianna took out a knife sit down wont you and have a piece liam shot out of the adjoining door five paces ahead of his mother cake he shouted got radar that boy has however gruff her voice maeves eyes lit up at the sight of him theres a likely lad he beamed at her sensing an ally and lifted his arms kiss come sit on my lap maeve ordered and youll have both the cake and the kiss hes a bit flushed margaret mary hes just up from his nap are you cutting that cake then brie you should have more care with your diet now that youre breeding again maeve told her the doctor says youve the morning sickness this time around it was a tossup as to who was more shocked by the statement maeve or maggie already wishing the words back maeve began to feed her grandson bits of cake its nothing shes sick as a dog every morning shannon corrected looking directly at maeve maggie you told me it was passing there was accusation twined with the concern in briannas voice furious and embarrassed maggie glared at shannon its nothing she repeated never could bear a weakness maeves caustic comment had the fury leaping before maggie could spew shannon nodded in agreement she snaps like a terrier when you try to help her through it its hard dont you think mrs concannon for a strong woman to need help and one like maggie whos figured out how to handle a family and a demanding career to lose her stomach and her control every morning its lowering i was sick every morning for more than three months carrying her maeve said crisply a woman learns to get through such thingsas a man never could no theyd just whine about it neither of my daughters were whiners ever scowling again maeve looked over at brianna are you going to stand there holding that pot of tea all day brianna or are you going to pour it out oh she managed to lift the jaw that had dropped and serve the tea sorry thank you darling delighted with the way things were going lottie beamed for more than two years shed been nudging and tugging maeve toward even a shaky bridge with her daughters now it looked as though the span was narrowing you know maggie maeve and i were just looking through the snapshots from our trip to your home in france no more pride than a beggar maeve muttered but lottie just smiled they reminded us both what a lovely time we had there its the south of france she told shannon the house is like a palace and looks right out over the sea and sits there empty month after month maeve grumbled empty but for servants maggie started to snarl at the complaint but caught briannas arched look it cost her but she buried the hot words and chose kinder ones rogan and i were talking about just that not long ago wed hoped to take a few weeks there this summer but both of us are too busy to go just now she let out a breath telling herself she was earning points with the angels its been a bit of a concern to me that no ones there to check on matters and see that the staff is doing as it should which was a big bold lie she hoped wouldnt negate the points i dont suppose the two of you would consider taking a bit of time and going out there it would be a great favor to me if you could manage it with an effort lottie bit back the urge to spring up and dance she looked at maeve cocked her head what do you think maeve could we manage it as the image of the sunny villa the servants dancing attendance the sheer luxury of it all slid into her mind she shrugged and brought the cup of tea to liams waiting lips traveling aggravates my digestion but i suppose i could tolerate a bit of inconvenience this time it was shannons warning glance that held back maggies snarl id be grateful she said between clamped teeth ill have rogan arrange to have the plane take you when it suits twenty minutes later brianna listened to the front door close behind her mother and lottie then crossed the kitchen to give maggie a hard hug that was well done maggie i feel as if id swallowed a toad her digestion be damned brianna only laughed dont spoil it and you maggie spun to jerk an accusing finger at shannon and me she returned all innocence as if i couldnt see the wheels turning in your head sick as a dog she is mrs concannon snaps like a terrier worked didnt it maggie opened her mouth then closed it on a laugh it did but my prides sorely injured catching movement through the window she moved closer and peered out well look what cons rooted out of the bush theres three men coming this way brianna you may want to make a new pot of tea she stared out for another moment as a smile bloomed christ jesus what a handsome lot they are ill take the jackeen she murmured the two of you can scrabble over the others while shannon tried to adjust her suddenly jittery system maggie went to the door and threw it open con bolted in first streaking under the table to vacuum up the crumbs liam had been considerate enough to drop cake his senses as tuned as the hounds gray spotted the treat the moment he crossed the threshold with the marshmallow stuff guys weve struck gold da liam bounced in his chair and held up sticky fingers rogan had the presence of mind to stop by the sink and dampen a cloth before he went to his son murphy just stood there his cap in his hands his eyes on shannon youre back a couple of hours ago she began then her eyes widened as he marched to her pulled her to her feet and kissed her the way a wise man only kisses a woman in private welcome she didnt have a single breath left she drew some in and nodded she would have given her shaky legs the relief of sitting again but he held firm to her arm come with me well i her gaze darted around the room where everyone was suddenly intent on their own business hold on to yourself murphy maggie said lightly as she got out fresh plates shannons a present she wants to give you yes thats right i she trailed off ill get the box for you rogan offered will you have some tea murphy brianna asked no thank you he never took his eyes off shannons face we cant stay just now shannon have dinner with me tonight and breakfast gray murmured in briannas ear thank you rogan shannon took the box he brought in and wondered what to do next what is it gray wanted to know open it up ow he winced as brianna jabbed his ribs with her elbow hell open it at home she said take some cake with you she already readied a slab and handed murphy the covered plate thanks come with me he said again and taking shannons arm led her outside good thing you gave him the plate maggie commented else hed have his hands all over her before they were out of the garden as it was he had to call on all of his control he wanted to drag her over the fields down onto them instead he concentrated on keeping his stride from outdistancing hers i should have brought the lorry its not far to walk she said breathless right now it is is that heavy ill take it no she shifted the box out of his reach it wasnt light but she wanted to carry it you might guess you didnt have to buy me anything your coming backs present enough he hooked an arm around her waist and lifted her easily over the wall i missed you every minute i didnt know a man could think of a woman so many times in one day he forced himself to take three calming breaths rogan told me youd signed the contracts with him are you happy part of me is and part of mes terrified the fears only a motivator to do your best youll be famous shannon and rich im already rich his stride faltered you are comparatively oh hed have to mull that one over he decided think it through but at the moment his mind kept getting muddled with images of peeling her out of that pretty tailored jacket when they reached the farm he held open the kitchen door he set the plate on the counter and would have grabbed her if she hadnt anticipated him and moved to the other side of the table id like you to open your present she set it on the table between them i want you upstairs on the stairs here on the floor blood bubbled under her skin the way im feeling right now you can have me upstairs on the stairs and here on the floor she held up a hand when his eyes went hot but id really like you to see what i got you in dublin he didnt give a damn if shed brought him a solidgold pitchfork or a jeweled plowshare but the quiet request stopped him from simply leaping over the table instead he lifted the lid from the box and pushed through the packing she saw the instant he realized what was under it the stunned joy crept into his face suddenly he looked as young and bedazzled as any child whos found his hearts desire under the tree on christmas morning reverently he lifted the dulcimer out ran his fingers over the wood ive never seen anything so fine maggie said youd made one yourself just as fine then given it away enchanted he only shook his head no twasnt so beautiful as this he looked up then wonder and delight in his eyes what made you think to buy such a thing as this for me i saw it in the window and i saw you playing it will you play it for me murphy i havent played the dulcimer in a time but he unwrapped the hammers stroked them as he might the down of a newly hatched chick theres a tune i know and when he played it she saw that shed been right he had that half smile on his face the faraway look in his eyes the melody was old and sweet like some lovely wine just decanted it filled the kitchen made her eyes sting and her heart swell its the grandest gift ive ever had he said as he set the hammers gently aside ill treasure it the impatient beast that had clawed inside of him was calmed he came around the table and took her hands gently in his i love you shannon i know she lifted their joined hands to her cheek i know you do you called me yesterday and told me you loved me will you tell me now i shouldnt have called that way she spoke quickly as nerves began to spark in her fingertips i wasnt thinking clearly and he kissed those unsteady fingertips watching her patiently over them i do love you murphy but he only laid his lips on hers silencing the rest ever since i heard you tell me the first time ive been aching for you will you come upstairs with me shannon yes she leaned closer trapping their joined hands between ill come upstairs with you she smiled swept up in the romance of it even as she was swept up in his arms the light was lovely trailing through the windows scattering over the stairs as he carried her up flowing pale across the bed when he laid her on it it was so easy to sink into that light into the gentle strength of his arms as they wrapped around her into the warm promise of his mouth it occurred to her that this was the first time theyd loved each other with a roof overhead and a bed beneath them she might have missed the stars and the smell of grass if it hadnt been for the sweetness he offered her in its place hed brought flowers into the room imagining her here hed wanted there to be flowers he caught the fragile scent of them as he dipped his head to trail his lips down her throat there were candles for later to replace the starlight there were soft linen sheets a substitute for woolen blankets and grass he spread her hair over his pillow knowing her scent would cling there she smiled as he began to undress her shed bought a few other things in dublin and knew when hed uncovered the first hint of rose silk shed chosen well with quiet concentration he peeled aside jacket blouse slacks then drew a fingertip across the ivory lace that flirted between her breasts why do such things weaken a man he wondered her smile spread i saw it in the window then i saw you touching me his gaze lifted to hers very slowly he skimmed his fingertip down over the curve of her breast under it then up again to graze her nipple like this yes her eyes fluttered closed just like this experimentally he followed the silk down to were it ended in an edge of that same lace just below the waist beneath that was a tiny swatch of matching silk he laid his hand over the triangle and watched her arch when he replaced his hand with his mouth she writhed to please himself he explored every inch of the silks before moving on to the flesh beneath he knew she was lost to reason when hed finished even as she bucked beneath him clawed he held on to his own he wanted one last gift tell me now shannon the breath was searing his lungs and his fists were bone white tell me now that you love me when youre burning for me when youre desperate for me to come inside you to fill you to ride you she was gasping for air frantic for him to drive her over that last thin edge i love you tears sprang to her eyes as emotion mixed equal to need i love you murphy he thrust into her making them both groan each plunge was a demand and a glory tell me again his voice was fierce as they both teetered on the brink tell me again i love you almost weeping she buried her face in his throat and let him shatter her later after hed lighted the candles he pulled her down the hall to the bath where they played like children in water too hot in a tub too full instead of dinner they gorged on briannas cake washed it down with beer in a combination shannon knew should be disgusting it tasted like ambrosia while she was licking her fingers she caught the gleam in his eye in a heartbeat they were lunging for each other and made love like mindless animals on the kitchen floor she might have slept there exhausted but he pulled her to her feet no steadier than drunks they staggered out down the hall then he pulled her into the parlor and they had each other again on the rug when she managed to sit up her hair was tangled her eyes glazed and her body aching how many rooms are there in this house he laughed and nipped her shoulder youre going to find out murphy well kill each other when his hand snaked up the ladder of her ribs to cup her breast she let out a shuddering sigh im willing to risk it if you are thats a lass there were fifteen shannon thought when she collapsed onto the tangled sheets somewhere near dawn fifteen rooms in the sprawling stone farmhouse and it wasnt through lack of wanting that they hadnt managed to christen all of them somewhere along the line their bodies had simply betrayed them theyd tumbled back into bed with no thought of anything but sleep as she drifted toward it under the weight of murphys arm she reminded herself they would have to talk seriously and talk soon she had to explain things to him make him see why the future was so much more complex then the present even as she tried to formulate the words in her mind she drifted deeper and she saw the man her warrior her lover on the white horse there was the glint of armor the swirl of his cape in the wind but this time he wasnt riding toward her across the fields he was riding away chapter twentyone murphy figured it was love that made a man so energetic after an hours sleep he dealt with the milking the feeding of stock the pasturing all with a song on his lips and a spring in his step that had the young feeney boy grinning at him as usual there were a dozen chores to see to before breakfast grateful it was his neighbors turn to haul the milk away murphy gathered up the mornings eggs eyed one of the older ladies who would need to do her turn in the pot shortly and headed back toward the house he was having a change of heart about his earlier idea of letting shannon sleep while he grabbed a quick cup of tea and a biscuit then set out to turn his turf it seemed much more inviting to take her up that tea and biscuit and make love with her while she was warm from sleep and soft from dreaming he never expected to find her in his kitchen standing at the stove with the apron his mother used when visiting wrapped around her waist i thought youd be sleeping she glanced over smiling at the way he took off his cap when he came in the house i heard you outside laughing with the boy who helps you milk i didnt mean to wake you the kitchen smelled gloriously of mornings from his childhood what are you doing there i found some bacon and the sausages she prodded the latter with a kitchen fork its cholesterol city but after last night i thought you deserved it the foolish grin broke over his face youre cooking me breakfast i figured youd be hungry after doing whatever you do at dawn somurphy she squealed dropping the fork with a clatter as he grabbed her and swung her around watch what youre doing he set her down but couldnt do anything about the grin as she muttered at him and washed off the fork i didnt even know you could cook of course i can cook i may not be the artist in the kitchen brie is but im more than adequate whats this she poked into the bucket hed set down when hed come in there must be three dozen eggs in here what do you do with so many i use what i need trade away or sell the rest she wrinkled her nose theyre filthy how did they get so dirty he stared at her a moment then roared with laughter oh youre a darling woman shannon bodine i can see that was a stupid question well clean them up im not touching them he hauled the bucket to the sink began to oblige when it suddenly dawned on her just where eggs came from oh she winced and flipped bacon its enough to put you off omelettes how do you know if theyre just eggs and not going to be little chickies he slid her a look wanting to make sure she wasnt joking this time poking his tongue in his cheek he washed off another shell if they dont peep youre safe very funny she decided she was better off in ignorance she really preferred thinking of eggs as something you took out of nice cartons stacked in the market how do you want them cooked however you like im not fussy you made tea he wanted to kneel at her feet i couldnt find any coffee ill get some next im in the village it smells grand shannon the table was already set he noted for two he poured them both tea wishing hed thought to pick her some of the wildflowers that grew alongside the barn he sat when she carried a platter to the table thank you there was a humbleness in his voice that made her feel twin edges of guilt and pleasure youre welcome i never eat sausage she commented as she took her seat but this looks so good it should mrs feeney made it fresh only a few days ago made it aye he offered her the platter first they butchered the hog theyd been fattening his brow drew together in concern when she paled is something wrong no with hurried movement she waved the platter away there are just certain things i dont care to visualize ah he gave her an apologetic smile i wasnt thinking i should be getting used to it the other day i walked in on a discussion brie was having with some guy about the spring lambs she shuddered knowing now just what happened to cute little lambs in the spring it seems harsh to you i know but its just the cycle of things it was one of toms problems deciding the toast shed made was safe shannon glanced over oh he couldnt stand to raise something for the table for his own or someone elses when he had chickens he gathered the eggs well enough but his hens died of old age more often than not he was a tenderhearted man he let the rabbits go shannon murmured ah you heard about the rabbits murphy smiled at the memory going to make a fortune off them he was until it came down to the sticking point he was always after making a fortune you really loved him i did he wasnt a substitute for my father nor did he try to be one it wasnt the male figure they say a boy needs in his life he was as much my father from my fifteenth year as the one who made me was before he was always there for me when i was grieving hed pop up take me for a ride to the cliffs or a trip into galway with the girls he held my head the first time i sicked up whiskey id had no business drinking and when id had my first woman i he broke off and developed a keen interest in his meal shannon lifted a brow oh dont stop now what happened when youd had your first woman what usually happens id suppose this is a fine breakfast shannon dont change the subject how old were you he gave her a pained look tisnt seemly to discuss such matters with the woman youre currently sharing breakfast with coward aye he agreed heartily and filled his flapping mouth with eggs youre safe murphy her laughter faded id really like to know what he said to you because it was important to her he crawled over his embarrassment i was id been you dont have to tell me that part she smiled to soothe him now anyway after he said relieved to have gotten past that first leap i was feeling proudmanly id guess you could say and as confused as a monkey with three tails guilty terrified i might have gotten the girl pregnant because id been too hotyoung and stupid he corrected to think of that before the matter so i was sitting out on the wall a part of me wondering when i might get back and do the whole thing again and the other part waiting for god to strike me dead for doing it in the first place or for ma to find out and do the job quicker and with less mercy than god ever would murphy she forgot herself and bit into a slice of bacon youre so sweet its as much a moment in a mans life as it is a womans id say anyway i was sitting there thinking of what you might imagine and tom comes along he sits next to me and says nothing for a time just sits and looks out over the fields it must have been all over my face he puts his arm around my shoulders made a man of yourself he says and youre proud of it but it takes more than sliding into a willing lass to make a man takes responsibility murphy shook his head and picked up his tea now im sick thinking i might have to marry her and me barely seventeen and no more in love with her than she with me and i say so he just nods not lecturing or scolding he tells me if god and fate are looking kindly he knows ill remember it and have more of a care next time out therell be a next time he says because a man doesnt stop going down such a lovely path once hes begun it and a woman is a glorious thing to hold and to have the right woman when you find her is more than sunlight you watch for her murphy and while youre sniffing those sweet flowers along the way treat them with care and affection and dont bruise their petals if you love with kindness even when you cant love with permanence youll deserve the one whos waiting along that path for you it took shannon a moment to find her voice everyone says he wanted to be a poet but didnt have the words she pressed her lips together it sounds as though he did to me he had them when it counted murphy said quietly he often lacked them for himself he carried sadness in his eyes that showed when he didnt know you were looking shannon looked down at her hands they were her mothers hands narrow long fingered and she had tom concannons eyes what else she wondered had they given her would you do something for me murphy id do anything for you she knew it but just then couldnt let herself think of it would you take me to loop head he rose took their plates from the table youll need your jacket darling the winds brisk there she wondered how often tom concannon had taken this drive along the narrow twisting roads that cut through the roll of fields she saw little stone sheds without roofs a tethered goat that cropped at wild grass there was a sign painted on the side of a white building warning her it was the last stop for beer until new york it nearly made her smile when he parked the truck she saw with relief that there was no one else who had come to see the cliffs and sea that morning they were alone with the wailing wind and the jagged rocks and the crash of surf and the whisper of ghosts she walked with him down the ribbon of dirt that cut through the high grass and toward the edge of ireland the wind lashed at her a powerful thing blown over the dark water and spewing surf the thunder of it was wonderful to the north she could see the cliffs of mohr and the still misted aran islands they met here she linked her fingers with murphys when he took her hand my mother told me the day she went into the coma she told me how theyd met here it was raining and cold and he was alone she fell in love with him here she knew he was married had children she knew it was wrong it was wrong murphy i cant make myself feel differently dont you think they paid for it yes i think they paid over and over but that doesnt she broke off steadied her voice it was easier when i didnt really believe he loved her when i didnt couldnt think of him as a good man as a father who would have loved me if things had been different i had one who did she said fiercely and i wont ever forget that you dont have to love the one less to open your heart a bit to the other it makes me feel disloyal she shook her head before he could speak it doesnt matter if its not logical to feel that way i do i dont want tom concannons eyes i dont want his blood i dont she pressed her hand to her mouth and let the tears come i lost something murphy the day she told me i lost the image the illusion that smooth quiet mirror that reflected my family its shattered and now there are all these cracks and layers and overlapping edges when its put back together how do you see yourself in it now with different pieces scattered over the whole and connections i cant turn away from and im afraid ill never get back what i had eyes desolate she turned to him she lost her family because of me faced the shame and fear of being alone and it was because of me she married a man she didnt love shannon brushed at the tears with the back of her hand i know she did love him in time a child knows that about her parentsyou can feel it in the air the same way you can feel an argument that adults think theyre hiding from you but she never forgot tom concannon never closed him out of her heart or forgot how she felt when she walked to these cliffs in the rain and saw him and you wish she had yes i wish she had and i hate myself for wishing it because when i wish it i know im not thinking of her or of my father im thinking of me youre so hard on yourself shannon it hurts me to see it no im not you have no idea the easy the closetoperfect life i had she looked out to sea again her hair streaming back from her face parents who indulged me in nearly everything who trusted me respected me every bit as much as they loved me they wanted me to have the best and saw that i got it good homes in good neighborhoods good schools i never wanted for anything emotionally or materially they gave me a solid foundation and let me make my own choices on how to use it now im angry because theres a fault under the foundation and the angers like turning my back on everything they did for me thats nonsense and its time you stopped it firm he took her shoulders was it anger that made you come here to where it began knowing what it would cost you to face it you know he died here yet you came to face that too didnt you yes it hurts i know darling he gathered her close i know it does the heart has to break a little to make room i want to understand it was so comforting to rest her head on his shoulder the tears didnt burn then and the pang in her heart lessened it would be easier to accept when i understand why they all made the choices they made i think you understand more than you know he turned so that they faced the sea again the crashing and endless symphony of wave against rock its beautiful here on the edge of the world he kissed her hair one day youll bring your paints and draw what you see what you feel i dont know if i could so many ghosts you drew the stones theres no lack of ghosts there and theyre as close to you as these if it was a day for courage she would stand on her own when she asked him shannon stepped back the man and white horse the woman in the field you see them i do hazily when i was a boy then clearer after i found the broach clearer yet since you stepped into briannas kitchen and looked at me with eyes i already knew tom concannons eyes you know what i mean shannon they were cool then id seen them that way before and id seen them hot with anger and with lust id seen them weeping and laughing id seen them swimming with visions i think she said carefully that people can be susceptible to a place an atmosphere there are a number of studies she broke off when his eyes glinted at her all right well toss out logic temporarily i feltfeel something at the dance something strange and familiar and ive had dreamssince the first night i came to ireland it unnerves you it did me for a time yes it unnerves me theres a storm he prompted trying not to rush her sometimes the lightnings cold like a spear of ice against the sky and the grounds hard with frost so you can hear the sound of the horse thundering across it before you see it and the rider and the wind blows her hair while she waits he sees her and his hearts beating as hard as the horses hooves beat the ground clutching her arms around her shannon turned away it was easier to look at the sea other times theres a fire in a small dark room shes bathing his face with a cloth hes delirious burning with fever thats spread from his wounds he knows hes dying murphy said quietly all he has to hold him to life is her hand and the scent of her the sound of her voice as she soothes him but he doesnt die shannon took a long breath ive seen them making love by the fire in the dance its like watching and being taken at the same time ill wake up hot and shaky and aching for you she turned to him then and he saw a look hed seen before in her eyes the smoldering fury of it i dont want this tell me what i did to turn your heart against me it isnt against you but he took her arms his eyes insistent tell me what i did i dont know she shouted it then shocked by the bitterness pressed against him i dont know and if i do somehow i cant tell you this isnt my world murphy its not real to me but youre trembling i cant talk about this i dont want to think about it it makes everything more insane and impossible than it already is shannon no she took his mouth in a desperate kiss this wont always be enough to soothe either of us its enough now take me back murphy take me back and well make it enough demands wouldnt sway her he knew not when she was clinging so close to her fears helpless to do otherwise he kept her under his arm and led her back to the truck gray saw the truck coming as he walked back to the inn and hailed it the minute he stepped up to shannons window he could sense the tension and he could see quite easily though shed done her best to mask it that shed been crying he sent murphy an even look exactly the kind a brother might aim at anyone who made his sister unhappy ive just come back from your place when you didnt answer the phone brianna started worrying we went for a drive shannon told him i asked murphy to take me to loop head oh which explained quite a bit brie was hoping we could go out to the gallery all of us id like that she thought the trip might dispel the lingering depression could you she asked murphy i have some things to see to he could see it would disappoint her if he made excuses and that she wouldnt talk to him now in any case could you hold off for an hour or two sure well take maggie and the monster with us rogans already out there come by when youre ready i need to change shannon said quickly she was already opening the door as she glanced back at murphy ill wait for you here all right thats fine no more than two hours he nodded toward gray then drove off tough morning gray murmured in several ways i cant seem to talk to him about what happens next or what happened before she admitted what does happen next i have to go back gray i should have left a week ago she leaned into him when he draped an arm over her shoulder and looked out over the valley my jobs on the line the old rock and a hard place ive been there a few times no way to squeeze out without bruises he led her through the gate down the path and to the steps if i were to ask you what you wanted in your life for your life would you be able to answer not as easily as i could have a month ago she sat with him studying the foxglove and nodding columbine do you believe in visions gray thats quite a segue i guess it is and a question i never figured id ask anyone she turned to study him now im asking you because youre an american when his grin broke out hers followed i know how that sounds but hear me out you make your home here in ireland but youre still a yank you make your living by creating fiction telling stories but you do it on modern equipment theres a fax machine in your office yeah that makes all the difference it means youre a twentiethcentury man a forwardlooking man who understands technology and uses it murphy has a topoftheline milk machine gray pointed out his new tractors the best modern technologys come up with and he cuts his own turf shannon finished smiling and his blood is full of celtic mystique you cant tell me that part of him doesnt believe in banshees and fairies okay id say murphys a fascinating combination of old ireland and new so your question to me is do i believe in visions he waited a beat absolutely oh grayson frustrated she sprang up strode two paces down the path turned and strode back how can you sit there wearing nikes and a rolex and tell me you believe in visions he looked down at his shoes i like nikes and the watch keeps pretty good time you know very well what i mean youre not going to have any trouble rolling into the twentyfirst century yet youre going to sit there and say you believe in fifteenthcentury nonsense i dont think its nonsense and i dont think its stuck in the fifteenth century either i think it goes back a whole lot further and that itll keep going through several more millenniums and you probably believe in ghosts too and reincarnation and toads that turn into princes yep he grinned then took her hand and pulled her down again you shouldnt ask a question if the answers going to piss you off when she only huffed he toyed with her fingers you know when i came to this part of ireland i had no intention of staying six months maybe write the book and pack up thats the way i worked and lived obviously briannas the main reason i changed that but theres more i recognized this place oh gray she said again i walked across the fields one morning and i saw the standing stones they fascinated me and i felt a tug a power that didnt surprise me in the least her hand tensed in his you mean that i do i could walk down the road there or drive to the cliffs through the village wander around in ruins cemeteries i felt connectedand id never felt that connection with anything or anyone before i didnt have visions but i knew id been here before and was meant to come back and that doesnt give you the creeps it scared the shit out of me he said cheerfully just about as much as falling in love with brianna did whats scaring you more pal i dont know i have these dreams so you said before are you going to tell me about them this time i have to tell somebody she murmured whenever i start to talk about it with murphy i get panicked like somethings got a hold of me im not the hysterical type gray or the fanciful type but i cant get past this she began slowly telling him of the first dream the details of it the emotions of it the words came easily now without the hot ball in her throat that swelled each time she tried to discuss it with murphy still she knew there was more some piece some final link that part of her was blocking out he has the broach she finished murphy has the broach i saw in my dreams he found it in the dance when he was a boy and he says he started having the same dreams fascinated and with one part of his brain coolly filing away the facts and images for a story to be spun he whistled thats pretty heavy stuff tell me about it i feel like ive got the weight of a hundredpound ax at the back of my neck he narrowed his eyes i said heavy not scary certainly not threatening well i am threatened i dont like it this having my unconscious intruded upon and this nasty feeling that im supposed to fix whatever went wrong doesnt agree with me gray when i see a magician vanish in a puff of smoke i know its a trick i may enjoy it be entertained if its well done but im fully aware theres a trapdoor and misdirection rock and a hard place again pal logic against illogic reason against emotion have you considered relaxing and just seeing which side wins ive considered finding an analyst she muttered and im telling myself the dreams will stop once im back in new york back in the routine im used to and youre afraid they wont yes im afraid they wont and im very afraid that murphy wont understand why i have to go do you understand gray asked quietly logically yes and still logically i can understand my connection here with murphy with all of you i know ill have to come back that ill never break the ties or want to and that the life im going back to will never be quite the same as the one i had before but i cant fix dreams gray and i cant stay and let my life drift not even for murphy want advice she lifted her hands then let them fall hell ill take what i can get think through what youre going back to and what youre leaving behind make a list if it helps the logical side and after youve weighed them one against the other see which side of the scale dips pretty standard advice she mused but not bad thanks wait till you get my bill she laughed tilted her head onto his shoulder i really love you flustered and pleased he pressed a kiss to her temple same goes chapter twentytwo shannon couldnt have been more delighted with worldwide gallery clare its manorhouse style was both striking and dignified the gardens murphy told her as she stepped from the truck to admire them were briannas design she didnt plant them he went on as there wasnt enough time for her to come out every day with her spade and her pots but she drew up the placement of every last dahlia and rosebush another family affair it is yes rogan and maggie worked with the architect on the design of the house scrutinized every paint chip there were some lively arguments there he remembered taking shannons hand as gray pulled up nearby its a labor of love for all of them shannon scanned the cars already parked in the lot it appears its working very well the president of irelands been here there was wonder in his voice as well as pride twice and bought one of maggies pieces others as well its no small thing to take a dream and make it into a reality that stands strong no she understood what was beneath his words and was grateful when brianna and the rest joined them youll keep your hands in your pockets liam sweeney maggie warned or ill handcuff you not trusting the threat she hoisted him up what do you think then shannon i think its beautiful and every bit as impressive as dublin and new york heres a home she said simply and carried liam toward the entrance shannon smelled the flowers the roses the drifting fragrance of peonies the scent of the trimmed lawn that was thick as velvet when she stepped inside she saw that it was indeed a home furnished with care and with the welcoming grace of elegance there were paintings on the wall of the main hall clever pencil portraits that celebrated the faces and moods of the people of ireland in the front parlor were dreamy watercolors that suited the curved settee and quiet tones of the room there were sculptures maggies incomparable glass as well as a bust of a young woman carved in alabaster and canny little elves depicted in glossy wood a handhooked rug in bleeding blues graced the floor and a thick throw was draped over the back of the sofa there were flowers fresh that morning in vases of brilliant glass and fired pottery it gave her a jolt to see her own painting on the wall stunned she walked closer staring at her watercolor of brianna im so proud to have it here brianna said from beside her maggie told me that rogan had displayed three but she didnt tell me this was one of them three there was something spreading in shannons chest making her heart beat too fast for comfort maggie stepped up struggling with a wriggling liam at first he was only going to use the one the dance but he decided to put up the other two for a few days only he wants to tease the clientele a bit give them a glimpse or two of whats to come in your fall showing and start a buzz hes had an offer on the dance already an offer now whatever was stretching inside of shannon was creeping into her throat someone wants to buy it i think he said two thousand pounds or maybe it was three she shrugged as shannon stared at her of course he wants twice that twice she choked then certain shed gotten the joke shook her head you almost had me hes greedy is rogan maggie said with a smile im forever telling him he asks outrageous prices and he delights in forever proving me wrong by getting them if he wants six thousand pounds for it hell get it i promise you the logical part of shannons brain calculated the exchange into american dollars and banked it the artist in her was both flustered and grieving all right boyo maggie said to the squirming liam its your das turn she marched out with him leaving shannon staring at the painting when i sold the yearling murphy began in a quiet voice it broke my heart he was mine you see he smiled a little when shannon turned to him id been there at the foaling and watched through until the first nursing i trained him to the lead and worried when he bruised his knee but i had to sell him and knew that in my head you cant be in the horse business without doing business still it broke my heart ive never sold anything ive painted ive given it away as gifts but thats not the same she took a long breath i didnt know i could feel this way excited overwhelmed and incredibly sad it may help to know that grays already told rogan hell skin him if rogan sells your brianna to anyone but him id have given it to them murphy leaned close to whisper in her ear say it soft for rogans got good hearing that made her laugh and she let him take her hand and lead her into the next room it took more than an hour before she could be persuaded from the first floor to the second there was too much to see and admire and want the first thing she spotted in the upstairs sitting room was a long sinuous flow of glass that hinted at the shape of a dragon she could see the spread of wings the iridescent sheen of them the curve of the neck the fierce turn of head and sweep of tail i have to have it possessively she ran her fingers along the serpentine body it was maggies work of course shannon didnt have to see the carved mm under the base of the tail to know it youll let me buy it for you no she was firm as she turned to murphy ive wanted a piece of hers for more than a year and know exactly what rogan gets for her i can afford it now barely i mean it murphy you took the earrings and she was wearing them still he saw with pleasure i know and its sweet of you to offer but this is important to me to buy for myself something of my sisters the stubborn look that had come into his eyes faded ah so its that way im glad so am i very glad her lips curved when his came to them i beg your pardon rogan said from the doorway im interrupting no she went to him hands extended i cant begin to tell you how i feel seeing my work here its something i never thought of something my mother always wanted thank you she kept his hands in hers as she kissed him thank you for making something she dreamed of come true its more than a pleasure and im confident it will continue to be for both of us for years to come he saw her hesitation and countered it briannas gone to the kitchen you cant keep her out of one will you come have some tea ive just started on this floor and actually id like a minute of your time rogan there you are with a smug smile on her face maggie strode into the room ive dumped liam on gray i told him it would be good practice for when kayla gains her feet and never stops running on them she hooked an arm through rogans brianna has the tea ready and bless her she brought a tin of her sugar biscuits from home ill be right down he gave her hand an absent pat should we go into my office shannon no its not necessary i want to discuss the dragon he didnt need for her to gesture toward the sculpture maggies breath of fire he said with a nod exceptional of course it is maggie retorted i worked my ass off on it started three different times before it came right i want it shannon was an excellent negotiator had bargained with the best of them in the diamond district in the little galleries of soho but in this case her skills had no chance against sheer desire id like to arrange to buy it and have you ship it back to new york for me no one but maggie noticed that murphy went suddenly and absolutely still i see considering rogan kept his eyes on shannons face its one of her more unique works no argument ill write you a check maggie looked away from murphy and squared her shoulders for battle rogan ill not have you it amused shannon to see maggie seethe into silence when rogan raised a hand artists tend to have an emotional attachment to their work he said mildly while his wife glared at him which is why they need a partner someone with a head for business fathead maggie muttered bloodsucker damn contracts he makes me sign them still as if i hadnt borne him a child and didnt have another in the womb he only spared her a brief glance finished he asked then continued before she could swear at him as maggies partner ill speak for her and tell you that wed like you to have it as a gift even as shannon started to protest maggie was sputtering in shock rogan sweeney never in my life did i expect to hear such a thing come out of your mouth after a burst of delighted laughter she grabbed his face in both her hands then kissed him long and hard i love you still beaming she turned back to shannon dont you dare argue she ordered this is a moment of great pride and astonishment for me in the man i married so shake hands on the deal before he comes back to his normal avaricious senses trapped by kindness shannon did what she was told its very generous thank you i guess ill have that tea now and gloat before i finish the tour ill take you down maggie murphy well be right along maggie sent him a quick silent signal then waited until their footsteps faded away she thought it best to say nothing for the moment and simply wrapped her arms around murphy she didnt realize what she was saying maggie began about having it shipped to new york that was the worst of it he thought closing his eyes and absorbing the dull dragging ache because its automatic to her the leaving you want her to stay you have to fight his hands fisted on her back he could fight with those if the foe was flesh and blood but it was intangible as elusive as ghosts a place a mindset a life he couldnt grasp even with his brain i havent finished he said it quietly with a fire underneath that gave maggie hope and neither by jesus has she he didnt ask if shed come back to the farm with him but simply drove there when they got out of the truck he didnt lead her into the house but around it do you have to do something with the animals she glanced down at his feet he wasnt wearing his boots but the shoes she knew he kept for church and town later he was distracted shed sensed that all along the drive back from ennistymon it worried her that he was still brooding about what they said to each other at loop head there was a stubborn streak under all those quiet waters just as there was a flaming wave of passion always stirring under the surface already the panic was creeping up at the idea he might insist they talk about the dreams again murphy i can tell youre upset cant we just put all this aside ive put it aside too long already he could see his horses grazing he had a client for the bay colt the one that was standing so proud just now and he knew hed have to give him up but there was some things a man never gave up he could feel the nerves in her hand the tension in it that held the rest of her rigid as he drew her into the circle of stones then he let her go and faced her without touching it had to be here you know that though there was a trembling around her heart she kept her eyes level i dont know what you mean he didnt have a ring he knew what he wanted for herthe claddaugh with its heart and hands and crown but for now he had only himself i love you shannon as much as a man can love i tell you that here on holy ground while the sun beams between the stones now her heart thudded as much with love as with nerves she could see what was in his eyes and shook her head already knowing nothing would stop him im asking you to marry me to let me share your life to have you share mine and i ask you that here on holy ground while the sun beams between the stones emotion welled up until she thought she could drown in it dont ask me murphy i have asked you but you havent answered i cant i cant do what youre asking his eyes flashed temper and pain like twin suns inside him you can do anything you choose to do say you wont and be honest all right i wont and i have been honest right from the start no more to me than to yourself he shot back he was bleeding from a hundred wounds and could do nothing to stop it i have she could only meet temper with temper and hurt with hurt i told you all along there was no courtship no future and never pretended otherwise i slept with you she said her voice rising in panic because i wanted you but that doesnt mean ill change everything for you you said you loved me i do love you she said it in fury ive never loved anyone the way i love you but it isnt enough for me its more than enough well not for me im not you murphy im not brianna im not maggie she whirled away fighting the urge to pound her fists on the stones until they bled whatever was taken away from me when my mother told me just who i am im getting it back im taking it back i have a life eyes dark and churning she spun back to him do you think i dont know what you want i saw your face when you walked in this morning and i was cooking breakfast thats what you want murphy a woman wholl tend your house welcome you in bed have your children and be content year after year with gardens and a view of the valley and turf fires she cut to the core of what he was and such things are beneath the likes of you theyre not for me she countered refusing to let the bitter words hurt her i have a career ive put on hold long enough i have a country a city a home to get back to you have a home here i have a family here she said carefully i have people who mean a great deal to me here but that doesnt make it home what stops it he demanded what stops you you think i want you so you can cook my meals and wash my dirty shirts ive been doing that fine on my own for years and can do it still i dont give a damn if you never lift a hand i can hire help if it comes to that im not a poor man you have a careerwhos asking you not to you could paint from dawn till dusk and id only be proud of you youre not understanding me no im not im not understanding how you can love me and i you and still youd walk away from it and from me what compromises do you need youve only to ask what compromise she shouted because the strength of his need was squeezing her heart theres no compromise here murphy were not talking about making adjustments its not a matter of moving to a new house or relocating in a different city were talking continents here worlds and the span between yours and mine this isnt shuffling around schedules to share chores its giving up one way for something entirely different nothing changes for you and everything changes for me its too much to ask its meant youre blinding yourself to that i dont give a damn about dreams and ghosts and restless spirits this is me flesh and blood she said desperate to convince both of them this is here and now ill give you everything i can and i dont want to hurt you but when you ask for more its the only choice i have the only choice youll see he drew back his eyes were cool now with turmoil only a hint behind the icy blue youre telling me youll go knowing what weve found together knowing what you feel for me youll go to new york and live happily without it ill live as i have to live as i know how to live youre holding your heart back from me and its cruel of you im cruel you think youre not hurting me by standing here and demanding i choose between my right hand and my left abruptly chilled to the bone she wrapped her arms around herself oh its so easy for you damn you murphy you have nothing to risk and nothing to lose damn you she said again and her eyes were bright and bitter and seemed not quite her own you wont find peace any more than i will with the words searing on her tongue she whirled and ran the buzzing in her ears was temper she was sure of it the dizziness outraged emotions and the pain in her heart a violent combination of both but she felt as though someone were running with her inside her as desperately unhappy as she as bitterly hopeless she fled across the fields not stopping when she reached briannas garden and the dozing dog leaped up to greet her running still when she stumbled into the kitchen and a startled brianna called her name running until she was closed in her room alone and there was nowhere left to run brianna waited an hour before she knocked softly on the door she expected to find shannon weeping or sleeping off the tears the single glimpse brianna had had of her face as shed streaked in and out of the kitchen spoke of misery and temper but when she opened the door she didnt find shannon weeping she found her painting the lights going shannon didnt bother to look up the sweep of her brush was passionate frenetic ill need some lamps ive got to have light of course ill bring you some she stepped forward it wasnt the face of grief she saw but the face of someone half wild shannon i cant talk now i have to do this i have to get it out of my system once and for all i have to have more light brie all right ill see to it quietly she closed the door behind her she painted all night shed never done that before never needed to or cared enough but shed needed this it was full morning when she stopped her hands cramped her eyes burning her mind dead she hadnt touched the tray brianna had brought up sometime during the night nor was she interested in food now without looking at the finished canvas she dropped her brushes in a jar of turpentine then turned and tumbled fully dressed into bed it was nearly evening again before she woke stiff groggy thered been no dreams this time or none she remembered only the deep exhausted sleep that left her feeling hulled out and lightheaded mechanically she stripped off her clothes showered dressed again never once looking at the painting shed been driven to start and finish within one desperate night instead she picked up the untouched tray and carried it downstairs she saw brianna in the hall bidding goodbye to guests shannon passed without speaking going into the kitchen to set aside the tray and pour the coffee that had been made for her hours before ill make fresh brianna offered the moment she came in no this is fine with something close to a smile shannon lifted the cup really im sorry i wasted the food doesnt matter let me fix you something shannon you havent eaten since yesterday and you look pale i guess i could use something because she couldnt find the energy to do anything else she went to the table and sat did you have a fight with murphy yes and no i dont want to talk about that right now brianna turned the heat on under her stew before going to the refrigerator i wont press you then did you finish your painting yes shannon closed her eyes but there was more to finish brie id like to see the letters now i need to see them after youve eaten brianna said slicing bread for a sandwich ill call maggie if you dont mind we should do this together yes shannon pushed her cup aside we should do this together chapter twenty three it was a difficult thing to look at the three slim letters bound together by a faded red ribbon and it was a sentimental man shannon mused who tied a womans letters so few letters in a ribbon that time would leach of color she didnt ask for the brandy but was grateful when brianna set a snifter by her elbow theyd gone into the family parlor the three of them and gray had taken the baby down to maggies so it was quiet in the lamplight for the sun was setting toward dusk shannon gathered her courage and opened the first envelope her mothers handwriting hadnt changed she could see that right away it had always been neat feminine and somehow economical my dearest tommy tommy shannon thought staring at the single line shed called him tommy when shed written to him and tommy when shed spoken of him to her daughter for the first and the last time but shannon thought of him as tom tom concannon whod passed to her green eyes and chestnut hair tom concannon who hadnt been a good farmer but a good father a man who had turned from his vows and his wife to love another womanand had let her go who had wanted to be a poet and to make his fortune but had died doing neither she read on and had no choice but to hear her mothers voice and the love and kindness in it no regrets shannon could find no regrets in the words that spoke of love and duty and the complexity of choices longing yes and memories but without apology always shed ended it always amanda with great care shannon refolded the first letter she told me hed written back to her i never found any letters with her things shed not have kept them brianna murmured in respect for her husband her loyalty and her love were with him yes shannon wanted to believe that when a man had given all of himself for more than twentyfive years he deserved nothing less she opened the second letter it began in the same way ended in the same way as the first but between there were hints of something more than memories of a brief and forbidden love she knew she was pregnant shannon managed when she wrote this she knew shed have been frightened even desperate shed had to be but she writes so calmly not letting him know or even guess maggie took the letter from her when shed folded it again she might have needed time to think about what she would do what she could do her familyfrom what rogans man foundthey wouldnt have stood with her no when she told them they insisted that she go away then give me up and avoid the scandal she wouldnt she wanted you brianna said yes she wanted me shannon opened the last letter it broke her heart to read this how could there have been joy she wondered no matter how much fear and anxiety she might read between the lines there was unmistakable joy in them more there was a rejection of shameof what was expected for an unwed woman pregnant with a married mans child it was obvious shed made her choice when shed written the letter her family had threatened her with disinheritance but it hadnt mattered shed risked that and everything shed known for a chance and the child she carried she told him she wasnt alone shannons voice trembled she lied to him she was alone shed had to go north and find work because her family had cut her off from themselves and from her own money she had nothing she had you brianna corrected thats what she wanted thats what she chose but she never asked him to come to her or to let her come back to him she never gave him a chance just told him that she was pregnant and that she loved him and was going away she did give him a chance maggie laid a hand on shannons shoulder a chance to be a father to the children he already had and to know he would have another whod be well loved and cared for perhaps she took the decision out of his hands one that would have split him in two either way he turned i think she did it for him and for you and maybe even for herself she never stopped loving him again she folded the letter even loving my father as much as she did she never stopped he was on her mind when she died just as she was in his they both lost what some people never find we cant say what might have been tenderly brianna tied the ribbon around the letters again or change what was lost or was found but dont you think shannon weve done our best for them being here making a family out of their families sisters out of their daughters id like to think that she knows im not angry and that im coming to understand there was peace in that shannon realized in understanding if hed been alive when i came here i would have tried to care for him be sure of it maggie gave her shoulder a squeeze i am shannon realized right now its about the only thing im sure of fresh weariness dragged at her when she stood brianna stood with her and held out the letters these are yours shed want you to have them thank you the paper felt so thin against her hand so fragile and so precious ill keep them but theyre ours i need to think take your brandy brianna picked up the glass and held it out and a hot bath theyll ease mind body and spirit it was good advice and she intended to take it but when she walked into her room shannon set the snifter aside the painting drew her now so she turned on the lamps before crossing to it she studied the man on the white horse the woman the glint of copper and a sword there was the swirl of a cape the sweep of chestnut hair lifted by the wind but there was more much more enough to have her sit carefully on the edge of the bed while her gaze stayed riveted on the canvas she knew it had come out of her every brushstroke yet it seemed impossible that she could have done such work shed made a vision reality shed been meant to do so all along on a shuddering breath she closed her eyes and waited until she was sure until she could see inside herself as clearly as she had seen the people shed brought to life with paint and brush it was all so easy she realized not complicated at all it was logic that had complicated it now even with logic it was simple she had calls to make she thought then picked up the phone to finish what shed started when shed first stepped onto ireland she waited until morning to go to murphy the warrior had left the wise woman in the morning so it was right the circle close at the same time of day it never crossed her mind that he wouldnt be where she looked for him and he was standing in the stone circle the broach in his hand and the mist shimmering like the breath of ghosts above the grass his head came up when he heard her she saw the surprise the longing before he pulled the shutter down a talent she hadnt known he possessed i thought you might come here his voice wasnt cool that he couldnt manage i was going to leave this for you but since youre here now ill give it to you then ask if youll listen to what i have to say she took the broach was no longer stunned or anxious when it seemed to vibrate in her palm i brought you something she held out the canvas wrapped in heavy paper but he made no move to take it you asked if id paint something for you something that reminded me of you and i have as a goingaway gift he took the canvas but strode two paces away to tilt it unopened against a stone it wont do shannon you might look at it theyll be time for that when ive said whats on my mind youre angry murphy id like to damn right im angry at both of us bloody fools just be quiet he ordered and let me say this in my own way you were right about some things and i was wrong about some but i wasnt wrong that we love each other and are meant ive thought on it most of the past two nights and i see ive asked you for more than ive a right to theres another way that i didnt consider that i turned a blind eye to because it was easier than looking straight at it im been thinking too she reached out but he stepped back sharply will you wait a damn minute and let me finish im going with you what im going with you to new york if you need more time for courtingor whatever the bloody hell you chose to call it ill give it but youll marry me in the end and make no mistake i wont compromise that compromise staggered she dragged a hand through her hair this is a compromise you cant stay so ill go but the farm the devil take the fucking farm do you think it means more to me than you im good with my hands i can get work wherever its not a matter of a job its important to me that i not live off my wife he shot the words at her daring her to argue you can call me sexist and a fool or whatever you choose but it doesnt change the matter i dont care whether youve a mountain of money or none at all or if you choose to spend it on a big house or fancy cars miser it away or toss it off on one roll of dice whats an issue to me is not that i support you but that i support myself she closed her mouth for a minute and tried to calm i can hardly call you a fool for making a perfectly sane statement but i can call you one for even thinking about giving up the farm selling it im not an idiot none of my family are interested in farming so ill speak with mr mcnee and feeney and some of the others its good land his gaze swept past her and for a moment held pain as it traveled over the hills its good land he repeated and theyd value it oh thats fine her voice rose on fresh passion toss away your heritage your home why dont you offer to cut out your heart while youre at it i cant live without you he said simply and i wont its dirt and stone dont ever let me hear you say that she fired up flashed over its everything to you oh you know how to make me feel small and selfish i wont have it she turned fisting her hands as she strode from stone to stone then she leaned heavily against one as it struck and struck hard that this was it from the beginning it had been spiraling toward this she steadied herself and turned back so that she could see his face odd she thought that she was suddenly so calm so sure youd give it up for me the thing that makes you what you are she shook her head before he could answer this is funny really funny i searched my soul last night and the night before part of it i ripped out to do that painting and when i finally took a good long look i knew i wasnt going anywhere she saw the light come into his eyes before he carefully controlled it again youre saying youd stay do without what you want is that supposed to comfort me knowing youre here but unhappy im giving up a lot really making a sacrifice with a half laugh she combed her fingers through her hair i finally figured that out too im leaving new york you cant smell the grass there or see horses grazing you cant watch the light strike over the fields in a way that makes your throat hurt im trading the sound of traffic for the sound of mockingbirds and larks its going to be real tough to live with that she stuffed her hands in her pockets and began to pace in a way that warned him not to touch her my friendsacquaintances mostly will think of me with amusement now and again and shake their heads perhaps some of them will come to visit and see just what ive given up the fast lane for im trading that for family for people ive felt closer to than almost anyone ive known thats a bad deal all right she stopped looking out between the stones as the warming sun burned off the mist then theres my career that allimportant ladder to climb five years more and i guarantee i would have had that metaphorical key to the executive washroom no question shannon bodines got the drive shes got the talent shes got the ambition and she doesnt blink at sixtyhour weeks ive put in plenty of those weeks murphy and it occurs to me that not one of them ever gave me the joy or the simple satisfaction ive felt since the first time i picked up a paintbrush here in ireland so i guess its going to be real tough for me to turn in my armani jacket for a smock she turned back that leaves one last thing by my calculation im back in new york boosting myself up the next rung on that ladder and im alone while the man who loves me is three thousand miles away she lifted her hands there doesnt seem to be any contest im giving up nothing because theres nothing there thats the bright flash i had last night theres nothing there i want or need or love its all right here right here with you but you had to jump right in didnt you she tossed out when he would have stepped forward now ill never be able to throw in your face during an argument what ive done for you because im not doing anything and i know it and you would have done everything he wasnt sure he could speak and when he did it was only one unsteady sentence youre staying with me she circled over to where hed balanced the painting with impatient rips she tore the protective paper aside look at this and tell me what you see a man and a woman on a white horse their faces as familiar to him as his own in a land washed with light the stone circle in the background with two of the cross stones that had fallen still in place the copper brooch clipped to a swirling cape but what he saw most was that while the man held the horse from bolting with one hand his other held the woman close and she him theyre together i didnt mean to paint them that way he was supposed to be riding away as he did leaving her when she begged him to stay when she pleaded and cast aside every iota of pride and wept shannon took a careful breath and finished telling him what she had seen in her mind and her heart when shed painted he left her because he was a soldier and his life was battles i imagine wars demand to be tended just as the land does he wanted to marry her but he wouldnt stay and she needed him to stay more than she needed marriage though she knew she was carrying his child murphys gaze shot up arrested on her face his child she never told him it may have made the difference but she never told him she wanted him to stay for her to put his sword aside because he loved her more than what he was when he wouldnt they fought here right here and said things to each other to wound because each was wounded he gave her back the broach in anger not in memory as the legend suggests and rode away from her always believing shed wait she cursed him as he left him and shouted out that hed never have peace anymore than she hed never have it until he loved her enough to give up everything else shannon pressed the broach into his palm kept hers over it she saw in the fire when he fell in battle when he bled and died and she delivered his child alone shes been waiting endlessly for him to love her enough ive wondered for a long time tried to see it and never could knowing the answers spoils the magic she set the canvas aside so it would no longer be between them theyre together now i want to stay murphy not her choice not my mothers mine i want to make a life here with you i swear i love you enough he took her hand brought it fiercely to his lips will you let me court you shannon no it came out on a broken laugh but ill let you marry me murphy i can settle for that he pulled her against him buried his face in her hair youre the one shannon youre the only one for me i know closing her eyes she rested her head on his heart it beat there strong and steady as he was love she thought closed every circle lets go home murphy she murmured ill cook you breakfast
