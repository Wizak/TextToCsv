a hell of a woman by jim thompson copyright id gotten out of my car and was running for the porch when i saw her she was peering through the curtains of the door and a flash of lightning lit up the dark glass for an instant framing her face like a picture and it wasnt a pretty picture by any means she was about as far from being a raving beauty as i was but something about it kind of got me i tripped over a crack and almost went sprawling when i looked up again she was gone and the curtains were motionless i limped on up the steps set my sample case down and rang the bell i stepped back from the door and waited working up a big smile taking a gander around the yard it was a big oldfashioned dwelling a halfmile or so beyond the state university campus and the only house in that block judging by its appearance and location i guessed that it had probably been a farmhouse at one time i punched the bell again i held my finger on it listening to its dimly shrill clatter inside the house i pulled the screen open and began pounding on the door you did things like that when you worked for payezee stores you got used to people who hid when they saw you coming the door flew open while i was still beating on it i took one look at this dame and moved back fast it wasnt the young one the hauntedlooking babe id seen peering through the curtains this was an old biddy with a beak like a hawk and closeset mean little eyes she was about seventy i dont know how anyone could have got that ugly in less than seventy years but she looked plenty hale and hearty she was carrying a heavy cane and i got the impression that she was all ready to use it on me sorry to disturb you i said quickly im mr dillon payezee stores i wonder if go way she snarled get out of here we dont buy from peddlers you dont understand i said of course we would like to open an account for you but what i really stopped by for was some information i understand you had a pete hendrickson working here for you did some yard work and so on i wonder if you could tell me where i can find him she hesitated squinting at me craftily he owes you some money huh she said you want to find him an make him pay not at all i lied its the other way around in fact we accidentally collected too much from him and we want to i bet you do she let out with an ugly cackle i just bet you collected too much from that drunken lazy bum no one never got nothing from pete hendrickson but a lot of sass and excuses i grinned and shrugged usually you had to do it the other way because its damned seldom that even a mans worst enemies will tip him off to a bill collector but once in a while you find someone real low down someone who just naturally likes to see a guy get it in the neck and thats the way it was with this old witch mean and lazy she said wouldnt do nothing and wanted two prices for doing it sneaks off an gets hisseif another job when hes supposed to be workin for me i told him hed be sorry she gave me petes address also the name of his employer it was a greenhouse out on lake drive only a few blocks from where i was now and hed been working there about ten days he hadnt made a payday yet but he was just about due he came whinin and beggin around here last night she said tryin to borrow a few dollars until he could get his wages i guess you know what i told him i can imagine i said now as long as im here id like to show you some very special items which huhuh no siree she started to close the door just let me show them to you i said and i stooped down and flipped the sample case open i laid the stuff out in the lid talking fast watching her face for an expression of interest what about this spread make you a very nice price on that or this toilet set were practically giving it away lady well some stockings a shawl gloves house slippers if i dont have your size here i can huhuh nope she wagged her head firmly i got no money for such folderol mister you dont need any i said hardly any just a very small payment now on any or all of these items and you can set your own terms on the balance take as long to pay as you like ill bet she cackled just like pete hendrickson huh you better go on mister what about the other lady i said that other young lady im sure theres something here shed like to have huh she grunted and how do you figger shed pay for anything i figured shed probably use money i said but maybe shes got something better iwas just being snotty understand ididnt like her and id gotten everything out of her that i was going to get so why be polite i started repacking the stuff jamming it in any old whichway because that junk was hard to hurt then she spoke again and there was a sly wheedling note to her voice that brought my head up with a start you like that niece o mine mister you think shes pretty why yes i said i thought she was a very attractive young lady she minds good too mister i tell her to do somethin and she does it no matter what i said that was swell or fine or something of the kind whatever a guy does say in a situation like that she pointed down at the sample case that chest of silverware mister how much you gettin on that i opened the chest and showed it to her i said i really hadnt intended to sell it it was such a bargain i was saving it for myself service for eight lady and every piece of it solid heavysterling plate we usually get seventyfive dollars for it but were closing out these last few sets at thirtytwo ninetyfive she nodded grinning at me slyly you think my niece you think she could pay for it mister you could fix it up some way sos she could pay for it why im sure of it i said ill have to talk with her first of course but you let me talk to her first she said you wait here she went away leaving the door open i lighted a cigarette and waited and no ill swear to it on a stack of bibles i didnt have any idea of what the old gal was up to i knew she was pretty low down but id never known many people who werent i thought she was acting pretty goofy but most of payezees customers were goofs people with good sense didnt trade with outfits like ours i waited wincing a little when there was a sudden flash of lightning wondering how many more goddamned days it was going to go on raining it had been raining for almost three weeks straight now and what it had done to my job was murder sales way to hell down collections way to hell off you just cant do good doortodoor work in rainy weather you cant get the people to open up and with accounts like mine a lot of day laborers and the like it didnt do much good when they did open up theyd been laid off on account of the weather you could cuss them and threaten them but you just couldnt get what they didnt have i was getting fifty a week salaryjust about enough to run my car my earnings had to come from commissions and i hadnt been pulling down any oh i was making something sure but not nearly enough to get by on id kept going by doctoring my accounts pocketing part of the collections and altering the accountcards accordingly right now i was in the hole for better than three hundred dollars and if someone should squawk before i could square up i swore under my breath flipping my cigarette into the yard i turned back to the door and there she was the girl she was in her early twenties i believe although im not the best judge of ages when it comes to women she had a mass of wavy blonde hair kind of chopped off rather than bobbed and her eyes were dark and maybe they werent the biggest eyes id ever seen on a gal but in that thin white face they seemed tobe she was wearing a white wraparound the sort of getup you see on waitresses and lady barbers the neck of it came down in a deep v and you could see she had plenty of what it takes in that area but below that huhuh out around the ag college i had an account or two out there the guys would have said she was poor for beef fine for milk she pushed the screen door open i picked up the sample case and went in she hadnt spoken to me yet and she didnt now shed turned and was walking down the hall almost before got inside walking with her shoulders kind of slumped as though she were tipping forward i followed her thinking maybe she didnt have much there in the rear but there wasnt anything wrong with the shape of it we went through the living room the dining room the kitchen her in the lead me walking pretty fast to keep up with her there was no sign of the old woman the only sound came from our footsteps and the occasional clashes of thunder i began to get an uneasy sickish feeling in the pit of my stomach if i hadnt needed to make a sale so badly id have walked out there was a door leading off the kitchen she went through it and i followed her kind of edging around her keeping my eyes on her wanting to say something and not knowing what the hell it would be it was a small bedroom a room with a bed in it rather and a washstand with an oldfashioned bowl and pitcher the shades were drawn but quite a bit of light seeped in around their edges she closed the door and turned her back started fumbling with the belt of the wraparound and i got the pitch then of course but it was too damned late too late to stop her the dress fell to the floor she had nothing on underneath it she turned back around i didnt want to look i felt sick and sore and ashamed and me i dont get ashamed easy but i just couldnt help myself i had to look even if i never looked at anything else again there was a welt across her like a hot iron might make or a stick or a cane and there was a drop of blood she stood head bowed waiting her teeth were clenched tightly but i could see the trembling of her chin i said god god honey and i stooped and picked up the wraparound because i wanted her i guess id wanted her right from the moment id seen her at the door a picture lit up by lightning but i wouldnt have taken her this way if id been paid to so i started to get this doohickey back around her but the way things worked out i didnt quite get the job done not right at the moment anyway i was fumbling with the damned thing telling her not to cry she was a baby girl and a sweet child and i wouldnt hurt her for the world and finally she looked up into my face and i guess she must have liked what she saw there as well as i liked what i saw in her she leaned into me snuggled up against me with her head buried against my chest she put her arms around me and i put mine around her we stood there together holding on to each other for dear life me patting her on the head and telling her there wasnt a goddamned thing to cry about telling her she was a baby girl and a honey child and old dolly dillon was going to take care of her it seems funny as hell now that i look back on it strange i mean me a guy like me in a bedroom with an armful of naked woman and not even thinking about her being naked just thinking about her without thinking about her nakedness thats the way it was though exactly the way it was ill swear to it on a stack of bibles i got her soothed down finally i helped her back into the dress and we sat down on the edge of the bed talking in whispers her first name was mona her last was the same as her aunts farrell so far as she knew that is all she had to go on was what the old bitch told her she couldnt remember living with anyone else she didnt have any other relatives that she knew of why dont you clear out i said she couldnt stop you shed get in plenty of trouble if she tried to i she shook her head vaguely i wouldnt know what to do dolly where to go i i just wouldnt know hell do anything i said theres plenty of things you could do slinging hash ushering in a movie sales clerking housework if you couldnt find anything else i know but but but what you can swing it honey dont tell her youre leaving if you dont want to just pull out and dont come back you get out now and then dont you she doesnt keep you inside all the time no yes she nodded she got out quite a bit downtown and around the neighborhood to shop for the old woman well then i said i ccouldnt dolly i sighed i guessed she couldnt either she was too beatdown completely lacking in confidence if there was someone to take her away from here keep her going until she was built up a little she was looking at me apologetically humbly begging me with her eyes i looked down at the floor what the hell did she expect me to do anyway i was already doing a damned sight more than i should well i said youll be all right for the present ill leave the silverware here for you the old girl wont know that that shell lay off of you for a while ddolly maybe youd better make it frank i said trying to steer her away from the important thing dolly i laughed at myself now aint that a hell of a handle for a big ugly guy like me to have youre not ugly she said youre pret is that why they call you that because youre so so yeah i said im a real pretty guy i am pretty damned tough and ornery and pretty apt to stay that way youre nice she said i never met anyone who was nice before i told her the world was full of nice people id have hated to try to prove it to her but i said it anyway youll get along swell once youre away from here so why dont you give yourself a break honey let me give you one i can tell the cops what no she gripped my arm so hard i almost jumped no dolly youve got to promise but baby i said thats all bushwa shes handed you they wont do anything to you shes the one that no they wouldnt believe me shed say i was lying and shed make me say it and aafterwards afterwards when she got me alone her voice trailed off into terrified silence i put my arm back around her all right honey i said ill think of something else you just sit tight and i paused remembering how quick the old woman had come out with her offer have you had to do anything like this before mona has she made you she didnt speak but her head moved up and down a faint flush spread under the delicate white of her face just people stopping by like i did again a reluctant nod mmostly that was good if you know what i mean her aunt would pull that on the wrong guy the right one rather and shed be in the jug but fast well she wont do it any more i said no i wont give you away so far as shell know everything went off per schedule thats the angle see ill be coming back with plenty of other nice things and i dont want you bothered she raised her head again and her eyes searched my face will you dolly wwill you come back didnt i say so i said ill be back and ill get you away from here just as soon as i do its going to take a little working out know what i mean its kind of complicated the way im set up you see well im a married man she nodded i was married so what it didnt mean anything to her i guess it wouldnt mean anything after what shed been through yeah i went on been married for years and this job i got it keeps me humping to make a living that didnt register either all she knew was that i had a hell of a lot more than she had it made me a little sore the way she was acting but yet i kind of liked it she was so damned trusting so sure that id work things out no matter how tough they were i hadnt had many people believe in me like that many hell any she smiled at me shyly the first time shed really smiled since id met her she took my hand and moved it over her breast do you want to dolly i wouldnt mind with you maybe next time i said right now i think id better be shoving off the smile faded she started to ask me if i minded about the others i said why would i mind for gods sake and i gave her a kiss that made her gasp because i did want her and i wasnt coming back and when a girl offers you that all that she has to offer you ought to be damned careful how you turn it down i took the silver chest out of my case and put it on the dresser i gave her another kiss told her not to worry about a thing and left the old hag her aunt was in the hallway grinning and rubbing her hands together i wanted to bat her in her goddamned rotten puss but of course i didnt you got something there lady i told her take good care of it because im going to be back for more she cackled and smirked bring me a nice coat huh mister you got some nice winter coats i got more coats than you can stack in a barn i said nothing second hand get me and im not trading for anything secondhand i come by here and find someone else in the sack its no deal you leave it to me mister she said eagerly whenll you be back tomorrow i said or maybe the next day im liable to drop by any old time so dont try any doublingup on me if you want that coat she promised she wouldnt i opened the door and ran back down the walk to my car it was still pouring down rain it looked like it was going to rain forever and i owed the company another thirtythree dollars thirtytwo nintyfive to be exact youre doing swell dolly i told myself yes sir dillon youre doing all rightyou think this staples character is stupid you think thats how he got the job of checking on characters like you you think he aint the meanest toughest sonofabitch in the payezee chain goddamn i thought double goddamn and a carton of hells then i shoved my car into gear and got going it was only fourthirty i had plenty of time to get out to the greenhouse and see pete hendrickson before he knocked off for the day and if pete wasnt a real good boy suddenly i grinned to myself grinned and scowled at the same time hed gotten to that poor damned girl mona id have bet money on it the old woman would have tried to pay him off that way and pete wouldnt have turned it down hed let his bills go to hell let me chase all over town hunting for him and do that to her and even if he hadnt he was still no good and i needed every nickle of what he owed us i parked in front of the greenhouse in front of the office that is i reached into the pocket of the car took out a sheaf of papers and thumbed through them rapidly i found his sales contract a contract that was also an assignment of wages you had to look for it a little because of the fine print but it was there all right all legal and airtight i took it into the office and presented it to petes boss he paid off like a slot machine thirtyeight bucks and not a word of argument he counted it out to me and then i recounted it and while i was still standing there he told a clerk to go and get pete i finished the count fast and beat it wage assignments and garnishees employers just naturally dont like the things they dont like to be bothered with them and they dont like employees who cause them to be bothered pete was going to get the gate i figured id better be some place else when he did i drove down the street a few blocks to a beer joint i ordered a pitcher of beer carried it back to a rear booth and took down half of it at a gulp then i spread a blank contract out on the table and made out a cash sale to mona farrell for thirtytwo ninetyfive that was one thing off my mind that took care of the silver with five bucks left over now if this rain would only stop and i could get in a few good weeks in a row i began to feel a little better not quite so damned blue and hopeless i ordered another pitcher of beer sipping it slowly this time i thought what a sweet kid that mona was and i wondered why i couldnt have married her instead of a goddamned bag like joyce that joyce now there was a number for you kid sloppybutt princess leadinthetail queen of the cigarette girls and a free pinch with every pack id thought she was hot stuff but it hadnt been recently brother i may have been stupid to begin with but i wised up fast joyce a lazy selfish dirty slob like joyce for a wife why couldnt it have been mona why was it that every time i thought i was getting a break it went sour on me i glanced at the clock ten minutes of six i stepped to the telephone and dialed the store staples sounded just the same as usual smooth oily softvoiced i told him i was chasing a skip through the sticks and i thought id wait until morning to check in quite all right frank he said hows it going anyway any lead yet on hendrickson nothing yet ilied but ive had a fairly good day i made a cash sale on that silver special good boy he said now if you can just get a line on hendrickson his voice lingered over the name underlined it he was more than five miles away but i felt like he was right there grinning at me watching me waiting for me to trap myself what about it frank he said what about that thirtyeight dollars hendrickson owes us what the hell you think ive been doing i said i havent been sitting around on my can in some nice dry office all day give me a little time for gods sake the phone was silent for a moment then he laughed softly not too much time frank he said why not put in a little extra effort eh as long as youre working over use that shrewd brain of yours i cant tell you how delighted id be if you could bring that hendrickson money in the morning well that makes two of us i said ill do the best i can i said goodnight and hung up the receiver i drank the rest of my beer not enjoying it very much had he been giving me a hint a warning why was he bearing down so hard on this one account hendrickson was a dead beat sure but practically all of our customers were they seldom paid unless they were made to they traded with us because they couldnt get credit anywhere else why with at least a hundred other skips and nopays to pick on had staples jumped me about this one i didnt like it it might be the beginning of the end the first step toward the jailhouse because if he caught me tapping one account hed figure id tapped the others hed check on all the others of course hed done things like this before kind of like this youd knock yourself out and have a pretty good day maybe and instead of a pat on the head youd get what id got tonight you know maybe youve worked for guys like that they just slide over what youve done and needle you about something else the first damned thing that pops into their minds that has to be done too and what the hell are you waiting on soso that must be it i decided hoped that was it you couldnt satisfy staples the more you did the more you had to do i went up to the bar and paid my check i walked to the door and looked out into the rain turning up my coat collar getting ready to make a run for my car night was setting in early but it wasnt quite dark yet i could see pretty good and i saw him down near the end of the building a big husky guy in work clothes standing back under the eaves of the building i couldnt get to my car without passing him i guessed id stopped a little too close to that greenhouse i went back to the bar and ordered a quart of beer to take out gripping it by the neck i sauntered out the door maybe he didnt see me right away or maybe he was just trying to work his nerve up anyway i was almost parallel with him before he moved out from under the eaves and placed himself in front of me i stopped and backed up a step or two why pete i said hows it going boy you sonabitch dillon he said you get my chob hah you get chob now i get you oh now pete i said you brought it on yourself fellow we trust you and try to treat you nice and you you lie chunk you sell me suit no good like paper it years in chail you should be chunk seller tief robber a fine chob i get and because i no pay for chunk you you i fix you dillon he lowered his head clubbed his big hands into fists i moved back another step tightened my grip on the bottle i was carrying it back behind my thigh he hadnt seen it yet jail huh i said youve hit a few jails yourself havent you pete you keep on fooling around with me and youll land in another one it was just a guess but it stopped him for a moment you couldnt go very far wrong in guessing that a payezee customer had made the clink so he sputtered in chail i haf been and my time i serve dot has nodding to do mit dis you what about a sentence for rape i said spit it out goddamn you tell me you didnt do it tell me you didnt have that poor sick starvedtodeath kid i moved in on him not giving him a chance to deny it i knew damned well that he had and it made me halfcrazy to think about it come on you ugly overgrown sonofabitch i said come on and get it and he came on with a rush i sidestepped swinging the bottle like a bat my feet slipped in the mud i caught him squarely across the bridge of the nose and he went down sprawling but his right fist got me as he went by it landed skidding just below my heart and if i hadnt bounced back against the building id have gone down with him i was doubled up for a moment feeling like id never breathe again then i got pulled together a little and i staggered over to where he was he wasnt completely out but there wasnt any more fight in him there was no sense in socking him again or giving him a kick in the head i grabbed him by the collar and dragged him over against the side of the building i propped him up so that he was kind of out of the rain and wouldnt get run over and then i knocked the beer open on a rock and pushed it into his hand it wasnt the kind of treatment hed expected or was used to he looked up at me like a beaten dog on an impulse or maybe it was a hunch i took five ones from my pocket and dropped them into his lap im sorry about the job i said maybe i can turn up another one for you like to have me do that let you know if i hear of anything he nodded slowly brushing the blood away from his nose i like yess bbut but vy dillon mister dillon vy you do dis an den you do no choice i shrugged the company says get the money i have to get it you say you want to fight i fight when i have my own way well you can see for yourself i treat you like a longlost brother give you dough out of my own pocket try to find another job for you he took a drink of the beer took another one he belched and shook his head iss badt he said vy you do it mister dillon soch a nice man vy you york for bad peoples i told him he had me there i guessed i was just such a nice guy that people took advantage of me then i told him to take it easy and headed for home my ribs ached like hell and couldnt get staples off my mind but in spite of the pain and the worry i laughed out loud what a character if people kept on telling me i was a nice guy i might start believing them and yet well what was so damned funny about that what the hell was there to laugh about id never hurt anyone if i could get out of it id given plenty of people breaks when i didnt have to like today for example just take today now pretty good huh youre damn well right it was how many other guys would have passed up mona and given a hand to a guy whod tried to murder em pete had the right dope it wasnt me but the job and i didnt know how to get out of it any more than i knew how id got into it i did you ever think much about jobs i mean some of the jobs people land in you see a guy giving haircuts to dogs or maybe going along the curb with a shovel scooping up horse manure and you think now why is the silly bastard doing that he looks fairly bright about as bright as anyone else why the hell does he do that for a living you kind of grin and look down your nose at him you think hes nuts know what i mean or he doesnt have any ambition and then you take a good look at yourself and you stop wondering about the other guy youve got all your hands and feet your health is okay and you make a nice appearance and ambition man youve got it youre young i guess youd call thirty young and youre strong you dont have much education but youve got more than plenty of other people who go to the top and yet with all that with all youve had to do with this is as far as youve got and something tells you youre not going much farther if any and theres nothing to be done about it now of course but you cant stop hoping you cant stop wondering maybe you had too much ambition maybe that was the trouble you couldnt see yourself spending forty years moving up from office boy to president so you signed on with a circulation crew you worked the magazines from one coast to another and then you ran across a nice little brush deal it sounded nice anyway and you worked that until you found something better something that looked better and you moved from that something to another something coffeeandtea premiums dinnerware pennyaday insurance photo coupons cemetery lots hosiery extract and god knows what all you begged for the charities you bought the old gold you went back to the magazines and the brushes and the coffee and tea you made good money a couple of hundred a week sometimes but when you averaged it up the good weeks with the bad it wasnt so good fifty or sixty a week well maybe seventy more than you could make probably behind agas pump or a soda fountain but you had to knock yourself out to do it and you were just standing still you were still there at the starting place and you werent a kid any more so you come to this town and you see this ad man for outside sales and collections good deal for hard worker and you think maybe this is it this sounds like a right job this looks like a right town so you take the job and you settle down in the town and of course neither one of em is right theyre just like all the others the job stinks the town stinks you stink and theres not a goddamned thing you can do about it all you can do is go on like those other guys go on the guy giving haircuts to dogs and the guy sweeping up horse manure hating it hating yourself and hoping we lived in a little fourroom dump on the edge of the business district it wasnt any choice neighborhood know what i mean we had a wrecking yard on one side of us and a railroad spur on the other but it was choice enough for us we were as well off there as we would be anywhere a palace or a shack it always worked out to the same difference if it wasnt a dump to begin with it damned soon got to be all it took was for us to move in i went inside taking off my coat and hat i laid them down on my sample case at least it was clean and took a look around the floor hadnt been swept the ash trays were loaded with butts last nights newspapers were scattered all over the hell nothing was as it should be nothing but dirt and disorder wherever you looked the kitchen sink was filled with dirty dishes there were soiled sticky pans all over the stove shed just got through eating it looked like and of course shed left the butter and everything else sitting out so now the roaches were having themselves a meal those roaches really had a happy home with us they got a hell of a lot more to eat than i did i looked in the bedroom it looked like a cyclone had struck it a cyclone and a dust storm i kicked the bathroom door open and went in it was one of her good days i guess here it was only seven oclock at night and shed actually got some clothes on not many just a garter belt and some shoes and stockings but that was damned good for her she drew a lipstick over her mouth squinting at me in the medicine cabinet mirror well she drawled if it isnt the king and just as polite as ever too okay i said you can hop back into your nightgown ive seen you before and i still say theres better ones on sidewalks ohyeah her eyes flashed you rotten bastard when i think of all the good guys i passed up to marry you i passed them up i said you mean lined em up dont you youre a goddamned liar i nnever she dropped the lipstick into the sink and whirled around facing me dolly she said oh dolly hon whats the matter with us us what do you mean us i said im out knocking myself out every day i work my can off and what the hell do i get for it not a goddamn thing thats what not even a decent meal or a clean bed or even a place where i can sit down without a lot of cockroaches swarming all over me i she bit her lip i know dolly but they just keep coming back those insects no matter what i do and i can just work from morning until night and this place always looks the same and well i guess i just get tired dolly there doesnt seem to be any sense to it theres nothing here to work with the sink keeps stopping up and theres big cracks in the floor and so what about the other places weve lived i guess you kept them all clean and pretty weve never lived in a really nice place dolly any place where i had a chance its always been some dump like this one you mean they got to be dumps i said after you lazed and loafed around and let everything go to hell you just dont give a damn thats all why dammit you should have seen what my mother had to work with how nice she kept the place we lived in seven kids in an east side coldwater tenement and everything was as shiny and spotless all right she yelled but im not your mother im not some other woman im me get me me me and youre bragging about it i said her mouth opened and closed she gave me a long slow look and turned back to the mirror okay i said okay youre a princess charming and im a heel i know you dont have it easy i know it would be a lot better if i made more money and i wish to god i could but i cant and i cant help it so why not make the best of things as they are im through talking she said i might have known it was no use goddammit i said im apologizing ive been out in the rain all day while you were lying in the sack and i come home to a goddamned pig pen and im sick and tired and worried and sing em she said sing em king i said i was sorry i said i apologize now what about chasing your pets out of the grub and fixing me some supper fix your own damned supper you wouldnt like anything i fixed she laid down the lipstick and picked up an eyebrow pencil a crazy blinding pain speared through my forehead joyce said i said i was sorry joyce im asking you to please fix me some supper joyce please understand please keep on asking she said its a pleasure to refuse she went on making with the eyebrow pencil youd have thought i wasnt there baby i said im telling you im kidding you not you better drag tail into that kitchen while its still fastened onto you you screw around with me a little more and youll have to carry it in a satchel now arent you sweet she said im warning you joyce im giving you one last chance all hail the king she made a noise with her lips heres a kiss for you king and heres one for you i said i brought it up from the belt the sweetest left hook you ever saw in your life she spun around on her heels and flopped backwards right into the tub full of dirty bath water andjesus did it make a mess out of her i leaned against the door laughing she scrambled out of the tub dripping with that dirty soapy scum and reached for a towel i hadnt really hurt her you know why hell if id wanted to give her a full hook id taken her head off she began drying herself not saying anything at first and i kind of stopped laughing then she said something that was funny as hell and yet it was kind of sad she said it sort of thoughtful and softvoiced as though it was the most important thing in the world that was my last good pair of stockings dolly you ruined my only pair of stockings aah hell i said ill give you another pair ive got some in my sample case i cant wear those they never fit around the heel i guess ill just have to go barelegged go i said im leaving now tonight i dont want anything from you i can pawn my watch and my ring get enough to get by on until i land a job all i want is to get away from here i told her all right if she wanted to be stupid those number fives of hers werent nailed to the floor but think you ought to mull it over a little first you ought to stick around anyway until you run across a job you know theres no nightclubs in a burg like this ill find something theres no law that says have to stay in this town why the hell didnt you get a job before this i said if youd ever contributed anything tried to help out a little why should i why should i want to i should get out and work for a guy that couldnt even say a nice word in church her voice rose and went down again all right dolly i said it all a while ago im me not someone else maybe i should have done a lot of things and maybe you should have but we didnt and we wouldnt if we had it to do over again now if youll excuse me let me get cleaned up a little why so damned modest all of a sudden i said were still married we wont be any longer that i can help it will you please leave now dolly i shrugged and started out the door okay i said im going downtown and get some chow good luck and my best regards to the boys on the vice squad ddolly is that all you can say at a time like this what do you want me to say peter peter pumpkin eater ddont you would you like to kiss me goodbye i jerked my head at the mirror that i said threeguesses toots and the secret word is still no i went on out turning my back like a damned fool and the next thing i knew a scrubbing brush socked me in the skull it hurt like hell and the dirty names she was yelling at me didnt exactly help it but i didnt sock her any more or even curse back at her id said enough i guessed id done enough i loaded my sample case into the car and took off for town i killed a couple hours eating and doctoring my account cards and went back home she was gone but her memory lingered on if you know what i mean shed left me something to remember her by the bedroom windows were pushed up to the top and the bed was soaked with rain my clothes well i just didnt have any clothes shed poured ink all over my shirts shed taken a pair of scissors and cut big holes in my suit the only other suit i had my neckties and handkerchiefs were snipped to pieces all my socks and underwear were stuffed into the toilet a real swell kid didnt i tell you a regular little doll id have to do something nice for her if i ever ran into her again i went to work straightening things out the best i could and it must have been two in the morning before i got through and stretched out on the lounge worn out burned up wondering ijust couldnt get it you know why if she didnt like a guy and didnt want to get along with him had she gone to so damned much trouble to get him id met her in houston about three years ago i was crew manager on a magazine deal and she was pushing cigarettes in this dive and i used to drop in for a ball every night or so well she started playing for me right from the beginning the way she hung over my table youd have thought she was the cloth i couldnt lift a drink without seeing her through the bottom of the glass so so one thing led to another and i began taking her home from work whats a guy going to do anyway when a chick keeps throwing herself at him i left her at her door a few nights and then she let me come inside and she had one of the nicest little efficiency apartments you ever saw i gqess they had maid service in this joint and with just herself to look after she got by pretty good not that i made any inspection of the place i had my mind on something else so i said howsa about it honey and boing she hauled off and slapped me in the kisser i jumped up and started to leave she started crying she said iwouldnt think she was a nice girl if she did i wouldnt want to marry her and id throw it up to her afterwards and i said aw now honey what kind of a guy do you no now wait a minute i think im getting this thing all fouled up i believe it was doris who acted that way the gal i was married to before joyce yeah it must have been doris or was it ellen well it doesnt make much difference they were all alike they all turned out the same way so as i was saying i said what kind of a guy do you think i am and she said they said i think youre nice i i went to sleep payezee had seventyfive stores across the country ill tell you about this one the one i worked for and youll know about them all it was on a side street a twelvefootfront place between a shine parlor and a fruit stand it had two small show windows with about a hundred items in each one mens suits womens dresses work clothes bathrobes wristwatches dresser sets novelties more stuff than i can name why it was there i dont know because it wasnt once in a month of saturdays that we got a customer off the street practically all the selling was done on the outside by me and five other guys we did a volume of about fifteen grand a month with collections running about seventyfive per cent and yeah thats low all right but our markup wasnt with a markup of three hundred per cent you can take a big loss on collections youll still do better on a fifteeng volume than most stores do on fifty i was a little late getting in that morning and the other collectorsalesmen were already gone a heavyset guy a just looking customer was thumbing through the rack of mens jackets staples was in the office at the rear a space separated from the rest of the store by a walltowall counter payezee didnt have the usual office employees just the credit menmanagers like staples i laid out my collection cards and cash on the counter and he checked one against the other he was a little guy of about fifty grayhaired paunchy sort of babymouthed back in the days when he was ringing doorbells theyd called him the weeper hed get on some poor bastards doorstep or maybe call on him on the job and then hed howl and cry and carry on until they could hear him in the next county he wasnt up to the rough stuff so hed pull that and theyd have to come across to get rid of him he talked kind of sissified not with a lisp exactly although you kept expecting one he finished the check and smiled at me pleasantly he removed his glasses polished them slowly and put them back on again frank he said im disappointed in you very very disappointed yeah i said whats the beef now such clumsiness frank such preposterous ineptness we did things much better in my day why in the world didnt you steal from the profit and loss file the inactive p and ls if you were at all clever you might have got away with it for years he shook his head sadly looking like he was about to cry i forced a laugh steal what the hell you handing me staples oh frank please he held up a hand youre making this very painful pete hendricksons employer called me yesterday his exemployer i should say it seems that he wasnt very favorably impressed with our way of doing business and he felt constrained to tell me so so what i said frank all right i said i borrowed thirtyeight bucks ill have it back for you by the end of the week i see and what about the rest of it what rest i said who you trying to crap anyway but i knew it was no use he sighed and shook his head looking at me sorrowfully ive only had time to spot check your accounts frank but ive already found a dozen uh defalcations why not get it off your chest my boy give me the total amount of the shortage ill find out anyway i couldnt help it i said it was the rain its cleared up now and if youll just give me a few weeks how much frank ive got it all written down i took out my notebook and showed him you can see for yourself i was going to pay it back hell if i didnt intend to pay it back i wouldnt have written it down would i weel yes he pursed his lips yes i think you would have i know i would have it looks much better in such unpleasant eventualities as the present one now wait a minute i said i three hundred and fortyfive dollars eh why dont you just dig it up like a good boy and well consider the matter closed ill write you a check i said for gods sake staples if i had any money or if id been able to beg or borrow any i wouldnt have taken this mmm i suppose so what about your car whos got a car talk to the finance company furniture nothing i rent furnished im telling you staples i dont have it and theres no way ican get it all i can do is i see he said well thats certainly too bad isnt it very depressing the company isnt at all vindictive in these matters but i suppose youre familiar with the law of this state anything over fifty dollars is grand larceny look i said whats that going to make you what the hell good is it going to do to have me slapped in jail god if youll just well it might do quite a bit of good he said a man faced with a long prison sentence often thinks of resources hes previously overlooked thats been our experience but i cant i wont i said theres no one that will help me i havent seen any of my relatives in years and theyre all poor as hell anyway i dont have any close friends or what about your wife im telling you i said theres just one way can get that dough give me six weeks give me a month three weeks ill work seven days a week sixteen hours a day until youve got to staples just a few weeks a oh i couldnt do that frank he shook his head firmly id love to but i honestly couldnt officer for gods sake officer it was the guy id thought was a just looking customer he sauntered up behind me a toothpick bobbling in the corner of his mouth and gripped me by the elbow okay buster he said lets go bye bye staples beamed at him he smiled at me i cant bear to say goodbye frank shall we just make it au revoir it may sound funny but it was the first time in my life id been in jail thats the gods truth and im kidding you not id crisscrossed the country been in every state in the union at one time or another and some of the deals id worked were as raw as a tackfactory whore but id never made the can guys all around me did guys working right across the street from me but never me i guess i just dont look like a guy whod get out of line i may talk and act that way but i dont look it and i dont if you know what i mean really feel it it was about ten oclock in the morning by the time they got me booked and locked up i looked around the tank the bullpen and im not snobbish or anything you understand but i went over in a corner and sat down by myself i just couldnt take it somehow i couldnt believe that i was part of this that i was in the same boat with these other guys and a lot worse off maybe me old dolly dillon in the jug on a grand larceny rap it was crazy i felt like i was dreaming i knew better but all that day i kept thinking that staples would soften up hed realize that i couldnt raise anything in here and hed withdraw the charge and let me work the debt off i kept thinking that hoping it and i figured out just the proposition id make him my rent was paid for the month and i was paid up with the finance company so id say okay staples heres what ill do with you you buy me a few meal tickets and pay for my gas and oil and everything over that i remembered that the store owed me money two twoandahalf days wages if theyd allow a half for this morning so hell there was twentyfive dollars right there all i actually owed was well call it three hundred in round numbers that wasnt any money for gods sake i could make it up in no time now that joyce had pulled out i knew staples would get me out i mean i knew it and i guess you know he didnt the next day came and passed and i began to think about other angles other ways id get out they were all as hopeless as the staples deal but i dreamed up one after another maybe some crew would hit town and theyd know what i could do and theyd all take up a collection theyd find out where i was some way and or maybe had a big bonus coming from one of the companies id worked for and the check was just now catching up with me or maybe one of my kinfolks back east had passed on and i was down for the insurance or maybe doris would pop up with a roll or ellen or or someone someone had to dammit something had to happen no one did nothing did and it was hard to take brother but it finally sank in on me that that was the way it was going to be i was stuck i couldnt kid myself any longer i thought about mona how she was really the cause of the whole trouble if i hadnt used pete hendricksons money to pay for that silverware staples wouldnt have caught up with me i called myself all kinds of a damned fool and i cussed her a little too i guess but i didnt really have my heart in it i knew id have done the same thing all over again and i wasnt sore at her that much how could you be sore at a sweet helpless kid like that i sat off by myself in a corner of the bullpen thinking about her and getting a nice warm feeling shed come right to me that day put her arms around me and laid her head against my chest shed stood there naked and shivering and shed hugged me tighter and tighter until i seemed to be part of her she was out of this world that little girl not one of these goddamned tramps like i was always latching onto you could really go places with a kid like that youd do anything in the world for her because you knew shed do anything in the world for you and you could just naturally go to town i wondered what shed think when i didnt come back i wondered what would happen to her i closed my eyes and i could almost see it happening the guys coming there to the door and the old woman propositioning them and mona mona there in the bedroom i opened my eyes fast i forced my mind away from her and started thinking about that house id had a feeling about it from the moment i set foot inside the door that it wasnt as it should be you know i couldnt figure out what it was at the time and id had plenty of other things to think about afterwards but now it finally came to me there werent any pictures in the place pictures of people i mean i guess ive probably been in ten thousand of those old houses places occupied by old people and everyone of ems got a flock of pictures on the walls guys with beards and gatesajar collars women in highnecked dresses with legofmutton sleeves boys in buster brown suits and girls in middies and bloomers grandpa jones uncle bill and aunt hattie cousin susies kids all those old houses are like that theyve all got those pictures but this one didnt have a damned one i kept turning it over in my mind and finally i thought so what whats it to you anyway i got kind of sore at myself you know thinking about a thing like that in the spot i was in so i forgot about it went back to worrying about myself and it was days before i thought of it again and by that time i dont know youll have to decide for yourself maybe any time would have been too late maybe it would have turned out the same way anyway i went to jail on wednesday morning i was scheduled for arraignment friday afternoon the turnkey came around at two that day and took me to the showers i bathed and shaved while he stood and watched and then he gave me my clothes i got dressed he led me up a long corridor through a lot of gates to the receiving room he gave my name to the cop behind the desk the cop opened a drawer thumbed through a bunch of envelopes and tossed one on the counter open it up he said anythings missing you say so now i opened it up my wallet was in it and my car keys and a check to the police parking lot okay he said well put your john hancock on this i signed a receipt i thought this was a screwy way to do things put a guy through all this just to go before a judge but like i say id never been in jail and i figured they ought to know what they were doing i put the stuff in my pocket the door to the street was open and i thought man oh man what wouldnt i give to be out there the turnkey had gone back behind the counter he was over at the water cooler rinsing his mouth out and spitting into a big brass gaboon he seemed to have forgotten all about me i stood and waited finally the desk cop looked up at me you like this place mac i guess i got to like it i said beat it he said what the hell you waiting on you got all your junk aint you yes sir i said think you kindly sir and i went out of that damned place so fast i bet i didnt even cast a shadow i was sure it was a mistake see they had me mixed up with some other guy i didnt see how it could be any other way i got my car off the parking lot i came off of it like a bat out of hell and i must have gone four or five blocks before i came to my senses and slowed down this wasnt going to get it how far did i think id go with a financecompany car and a little over two bucks maybe the cops had pulled a boner and maybe staples had decided to give me a break either way i couldnt lose by seeing him if this was on the level swell if not that was swell too at least i could beat his rotten tail off before i went back to jail i parked a few doors below the store i sidled up to the window and glanced through the door he was about halfway down the aisle counting stock it looked like his back to me i jerked the door open fast and went in he started and whirled around he came toward me swiftly hand extended my dear boy im so glad they released you promptly i asked them not to take a moment longer than was necessary i made it very urgent frank well okay i said im not kicking understand but you ask me three days isnt very damned prompt but frank he spread his hands it wasnt three days it was hardly an hour ago that your wife repaid the money my wife a wife i didnt really have now had ponied up the dough hell she couldnt have she wouldnt have if she could staples looked at me expectantly you mean to say you didnt know she didnt tell you she was arranging your release there was a purring pleased note to his voice i didnt know what the situation was or what he might make out of it but a guy like that you dont share your troubles with him well i said i knew she was trying to get it but i didnt think she could i guess its like you say you never know what you can do until you have to do mmm he nodded studying my face i was wondering you know any number of people called the store here for you accounts whod bought from sample pending your delivery i explained the situation to them about your shortage and swell i said why didnt you advertise it in the papers now frank i was only trying to help you you can be very ingratiating when you choose to and i thought some of your clients might like to help youout in your hour of need i shook my head at him the guy was off his goddamned rocker sure they would i said this is saks fifth avenue i got a bunch of millionaire clients i dont practically have to club em over the head to get a onebuck payment well he smiled sheepishly i suppose it was a rather forlorn hope but what i started to say was that i dont believe your wife was among those who called about you so i said nothing he said hastily naturally youd have called her from the jail it just struck me as rather curious your wife not calling and then sending the money in with another woman i thought that possibly uh i shrugged it struck him as curious ill come clean with you i said i didnt call my wife i called all these scrubwomen and dishwashers i got for customers and i said they either laid it on the line or i was through with them really frank hegave me a slap on the arm as a matter of fact this woman the girl who brought the money in wasnt at all unattractive rather dowdy and weatherworn but not bad withal that must have been frances smith i said the neighbors girl joyce probably got herself a job so she sent frances with the money i lit a cigarette casually and dropped the match on the floor that eager foxy look went out of his eyes well frank as long as youre here as long as im here i said ill take the dough ive got coming now frank he pouted you mean youre angry with me youre going to quit well i said i just supposed that not at all im sure youll be extremely scrupulous from now on just about have to you know you can go back to work right now if you like i said i was pretty pooped thought id better wait until monday he let me have twenty bucks against my pay and i drove home the place smelled like a sewer it stank with mildew and rotting food icleaned out the refrigerator piling the stuff onto the junk on the table then i just bundled it all up in the tablecloth dishes and pans and everything and threw the whole mess out into the garbage i opened all the windows and hung the bedding on the line there was still plenty to be done there always would be in that place but i let it go at that i was feeling sort of limp what with all the worry and nerve strain id been through almost too tired to wonder who had bailed me out or why shed done it maybe it would turn out to be a mistake after all it got dark i put the windows back down and drew the shades i hadnt eaten much of anything while i was in jail i couldnt eat that slop so now i was pretty hungry but there wasnt a damned thing in the cupboard but coffee and half a pint of whiskey i took the whiskey in to the lounge and had myself a slug i leaned back and put my feet up i sipped and smoked thinking about the way id been last night and how much better this was thinking how a guy never knew when he was really well off and maybe i hadnt done so bad for myself after all i began to relax i started wondering again now who in the hell did i know who in the name of god could have someone was coming up the walk running almost up the walk and the steps and across the porch i jumped up and threw the door open mona i said mona child what is the she half fell into my arms sobbing out of breath i kicked the door shut and carried her over to the lounge baby i said its all right baby old dollys got you and oh dolly dolly she rocked back and forth hugging me i was sso afraid so afraid you might not be here and dont let her get me dolly take me away help me to get away ive got money enough for both of us dolly pplease please please wait wait a minute i said and i shook her by the shoulders slow down now ill do anything i can honey but ive got to know take it dolly you can have it all but just take me with you she jabbed her hands into the pockets of her faded old coat she pulled them out again and money tumbled into my lap crumpled wads of fives and tens and twenties pplease dolly will you take the money and take me sure i said you bet i will but we got to get a few things straight first you took this money from your aunt yyes this and the other the money i gave to the man at the store i ddidnt know what to think when you didnt come back i knew something awful must have happened to you youd promised to come back and i knew you wouldnt have broken your promise if you could help it anyone as ggood and nice as you were wwouldnt her voice faltered ipatted her hand uncomfortably yeah sure i said i just couldnt help it see what i mean sso i looked your number up in the phone book and i called here i called and called and ffinally today i called the store and the man said the rest of it came out with a rush staples had given her the lowdown on me she knew where the old woman kept her money shed tapped it for enough to get out plus what she had here now with what looked like five or six hundred dollars and me just out from under one larceny rap we were supposed to take off together live happily ever after and so on and i wanted to i wanted her and i was grateful as hell but hell how could i she was looking at me pleading with her eyes ddont you want to dolly was that why you said you were married bbecause you didnt really like me i called and called here and no one no i wasnt lying to you i said my wife left me she doesnt figure in the deal any more so that parts swell but shell kill me when she finds out dolly shell know i took it and she began to cry again a low helpless sobbing that cut through me like a knife its aall right dolly i ddont mean to rnmake you feel bad i gguess i should have known that you ccouldnt really ilike baby i said listen to me honey like isnt the word for the way i feel about you i love you understand youve got to believe that thats why weve got to go slow on this because if we do it the wrong way what youre suggesting well never be together theyll have us both in jail but listen to me let me ask the questions and you answer em youre supposed to be out shopping tonight okay the store was closed and you had to go on to another one that takes care of that now how about this dough your aunt had hidden she doesnt know that you knew about it does she nno but just answer the questions where did she keep it how did you happen to find out about it down in the cellar behind some old boards and boxes i was down there one day cleaning out the furnace and she didnt know i was there she pulled the boards and boxes away and there was a hole in the wall and the money was in it in sort of a little suitcase she took it out and counted it mumbling and cursing acting like she was halfcrazy aand she scared me to death dolly i was afraid sshe might see me and yeah sure i said the old miser act huh did you ever see her down there again when was the last time that was it was the only time about three months ago the stairs are awfully steep and i always go whenever theres anything to uhhuh sure well dont you see honey its all right anyway its all right for the present why hell it might be a year before she misses the dough she saw what i was leading up to and she started getting frantic all over again it might not be a year or even a day the old gal might be checking over the dough right this moment and stop it i said get me baby i said to stop and thats what i mean your aunt doesnt know you took the money she isnt going to know it i go back on the job monday ill have the three hundredodd you got for me within a month or so youll put it back in that satchel and youll put this back tonight and no i yes dont you see honey we havent got any choice if you didnt go home tonight the old gal would look for her dough right away its the first thing shed think of shed know youd taken it and the police would pick you up in no time you dont want that do you you see im right dont you yyes she nodded reluctantly yyou you really do love me dolly i wish i had time for a demonstration i said and i wasnt just woofing but youve been gone pretty long as it is ill drive you back over there drop you off at the shopping center and well get together in a day or two have a hell of a time for ourselves i stuffed the money back into her pockets petting and kidding her until she was smiling she was still pretty nervous and scared but she thought she could swing it all right she had the downstairs bedroom the old woman slept upstairs and once she went up for the night she stayed up its a cinch i said you wont have a bit of trouble baby now lets have one big kiss and then well be on our way we had it i headed the car across town she rode with her head on my shoulder hardly saying a word pretty well at peace with the world and that was the way i wanted her of course but me i wasnt feeling so good mona didnt know how often her aunt counted her money shed only caught her at it the one time but there were probably plenty of other times she didnt know about the old woman could be doing it right along you know when she sent mona out to shop it figured that she would a dame that liked dough as well as she did and if she did it before i got that threefortyfive back it wouldnt take her five minutes to beat the truth out of mona staples would have to return the money and id be returned to jail on a double rap probably the stores charges and a charge of getting mona to steal i wondered if maybe i wasnt playing this the wrong way i couldnt think of any other of course if the old woman had had any real dough it would be different if shed had thousands instead of hundreds enough to do something with you know enough sos you wouldnt mind sticking your neck out well id have known exactly what to do then she was a rotten worthless old bitch she had something coming to her and i was just the boy to deliver it and and hell there didnt have to be much risk some sure but not much because pete hendrickson had something coming to him too and if he wasnt built to be a fall guy id never seen one yes sir i knew just how id use pete a plan popped into my mind almost without me thinking but for a few hundred huhuh or even a few thousand when and if i ever pulled anything like that id be playing for the jackpot one big haul and then mona and suddenly i thought of something baby i said mona honey does your aunt have some other money around the house i mean if she hardly ever digs into this cache in the basement well she hesitated i guess she must have she keeps it in her room probably i dont know because the doors always locked and shes never let me go in there uhhmm i said she must have quite a bit wouldnt you say after all shes got the day to day expenses of the two of you and theyre not very much dolly we eat mostly rice and beans and things that are cheap i have to shop all around buy stuff that the stores are about to throw out we dont spend hardly anything yeah but still ddolly she drew closer to me i didnt wwant to tell you but ive had to do that you know a lot ive had to do it for a long time shes mmade me and thats where jesus it made me sick to think about it hustling this kid making her hustle since shed really been a kid never you mind honey i said you wont have to do it any more so you just dont think about it i dont we were almost there almost to the stores where i was supposed to let her out she started getting the shakes again do i have to dolly ccant we just take the money and i shook my head no baby we cant i mean we really cant wed have to travel wed have to do plenty of traveling wed have to have money to live on we just couldnt make it on this it just aint enough know what i mean well she sat up on the seat turned and looked at me eagerly i could get the rest dolly theres a lot more and i could get it too huh but you said but she hadnt said that id just assumed that shed cleaned out all the old girls cash it was what id have done if id been in a taking mood and i supposed she had too so there was more a lot but maybe there wasnt what did a lot mean to a kid like this my hands were shaking on the wheel i gripped it tighter fighting to keep the excitement out of my voice now lets just keep calm baby i said old dollys in the saddle and theres nothing to get up in the air about nnow now how much is there tell papa baby what do you mmean when you say a well she chewed her lip frowning id have to count off for what i gave the man at the store and this that i for gods sake i said dont stop to do arithmetic problems spit it out just give it to me in round numbers she gave it to me my hands jerked on the wheel i almost ran up on the curb mmona i said baby child sweet thing say that again a hundred will it be enough dolly a hundred thousand dollars i sat and stared at her kind of stunned and she looked at me anxious eyed her breasts rising and falling we were like that for a minute or two her staring at me hopefully and me too shockedstupid to say anything and then her face went dead again and she said id better take her on home its all right dolly im not afraid any more shell kkill me and then itll all be over with and hush your mouth honey child i said she isnt going to kill anyone she isnt get me but she will shell find out and huhuh that aint the way its going to be at all now tell me something baby where did an old bag like that get a hundred thousand dollars well she hesitated im not sure but she couldnt remember much of anything about her early life but the old lady had let drop a few things and piecing it all together she had a pretty good idea about the source of that hundred grand at least it sounded good to me i started up the car again and drove on toward her place thinking wondering just how to put the proposition up to her or whether i really wanted to put it up to her one more thing honey i think this is going to be all right i mean it could be all right i think i can work it out sos you and i can go off together and and i couldnt get the words out what i really wanted to say i swallowed and made another try coming in at it from an angle this pete hendrickson character remember him honey now just suppose that pete she shivered and turned her head you know sick shamed scared just at the mention of petes name i gave her a little love pat and called her a honey lamb im sorry baby we wont talk about pete any more about any of those dirty bastards your aunt made you well never mind what i was going to say was was suppose someone broke into your house and no she said no dolly but baby if no she said again youre too nice youve done too much i couldnt let you do it i swallowed feeling like i ought to be disappointed because this was the first crack id ever had at the big dough and i figured itd just about be the last but i reckon that i was actually pretty relieved i was glad that it wasnt going to happen well all right i said i just thought that shes got a gun you might get hurt or even killed she said and i was back in business again wed come to the shopping center where i was supposed to let her out i pulled in at the curb and stopped the old gals counting on me coming back to your house remember honey i told her id be back so if i should drop around late some night and i laid it on the line for her not the whole stunt because i didnt have it all figured out yet but the main thing what was going to have to happen to the old woman you dont have to mix into it yourself baby all you have to do is have the dough ready for me to grab and call the cops after ive left and then the shine came back into her eyes the deadness went out of her face and we could go away together then dolly we could be together after that in a week or so sure just as soon as things cool off a little do it tonight dolly she said kill her tonight well of course doing it that night was out of the question a deal like this it was going to take some planning there was pete hendrickson to be got ahold of and worked on i told her wed have to wait probably i could swing it monday meanwhile she was to beat it on back to the house and pretend like everything was hunkydory but what if she finds out i took that money dolly if she finds out before monday she wont i said making her believe it making myself believe it beat it on home now and ill talk to you again tomorrow night ill meet you right here around eight oclock she hung back scared as hell to face the old dame just wanting to hang on to me but i sweettalked her kind of getting hardboiled at the same time and finally she took off i watched her until she rounded the corner then i made a uturn in the street and headed for home now that it was all settled if of course i could suck pete in i began to get cold feet or maybe i should say i started to go cold on the deal i wasnt really scared hell there wasnt anything to be scared about and i sure wanted that little mona and i sure wanted that hundred grand but i just couldnt see myself doing what id have to do why you re crazy man i thought youre going to kill someone youre going to kill a couple of people not you felia it just am tin you i got about half way home and then i jerked the wheel to the right and headed for town id hardly eaten anything for the last threefour days maybe that was what was making me so shaky and nervous maybe things would look different to me with a good meal under my belt i toured around the business section for a few minutes trying to think of something i wanted to eat and some decent place to eat in i finally wound up at the same old joint i usually ate in a little combination bar and grill around the corner from the store i sat down in a booth and the waitress shoved a menu in front of me there wasnt anything on it that sounded good and anyway one look at her and my stomach had turned flipf lops i dont know why it is by god but i can tell you how it is every goddamned restaurant i go to its always the same way theyll have some old bag on the payroll i figure they keep her locked up in the mop closet until they see me coming and theyll doll her up in the dirtiest goddamned apron they can find and smear that crappy red polish all over her fingernails and everything about her is smeary and sloppy and smelly and shes the dame that always waits on me im not kidding brother its that way wherever i go i told her to bring me a shot and a bottle of beer id settle on something to eat later but she was one of these salesmen you know she hung around recommending good things the days specials and so on pointing em out with those goddamned red claws so i put up with it just as long as i could and then i gave her the old eye and told her off maybe you didnt hear me sister i said maybe i better have the manager bring me that shot and the beer bbut she looked like id hit her in the face and it was just about as red as if i had im sorry sir i was ijust trying to and im trying to get a drink i said now do i get it or not i got it fast but the next round i ordered another girl brought it to me not that it made any difference because she was just as bad as the first one they all were they always are they may be okay up until then but the minute i step in through the door of a place its lets get sloppy girls here comes dolly the poor bastard aint got enough trouble so lets make him sick at his stomach i know how they do they cant kid me a damned bit well anyway i finished the first setup and started on the second i was sitting there sipping beer thinking and trying not to think when a shadow fell across the table ah frank staples lisping oily voice so you are here arent you i gave a little jump and he grinned and sat down across from me i asked him what he meant by that soiwashere stuff a little bet i had with myself i oh thank you miss a bowl of your delicious soup if you please and a tall glass of milk as i was saying frank i worked rather late at the store tonight a special inventory and afterwards i found myself in the mood for a prebedtime snack but i do so hate to eat alone you know id almost rather do without and just on the offchance that i might encounter some dear friend i not you of course i had no idea that you would be eating out tonight this looks like im eating i said the wife had some girl friends in tonight so i got out of her way how thoughtful of you and how thoughtless of her to entertain on your first night at home are you and the little woman getting along all right frank you havent quarreled sorry to disappoint you i said now whats the pitch on this bet you made with yourself oh yes he spooned soup into his pussycat mouth as i say i was hoping to find someone to break bread with and just on the offchance that you or one of the boys might be here i glanced through the window he grinned waiting for me to feed him the straight line i let him wait taking another slug of beer and his lips pulled down in a little pout i couldnt see you from the street frank and yet i knew you were here arent you interested in knowing how i was curious about it but i shrugged and said it made me no difference his eyes glinted spitefully the atmosphere of the place frank the look on the faces of those poor girls tell me if you dont like the food and the service here why dont you go some place else whats the use i said theyre all alike oh but he studied me puzzledly then his head moved in a nod and he smiled in a way i didnt understand yes he said yes i suppose they are all alike if yeah nothing this is quite cozy frank its always such a joy to talk to you i trust youre fully readjusted after your recent ordeal you harbor no illwill toward me a swell guy like you i said how could i im so glad incidentally inasmuch as we are such good friends fire away how in the name of heaven did you get so deeply in the hole after all the other collectors also had the rain to contend with and they didnt appropriate more than three hundred dollars in company funds well i said well you see staples yes frank i couldnt tell him i wouldnt have told him even if could have found the right words because it just wouldnt have been smart but i couldnt find the right words are you fed up frank is that it feel like your best effort gains you no more than your worst that existence itself has become pointless well like i say i couldnt tell him but he hadnt missed it very far i couldnt get out and hit the old ball any more because i just didnt give a damn any more and i guess theres nothing that can make a guy give a damn if he doesnt feel like it how about it frank his lisp was gone you may as well tell me now if thats the case hell i said you talk like a man in a paper hat whats the difference anyway he didnt bother to answer me just waited the difference was that if i couldnt earn my dough id probably go back to stealing it and i might skip out with a wad before he could nail me i dont get you i said stalling for time if you were worried why didnt you jump me about it this afternoon instead of im not the jumping kind frank i always think things through put all the various pieces together before i act now what happened to that money a month or so later on i could have told him to go to hell that sure i was fed up with the damned stinking job and who wouldnt be and so what the hell about it but it wasnt a month or so later and until it was until everything had cooled off and it was safe to skip with mona i had to have a reason for staying in this crummy burg i had to hang onto the job you understand dear boy he was quizzing me again im not merely being nosy if its simply something shady or unwise if for example you spent it on a woman or took a little flyer on the ponies i looked up meeting his eyes at last hed rung the bell with that last bit hed shown me how to get off the hook and hed also opened the way for me to ask him some questions you remember that sales letter i showed you a while back from that oil company down in oklahoma letter he shrugged i think youve showed me at least a dozen for a man with some pretensions to sophistication you seem to have landed on a truly amazing number of sucker lists but he broke off staring at me oh no he said no frank you didnt send that outfit any money yeah i looked sheepish i guess i did stape but i distinctly told you yeah i know i said but look at all the other things you told me about the chances you missed when you were running a store down there years ago and but my dear frank that was entirely different i had a chance to buy land leases the real thing not merely wild promises on paper well ill know better next time i said you could have got in on the ground floor huh stape it was his favorite topic the one thing hed really talk to you about instead of jabbing you with the needle once you got him on the subject of oil and this town where hed managed his first store he was a different guy entirely you never saw anything like it frank nominally it was the sorriest land in the world rocky eroded worn out then the boom came and these poor farmers people who actually hadnt had enough to eat a few months before were suddenly rich beyond their wildest dreams why i personally know of one little eightyacre plot that went for a million and a half dollars and i whistled wonderingly cutting in on him sliding in one of the questions i wanted to ask i dont suppose they all cashed in that heavy though did they i mean some of em probably sold out too early or thats right thats right frank it just seemed too good to be true you know in a great many instances the first lease hound that came along and shook forty or fifty or a hundred grand under a farmers nose cash i whistled again you mean they actually swung that much cash at em oh yes and even much larger sums the psychological effect you know and then these people were poorly educated and inclined to be suspicious of banks cash they understood a check well that to them was nothing more than a piece of paper what about the people like that anyway i said ill bet a lot of them didnt know what the hell to do with the money after they got it true oh so true frank you or i now if i were ever able to get my hands on any substantial sum he broke off sighing and dipped into the soup again yes frank it was an experience that might have permanently embittered a man of a less philosophical turn of mind here was poor little me filled with appreciation for the finer things in life yet lacking the money to achieve them and here were these loutish creatures with scads of money and no appreciation whatsoever why in case after case they wouldnt even buy themselves the necessities of life they simply went on living as they always had and hoarded their tens of thousands i grinned ill bet that really did burn you stape you right in the middle of all that cabbage and not being able to latch onto it oh i tried frank he nodded seriously i tried oh so terribly hard but im afraid iwas a little green and callow in those days a trifle clumsy the only result of my efforts was a sudden transfer to another store i had another round of drinks while he was finishing his snack then he left for his hotel and i started for home i still hadnt eaten anything but i was feeling pretty good the talk with staples had warmed me back up on the deal no i didnt really know anything all i had to go on was the few things that mona remembered or thought she remembered and the little that shed picked up from the old womans remarks but all in all and taken with what staples had told me it seemed to add up theyd lived down south at one time mona and the old woman and some other people she couldnt remember her own folks i figured it must have been the south or southwest because it was warmer and things stayed green longer she remembered or thought she did and thered been towers oilfield derricks and and that was about all as much as she could tell me why theyd come up here to settle down i didnt know so there was kind of a hole in the picture there but i didnt see that it was too important and the rest was solid enough oil had been struck on their farm down south the old woman had sold out for a hundred grand or maybe shed got even more and was just hoarding the hundred grand low down white trash too miserly to let go of a buck and not knowing what the hell to buy with it if she did let go sitting on a hundred thousand and hustling her own niece for bean money yeah it figured i wanted it to be that way so thats the way it was i picked up a few groceries the next morning and had a real meal for a change french toast with bacon hashed brown potatoes fruit cocktail and coffee i ate and ate grinning to myself thinking by god they might think they could starve old dolly to death but they had another goddamned think coming to hell with those damned sloppy waitresses to hell with that damned bitchy joyce and doris and ellen and and all those other tramps old dolly could take care of himself until he got someone decent to do the job and brother that happy hour was not far away i refilled my coffee cup and lighted a cigarette i sat back in my chair relaxing pete hendrickson was the next step id look him up today on the quiet naturally it wouldnt do to be seen with him and i choked and banged down my cup pete i didnt know where the guy lived the last address id had on him was the one hed skipped from you know before he went to work at that greenhouse and where the hell he might be living now god only knew he might not even have an address since he lost his job he could be bunking in a boxcar somewhere or sleeping under a culvert i jumped up cursing paced back and forth across the living room i thought by god i might have known it i knock my brains out to shape up a sweet deal and someone screws it up for me i dont know how long i paced around cursing and ranting before i finally got a grip on myself then i got out the phone book looked up the number of the greenhouse and dialed it i got the foreman on the wire i said please sor iss olaf hendrickson speaking iss very important dot i speak to my brudder pete not here any more he said sorry perhaps you vould tell me vere nope nope he said curtly before i could ask him the question dont give out information like that not sure anyway please sor i said iss sorry he banged up the receiver well im a funny guy though people try to screw me up to keep me from doing what i got to do i go at it all the harder i looked at the clock i shaved and brushed my teeth and gandered the clock again elevenfifteen just about right i got in my car and headed for the other side of town it was pretty close to noon when i got to this beer parlor the one just down the street from the greenhouse i picked up the name and address as i drove by and stopped at a drugstore in the next block i waited in my car until the noon whistles blew then i got out and stood looking down the street my hunch had been right workmen were coming out of the greenhouse and making a beeline for the beer parlor i gave them a few minutes to get inside and get settled i went into the drugstore then and called the place from a booth telephone the phone rang and rang finally someone snatched it off the hook the proprietor or a bartender or maybe even a customer and hollered hello theres a fellow there named pete hendrickson i said one of the boys from the greenhouse will you call him to the phone please he didnt answer me just turned away from the phone and shouted pete pete hendrickson any of you guys named hendrickson someone shouted something back and someone else laughed and this guy spoke into the phone again he aint here mister aint at the greenhouse no longer either gosh i said ive just got to talk to him iwonder if theres anyone around who could tell me where hang on he said pretty short like i was giving him a hard time any of you guys know where they didnt or if they did they werent saying sorry mister this guy said any other little thing i can do for you i told him yeah go take a flying jump at yourself you snotty bastard and i slammed up as he started to cuss well that had been my best bet but it wasnt my only one characters like pete hendrickson were my meat i knew just what theyd do just where theyd go sure itd taken me weeks to run him down before and i could work out in the open then instead of slipping around like i had to now but that had been different i hadnt been looking for him for myself this time it was for me for me and mona and a hundred grand and by god id find him i drove into town and parked at the foot of skid row i got out and started walking i must have walked fifteen miles that afternoon past the employment agencies with the bums hanging around in the front past the flop houses with their flyspecked windows and stinking lobbies past the greasy spoons past the pool halls and wine joints and cheap beer parlors hell it was saturday afternoon wasnt it and even if he had a home a guy like pete wouldnt stay in on saturday afternoon hed be down here where he could stretch a few dimes into a party where he could guzzle and scoff and have enough left over for a flop so i walked and walked just strolling from place to place going around and around and around and saturday afternoon went away and it was saturday night i was too jumpy to eat not that i could have got anything to eat anyhow i found a bar that wasnt too completely crummy looking and threw down a few double shots then i started walking again he had to be here someplace sonofabitch he just had to if he wasnt around here then he must have left town and i gritted my teeth together no no he couldn t do that to me they couldn t do that to me saturday night eight oclock saturday night still no pete and it was almost time to meet mona i bought a pint of whiz and went back to my car i yanked the cap with my teeth making them ache to beat hell and liking the ache i threw down a slug two or three slugs i dropped the jug down on the seat and stepped on the starter high man i was higher than a kite but not from the old gravy it was the kind of high you get on when you got to do something and cant when youve got to have the answers and you dont know any what was i going to do now what was going to tell mona id told her i was going to fix it and id reached the point where i could almost feel that hundred grand i fingered the cap off the bottle and took another long drink tell her tell her nothing if i could dig up pete tomorrow or the next day fine if not and id better not hang around town much longer after that well shed have a few days of hope before she found out the truth and me i wouldnt have had anything more than i was entitled to it was the only thing to do as i saw it brush her off on the questions play it close to the vest make her happy and grateful and then you know nothing wrong with that was there i wasnt taking anything that she wasnt perfectly willing to give me nothing wrong i said and i said it out loud dolly dillon says theres nothing wrong with it the rotten sonofabitch so anyway i admitted it and was mad enough at myself to bite nails but i knew i was going to go right ahead just the same she was waiting in the shadows of a tree a few doors down from the supermarket she climbed into the car laying a little sack of groceries up behind the seat and i stepped on the gas the jerk threw her against me she moved away looking a little frightened her voice trembling wwhere are we going dolly ive been away from the house quite a while and i wont keep you long i said whats the matter you act like youre not glad to see me oh no dolly i mean i am glad but is everything all right wwe youre still going to do it didnt i say so i said monday nno later than monday dolly im scared to death shell i told you didnt i i said you want me to put it in writing i drove across a railroad spur turned down a dirt road and parked there werent any streetlights over that way and there wasnt any traffic i put my arms around her and pulled her against me i kissed her and ran a hand over her and what happened then was so wild and wonderful that well i dont know how to say it i guess a hopeaters dream might be something like that ive been around see im not one of these old country boys that can work up a boil around a lingerie counter ive known the twentydollar gals and the niceynice babes who were just out for kicks but id never known anything like that before then it was all over it was as far as i was concerned but that didnt seem to mean nothing to her i said baby and then i said my god honey and finally i said what the hell is this i shoved her away and got back on my own side of the seat that seemed to break the spell as they say in story books im ssorry she bit her lip trying not to look at me looking ashamed i jjust love you so much that that but how about a ba be like this maybe i had the wrong angle on things maybe the old woman was just selling something to keep it from going for free that thought went in and out of my mind fast it didnt even have time to say hello before id booted it out in the cold and slammed the door because even a damned fool could see that this kid was a doll just as sweet and innocent as they come and naturally with everything i was doing for her with everything she thought i was doing for her she wanted to do something special for me that was the way i wanted it the way it should be after all the tramps id been tied up with it was about time i met someone who was grateful and loving and appreciative i told her she was swell and everything was swell i just hadnt wanted to hold her up tonight when she was already late about this gun your aunt has i said starting the car where does she keep it upstairs in her room dolly she keeps the key to the room with her swell now you get your clothes straightened out and ill drive you back to the shopping center dolly she started brushing at her clothes what how are you going to do it dolly i mean i ought to know if huhuh i said you dont need to know a thing if you had it on your mind you might accidentally give it away so just forget about it bbut you hear forget it i said all you have to do is be at home monday night between eightthirty and nine eightthirty or nine or ten somewhere along there i said you asked you started to ask about pete hendrickson last night what does he nothing i said and it didnt look like i was lying about that pete wasnt going to have anything to do with it i wasnt going to and i sure felt sorry for her but what could i do now leave it lay will you i said you keep asking questions im liable to think you dont trust me im sorry i just wondered what heres where you get out i said and i handed her the groceries now hurry on home and dont worry about a thing everythings going to be fine she opened the door of the car and started to get out she turned back around worriedly apologetically her lips parted for another try i leaned forward and kissed her gave her a little punch beat it i said you hear me honey i want to see you move she smiled she beat it i drove away i made a few more tours of skid row and it was still no soap it looked like pete must have jumped town i got a bite to eat and bought another pint and drove home figuring well hell maybe thats the way its supposed to be i think i told you earlier that this shack of ours was on a railroad siding that there was the tracks on one side and a wrecking yard on the other anyway i meant to tell you so i drove home that night and there was a string of cars shuttled onto the siding an empty box and a gondola and a couple of flats and i thought oh oh no damned slecp in the morning theyll be in here humping those cars at six am and i gulped i stood staring at the open door of the box car and i sort of froze in my tracks it was dark on that street ours was the only house in the block id already locked up the car and i knew id never have time to get my hands on a wrench or something to slug with before this guy could get to me because hed already started toward me hed swung down out of the door of the box a hell of a big guy and was coming across the yard and i couldnt see what he looked like of course but i reckoned he wasnt up to any good or he wouldnt have been he stopped about six steps away from me dillon he said iss dillon yess and i sagged back against the car ppete i said weakly pete hendrickson hed taken the five i gave him the night before and jungled up with some hoes down on salt creek theyd all got on a hell of a wine binge and he hadnt woke up until tonight needing a drink like a baby needs its mother a drink and some chow and an inside flop and there was just one guy he could think of who might hold still for a bite i had been so nice to him the fife dollars i had given him and i had spoken of a chob so he cleared his throat uncomfortably misunderstanding my silence i did not go to your door dillon your vife you have a vife yess i was afraid of alarming so late at night to see a bum like me at the door so i vait in the box until i hear your car and his voice trailed away i snapped out of the jolt hed given me im glad you came by i said ive been wanting to see you come on inside and better i had not such a bum i look and your vife vould not like if you could chust vell a dollar or two chust until i find york huhuh i said and took him by the arm you need a lot more than that pete come on in and ill tell you about it and no dont worry about the wife shes away on a little trip i got him inside i saw that the shades were drawn and i turned on the light and gave him the opened pint he killed it at a gulp shuddered sighed i passed him the fresh pint and gave him a cigarette he took another drink drew a long drag on the cigarette he leaned back in his chair sighing ahhhhh he saidjust like that ahhhhh my life you have safed dillon maybe not your life i said just about forty years of it i think thats the stretch in this state for raping a minor it didnt register on him for a moment hed been stuck in the basement and now he was riding the express car up and it wasnt stopping for signals he took another swig from the jug he wiped his mouth and said i was a nice man he said i was a chentleman and a fine friend and then he said vot rape and leaned forward in his chair you heard me i said old lady farrells niece mona bbbut he said bbbut yeah a lie it iss i i he swallowed and his eyes shifted away from mine with the girl i was yess vy not i york and dot is some of my pay she does not object it iss agreeable with her and it was huh i said maybe she took it away from you huh and i thought oh you dirty bastard you dirty lying bastard you just wait vell he started to smirk then straightened his face when he saw the look i was giving him vell no i haf told you how it vas i york she iss the pay and shes a minor a child in the eyes of the law but she iss not she could not be and anyway i did not force the old woman says shes a minor i said she says you threatened to kill her and the girl and then you took it bbut but he lifted the bottle again he stared at me his eyes crafty i tink maybe you maybe you not tell truth dillon all right i said vy vy vould she do such a thing i am not the first many others there have been and and how you know anyvay let it go i said i felt like id given you kind of a raw deal getting you fired and i wanted to make up for it but as long as you think im lying let it go i stood up and took out my wallet i got out a couple of ones letting him see them and then i shoved them back and took out a five i held it out to him and take the bottle along with you too i said youd better have a good one before they pick you up bbut he drew back from the money i did not mean to offend it iss chust just for your own satisfaction i said why dont you call the old gal up theres the phone ask her if she isnt going to send you over the road just as soon as she can arrange it bbut if i did dot but it isnt true remember im lying to you his face was turning gray he took such a slug out of the pint that he almost killed it dillon he said how vot vot iss i sat down in front of him i looked him in the eye and began to talk so maybe he wasnt the first one with mona i said but could he prove it and could he prove that she wasnt a minor and that she and the old woman had agreed to the deal it would be his word against theirs and he had a police record and a bad rep for drinking why was the old gal doing this to him well she was a pure mean bitch and low down as all hell and she was sore at him remember theyd had a knockdown dragout brawl before hed quit working for her and she was plenty burned up about it she was out for blood that baby and she meant to stick him pete shook his head dully a thin thread of slobber oozed down from the corner of his mouth and he brushed it away vy he said i do not doubt you dillon but vy does she tell because she thought i was on her side see i lied i went there trying to trace you down for the store and you know it was just business with me i wasnt sore at you at all and i proved it to you but anyway she figures i am and i play along with her so just as im leaving she says to come back and let her know if youre still there at the greenhouse shes got an idea how we can make it plenty tough on you well like i say i wasnt sore at you at all im really your good friend and i proved it didnt i so i go back and tell her youve quit the greenhouse and then i ask her what the score is i want to find out see so can tip you off i guess maybe she got a little suspicious of me about then because all shell say is never mind the cops will be able to find you and when they do itll be just too bad but i kept on hanging around pretending like im burned up with you too and anxious to help her and finally she tells me what she has in mind i coughed and turned my head man it was all i could do to keep from busting out laughing that slobber running down his chin again and his eyes glazed and bugged out like marbles he was one scared bastard and im crapping you negative well i was afraid to try to talk her out of it i went on shed have seen i was really your friend see and shed probably have called the cops right away so i said swell i was all for it but maybe she wouldnt be able to make it stick maybe it would be better if i looked you up and brought you there you know had a few drinks with you and then suggested that we go over there for a party wed frame you i told her see wed call the cops in and yeah it was pretty wild but he was a pretty dumb guy didnt have much education anyway and i guess hed been pushed around plenty by the cops he stared at me his lips too stiff to move his face turning green under the gray and i coughed and turned my head again vvot i haf some time dillon i can get out of town before how far would you get i said the cops have your mug and prints they put out a flier on you and they pick you up in no time bbut vot im telling you i said she gave me until monday night so monday night we go over there ill go in first and tell her youll be along in a few minutes and then you slip up on the porch and i start talking to her i tell her im sticking my neck out a mile so how about a roll with the gal for my trouble and shell go for it see she practically propositioned me already so then i say ive got to be sure she wont try to stick me some time shell have to give me something in writing to show that she and the gal consented to the deal that the kids over twentyone and shes done it before and well whats the matter hed been frowning a little i gave him a hard look and he cleared his throat apologetically it a little strange it sounds you tink she vould do such sure she will its a cinch den vy iss it necessary for me to be dere why i said and for a minute i couldnt think of anything else to say why dammit i dont need to explain that to you do i if you vould not mind pleass so mixed up i am i cannot why its because shes liable to hang back know what i mean shes liable to think im trying to pull a fast one on her so i step to the door and say well here you are now i want that statement i want it right then or the deal dont go no further ill tip you off and tell the cops its a frame and shell be in heap big trouble he nodded his face clearing he hesitated vould you you do not tink perhaps you could go to the police now and i thought of that i said but im afraid it wouldnt work theyd probably lock you up while they were trying to get to the bottom of things and maybe they wouldnt stick you on a rape rap but youd still be in for a long jolt its a pretty messy deal you know anyway you look at it even if it wasnt rape it vas not i svear it dillon it still looks bad you cant make it look any other way there are at least a couple of charges they could stick you on and theyd damned well give you the maximum on each he sighed nodded again you are right my good friend so if you are villing to do me dis great favor i owe it to you i said i got you fired and now im trying to square things anyway its a pleasure to put a crimp in that old bitchs tail he told me i was a nice man and a chentleman again he looked at the bottle set it down on the end table and stood up so much you haf done i am ashamed to ask sit down i said youre going to stay here stay right here until this is all over with bbut he sat down again he didnt need any urging at all it iss too much nuts i said im glad to have some company now how about some bacon and eggs his eyes filled up i thought by god he was going to start blubbering my good friend he said my fine friend and he brushed his nose on his sleeve theres just one thing i said youll have to stay under cover understand keep inside the house and dont let anyone know youre around here it wouldnt look good know what i mean if the old gal decided to get tough and we had togo to the police theyd figure that we were buddies see get the idea that one of us was lying and the other was swearing to it so he said i vill do as you say i fixed him some grub i went out and got more whiskey i made him go to bed in the bedroom and i took the lounge i fell asleep fast but along about three in the morning i woke up feeling kind of cramped and like something was hugging me something was the bedclothes i was all tucked in like a twoyearold i started to lug the stuff back in to him and then i remembered mona that sweet child and the way hed taken advantage of her so i just took what blankets i wanted and dropped the rest on the floor let the sonofabitch freeze hed be plenty hot in the place he was going to the next day was sunday and it was just about the damnedest longest day i ever spent in my life pete was pretty well leveled off of his binge his mind was about as clear as it ever got to be and he was over his first scare so he starts to worrying wondering firing the questions at me and frankly my mind wasnt very clear everything was kind of mashed together inside like id been crawling through a rat hole i started feeding him whiskey right away i got out my collection cards and pretended like i was working but i couldnt hedge him off they kept coming the vys and the vots and the hows until man i was almost ready to murder him right there i told you goddammit pete how many times do i have to explain it i get this business in writing from her and then shes screwed you could whip her with a wet rope and she wouldnt dare let out a peep but he kept shaking his head but so strange it seems like a movie almost it iss hard to believe that she vill well she will wait and see if she doesnt still he kept on shaking his goddamned head it iss hard to it iss so strange for her to be so angry with me over someting dat for her to tell you of her plans and for you to all right i said im lying i made it all up why the hell would i lie to you for christs sake pleass my good friend my dear friend i did not mean what do you mean vel i vas chust wondering i merely wished to ask vy no i dont think he was actually suspicious he was too well sold on me and him being swell friends it was more as though he was afraid i was going off halfcocked like maybe the old woman had been tossing some bull and id got the wind up over nothing or maybe i was setting a bear trap to catch a skunk making such a big deal out of it that we were liable to get screwed up in the machinery anyway he kept on and on fussing and quizzing and worrying out loud until by god i had just all i could take and i couldnt take any more it was about an hour or so after dinner when it happened id gone out to the delicatessen and bought enough damned grub to feed a horse thinking you know that a good scoff would keep him quiet for a while but all through the meal he was making with the talk talking with his goddamned big mouth full and afterwards he had to help with the dishes i mean he insisted on it and the talk kept on on and on and on until the words began to dance through my mind vy vot vyvot faster and faster and yet somehow slow vyvot vy vot vyvotvy vyvot why what whywhat whywhat why why why all of a sudden something seemed to snap inside of my head it was just like i wasnt any more like id just shriveled up and disappeared and in my place there was nothing but a deep hole a deep black hole with a light shining down from the top the light began to move downward it rushed downward with a swishing screaming sound it reached the bottom of the pit and shot back upward again and then i came back from wherever i had been and pete and i were standing in the front room and i was talking to him very quietly youre right i said the whole things a damned lie she isnt out to get you im out to get her shes got a pile of dough see a hundred thousand dollars and no one else knows about it i figured on bumping her off and grabbing it and making it look like you please he patted my shoulder awkwardly ogscuse my good friend i am vorried and i talk too much but now i vili say no more im telling you i said im laying it on the line for you now get the hell on out of here and forget the whole deal he put both hands on my shoulders and pushed me down into a chair he gave me another little pat looking sad and apologetic soch a bum i am so much you

only the dishes i vill do and keep my sobig mouth shut well id told him and even if id been able to go on telling him and i couldnt he wouldnt have listened he finished the dishes he mopped up the kitchen and scrubbed the oil cloth on the table he came back into the living room and he poured a very small drink for himself and a big one for me he kept his word there were no more questions but i couid see he was busting with them that he was itching inside like hed swallowed a poison ivy bush and seeing him that way it was ten times worse than if hed actually talked i poured him a big drink i made him take three or four big slugs but it didnt seem to help much i tried to get his mind off of what he was thinking about what i was thinking about i got out a deck of cards and a box of matches for chips and we played a few hands of draw we switched from poker to cooncan and then on to monte and faro and then on to a lot of wild games like baseball and spitintheocean the cards seemed to help some they were a long time in doing it but finally they did he began to hum to kind of mumblesing the first thing i knew i was doing it with him we grinned and came in on the chorus together it was pie in the sky as i recollect and by the time we got to the end wed dropped the cards and were laughing like fools dillon he wiped his eyes soch a pleasure good friends good viskey a good song i do not belieff i haf heard that song since ill bet ican tell you i said up in the northwest wasnt it were you ever up around washington and oregon vas i vy in nineteen fortyfive i said why hell i was there myself that year running a pots and pans crew well i guess it wasnt so strange because guys like us would just naturally get around a lot we wouldnt do the same kind of work but wed land in a lot of the same places it seemed funny though strange i mean and when i could make myself forget the other it seemed kind of good we sang one song after another keeping our voices down of course we sang and drank and talked and i guess we got pretty tight before the evening was over i guess i got even tighter than he did the day had been endless you know it had taken everything i had out of me so now filled up on the music and the talk and the drink and i got tight as a fiddle whats it all about pete i said what the hell are we looking for anyway looking dillon yeah chasing from one place to another when we know theyre all alike moving from job to job when we know theyre all alike that there isnt a goddamned one of em that doesnt stink vell he scratched his head i do not tink ye are

coffee dont want any coffee i said want another drink wanta talk wanta coffee he said firmly getting up and then bed he went out into the kitchen i heard the water tap go on and then there was a lot of sioshing sioshing and sioshing and sloshing i listened to it my head began to ache again and all the good feeling went out of me i got up and staggered to the kitchen door i stood staring at him and the blood pounded through my brain why i said what the hell kind of slopgut are you vot he whirled around startled i do not under why didnt you do it in the first place i said you knew it had to be done everything was swell and you had to screw it up why ananswer me you dirty sonofabitch why wwhy didnt you wash out that coffee pot i began to bawl i started to slide down the doorjamb and he picked me up in his arms and carried me into the bedroom that monday the next day was a toughie i wasnt bothered about him any more except for worrying that he might show himself outside the house because after the way hed acted he had it coming to him but there were plenty of other things on my mind i couldnt concentrate on my work and this was one day i had to concentrate staples had his eye on me if i sioughed off very much id be out of a job and that job i had to have for a while so i had the job to think about to make a good showing on and i had all this other stuff the hundred grand and mona and what i was going to have to do to get em and the whole shidderee was all jumbled up inside me and couldnt make any headway on any of it i couldnt collect i couldnt sell i mean sure i collected and sold some but nothing like i should have as for the other well the morel thought about that and couidnt stop thinking about it the more mixed up i got you see youve probably seen it if there was ever a bastard that was going off halfcocked i was it i didnt know the layout of the house i didnt know how long it would take mona to get that dough out of the basement or which room was her aunts or whether shed let me into the place at night or or a goddamned thing worst of all i hadnt laid the deal out for mona i hadnt rehearsed her in how she was supposed to act afterwards what she was suppose to say and the story she was supposed to tell the cops and soon i hadnt done it because i hadnt really planned on going through with the deal id figured that pete had skipped town and i couldnt go through with it so there it was there i was i hadnt asked mona half the questions that i shouid have and id told her practically nothing that she needed to know and now it was too late i didnt dare call her there was no way i could see her maybe i could catch her outside the house if hung around that neighborhood long enough but that wouldnt look good people might remember seeing me later and anyway i didnt have the time wait put it off a night or two until i got a chance to talk to her i couldnt do that there was that story id given pete and then the old woman might discover that the till had been tapped so there it was like i say i was fumbling before i even got started i hadnt really made a move yet and id already boilixed the frammis anyway i hadnt done what i should have i got to thinking about that while i was whipping the deadbeats or trying to whip em i should say i thought well dolly you aint changed a bit have you you havent learned a goddamned thing you stupid bastard you couldnt learn a prayer at a revival meeting you see something you want and thats all you got eyes for you aint watching the road at all and the first thing you know youre up to your tail in mud well though that wasnt so it maybe looked that way but it wasnt the way it really was theres just some guys that get the breaks and some that dont and me i guess you know the kind i am i got through the day somehow and along toward quitting time my mind began to clear i began to figure i hadnt done so badly after all the money was there wasnt it and i had pete sold didnt i and mona wouid do what i told her to wouidnt she everything important id taken care of fine and all that was left was just a few little details of course it would have been better if i could have expiained things to mona but it didnt really matter id done all right and everything was going to be all right it had to be know what i mean take the most hard luck guy in the world and hes bound to get a break once in a while i worked until after six trying to make a showing the other guys had already checked in and left when i went in and staples was back behind the cash wicket fidgeting and waiting for me he looked through my sales contracts the new ones and the adbuys he checked through my collection cards and counted my cash a little light frank he purred looking up at me at last quitesomemuch light i trust you can bulk it out with a good story what the hell i said ive been off work for almost a week it takes a few days to get back into the swing of things no he shook his head no it doesnt frank it takes exactly one day today do i make myself clear so all right i said ill do much better tomorrow you will indeed much better otherwise i am very much afraid that i shrugged and told him to stop making a production out of it if i didnt do okay tomorrow he could beef then so he let it go at that and we said goodnight and i started for home i would do all right the next day if i couldnt do it legit id feed a little of that hundred grand into the accounts just a few bills enough to make myself look good i could afford it with that much dough and it would save me knocking myself out i got home pete was pretty uneasy from being cooped up all day all set for another quiz program it looked like so i told him i had to take a bath and he was to fix the grub id brought home and that got him off my neck for an hour we ate around seventhirty by eight we were finished i told him i had a little work on my accounts to do and he was to wash the dishes so that took care of him until eightthirty he came out into the living room then and i folded up the collection cards id been playing with i told him to get his hat and coat on and he did looking like he was about ready to pop then i gave him one of the two big drinks i had poured and as soon as he got it down i poured us another dillon good friend dere is someting drink your drink i said hurry were running late but but he drank his drink and i drank mine i switched off the lights took his elbow and started him toward the door in the darkness it iss only a small ting dillon unimportant but it hass been running through my mind since last night yen ye vere you hear me i said i said we were late now come on he came along but that question whatever it was was still bothering him and all the way across town he was kind of mumbling and muttering to himself i guess i told you that the house was out beyond the university the only one in that block well it was anyway sitting off by itself but i still didnt take any chances i speeded up a little at the end of the adjoining block then cut my lights and motor and coasted the rest of the way i opened the door i told pete to stay in the car until i called him oh he turned and looked at me but i tought i know i said but she might hear you come up on the porch figure that something screwy was going on and it would blow the whole deal i left him sitting in the car mumbling and muttering i was about half way up the walk when i thought what if someone should come by a prowl car and ask him what the hell he was doing but well i couldnt help it it wasnt good but it wasnt good to have him come up on the porch either like id told him to last night that wasnt good and this wasnt and maybe nothing could be that i would dream up but goddammit i just hadnt had much time to think and i was a hard luck bastard to begin with and i knocked on the door and man it just sounded like an echo from my heart the old pump was beating that hard after a long time a dozen years it seemed like the old woman tipped the shade back and peered out at me there was only a dim light on in the hail where she was standing but it was apparently enough for her to recognize me she opened the door and unlatched the screen and i went inside her face fell a little when she saw i wasnt carrying anything then she jerked her head toward the door and started grinning again rubbing her hands together you bring my coat you got it in your car hah i didnt say anything do anything i was like a mechanical man with the batteries run down i wanted to boff hell out of the old bitch and i just couidnt move you bring it in mister thats why you came aint it you bring in the coat and then she winked and jerked her head toward the rear of the house shes already in bed mister and you just br she just shouldnt have said that honest to god id planned it and id already come threefourths of the way but if she hadntve said that i dont think i could have gone any further she brought it on herself when she said that she asked for it and she got it i lefthooked her i rightcrossed her i gave her just the two haymakers left and right fast batting her one way then the other batting her back before she could fall and then i let her go down back against the foot of the stairs and her neck looked about four inches longer and her head was swinging on it like a pumpkin on a vine kill her what the hell do you think it did mona had been standing behind the living room drapes now she came out and she took just one look at the oid woman and then she looked away again and she threw her arms around me shivering i kissed her on top of the head gave her a little squeeze i pushed her out of the hall into the living room ddoliy what are we ggoing to ill tell you i said ill tell you exactly what to do now which room is your aunts aat the head of the stairs on the right oh ddolly im save it i said for gods sake save it whereil she have her key wheres her key i ddont maybe in hher i ran out in the hall and frisked the old woman i found a key in her pocket and took it back into the living room is this it now what about the gun in her room goddammit answer me she nodded stammered that the gun was in the old gals room she gulped and tried to smile tried to get ahold of herself im ssorry dolly ill do whatever swell i said sure you will and everythings going to be fine i smiled back at her did the best i could at smiling anyway you go get the money now how long will it take you can you get it in five minutes she said she could she thought she could shed do it just as fast as she could but what are you never mind goddammit i said just go get it and leave the rest to me move for gods sake she moved she turned and went off at a run i went back out into the hail slung the old woman over my shoulder and carried her up the stairs i got to the top and dropped her on the landing i unlocked the door to her room and went inside there was a chair a bed an old dropleaf writing desk nothing else no books no pictures and with an old house like this an old woman like that there should have been pictures i opened the dropleaf of the desk scared sick that there wouldnt be any gun or that it wouldnt be loaded and i thought man oh man how stupid can you get you could have checked on that anyway youve gone too far to back out and if that gun isnt but it was there a big old fortyfive of all things just about the last gun youd expect an old woman to have and it was loaded and there was some money too a little roll of bills in one of the desk drawers i took the money and shoved the gun into my belt i jerked the drawers out and dropped them on the floor and i knocked over the chair as i went back into the hall i walked down the stairs a few steps i reached back up and got the old woman by an arm and pulled her down head first i left her lying about half way down i went on down the rest of the way scattering the bills on the steps i switched off the light opened the door and called to pete then i went back up the stairs a little way and waited i was sweating like a chippie in church it wouldnt work it couldn t work it was like some of those stupid jobs you read about in the newspapers guys tackling some big deal and doing everything bassackwards tripping over their own feet in a hundred places until its almost like a comedy id read some of those stories laughing out loud and shaking my head thinking what a jerk the damned fool ought to have known he ought to have seen if hed done any thinking at all hed the door opened closed i heard him breathing heavily nervously and then his whisper in the darkness dillon vot everythings swell i spoke softly shes up in her room now writing the statement im going up to check it over oh i could almost see the frown on his face den vy am i i want you to look at it before we leave its okay she wont know youre here until i get my hands on it vell he said hesitating trying to unravel things and then he gave it up and chuckled i was his pal i was the brain man i was taking care of him just like id been taking care of him and he was a simple guy and there was this other thing on his mind all day i haf been trying to remember dillon soch a crazy thing how does it go dot song ye vere singing der vun about der bastard king of england song i gasped song is that what i brought my voice down turn on the light pete i accidentally brushed the switch with my sleeve when when when what youll have to turn around its there on your right back near the door i saw the black shadow that was his body revolve in the darkness i heard his fingers tracing their way along the wallpaper then the chuckle again almost childish soch a foolish ting at a time like dis no attention you should pay me later perhaps yen no isaid this is a good time heres the way it goes pete cats on the rooftops cats on the tiles cats with their bottoms wreathed in smiles the light went on his back was to me like it had to be i got him six times through the head and neck he pitched forward and that was the end of him i made sure of it i checked him before i left his face was pretty much of a mess but it looked like hed died happy it looked like he was grinning through thick and thin the true story of a mans fight against high odds and low women by knarf noliid i was born in new york city one score and ten years ago of poor but honest parents and from my earliest recollections i was out working and trying to make something of myself and be somebody but from my earliest recollections someone was always trying to give me a hard time like this time when i was runningerrands for a delicatessen and hell i wouldnt have stolen a damned dime from anyone i was only about eight years old and just wasnt smart enough so this old bag shortchanges me on an order and the delly owner says i took the dough myself weil anyone could have seen she was a goddamned bag dirty dishes and clothes strung all over her apartment living like a hog and later on she pulls the same stunt on some other delivery boys around there and everyone gets wise to her and they know i didnt take the money meanwhile though this deily owner has canned me and told my old man i was a thief and the old man beats me black and blue so a hell of a lot of good it does me that is one thing i cant figure out why your own parents will take some outsiders word for something before they will yours but i realize that this incident is of no importance so i will get on with my tale i simply wished to demonstrate how right from the beginning people were giving me a bad time well it went on and on and i will not trouble you with a full recital of it all because all the crap i caught its pretty hard to believe and youd probably think i was a damned liar so finally im in my second year of high school and people have been giving me trouble all the way trying to hold me back and im pretty big not to be any further along anyway theres this english teacher and shes pretty young not a hell of a lot older than i was i guess and she keeps giving me the eye and putting her hand on my shoulder when she shows me how todo something and i figure well you know so one day when she keeps me after class its the last class of the day and were all alone one day when shes leaning over me and kind of rubbing up against me why i give her a feel i thought she wanted it you know so i did it but dear reader it was a trap well i suppose it was an invaluable lesson and one that profited me greatly in the future that little bitch taught me something i never forgot viz the prettier and the sweeter they act toward you the less you can trust em theyre just leading you on see to get you in trouble and maybe you dont see it right at the time but brother you will but it was sure a lesson purchased at great cost i get the chilly drizzles right now when i think about it she yells and slaps my face and some of the men teachers come running in and i try to explain how it was what i thought and that just makes it worse they call the principal and they all start knocking me at once its their fault see that im not any further along but they claim its me they give out with a lot of craperoo about how i wont study i havent really got my mind on school and im uncooperative and antagonistic toward the other kids and they make it sound like im public enemy number one or something and it all started because this babe gave me a play and i foolishly picked her up on it well to make a long story short i got expelled and thus through no fault of my own my formal education was terminated at a tender age but to hell with em all i say people that act as dirty as that theyre not worth soiling my mind thinking about and i dont you are aware by now that i am one hard working bastard with plenty of experience in many fields but incredible as it seems my earnest efforts and ability were never appreciated the rookings i got right from the time left home and took to the road are something to challenge the imagination youd have to see it to believe it by god there was the manager of this circulation crew i first went out with a crook from way back and man what a crap artist he gives me the old bull about traveling to california and back in new cars and making seventyfive bucks a week and me im just an innocent kid unwise in the ways of the world so i swallow it like candy i sign on with the crew theres about eight of us in this tenyearold dodge and it seems like our first stop on our way to california is newark nj and you ever do the doortodoor in newark well dont do it they get all the crews coming out of new york see these circulation outfits and so on they shake the crews down in jersey and its not reaily a fair test because the goddamned place is worked to death but thats the way it is they shook out two of the guys in newark and another one before were out of the state then the rest of us go on westward the crew manager and us four men well i really knocked myself out i made the doors and i made the sales but it dont do me no good its like its always been with me working hard and being honest and getting nothing for it the crew manager this bull artist would do the calibacks on my orders and on about twothirds of em hed give me a cantconfirm hed look me right in the eye and say the lady had changed her mind or her husband wouldnt let her go through with the buy and then hed write the orders up as his own and take the commission well we got into illinois and im practically dead of doughnut poisoning by that time ive been working my can off and all the time i have to eat in dumps taking a lot of guff from the hired help just because im a kid and i cant tip or anything sojust about then i began to get wise i made a few callbacks myself and then i jumped this crap artist i wasnt mean about it or anything just asked him how about shaking it out fair from now on and that shows how little i knew of the ways of life the sonofabitch slugged me with a water pitcher and then he kicked the hell out of me and then he fired me off the crew and i wanted to fight or argue about it or something but somehow i just couldnt getting slugged and kicked when id been trying to be nice well i couldnt do anything for a while just hole up in my room and think well pretty soon i joined up with another crew and inside of a month i was manager of it me just a kid managing a crew so i guess you can see i had what it took but there were a couple of these punks that were always kicking hinting maybe that i was crapping them on the cantconfirms so finally i got em alone in my room and beat the sap out of them and then i gave em the gate but they still werent satisfied it wasnt enough that i had to go out and dig up a couple of more men they wrote to the home office and the next thing i know im yanked off the crew and i cant ever work for that company again it went on and on like that every damn thing i tried i work into a nice premium deal and the superintendent robs me on territory i buy gold and the refinery gives me the cob even the big buyers do it by god they try to kid me that my eighteenkarat is fourteen and that the fourteen is ten and so on and ill bet i was skinned out of thousands of dollars before i saw i was struggling against hopeless odds and moved into another racket it was that way with everything i did the aluminum ware the pots and pans the premiums the magazines everything one way or another id get the blocks put to me so i will mercifully spare you the sordid details i often thought i kept thinking that if i had some little helpmeet to dwell with the unequal struggle would not be so unequal but i didnt have any more luck that way than i did in the others tramps thats all i got three goddamned tramps in a row or maybe it was four or five but it doesnt matter it was like they were all the same person finally i was working in this small city in the middlewest outside collectionsales it could have been pleasant and remunerative but my boss was just about the most nogood sonofabitch i ever worked for character named staples he just wasnt satisfied unless he was giving me a hard time and when i go home at night exhausted with the struggles ainst unequal odds its more of the same because the babe im married to then shes out of this world what i mean the queen of the tramps and a plenty tough bitch to boot to get ahead of myself a little she starts giving me a hard time one night talking dirty to me and using bad language so like i always do i try to be reasonable and show her the error of her ways i say it is not the best time to talk when a man just comes home from work and perhaps we wiii both be in a better mood after we have a bite to eat i say will she please fix us a bite and will cheerfuily help her well for answer she gives me some more of the dirty talk and when i try to pet her and soothe her down gently but firmly she somehow slips and falls into the bathtub i helped her out and apologized although i hadnt done a goddamned thing im very sorry joyce i said now you just take it easy and ill fix us a nice dinner thats the way i talked to her but you know how much good it does trying to be nice to a tramp she almost caved my skull in with a scrubbing brush then when i leave the house to calm myself she ruins all my clothes and pulls out i guess she saw that she couldnt get anything more out of me and it was time to latch onto another sucker meanwhile to go back and take events in their proper order i have met one of the sweetest finest little girls in the world her name is mona and she lives with a mean old bitch of an aunt the old womans holding her prisoner practically working her tail off and making her do a lot of dirty things she this little girl asks me to rescue her and let her be my helpmeet and then we can live happily forever after and touched by her plea i agree to do so i agree even before i know about all this dough the old woman had stashed away which when you come to think about it is rightfully monas because the old bitch has given her a hard time every day for years and if a littie girl ever had a hundred grand coming she did well i go over to the house that night and hell i wouldnt have laid a finger on that old woman but she keeps egging me on talking dirty and giving me a bad time so there just wasnt any other way out well just about then maybe a few minutes later this fellow pete hendrickson came in i think maybe he was a nazi or maybe a communist one of em that slipped over here during the war but anyway he was a nogood bastard he admitted being a bum himself and he wouid have given me a hard time too so there was only one thing to do about him well id done it to him and i was wearing gloves but i wiped the gun off good and put it in the old womans hand and just as id finished this mona shows up with the money and she sees this nazi or communist or whatever he was and she goes all to pieces acts like i was a criminal or something acted like i hadnt done it all for her well she pulled herself together when she saw how jarred i was the notion i was getting she said it was just a shock seeing him there when she hadnt expected to that she just didnt like to have it happen to anyone unless it was her aunt and she was sorry and so on and shed do whatever i asked so im a pretty understanding guy and i kind of liked her for feeling that way if she did actually feel that way so everything was jake between us again i told her what she was supposed to do what to say to the cops i told her it would be a leadpipe cinch and in a couple of weeks we could get together then i kissed her and left taking the money with me it the money i mean was in a black leather bag something like a filebriefcase or a doctors medicine kit it was packed tight and it was heavy about sixty or seventy pounds and all the way home i was wondering where in the hell i could keep it i was afraid to hide it in the house that was a pretty bad neighborhood and it would be just my luck to have some sonofabitch break in and lift it i finally decided to carry it with me at least for a while i could bury it down in the bottom of my sample case throw out some of the samples if i had to and keep it with me all day long i got home and took it into the house i set my sample case up on the coffee table opened the lid and tried fitting the bag inside i kind of fiddled around with it trying it this way and that way i was sort of delaying the pleasure i guess letting my anticipation build up and i guess probably i was a little afraid because with a hard luck guy like me damned near anything can happen that littie satchel might turn out to be filled with bricks or magazines or some kind of booby trap that would blow my head off when i opened it it bulged open the second i pressed the catch and i made myself look inside and i sort of moaned nickered like a colt going for its mother it was there all right packs and packs of paperbanded bills fives tens and twenties i dipped my hands down into it and brought them up again and it was all money no false packages no junk i didnt have to count it hell i could almost count it in my head a hundred grand a hundred grand and mona id rescued her from her wicked aunt and meted out justice to this guy who had molested her and id recovered this money which was rightfully hers and soon we would shake the dust of this old land from our feet depart this scene of my many tragic disappointments and we would go to some sunny clime like mexico and man what a happy life wed lead me and that sweet child that honey babe and a hundred thousand dollars or practically a hundred thousand id probably have to feed a few hundred into my accounts to keep staples happy i dipped down into the money again squeezing and rubbing it between my fingers hating to let go of it it was old of course but still clean and crisp and yeah hell you think i havent been around it was the real thing i make no pretense of being a great mental genius but there is one thing i cannot be fooled on dear reader the green goods i cannot be deceived about counterfeit you get stuck a few times like i have when you are an innocent trusting kid and have to make it up out of your own pocket and you learn to spot the goddamned stuff a hundred yards away i took six bills thirty dollars from a packet of fives and stuffed them into my waliet that would give me a good day at the store and keep this unappreciative character staples who was always giving me a hard time from giving me a hard time i dropped the rest of the pack back into the satchel and started to fasten the catch and i was a happy man dear reader i had won out in the unequal struggle with every sonofabitch in the country even my own father giving me a bad time i had forged onward and upward against unequal odds my lips bloody but unbowed and from now on it would be me and mona and all this dough living a dream life in some sunny clime mexico or canada or somewhere the rest of the goddamned world could go to hell but though i seldom complain you have doubtless read between the lines and you know that i am one hard luck bastard so now right as i stood on the doorstep of dreams come true my whole world crumpled beneath me i had all this dough and i had mona or i soon would have her and then i looked up and she was in her nightgown she was all prettied up like hadnt seen her since dont know when and she wasnt more than a dozen feet away standing in the entrance to the little hall that led back to the bedroom smiling at me but sort of watchful kind of smilefrowning joyce my wife i didnt think shed seen the money i wasnt sure but the lid of the sample case was up you know and it wasnt likely that she would have i let it drop casually the lid i mean and locked it i said what the heii are you doing here i her eyes fiashed but she held onto the smile i still had my key dolly so you had a key i said so suppose you had a nickel you got to make a telephone call with it please dolly dont make it any harder for me than it is and you never made anything hard for me did you i said you didnt do your goddamned best to wreck this house before you left you didnt screw up every goddamned stitch of clothes had you didnt i know im sorry doily but ive thought things over and if youll just listen to me listen hell i said listening to dames like you is whats put me where i am today and then i shrugged and said all right spili it im iistening id decided id better because maybe she had seen that dough and anyway this was no time to get into a brawl i had to live nice and quiet for the next few weeks my nerves wouldnt take anything else and anything else anything that might draw attention to me just wasnt safe she hesitated iooking at me a little suspicious i guess of the sudden change i said well come on give sit down and ill get us a drink i dont think i want a drink she shook her head youve been drinking quite a bit havent you dolly theres all kinds of bottles around and it looks like you slept in the bed with your shoes on and i was staring at her not saying anything just staring she cut off with the nagging fast stretched her smile just listen to me will you im not back in the house an hour and already im you get us a drink honey please i got a bottle out of the cupboard and a couple of glasses i came back into the living room and she was sitting in the same chair pete had sat in and well it gave me an awfully funny feeiing i poured the drinks and handed her one my hands shook and i patted the lounge at my side why so unsociable why not sit over here weel you really want me to what the hell sure well she sat down on the lounge kind of crossways to me well here i am yeah i said there you are all right i i guess it would be too much to hope i guess i shouldnt ask if youre glad to see me i let myself frown a little thoughtful you know i took a sip of my drink lighted a cigarette and passed her one well its kind of a funny deal i said a guys wife wrecks damned near everything he has and then she takes off for a week almost a week and he thinks its all over he doesnt know where the hell shes been what shes been doing with herself she shows back up without any warning and for all he knows ive been in kansas city doily id started back to houston i was going to get my old job back whered you get the money from the owner of the club i called him collect after i left here that night and he wired me two hundred to get back on oh no dolly please dont act like that honey you know i wouldnt couldnt you know theres never been anyone but you i didnt say anything i said so you stopped off in kc huh yes i had a fourhour layover there between trains and then iwas going on but she paused a moment iooking down into her glass i dont know quite how to put it honey maybe it was getting off by myself for a while being able to stand outside of things and look at them i could see the whole picture that way dolly the good and the bad and it began to look a lot different to me i began to wonder why things had turned out as they had i wasnt sure that i should come back but i felt that i should at least think about it so so thats what i did i took a room in kansas city and i really thought for the first time in months i suppose it was quiet and peaceful and there wasnt something to get me upset the minute i like me for example ive been more to blame than you doily entirely to blame i guess i was responsible for the way i acted well i said im not throwing anything up to you understand but as long as you mention the subject yourself i i turned and looked at her feeling the blood push up into my face what the hell you mean you were responsible please honey im here to help you i love you and im your wife and its a wifes place to stick by her husband i poured myself another drink the neck of the bottle rattling against the glass i threw it down at a gulp and it calmed me down a little bit but only on the outside it didnt change the way i felt you think im crazy is that it i said well it wouldnt be any goddamned wonder if i was ive been knocking myself out for people almost from the time i began to walk and all i got for it was a royal screwing its like it was a plot almost the whoie goddamned world sitting up nights to figure out how to give me a hard time every bastard and sonofabitch in the world working together to to i stopped it was all true by god but somehow saying it out loud saying it just then it didnt sound so good well anyway i said youve got to admit ive had plenty of hard luck of course you have dear so have a lot of other people a lot of other people hell you name me just one person thats got the rooking ive got in his work and his home life and i stopped myself again she slid over on the lounge put one of her hands over mine you do see it dont you honey and now that you understand and i understand we can stop it before we can do something about it id do something about it all right she may have thought shed had a tough time before but she hadnt seen anything yet id have her run out of here inside of a week long before mona and i were due to get together theres i dont want to upset you honey but theres something i want to ask yeah i said well go ahead maybe id better not not tonight im sure you wouldnt uh come on spit it out well about the money i dolly i let go of her wrist grinned and gave it a little pat it had been a dumb thing to do to cut her off before she had a chance to say whatever she was going to but i just hadnt been able to help myself scuse piease i said i guess seeing you in that nightgown i kind of lost my head now what about the money weel nothing do you really like the gown honey love it what about the money she hesitated then she smiled and shook her head nothing honey no really its nothing i was just going to say that uh well i had quite a bit of money left from cashing in my ticket and all and uh of course ill have to pay it back but we couid use if for a while and she went on smiling at me smiling into my eyes and of course she was a goddamned liar like every other woman id ever known but i couldnt be sure she was lying now well i said i wont say i couldnt use a little extra money ill give it to you in the morning she said be sure and remind me of it those deadbeats have really been giving me a time i said the rotten bastards youd think they were trying to see how hard well skip it i must be beginning to sound like one long gripe its all right darling dont ever be afraid to talk to me well anyway i said i caught up with a flock of em tonight pulled in a nice littie wad of dough ought to make staples act half way decent toward me for a change wonderful she said im so glad for you honey and it seemed to me that her smile became a lot more real the watchfulness went out of her she turned down another drink i poured one for myself and sat sipping it thinking and then i happened to look at her out of the corner of my eyes and she was looking at me the same way her head cocked to one side i laughed and she laughed i set down my drink and pulled her over on my lap i kissed her or i guess you could say she kissed me she put her hands back of my head and pulled my face down to hers and i thought we werent ever coming up for air but you dont hear me kicking she was a lot of woman that joyce she had the face and she had the build it wasnt hard to forget for a little while that she was just plain nogood and never would be she pulled away at last and lay back smiling up at me wiggling and breathing pretty hard as i made with the hands mmmm she said half closing her eyes oh dolly we are going to be happy arent we hell i said im happy right now do you really like my nightgown honey tell me the truth now huhuh i said i dont like it oh why honey i spent almost one whole afternoon picking it out and i was just sure it covers you up i said i dont like anything that covers you up she laughed and said oh you and gave me a little pinch she pulled my head down again and whispered in my ear ill tell you something honey its a new kind of gown it comes off well well afterwards after shed gone to sleep i got up to get a drink of water and on the way back to the bedroom i locked the sample case and put the key in my pocket i got back into bed i turned on my side and closed my eyes and it was as though a guard had been taken away from a gate or a door suddenly thrown open letting in a hundred images that i hadnt looked at until then that i hadnt really looked at letting them all rush in at me at once the old woman and pete the way shed looked the way hed looked her head swinging like a pumpkin her body sprawled on the stairs his face his face and neck the way hed chuckled when he asked me i screamed i flung myself up in bed rocking and screaming because jesus i hadnt wanted to do it and i wouldnt ever have done it again but now it was done and there wasnt any way i could undo it and god id be caught sure as hell id just blundered my way through and probably id done a hundred things that the cops could trace me on or if they werent bright enough to catch up with me mona would probably do the job for them shed get scared and talk to save her own neck and jesus i rocked back and forth screaming and crying oh god almighty my god god god and then there was someone else saying my god oh my god darling and joyce was holding onto me her body rocking with mine im ssorry i said i i god im sorry i didnt mean it im lie down she said lie down and mother will hold her boy mothers never going to go away and leave her boy again shes going to stay right here and hold him close like this and nothing can hurt him then theres nothing to be afraid of hes with mother and hes safe and mother will understand whatever wwhatever i got hold of myself partly i said i must have been having a nightmare i there there she said its all right everythings going to be all right darling hes going to lie down now and there there there she pulled me back down she moved her pillow up a little bit and moved mine down a littie there she said no baby around this way thaats my boy now down a little just a little more and then closer darling very close to mother and she drew me close and slid the gown down off her shoulders well even a punching bag gets a rest once in a while and now and then usually right after ive been torn all to pieces i get a little relief things will actually begin to look pretty good to me ive been down as far as i can go you see so i start going back up again kind of soaring and man when you catch me that way im a hard guy to stop joyce was up ahead of me the next morning by the time id dressed she had breakfast waiting and a good one no kidding and she didnt say a word about the night before id been sort of worried about that worried and kind of ashamed but she didnt let out a peep about it or let on like thered been a thing out of the way so that day was started off right right from the beginning she kept a little of the money from her trip for groceries and gave me the rest she gave me a love pat now and then while she was waiting on me and i got a big hug and a kiss when i was ready to leave notice anything she said smiling up at me ive got a house dress on and my hair is combed and my face is made up and did you notice i started to say so what you want me to shoot off some skyrockets but it just wasnt that kind of morning so i said youre darned right noticed you look swell baby youll be right home tonight well sure i said why not why wouldnt i come right home i just wanted to know so that i could have dinner ready something on your mind i said anything bothering you her face fell a litle at the tone of my voice i figured then she stood on tiptoe and kissed me again and she said laughing yes you ive got you on my mind now run along so i can get some work done i started for town on the way in i stopped and bought a newspaper and i had a hard moment or two before i found the story and made myself read it it was okay it was swell the case was so openandshut that it hadnt even made the front pages it was back on page three and there was only about half a column of it mona had been in bed asleep and had been awakened by the sounds of struggle at first too terrified to investigate she had finally forced herself to when the sound of several shots was followed by a prolonged silence mrs farrells niece identified hendrickson as a onetime oddjobs man in her aunts employ he had quit swearing vengeance she said after a dispute over his wages as police reconstructed the case hendrickson returned to the house last night drinking and surly and demanded payment of the disputed sum angered by the elderly womans refusal he gave her a nearfatal beating robbed her and started to flee mrs farrell managed to follow him to the head of the stairs and shoot him she then fell and broke her neck although it is believed she would have died anyway as a result of the beating police revealed that hendrickson had a record of several arrests for drunkenness disorderly conduct and battery he recently completed a six months jail sentence for assaulting an officer who was taking him into custody that was just about it all thats important mona had recited her story just as id given it to her and thank god there werent any pictures if theyd gotten her picture and she hadnt kept her face covered like she was crying you know like id told her to idve had some questions to answer staples would have recognized her as the same girl who bailed me out of jail and hedve been mighty curious about it hedve wanted to know what i was to her and she to me and just where was i last night at the time of the killings and if i couldnt answer his questions but there werent any pictures the case was too openandshut the people involved just werent important enough i stopped at the store and checked in and out i went to work trying to figure out some place where i might stash that dough it was pretty awkward to lug around with me heavy and the samples didnt cover it too well lift up a few and there it was someone might accidentally spot it before i could stop em joyce might want some panties or stockings out of the case and well any way you looked at it it wasnt good to have it with me i thought about it all morning as i drove around i fretted and fumed trying to think of something getting pretty sore at myself because i couldnt but i couldnt and that was that i thought of a couple places but they werent any good they were worse or they seemed worse than keeping the dough with me check it at the railroad station well you know how that is those guys are always banging stuff around breaking stuff open accidentallyonpurpose or they give your baggage out to someone else or they get screwed up on the claim check and you have to identify the contents you know you read about it all the time a safety deposit box well that would be just as bad or more so id have to give references to rent one and maybe i could give staples huh and anyway characters like me we arent supposed to have anything worth locking up i had to keep it with me it was the only thing knew to do id just have to take the stuff out of the case that i was going to show people as for joyce well i could handle her she was on her good behavior now afraid of getting me sore and i wouldnt need to give her any expianations or act apologetic id just tell her to go down to the store if she wanted anything i was tired of getting my samples screwed up id keep the sample case locked and tell her to keep the hell away from it and if she didnt like it she could lump it i framed the words in my mindjust how id tell her off if she started nosing around and then i got to thinking about iast night and i decided it wouldnt be necessary to talk to her that way id say well id say now honey im not even going to let your pretty fingers touch that junk you just tell old doily what you want and hell bring you home something good it would be better to say something like that it was just good sense you know hell you can still be polite to people even if you dont give a damn about em i knocked off work about one oclock and checked over my take i had twentyeight dollars pretty good for a morning but nothing at all for a day of course but with that other thirty the six fives id taken from the hundred grand it would make me a plenty good day i stopped in a bar i ordered a prewrapped sandwich those bastards could eat their own siop and a bottle of ale and took it over to the booth i ate and drank i got another ale and spread out my collection cards they were really honeys these accounts we had they made the first payment and then you fought em for the rest catch those characters coming in or sending in the dough you either fought em for it or you didnt get it and you didnt always get it then i picked out six pastdues six accounts that owed us five bucks each i marked them up on the cards shifted the thirty from my wallet to the company cash bag and well that was it it was about two oclock by now i moved on to another bar buying a iate paper on the way theyd cut the story down to about three paragraphs in this one there was nothing new in it or rather nothing that mattered the house and the furniture were just about the sum total of the old womans estate and it seemed like she was so far behind in her taxes that the property would just about cover em she hadnt left any will mona was her only known survivor and so on nothing that mattered everything was still okay i ordered my second double shot and another ale for a chaser it was kind of funny about those taxes the old woman not paying em all that dough and shed let the taxes pile up until the county was on the point of taking over but well maybe it wasnt so funny either so strange i mean a lot of people dont pay taxes until the guns right on them and shed been just as stingy and tightfisted about everything else living on beans and junk making mona lay for everyone that came along she was just a miser and theres no accounting for misers the only money shed spent that she could have got out of was that little bit of yard work shed hired pete to do and i guessed she probably hadnt laid out much cash then if any pete had taken it out in trade got his pay from mona mona she was a plenty sweet child and i was in love with her but id fallen in love before thinking i was getting something special and how had it turned out how did i know it wouldnt turn out the same way with her i hadnt thought much about it until last night hadnt had any real doubts about her id been just a little bothered the way shed cut loose with me but except for last night idve been ready to skip it when you put the two together the way shed acted with me and the way shed blown her top over pete and when you got to thinking about all those other guys well i wasnt putting up with any more tramps i mean id had enough goddamned tramps to last me a lifetime i was sure that she wasnt one pretty sure but if i ever got the notion that she was brother look out what the hell could she do about it anyway what if i told her right now that shed been on a buggy ride and this was where she got off why she couldnt do anything thats what i could keep the money and tell her to go to heil well maybe id give her a few bills and there wasnt a damned thing she could do about it and it wouldnt bother me that much if theres anything i cant stand its a goddamned tramp joyce now well ive talked pretty rough about joyce and she was as lazy and sloppy and ornery as they come but there was aiways one thing i was sure of pretty sure damned sure regardless of what i said she didnt play around she never had and she wouldnt know how to begin it just wasnt in her see if shed been as square about other things as shed been about that if she kept up this act shed been putting on since shed been back if it was an act i figured it just about had to be because a leopard dont change her spots but it was a damned good one as good as the real thing so what the hell was the difference joyce yeah joyce had her points all right and now that i wouldnt have to knock myself out to make a living now that i could feel like i amounted to something and we could have nice things and but that was the trouble the money how could i explain to her about the money what kind of story could i hand her i guessed i couldnt explain anyway i couldnt think of a good story offhand and there wasnt any hurry about it i wasnt supposed to see mona for a couple of weeks and i could probably think of a lot of things between now and then well i drank another round and left the place i got some black coffee and started driving again just around just killing time it was four oclock more than two hours before i could check in at the store and get home to joyce joyce mona joyce mona what the hell thought and i tried to push it out of my mind mona was a good kid anyone could see that she was and shed carried through on this deal like a little brick doing what she was told helping to murder her own aunt for her dough well well she was on the square all right shed damned well better be because knewjoyce was and if i could just think up the right kind of story to account for that hundred grand i drove around until after six making myself look good then i checked in at the store bustling in like id been on the run all day and staples eyebrows went up a little when he saw what i had for him not bad frank he said counting the money oh not half bad perhaps by the end of the week youll be doing a decent days work again gee thanks i said you better watch that stape you keep patting me on the back like that and youre liable to break your wrist he grinned down his nose we said goodnight and i started to leave and he called me back by the way i see that a couple of your customers came to a violent end last night one of your customers i should say and the relative of one yeah i said i read about that too damned bad they dont all get bumped off oh now frank what would we do for customers i mean it i said if every one of the rotten bastards dropped dead of the bleeding piles it would tickle me pink it reaily would wouldnt it he nodded but this farrell case theres an angle of it which struck me as being rather curious yeah i said i mean it did mmm uhhah mrs farrell was apparently a virtual pauper yet her niece her dependent spends thirtythree dollars for a chest of silverware he stood looking at me eyebrows cocked waiting for me to say something i swallowed and it sounded by god like niagara fails well i said what about it frank honestly and ive always looked upon you as my best man in a hideous sort of way of course you actually dont see anything contradictory in the situation well ill tell you i said yes yes frank ill tell you the way i feel stape these bastards we got on our books i dont try to figure them out its no use know what i mean you cant expect em to make any sense if they werent nutty as a pecan orchard they wouldnt be trading with us weei he hesitated yes i cant say that i disagree with you youd attribute this then to merely another of the mental aberrations peculiar to our clientele spending their last dollar on like i say i said i dont think about em at all dont even try to figure them out all im interested in is have they got the money and can get it away from em hear hear he clapped his hands together spoken like a true payezee man well toodleoo dear boy and pleasant dreams i started for the door again he called to me again for gods sake i said whirling around what the hell you want now stape it aint enough i knock myself out all day i got to stand around here half the goddamned night talking to you why frank he pouted i do believe youre annoyed with me is there something about this case that uh did i say something that disturbed you i told him sure he disturbed me he bothered hell out of me hanging onto me this time of night when i wanted to get home and get my shoes off and get some grub under my belt ive been working all day know what i mean i havent been sitting around on my butt reading newspapers i see he nodded you feel a slight twinge of conscience mrs farrell tipped you off to petes whereabouts didnt she and he no doubt guessed as much and so why should that bother me i said it all turned out all right they both got killed he frowned staring at me turning a little pale then he laughed unwillingly shaking his head oh frank he said what will i ever do with you keep me standing around here a while longer i said and you wont have to do anything ill keel over from hunger unthinkable night frank night stape i said and i headed for home he didnt know anything didnt even guess anything he was just staying in character that was all and id been stupid to get upset about it hell hadnt he done the same thing a hundred times before picked at me tried to rattle me nosed around like a skunk in a garbage dump not because there was anything to act that way about you understand just because he was the boss and you had to hold still for it and being on the make himself he figured everyone else was yeah i should have counted on it tonight he figured id had a hard day and you could almost always count on it after a hard day so so there wasnt anything to get up in the air about not a damned thing at all and everything was jake but still i was glad to get home i was glad to have joyces arms around me holding me tight to hear her whisper that i was her boy mothers boy and she would never leave me again she held me reaching up to stroke my head and finally we sat down at the table side by side it was all ready the dinner i mean shed put it on the table when she heard my car it was good and it was hot and we sat next to each other squeezing hands now and then and i hadnt had much appetite before hadnt thought i could eat a bite but i really stowed it away she poured the coffee i lighted two cigarettes and gave her one you asked me something last night isaid now id like to tell you the answer im glad dolly i was hoping you would you asked me if i was glad youd come back all ive got to say is youre damned right i am oh she hesitated then she leaned forward and kissed me im glad that youre glad dolly its wonderful to be back she cleared away the dishes and i helped her she didnt want me to but i did anyway i wiped while she washed them and then we moved into the living room the light was turned down low she curled up next to me on the lounge her legs pulled up under her her head resting against my shoulder it was pretty nice mighty peaceful and pleasant i felt like if it could just be this way forever i wouldnt ask a damned thing more dolly she said and right at the same time i said joyce we spoke together and then we laughed and she said go ahead honey what were you going to say oh nothing much i said probably nothing will come of it of what well its a chance to make some real dough a pile of it anyway it looks like a good chance one of the fellows down at the store one of the collectors well his brotherinlaw is manager of a big gambling house out in las vegas and the owners of the place havent been treating him right see hes made em rich and now theyre about to kick him out so he wrote his brotherinlaw this collector down at the store and told him that if he could get up some money he this manager would place it with a shill and let the shill win and and she hadnt said a word hadnt changed her position but all of a sudden the room seemed to have gotten cold and her shoulder felt stiff against mine well i said i guess maybe that isnt such a good idea might get in trouble on a deal like that but theres another proposition i run across and dolly she said i have to know where did you get that money i leaned forward and stamped out my cigarette in an ash tray i stayed leaned forward while i lighted another one and then i sat back again and i yawned man am i tired you about ready to turn in honey dolly what i said oh the money i thought i told you about that i caught a few old accounts at home last night people that really owed us a wad and i saw it dolly i dont know how much there was but i know there was a lot a whole bag full i turned around and stared at her i gave her the hard eye trying to stare her down and she didnt flinch there was a little frown on her forehead but it wasnt unfriendly she didnt look tough or like she might get tough if shed been that way idve known what to do but the way it was i didnt i couldntve slugged her if id been paid to i couldnt do anything the silence must have gone on for five minutes finally she reached out and took one of my hands in hers and spoke i came back to you dolly it wasnt easy after everything that had happened between us but i felt that i had to i loved you and i wanted to help you well i said you dont hear me kicking do you do you remember last night honey dont you think that after that ddont you know that i love you and you can trust me and that all i want is to help you i tell you i said ill bet we get waked up pretty early in the morning i notice theyve got a couple of cars of gravel switched onto the siding out here and theyll probably be hooking onto em she stood up smoothed down her house dress she looked down at me frowning slightly gave me a little nod like a teacher dismissing a kid all right dolly i guess theres nothing more i can say perhaps its my fault for leaving you going off in a tantrum when i should have known that you were that a man who acted as you did was wasnt himself and might oh dolly dolly what have you ddone she threw her hands over her face and sat down on the lounge again crying sobbing helplessly and she seemed so alone as lost and scared as id been last night joyce i said please baby what the hell what are you acting that way for yyou you know why aall that money i hoped youd tell me that thered be some innocent explanation i ddidnt know what it ccould be but i hoped and now i know that you cant explain yyoure afraid and aw now wait a minute i said wait just a minute baby i tried to pull her onto my lap she moved her shoulders shaking off my hands i waited a minute looking at her listening to her feeling myself come apart inside then i tried again and that time i made it i wanted to tell you about it i said but i wasnt sure i was going to get to keep it see so i thought id better hold off a few days otherwise youd be counting on it and then youd be disappointed i ddont she pulled her head away from my chest and looked at me what how do you mean i found that money oh dolly she started to cry again please not any more i jjust cant stand it if you lie to me any im not lying i know it sounds crazy as hell i could hardly believe it myself but its true bbut it im telling you ill tell you if you give me a chance you want me to tell you or not she sniffled and looked at me again i thought she was never going to stop looking but finally she nodded aall right dolly but pplease dont if it isnt true ddont well i said i cant guarantee that youll believe me ive been afraid that no one would believe me and thats what makes it so hard to know what to do i wwant to believe you honey theres nothing i want more well it happened last night one of my accounts a skip named estill i got a tip that he was living out on west agnew street so i beat it out there and the house was empty if hed ever lived in the place he wasnt any more well i got my flash out of the car and went inside and went inside she frowned why whyi said well youd know if youd ever done any collecting honey if youd ever worked for an outfit like payezee we always go in if we can get in you might pick up a telephone number off the wall you know or maybe theres been an old letter left behind something that will give you a lead on the skip oh she said and her frown faded and some of the doubt went out of her eyes go on honey so i went in and i looked around from room to room and i couldnt find a thing not a scrap of paper or an address or nothing it looked like well it almost looked like someone had gone to a lot of trouble to see that nothing was left behind like everything had been washed and scrubbed before they left it was very screwy know what i mean it got me curious so i kept on iooking and finally i found this this little satchel pushed way back on the shelf on one of the bedroom closets i opened it up and looked inside and im telling you honey it really threw me for a loop i paused to light a cigarette i offered her one giving her a quick sizeup and i took a long deep breath shed swallowed it all so far it was a pretty good yarn and she was anxious to swallow it what did you say this mans name was honey this man you were tracing when estill robert estili ive got his card right here in my pocket if you want to look at it she said oh no but she hesitated a second first so i took the card out and showed it to her it was on the level actually his card which was a heil of a lot more than i could say for him wed got two payments out of him and then hed done the disappearing act i can show you the empty house too i said and i could have shown one to her its at west agnew and i can drive you out there right now nno thats not necessary i how much money is there dolly i started to lie to tell her there was five or ten grand or some such figure because she might ride along with that where she might not with more and once shed started riding the rest would be fairly simple i could say well i could pretend like id invested part of the dough or gambled with it or or done something to make myself a pile but she wasnt completely sold yet not so sold anyway that it wouldnt be awfully easy to unsell her if she asked to look at the money to count it i told her the truth she jumped and almost fell off my lap dolly oh my goodness honey a hhundred thous it must have been stolen or it could be kidnap money or its not marked i said i know that i checked it over but good its bound to be something like that it just has to be youve got to take it to the police dolly and suppose there is something shady about it like there probably is where does that leave me a guy like me a floater with no friends or background ill tell you what would happen if they couldnt beat me into signing some kind of confession theyd just lock me up and keep me until they could dig up the right answers but if you took the money in that should prove that i tell you theyd never believe me theyd think i just got scared and was trying to do a coverup thats what makes it so hard why ive been so worried i wont say that i dont want to keep it but what difference would it make if i didnt the story sounds screwy i can hardly believe it myself and i dont reckon you believe it and i shoved her off my lap suddenly i went into the kitchen and reached a pint out of the cupboard and i took a long stiff slug from the bottle id thought of something right while i was talking to her something about the money and it had rattled me like lightning on a tin roof the dough wasnt marked i knew that but suppose there was something actually shady about it that it actually hadnt belonged to the old woman suppose the cops or the fbi were on the lookout for certain serial numbers i shivered then i remembered and i sighed with relief mona had baiied me out of jail with part of the money four days ago if the stuff was hot id have known about it by now i put the bottle back in the cupboard i turned back around and joyce was there and she threw her arms around me i believe you doily she said her voice sort of desperate i believe every word of it well gosh i said ill be frank with you honey i wouidnt blame you much if you didnt wwhat are you going to do doily we cant keep it well i dont know i said i mean what else can we do i wont say that i dont want to keep it but even if no oh no honey there must be some way to to how you name some way where i wont have to go to jail and probably get loused up for the rest of my life weel well couldnt you go out to that neighborhood and make some inquiries find out huhuh attract a lot of attention to myself and maybe have someone call the cops not me i was out there after dark and no one saw me im in the clear so far and thats where im staying but we just ccant so tell me what we can do i said just tell me and ill do it you dont want me togo to jail do you nno oh no dear if i thought it would do any good i said i would but all i can see is getting fouled up it wouldnt help anyone that much money if it was stolen it must have been insured and the insurance moneys already been paid over no ones out anything but the insurance companies and you know those birds they already got half the money in the world got it from gypping people foreclosing on farms and giving everybody a hard time i see no reason why i should stick my neck out for some thieving insurance company she was silent thinking i stooped down and kissed her on top of the head you and me joyce i said we never really had a chance honey it was always one goddamned dump after another never having a nickel to spare hell i tell you you may try hard you may patch things up temporarily but you go on living like that and sooner or later her arms tightened she whispered oh dolly oh i love you so much honey a hundred thousand i said softly and it belongs to us just as much as it belongs to anyone a hundred thousand a decent house a place with lots of windows so that the sunlight could stream in and and decent furniture instead of junk and a good car for a change and no worries not being half out of your mind all the time wondering how the hell to make both ends meet and and she whispered well sure i said why not im all in favor of kids if people can take care of em she sighed and hugged me closer i knew youd feel that way honey you were always so good about so many things i dont know why i ever thought that that her voice trailed off i waited stroking her hair i dont know dolly i want to i want to so much why dont you iook at it i said feel it count it lets count it together honey figure out how we can spend it like to do that huh well she hesitated no no id better not its hard enough to think straight as it is lets lets just not talk about it any more lets lets so we didnt talk about it any more i picked her up in my arms and carried her into the bedroom i had a good night i got off to a good start the next morning joyce was pretty thoughtful and a shade pale around the gills as the saying is but that was the way it should be she was a swell kid aiways been on the level and all and naturally something that wasnt strictly kosher would give her a jolt i bought a paper on the way into town i had to turn through it twice before i found the story about well you know and it wasnt really about that then it was just mentioned in passing in connection with a little squib about the old womans estate the county was filing a suit for the back taxes mona had been served with a thirtyday eviction notice i threw the paper away i drove on to the store thinking that the poor kid really wasnt getting any breaks if the property had been clear she might have got a nice piece of change for it enough to live on a couple years and make a new start somewhere but it just wasnt in the cards she was just the original hard luck kid of course id give her a few bills i wouldnt let her be put out on the street with no clothes and not a dime to her name but it would have been a lot better if shed had some real dough i wondered if she had any money to eat on and i thought for a minute of slipping a few bills in an envelope and sending it to her i felt sorry for the kid and i really wanted to help her you know but i finally decided against it the police might be keeping an eye on the place with all i had to lose i wasnt taking any chances shed get by all right the way she was used to living she probably wouldnt feel right if she had enough to eat staples usually opened the store at eightthirty a half hour before i and the other outside men went to work but he hadnt done it that morning it was a few minutes before nine when i got there and the place was still closed up tight and the other guys were waiting out front for him to show i got out of my car and joined them we waited around smoking and talking wondering if the sonofabitch had got run over by a truck and hoping to hell that he had but there was no such luck of course at ninethirty he showed up he unlocked and we followed him inside it didnt seem to be done deliberately but somehow the other guys were all checked out ahead of me and i was left alone with him he began checking me out kidding and laughing i felt myself getting uneasy he just wasnt himself know what i mean he was in too damned good a humor well sure he was always ribbing and making with the fast talk but it wasnt because he was mr gayheart scattering pearls of joy and so on it was about as genuine as a dimestore diamond he couldnt work you over with a bailbat like he wanted to so he swung the old needle making like it was a joke in case you got sore this morning though it was different the sonofabitch was really tickled pink about something i picked up my cards and asked him what the big joke was ill bet i know i said you tripped a blind man on your way to work ah frank he giggled giving me a pussycat tap on the wrist always putting others in your place as a matter of fact i paid a call on an old friend someone i hadnt seen in almost twenty years no kidding i said you mean you go out to this nut house they got you inside and then they let you go he giggled again made another pass at my wrist youre getting warm dear boy strange how our minds seem to run in the same sewer the friend i visited the acquaintance i should say was in a public institution jail huh i knew it i said well its a good thing youve got a standin with the local cops a standin ive gone to some pains to develop frank it proves very useful in a position such as mine but no youre still a little wide of the mark it wasnt actually jail more of a corollary establishment i should say yeah mmmm an adjunct to the jail but isee that im boring youand ive already delayed you unpardonably away with you good friend on to the assault on the heels and may their achilles heel be bared to you i dont dig this i said this party you visited he was in some kind of trouble no ha ha i wouldnt say that frank at least the party made no complaint to me well hell then what no he held up a hand no i wont let you frank youre just being polite pretending an interest in my poor conversation and i cant allow it do run along now i insist on it and oh yes i know i said i know you want me to knock em dead again knock them oh well put oh very well put and he grinned i turned my back on him and walked out my stomach was all tight and funny feeling it seemed to be narrowed drawn down at the bottom like id swallowed something heavy and there was a sickish feeling in my throat and hoticy needles were jabbing through my head i got in my car so shaky that i could hardly turn the switch key i backed away from the curb and started driving aimlessly sort of blind finally i pulled up at a bar and parked myself in a rear booth the drink helped the drinks helped i began to calm down he couldnt know anything the cops didnt so how could he and what the hell somehow hed spotted that i was a little uneasy hed seen it and started working on it trying to needle out the answer he was swinging every which way throwing out the scatter shots in the hope that one of them would hit something this frammis this morning now it just about had to be a dammed lie when you started studying it an ordinary guy would have come right out and admitted that he overslept or got stuck in an elevator or something of the kind but staples wasnt an ordinary guy a decent one i mean hed lie just for the hell of it climb a tree to lie when he could stand on the ground and tell the truth so since he wanted to needle me anyway hed come up with this story about visiting an old friend a friend that wasnt anywhere know what i mean no place i could pin down no place that i could check on if i took a notion the party was in jail but he wasnt and so on a big mystery a lot of double talk if he just hadnt been so damned tickled so pleased with himself but that would be part of the act another scatter shot or maybe he had actually screwed someone and it had put him in a good humor hed been boasting around about how he was going to make one of the maids at his hotel hed been working on it for weeks hinting that he was going to get her fired then turning the other way sweetening her up with little presents from the store so maybe hed finally connected anyway anyway he didnt know anything dammit he didnt know anything but i sure didnt feel like working i couldnt whip the deadbeats today if i tackled em the way i felt theyd probably wind up collecting from me what i wanted to do was go home not do anything you know but just be there stay there all day close to joyce but hell it was out of the question she was already plenty bothered about the money so upset that she hadnt even wanted me to leave it there in the house with her she was about ready to go along with keeping it instead of going to the police but she still didnt like it and if i laid off today shed realize that there was a lot more not to like than she knew about i had four or five drinks in that bar stretching them out until around noon then i went back to my car and started driving again i drove to the outskirts of town and turned off on a dirt road i parked i leaned over the seat and opened my sample case i took twelve of the fivedollar bills this time enough to add up to a full days work i fingered them hesitating thinking and then i put six of them back and took three tens instead that was more like it twelve fives and nothing else might look a little funny i put the bills in my cash bag i spread the collection cards out on my clipboard and doctored them then well that was all there was nothing left to do and i had almost five hours to do it in a picture show hell who wanted to go to a picture show sit there in the dark alone i could have enjoyed reading because im quite a reader see but i couldnt sit out on the street and do it and theres never a damned thing worth reading in these libraries no good confession stories or movie magazines or anything interesting i started driving again i guess theres nothing thatll get you down so fast as driving when youve got no place to go i kept thinking how nice it would be to go home knowing it was out of the question and i began to get pretty sore what the hell anyway a guys sick and worried and he cant even go to his own home talk to his own wife it was a pretty damned sorry state of affairs if you asked me a man knocks himself outputs himself on the spot on account of her and she keeps right on giving him a hard time banging his ears and worrying him as if he didnt have enough to worry about already mona wouldnt act like that that little mona now there was a real sweet kid a real honey shed had to do a few things that she shouldnt have done so maybe she wasnt highclass like joyce like joyce pretended to be but huhuh about joyce joyce wasnt much good at pretending shed told me off plenty of times in the past the way she acted was the way she felt and no puton about it but mona was okay too and i needed to see her i needed to be with someone talk to someone someone almost anyone that was on my side i drove across town to that center where she sometimes shopped i went into the little bar there next to the drugstore and sat down near the door it was one of those places the kind that makes you wonder how the hell they stay in business because this joint it sure didnt have any an old codger nursing a dime beer some paintedup dame getting high on sherry and counting her change every two minutes thats all there was i had a couple of double scotches i told the bartender to pick himself up a buck tip and i thought he was going to drop dead he set a bowl of peanuts in front of me he dropped a handful of slugs into the jukebox i told him the light up front was pretty bright and would he mind turning it off or rather i started to tell him he had it turned off before i could finish the sentence okay anything else sir ill let you know i said and he took the hint and left me alone i turned a little sidewise on my stool i sat looking up front one elbow on the bar drinking and thinking and the time loafed by i bought another drink and the bartender bought me one i took a swallow or two from it glanced at my watch it was a few minutes after three probably she wouldnt be by you never can see peopie when you really want to so probably i wouldnt get to see her i got up and went back to the john i came out and there she was just going by i just got a glimpse of her i sauntered up to the door like i wanted to get a breath of air she went into the super market i waited a couple of minutes and then i went back to my stool i stood by it sipping my drink and watching the door out of the corner of my eye the jukebox had run out of slugs the dame and the old codger had left it was quiet in there and kind of echoy and i heard her heard those fast footsteps of hers before i saw her i got to the door just as she was passing and yeah i let her pass i wanted to talk to her but there was something i wanted worse something i wanted to know so i let her go right on by and stood in the door watching i watched her until she rounded the corner two blocks away i watched her and the cars on the street the people and then she was out of sight and i felt a hell of a lot better she wasnt being tailed the police werent keeping an eye on her she was in the clear which meant i was so that jerk staples could take his goddamned needle and i went back to my stool kind of sorry that i hadnt got to talk to her because she was a swell kid you know but glad that id handied it this way now i was sure and now i didnt need to talk to her i was feeling okay and i had the biggest part of the day licked i motioned to the bartender he made with the whiz and the soda i took out a cigarette and he lit it for me smirking and giving me the wink quite a dish huh sir a really wellstacked babe what i said what babe you didnt notice her the one that just went by pretty little girl with so much above the belt she can hardly see over it oh her i said yeah i believe i did notice her went by when i was getting some air didnt she thats the one lives around here someplace i guess a real hot customer from all i hear no kidding i said i thought she looked like a pretty nice girl well you know the saying mister the nicer they look the lower down they are i he caught my eye and broke off he began scrubbing the counter with the bartowel his smirk drawing in around the edges of course i dont really know anything he said all ive got to go on is what some of the fellows around here have said could be a lot of lies and probably is i took another swallow of my drink i said well i didnt know about that the way i figure where theres so much smoke theres got to be fire well his smirk started to spread again she didnt get them breastworks from chinning herself i wonder how a guy would go about getting some well they tell me its pretty simple from what i hear and i got no reason to doubt it all you got to do is give her the old proposition yeah just like that huh so they tell me they tell me its just a matter of howsabout it toots and you can get out the coal shovel he nodded giving me another wink i picked up my change every damned penny of it and left i drove around a while got myself some coffee and ate a handful of mints it was that time by then so i went to the store and checked in there was no hurrahing or needling from staples he had a dinner date i guess or maybe hed decided that there wasnt anything he could nose out anyway he checked me out fast and i went home everything was about like it had been the night before a good dinner joyce being sweet and nice despite the way she was worried about the money i couldnt think of much to say to her talk so i just let her ramble on at one time i got to frowning unconsciously staring around the living room and frowning i wasnt really thinking about it at all you know but she thought i was im sorry darling she apologized ive been meaning to clean house from top to bottom but ive been so well never mind ill get busy on it the first thing in the morning you wont know the place when you get home oh hell i said let it go it looks okay to me no she said im going to do it itll help to take my mind off of of she didnt finish the next day was thursday like the other days sincejoyce had come back it started off good breakfast was ready and waiting for mejoyce was swell there was no mention of the mur of the case in the morning papers i thought well everything else is so good that goddamned staples will probably give me a hard time but i was dead wrong about it i was the first guy he checked out and he didnt waste any time about it i went back around the corner and climbed into my car i backed away from the curb and i dont know where shed been hiding waiting back in some doorway i guess but suddenly there she was mona was piling into the car with me stammering scared so scared that i could hardly understand her ssomethings wwrong ddolly ttthe ppolice are fffollowing me the police great god the police were after her and shed led them right to me my foot slipped off the clutch and the car leaped forward i jammed my foot down on the gas inside of two blocks i was doing seventy right through the early morning traffic and god i dont know how i kept from being pinched or from smashing into someone then i began to think again and i slapped on the brakes but i didnt stop the hell the police were following her i knew damned weil they werent but i wanted to get her away from the store neighborhood if staples saw us together it would be just as bad as if the police were on our tail now whats this all about i said finally heading the car toward the country i know the police arent watching you i know see i told her about the afternoon before how id wanted to see her but i wasnt the kind of guy to give way to my emotions the important thing was to take care of her make sure that everything was okay so id taken time off from my job gone to all kinds of trouble and done it bbut they dont do it in the daytime dolly jjust at nnight tuesday night and last night i was afraid to call you or ggo to your house and i knew you wouldnt be there during the day sso well that was a break it would have been a hell of a note if shed come busting in on me and joyce never mind i said pretty damned disgusted with her never mind the trimmings you say the police have been watching you how do you know they were police wwell i she hesitated i ddont know but i supposed tell me what happened start with tuesday night well i i was just going out for a walk doily that house i get so scared in it now ive hardly been able to sleep ssince never mind dammit just tell me what happened this car it was pparked up at the next corner right where they whoever was in it could watch the house and just before i got to it they turned the lights on me i went on by and they started up i mmean the car started up it turned around in the street and began to follow me i walked five or six blocks and it followed me until i turned the corner to go home well i said well she looked at me looking like i was supposed to turn flipf lops or something well i went for a walk again last night and the same car was there it was over on the other side of the street and they didnt turn the lights on aand and i started walking pretty fast so i didnt hear it when it started up but id only gone a block when yeah sure i said oh sure and it followed you back to the corner again yes well no not quite you see there were quite a few cars passing and i see i said and boy did i want to paste her scaring hell out of me coming down around the store where staples might have seen her are you even sure that it was the same car what kind of car was it anyway i iddont know i dont know much about cars i tthink it was the same as this one you do huh i said and do you know how many cars there are like this one on the road well ill tell you just about eight million then you dont tthink i shook my head i couldnt trust myself to speak she saw how i felt apparently and she shut up too stupid how stupid could you get anyway it wasnt enough that she was a tramp she had to be stupid on top of it there were a lot of college guys out in that section of town one of em or some guy had tried to pick her up he sees a swelllooking kid out by herself at night so he follows her thinking shell give him a tumble and all hed have to do was say how about it toots and shed probably have jumped into his car but he didnt know that so well anyway thats what had happened something of the kind it had given her a hell of a jolt naturally being scared and having a guilty conscience and having to stay in that house where everything had happened but still she shouldnt have acted like this this was a hell of a stupid way to act i drove along toward the country calming down i began to feel sorry for her to think that i couldnt really blame her for losing her head it might have jarred anyone that was in the spot she was in even me i might have been jarred myself and im a guy thats used to taking it i started talking again dropping in a sweet word now and then i explained to her what had happened that there wasnt a thing in the world to be scared about she couldnt believe it at first shed been knocked for such a loop that she couldnt see the truth when it was pointed out to her and proved to her but i went on talking and finally she did we were in the country by then i turned off the highway and parked she leaned toward me a little smiling kind of timidly i put my arms around her the coat she had on was worn thin and all she had on underneath was one of those wraparounds i could feel her the warmth and the softness well i put my mouth to her ear and whispered howzabout it toots wwhat oh she said and she blushed you mean here in the ddaytime what the hell i said you know the score you ought to know it anyway she didnt say anything but something happened to her eyes they went sick so sick as sick as a sick dogs and i moved my hands away from where they had been and just hugged her tight around the shoulders im sorry i said i talk pretty rough you know and i just wasnt thinking how it sounded iits its all right dolly forget i said it huh because i didnt mean a thing just a manner of speaking hell i knew all about you everything there was to know in the beginning didnt i and it didnt make a damned bit of difference did it i nnever wanted to dolly with you yes everything was different and i wanted to give you everything that i sure dont you suppose i know that i smiled at her gave her a big hug and for a moment i forgot all about joyce youre the sweetest nicest girl in the world and were going to have a swell life together well hang around town two or three weeks longer just to make sure and then well pull out and there wont be any past baby just the future and she snuggled up against me after a while i ran out of words so i just held her and patted her i kept it up for weil maybe fifteen or twenty minutes then a string of cars started to go by and we had to move apart dolly i hate to i dont like to bother you but you couldnt bother me i said you just tell old doily about it and if he can fix it up he will well could i see you tonight just for a little while i get so sscared in that house if i could see you for just a little while bbefore i went to bed there was still some of the sickness and hurt in her eyes not a whole lot but it wouldnt take much to make it into a lot i couldnt have her think i was slapping her down again well id sure like to i said but it might not be too smart see if someone should spot me over there around your place let me come over to yours then pplease dolly just for a few minutes and i wont ask you again until until its all over well well you werent you meant that about the police youre sure theyre not watching me youre not afraid to have me i said sure i was sure i wouldnt snow her about a thing like that you see its this way honey heres the rub my boss this character staples the guy you took the bail money to well he drops out a lot in the evening to talk about the work you know and if he saw you there it would blow things higher than a kite he was pretty suspicious about that dough anyway i wasnt supposed to have any see and youre sure not supposed to have any were not suppose to mean a thing to each other so if he found out she was nodding almost impatiently she understood about staples but that still didnt take me off the hook i could come later dolly anytime midnight he wouldnt be there that late well yeah sure i said but uh oh she said dully now wait a minute i said im trying to explain honey you see well its kind of hard to put into words but uh uh i understand she said i couldnt have her feeling that way it made me squirm and it just wasnt safe not now not at this stage of the game anyway when she was still so shaky that she could hardly cast a shadow why dont we do this i said suppose you come over around nine oclock and ill meet you outside ill say in case someones there ill say that i want to get some cigarettes and ill meet you down the block there from the wrecking yard on the corner there by the drug store well if youre sure you want to id love to ijust wanted to play it safe see thats all hell baby theres nothing ilike better than being with you i made her believe it i said id been worried about her being without dough and i started to reach back to my sample case and then i caught myself and took out my wallet i didnt want her to know had the loot with me the way shed been feeling just a little doubtful about me she might decide to ask for a cut i gave her five bucks of my own money we talked a little longer and then i drove her to the bus stop and let her out i didnt feel like working that day either but i put in a few hours just to pass the time i took in around twenty dollars padding it out with forty from the satchel the rest of the day ijust fooled around and at six i checked in staples was okay i mean he didnt give me the needle i was out of the store in ten minutes and on my way home the gravel cars had been pulled off the siding and three gondolas of coal were there tonight one of the cars was sticking half way out into the street and it was a close squeeze getting the car past it i finally made it and i parked and went into the house i called out to joyce her voice came back to me faintly from the bedroom i glanced into the dinette dinner was ready it was on the table but there was only one place setting mine i set down the sample case took off my hat and coat i hesitated and then i went back to the bedroom i paused in the doorway it didnt seem like i could go any further and stood looking in at her she was in bed with the covers pulled pretty well over her but i could see she had on her nightgown she was facing the wall her back to me and she didnt turn around yyou i cleared my throat you sick or something honey she didnt answer for a moment then she said her voice muffled i dont feel too well go and eat your dinner while its hot dolly well hell i said where are you sick anyway whats the matter eat your dinner she said pretty crisply we can talk afterward well okay i said maybe id better i didnt have much of an appetite for some reason but late late slow taking my time and i drank three cups of coffee afterwards and when i couldnt hold any more coffee i started smoking lighting one cigarette after another she called to me i called back yeah ill be there in a minute honey i finished my cigarette i got up and went down the hail toward the bedroom and i got there and i couldnt make myself go in i said bbe be with you in a minute baby and i went into the bathroom and closed the door i looked around in there and it was like id never seen the place before no nothing had been changed nothing had been done to it but something had happened to me everything seemed strange twisted out of shape i was lost in a strange world and there was nothing familiar to hang onto nothing no one no one i could talk to explain things to i sat down on the edge of the tub and lighted a cigarette i crushed it out in the sink without thinking and then i got up and crumbled the butt into shreds and washed the shreds down the drain i washed the sink out real good until there wasnt a spot or a stain left on it i sat down on the toilet and lighted another cigarette i stayed there in the bathroom it was a strange world but it was even stranger outside i could sit here and explain to myself and hell it was clear as daylight but i couldnt explain to her she called to me i yelled that id be out in a minute and i stayed where i was she called again i yelled again she came to the door finally and knocked and i yelied for christs sake whats the hurry anyway and she turned the knob and came in shed been crying so much and so long that she was cried out and now her face was drawn streaked with tears but her yes were clear and her voice was steady i want to know dolly i intend to know so dont try to lie to me where did you get that money through thick and thin the true story of a mans fight against high odds and low women by knarf nollid well dear reader in looking over my last installment i discovered that i have made a small error or two in fact this was no fault of mine because although i seldom complain you have doubtless discovered that lam one hard luck sonofabitch and people keep pouring it on me until i dont know my tail from a tbone so this was the case in this case there was so much happening at once that i got slightly balled up in my facts the truth is this the truth about this girl mona i was telling you about this old woman she was living with she wasnt actually her aunt at all she was a kidnapper see and shed kidnapped this poor girl from her wealthy parents while she was still no more than a tot so naturally she didnt remember anything about them and this one hundred thousand dollars was ransom money the old woman was afraid to spend it because well hell how do i know oh yeah she was afraid to spend it because at first she had to lay low until the heat was off and after a while everyone got to believing that she didnt have a dime to her name and she couldn t spend it it would have looked funny as hell know what i mean so that was the way it happened or something like that she couldnt bring herself to throw the dough away but she couldnt spend it either it was some sort of screwy deal like that and however it was it isnt really important the important thing is that the money really belonged to mona since her wealthy parents had been dead many years of broken hearts and since i had saved her from a fate worse than death it wasnt any more than right that she should kind of let me take care of it for her or maybe even keep it all because if she was actually a tramp like rumor said i sure as hell wasnt going to have her tagging around with me well i was going to explain these true events to my wife joyce when she returned unexpectedly and caught me with the dough but i just couldnt think fast enough iguess so i stalled and a day or so later i told her id found the money it sounded more logical than the truth and anyway i hadnt been able to figure out the truth yet hell how could i the way things were popping at me right and left this character staples was giving me a hard time mona was giving me a hard time worrying me about whether she was a tramp or not and getting scared and making me scared and joyce well i was glad shed come back because it looked like shed turned over a new leaf and all was about to be well between us but you can see how it was just one more goddamned thing to mix me up so i hadnt got around to tell her the truth yet there wasnt any real incentive to you know as long as she believed that id found the money then the day came when she gave the house a good cleaning and believe me it could stand it and when i get home that night all knocked out after a rugged day of toil she starts giving me a hard time she hardly lets me finish my dinner before she starts yapping at me wants me to come back in the bedroom and do some talking so i rush through my meal and step in the bedroom for a minute for gods sake whats the world coming to when a guy cant go to the bathroom but it seems like even this humble privilege is not to be mine i hardly have the door closed before shes calling to me and i know somethings plenty wrong see and all want is time enough to figure out a good story its for her own sake understand because if she decides im lying about the money it leaves her in a pretty bad spot shell want me to go to the police or shell go herself and i just cant allow that even though the money is rightfully mine the cops wont believe the truth any more than she does so so well you can see the situation im a pretty easygoing guy and never hurt anyone in my life if i could get out of it but if she tried to pin me down give me a hard time when i already had more than i could stand it would be just too bad for her so i stalled in the bathroom wondering what the hell shed found out and how the hell i could squirm out of it but she just wouldnt have it that way she wouldnt let me protect her she had to bust into the bathroom on me and ask where did i get the money i told her i said hell honey i already told you where i got it and she said you lied doily i must have known it right from the beginning but i wanted so much to believe that that where were you on monday night dolly monday night i said oh the night you came home why i was out collecting baby i caught up with some longtime skips and they paid off like they did not pay off because you werent collecting now wait just a minute i said i told you about it at the time told you exactly where id been you saw the money took in and i saw you take some money out of that little bag and put it in your wallet that was all you had dolly except for a dollar or two i could see that it was the next morning when you took the money id brought back from my trip i shrugged i gave her the cold eye hell what if hadnt told her the whole truth was that any reason for her to break into the bathroom and accuse me of lying and act like id committed a crime or something i will leave you to be the judge dear reader all i will say is that if you insist on putting yourself on a spot pushing a man who has already been pushed too far you have got to take the consequences how well did you know pete hendrickson dolly pete i said pete hendrickson never heard of him in my life he was killed monday night he and a woman named farrell yeah i said oh yeah seems like remember reading something about it you didnt know him personally know him i laughed why would i know a character like that you didnt know him im telling you i said then why was he in this house why did he sleep here i gave her a look like i thought she was crazy i wanted to protect her see and believe me i was doing everything i could why my god honey i said thats the screwiest thing i ever hear of what ever gave you the idea that this she said i cleaned house today and i found this down on the floor behind the bed she opened her hand and held it out a little blue and white card pete hendricksons social security card the stupid sloppy bastard had slept with his clothes on that one night and hed let this slip out of his pocket just to give me a hard time later sure and and what did it matter anyhow look at the way hed treated mona and besides that he was a nazi or a communist or why did you lie about it dolly why did you tell me you didnt know him well hell i said i know a lot of people i just didnt see that it made any difference were any of those other people here while i was away you think im running a hotel i said no there wasnt anyone else here and the only reason he was here was because i felt sorry for him and uh then he was with you monday night wasnt he monday evening before the murd bef ore it happened thered been someone with you i could tell it the minute i stepped into the house two people had been here drinking and smoking and if there wasnt anyone else baby i said youre making a lot out of nothing so what if he was here what if it works out that i wasnt collecting that night dont you i want to know she said thats what i want to know why you iied if it didnt matter dont you trust me i said dont you love me my god maybe i did get a little mixed up and forget a few things but she moved away from me shrugging my hands off her shoulders why doily and where where were you monday night and where did you get that money leave me alone i said goddammit leave me alone i didnt like to talk to her that way understand but why did she have to give me a hard time and all over nothing im waiting doily i already told you i said i mean maybe it wasnt the truth exactly but that doesnt mean i did anything wrong i am rnmy god you act like you thought id killed those two people beat the old woman to death and shot pete and where you going where do you think youre going oh dolly she said hhow what have you i tried to tell her then what had happened how things really were how they could have been and how did she know it wasnt true how did she know that the old woman wasnt a kidnapper and that this money didnt belong to monas wealthy parents who had died years ago of broken hearts and and she wouldnt even listen to me she was tugging at the doorknob staring at me with her eyes getting wider and wider like i was a goddamned maniac or something i made a grab for her just trying to make her listen to reason you know and for a moment i thought she was going to scream yeah call for help against her own husband but she didnt all she did was say nothing nothing i remember not anything important it was an accident of course hell you know me dear reader and you are aware that i wouldnt hurt a goddamned fly if i could get out of it i was just trying to grab her to hold onto her while i made her listen to reason but i grabbed pretty hard i guess sort of swung and an unkind fate decreed that the small understanding between us should end otherwise than happy to be continued she said nno dolly oh nno i had to come back i wanted to anyway but i had to i was going to tell you as soon as everything was settled everythings settled i said its damned good and settled don t know what you redoing you can t dolly nno please no im pregnant it was too late to stop anyway how could i have stopped even if it hadn t been too late i hooked her and she went down in the bathtub ibent over the tub and and when ifinally stripped off the nightgown and lifted her out she didnt look like joyce any more or anyone i carried her out the back door i tossed her body up on the top of one of the coal cars and climbed up after it i dugdown in the coal with my hands scoopingouta long shallow hole and i buried her in that buried them it was enough for one night it was too much for a million nights and i came back into the house feeling pretty good and relaxed you understand nothing else could happen now because everything had already happened the worst they couldnt throw anything more at me after this they couldnt ever give me a bad time again it was too much but now it was all over and they couldnt i came back into the house i washed and cleaned up thinking thinking just thinking but not worrying they couldnt identify her that train would be three days getting into kansas city and it stopped a half a dozen places between here and there they wouldnt know where it had happened when shed been put onto the coal car who she was all i had to do was get rid of her clothes when i cleared out of here and id be clearing out damned fast because too much had already happened and now nothing else could mona could stay here with me tonight why not the deal was on ice nothing to worry about and she was one swell kid and i needed someone to be with me ive always needed someone to be with me and tonight so shed stay here tonight and in the morning id quit the store pick an argument with staples and then tell him to go to hell and walk out and then mona and i would take off just the two of us and that good old hundred grand it would be okay there wasnt a hole in it any place not on my side or hers the county had ordered her to clear out of the house no one could make anything out of it if she got out a little ahead of time wed take off together joy mona and me and from then on from now on nothing more could happen i finished cleaning myself up and cleaning up the bathroom i went out into the living room and had a good stiff drink it seemed like it should have been awfully late but it was only a little after eightthirty almost twentyfive minutes before i was to meet mona before someone would be here with me i poured another stiff drink i drank it and i got to thinking it couldnt have happened so much so quickly and if it couldnt why it hadnt and maybe i ought to take her back a little drink since she wasnt feeling well and i poured it out for her and drank it there was a knock on the door i gave a little jump and then i went to answer it and no i didnt hesitate because there couldnt be anything more now nothing ever again and there was nothing to be afraid of i opened the door staples said good evening frank and i didnt answer i couldnt answer and he walked in past me well frank you dont appear at all pleased to see me arent you going to ask me to sit down i shook my head i said no what the hell do you want stape he sat down crossing his fat little legs what do i want frank weel lets say ill be quite happy with pot luck ill take whatever you have he couldnt mean what i thought he probably did he couldnt know anything and too much had already happened and i sagged down in a chair across from his it was the chair pete had sat in and he was in the place i had sat in when i was talking to pete i was in petes place and he was in mine i started shaking my head i didnt know what to say or do so i just shook my head yes he said oh yes frank yes indeed nono i wont i broke off made my voice steady what do you want what are you talking about anyway and he laughed softly oh frank youve been so clumsy so obvious such a thorough botch from the very beginning must we go into the tiresome details or cant you see it for yourself i dont know what youre talking about i said you hhear i dont well he sighed if we must we must ill begin at the beginning and spell it out very slowly item he held up a hand then folded one of the chubby little fingers back into his palm item one frank on the day before your arrest for stealing company funds you collected some thirtyeight dollars from the late pete hendrickson on the same day you made a cash sale or rather you turned in a cashsale contract in the amount of thirtythree dollars to one mona farrell in the morning then on these two accounts you should have checked in about seventyone dollars and frantic as you were to stave off arrest you certainly would have turned it in if you had had it but you didnt all you had was the money for the silverware you used petes money or most of it to buy the girl a present now wait a minute i said that doesnt mean you cant prove prove his lips pursed thoughtfully well perhaps not if we take it out of context which happily i am not forced to do at any rate and at the moment we are not discussing proof i am merely pointing out your initial error delving down to the center strand of that very ugly rope which you have hung around your neck you gave the girl a thirtythree dollar present and perhaps that is meaningless of itself one more manifestation of a distorted personality but it is not meaningless it is not my dear boy when this same girl arrives at the store and bails you out to the tune of more than three hundred dollars or are you going to tell me that it wasnt the same girl there was no use in denying it i knew now whod been watching her whod turned the car lights on her all right i said so know her i like her and she likes me what of it my wife skipped out and please he held up his hand again im not at all interested in your morals nor in you personally for that matter only in the money you obtained from what must be the two clumsiest murders on record he waited waiting for me to deny it and it wasnt any use of course but i did money i said murders i dont know what youre money murders he nodded and please frank youre trying my patience i dont know how you got next to the girl or how you managed to frame pete but i know that you did the girl tipped you off to the fact that the old woman had a substantial sum of money you skipping over the gory details you got it and you still have it except for those amounts which you checked in as collections now wait a which you checked in as collections he said firmly would you like me to show it to you ive laid it aside just in case you became stubborn approximately a dozen bills supposedly collected from an assorted group of people but with their serial numbers in sequence you got it frank and you got a very substantial sum nothing less would have tempted you to take such a terrible risk and ma farraday was just the woman to have had a hefty chunk of cash but ma farraday i said mmmm do you recall my telling you that id been to visit an old friend that was ma better known locally as mrs farrell i went to see her in the morgue after my suspicions about you became aroused once i recognized her i was certain that but i see you dont recognize the name he waited again one eyebrow cocked upward then he grinned and went on a little before your time i imagine but the farraday gang was notorious in the southwest some twenty to twentyfive years ago bank robbers ma and her three sons ma doing the planning and the three men faithfully carrying out her orders three of the orneriest coldestblooded killers ever to shoot a teller in the back and their wives and children they all lived together near the town where i worked their wives and children were just as ornery as they were why yes frank nnothing i said i mean i thought i know i was confident that your interest in the oil business and my early days in oklahoma was something more than casual but no there was no oil on the farraday property they lived too far back in the hills for that matter i doubt that even had they owned oilproducing land it would have altered their way of life a whit they were cruel vicious because they wanted to be it was all they understood men women and children being a very clannish lot with little trust in the law their neighbors protected and put up with them for years in the end however they finally became so outraged that they moved in and massacred the lot of them shot them like the swine they were then burned their dwellings wiped out the entire family supposedly mona she was part of an outfit like that no wonder shed been so ready to kill her own aunt her grandmother probably no wonder that she acted like i said supposedly frank criminal investigation was just emerging from swaddling clothes in those days and of course neither ma nor the various children had police records a number of bodies were found in the smoldering ruins also the charred remnants of a quantity of currency ergo and in the absence of proof to the contrary it was assumed believed i should say that the entire family was wiped out and with them their illgotten gains but you and i know better dont we frank we are the only ones who do know he winked at me grinning with his puffy little lips drawn back from his teeth like a cat thats just had a good meal he licked his lips slightly grinning and waiting and my stomach turned over and over and the band grew tighter and tighter around my head i began to tremble my mouth opened and i felt a scream crawling up from my throat and i had to swallow hard to choke it back nno i said youve got it all wrong stape i dear dear he said oh dear me you are such a tiresome fellow frank im telling you its the gods truth stape the girl was kidnapped see she was actually the daughter of a very wealthy family and the money was ransom money and and he laughed out loud and you were going to act as custodian of it eh oh my dear boy im almost embarrassed for you its true goddammit it had to be true something had to be true besides what what was true thats why the old woman didnt spend any of the money see she found out it was marked and but it wasnt marked frank i know it you must know it also unless youre a much bigger fool than you appear welluhwell then she found out she figured out that the serial numbers had been recorded and oh then why since it was unspendable did she keep it all these years he was playing with me laughing at me having a hell of a time for himself yes frank and why if the authorities are on the lookout for those serials why arent you in custody well i had to go on i was talking crap making a horses ass of myself but i had to go on well theres bound to be something wrong with it if there wasnt why didnt she spend it why did she go on living like a goddamned hog when because she was one a grasping old sow you dont know i said you dont know that the money isnt hot she could have found out that then why as i asked a moment ago didnt she destroy it well uh well because she couldnt jesus youve got a hun a pretty good wad of dough how can you destroy it i couldnt she couldnt so she just hung onto it figuring that maybe some day somehow she might be able to shove it oh frank you dont know i said goddammit you cant be sure stape i not only can be but i am you see i had some several dealings with the farradays at this store i managed delivered merchandise to their mountain retreat at considerably above the market prices there was nothing criminal about our association nothing provably illegal i should say but the company became embarrassed to the point of transferring me to another town however enough of personal history my point is that the farradays were strictly bank robbers but they might have pulled one kid stop it no more nonsense frank how much did you get and where is it i looked down at the floor i looked up again keeping my eyes away from the corner where the sample case was she didnt have as much as i thought just ten thousand dollars i can well i got it out in the country see but i can bring it in the morning ten thousand you mean a hundred thousand im sure you almost said it a moment ago all right i said so goddammit theres a hundred thousand come on with me and well go and get it he hesitated then he nodded smiling faintly very well frank but perhaps i should tell you something first i left a letter with the night clerk at my hotel a very reliable man incidentally hes instructed to mail it if i fail to return by midnight his smile spread and he laughed out loud again i thought it can t be like this and i guess i must have said it but it is frank it is like that and now you will produce the money immediately i got up i brought the case over to the coffee table and snapped it open i started to reach in for the satchel digging it out from under the samples and he brushed my hands away and grabbed it himself he opened it he made a funny purring sound mmmm wonderful i hope you wont think im greedy if i dont offer to share with you youve got to i said i kept saying it you got to stape a a few grand well one grand something anything i ki i did it all and so sorry he shook his head but ill be happy to give you a word of wisdom you have no problems which money will solve you sonofabitch i said you really dont frank youd be just as miserable with the money as without it well much as i hate to leave such pleasant company he buttoned his coat and stood up he tucked the money satchel under his arm i want that silverware contract back i said by god youll never be able to hold that over me the sil oh yes to be sure and very shrewd of you you can pick it up in the morning get your wages to date at the same time my wages i said well no more questions youre not wondering why i delayed calling you to account until tonight get out i said the girl dear boy the clinching bit of proof i didnt really need it but get out of course but shouldnt you invite her in frank shes just around the corner and you do look so lonesome lonesome he said the man said i looked lonesome and i had all kinds of company all kinds all dead all jumping up in front of me wherever i looked all laughing and crying and singing in my mind all dead and all for nothing all for a dame that had been born rotten and got more rotten every damned day of her life i met her and brought her back to the house i told her about staples and losing the money i laid it out cold for her kind of hoping you know that shed bitch or give me a hard time about it but she didnt let out a peep she was sympathetic sorry on my account but she acted like it didnt matter to her as long as she could be with me that was all that mattered i began to think that maybe i might be mistaken about her to feel that she was the swell kid id thought she was in the beginning it was pretty hard to swallow and of course i couldnt sell myself completely but i did it enough enough to keep from slugging her enough to put up with her for the time being she was all i had you see all id got for all id done and i had to have someone with me id almost always had someone with me i went out and got some more whiskey it took just about my last nickel i came back and we talked and drank and after a while she talked and i drank and pretty soon there was no more talk and only me drinking she fell asleep with her head in my lap i passed out when morning came we were still there on the lounge i fixed us some coffee and toast i didnt want her slopping around with my grub i told her to beat it back to her house and gather up anything she wanted to take with her she left hurrying and i went back into the bedroom i stuffed all of joyces things into a big pasteboard carton clothes cosmetics and toilet articles everything i carried the box out into the alley and set it down by the trash can then i drove down to the store the other collectors had checked out and staples was alone he gave me the silverware contract and i struck a match to it dropping it to the floor and kicking the ashes to pieces such a messy fellow he pouted but i suppose i shouldnt chide you your money frank im making it a full fifty dollars i picked up the money not saying anything i gave him a slow hard stare and then i turned around and started to leave frank there was a worried note in his voice what uh what are your plans frank whats that to you i said but ive always been concerned for you dear boy always and its dawned on me that since youll doubtless want to be moving on i began to get it he was worried he wasnt just another hired hand that could pull out without a moments notice the books would have to be audited and the stock inventoried before he could leave and that would take two or three weeks at the inside and he didnt like the idea of me being in town during that time i might get desperate see might get drunk and jam myself up with the police and do a little talking i dont know i said why would i want to travel i figure ill stay right here he gave me a peeved look but he opened the cash drawer he took out all the currency inside counted it and shoved it through the wicket four hundred and fortyseven dollars frank almost five hundred with the fifty you have that should see you well on your way i like it here i said im not going anywhere now frank not unless you do a lot better than that i said hell make it a grand anyway with all youve got but i dont have it with me its put away in a safe place and its going to remain there until my resignation takes effect well well i said write me a check then give me your check for five hundred oh he shook his head grinning must you really be so obvious no checks i couldnt oblige you even if i was stupid it will take just about my entire bank balance to square with the cash drawer i was sure he was lying but there wasnt much i could do about it he was just a little worried not actually scared and id played that worry for all it was worth i picked up the money and left i owed two hundred and thirty on the car i paid it off i couldnt have a goddamned finance company on my tail and went back to the house mona was there waiting for me i got my stuff together and loaded all our baggage into the car there was quite a bit of it since i figured id better take joyces it wasnt monogramed and it was pretty good stuff and it might look funny if i left it behind id always made out pretty well in omaha as well i mean as ive made out anywhere so thats where i headed for and we got there just after dark we stopped at a diner for a bite to eat the waitress brought me a newspaper i glanced at it and that was our last stop in omaha i started driving again and idrove almost night and day to des moines down across to grand island across to denver i sold the car in denver a lousy three hundred and twentyfive bucks and we started traveling by bus yeah i suppose she wondered what the score was or maybe she didnt either she hadnt been around enough to know when something was screwy and when it wasnt so maybe she didnt wonder anyway she didnt ask any questions try to give me a hard time and it was a damned good thing for her that she didnt id had it brother know what i mean and it looked like i was going to keep right on getting it because staples had given the cops a bum steer tole em i had a seamans ticket and probably intended to ship out but that didnt help much nothing helped much the crew haircut the hornrimmed glasses the mustache i was still scared as hell afraid to settle down in one place it was lousy the lousiest stinking luck a guy ever had in his life it goddammit it just wasnt fair i ask you now did you ever hear of coal being moved by anything but regular freight youre damned right you didnt and neither did anyone else but that one car that one car they had to make an exception out of it it got hooked onto a manifest an express freight and it didnt stop until it got into kansas city it was in there at noon the next day and they started unloading it right away they couldnt wait goddamn them and inside of an hour the police doctor was posting the body well that soon it was easy to fix the time of death and they knew the body couldnt have been put on the train but one place so they wired the cops at that place and the cops started sniffing around and they found that box of stuff back in the alley by the trash can i had to keep moving my money was running out and i had to keep moving and if i hadnt been saddled with her chained to a goddamned tramp well well she finally started in on me i didnt have it tough enough i guess so she had to make it tougher watching me all the time like i was a goddamned freak or something not saying anything unless i spoke to her you know a lot of little things wearing me down little by little and stupid the only thing she could do was bawl and she never missed a chance at that i was walking a little ahead of her that day in dallas id told her for gods sake if she wanted to look and act like a goddamned tramp she could walk by herself so i was ahead of her like i say and finally i looked around and she wasnt there any more hardly anyone was on the sidewalk any more they were all out on the street about a half block back crowded around the front of a big truck upward and onward the true story of a mans fight against high odds and low women by den senoj i was born in new york city of poor but honest parents and from my earliest recollections i was out working and trying to make something of myself but from my earliest recollections someone was always trying to give me a hard time it was that way with everything i did one way or another id get the blocks put to me so i will mercifully spare you the sordid details i kept thinking that if i had some little helpmeet to dwell with the unequal struggle would not be so unequal but i didnt have any more luck that way than i did in the other tramps thats all i got five goddamned tramps in a row or maybe it was six or seven but it doesnt matter it was like they were all the same person well finally i landed in oklahoma city and it looks like at last my luck has changed not with money i was buying the gold door to door and how can you make any money when everybody cheats you but it looked like it had sure changed with women it not only looked that way but it was that way and as far as the money went she had enough for forty people i met her when i was working this swell apartment house there in the city i sneaked in past the doorman and hers was the first apartment i hit classy beautiful well all i can say is that id never seen anything like her i could hardly believe it when she smiled and asked me inside i was ashamed to hit her up on the gold i said i was looking for a party that used to live there and so on and i was sure sorry to have bothered her and now now she laughed but she didnt laugh at me understand it was nice and sympathetic dont apologize for your job of course i am a little disturbed to see a gentleman of your personality and evident ability doing this kind of well i said its just temporary see igot a little down on my luck and i had to take what i could get how dreadful you sit right down and ill fix you a nice drink i sat down on about two thousand dollars worth of lounge she brought our drinks and sat down next to me she smiled at me and kept the conversation going because naturally i was pretty speechless i finished my drink and started to get up she put her hand on my arm please she said please dont go ive been so lonely since my husband died i said i was certainly sorry to hear of her husbands death her eyes clouded up a little for a moment and then she shook her head its lonely without him and nnaturally i didnt want him to die bbut but oh its a terrible thing to say but i think id actually begun to hate him he misrepresented himself he pretended to be everything i wanted and then after we were married i know what you mean i said i know exactly what you mean ba uh say it she whispered and she turned and threw her arms around me say im your baby say it say anything to me do anything to you like but jjust dont go away and it was like a beautiful dream dear reader but im talk about dreams kidding you negative that was exactly how i came to meet the lovely helene my princess charming thus at last were two lovehungry souls united you will notice that i havent described her but i cant because she looked so many different ways when she went out where anyone else could see her she always looked the same way the way she looked that first day i met her but when we were alone well if i hadnt known it was her sometimes i wouldnt have known it was her a goddamned syphilitic bag the same woman she had dozens of different complete outfits clothes that a girl of eighteen would wear or a woman of twentyfive or thirtyfive and so on all complete from house dresses to evening gowns and she had all of these different kinds of makeup powder and lipstick and rouge dozens of different shades hairpieces and eyelashes and brows and teethcaps even little glass things to slip in over her eyes and change their color it was kind of a hobby with her see making herself up in all those different ways and right at the start it made me a little uneasy igot to wondering what was real and what wasnt and maybe if i saw her as she really one more bag like all the rest was i wouldnt be able to take it but that was just at first you see it could be no other way dear reader i mean she had to be a bag in a fleabag for christs sake and i couldnt go any beautiful and classy and all that a man desires in a woman all the royal rooking id got from tramps i couldnt take any more and after the long unequal struggle i had at least found my hearts desire shed inherited a pile of dough from her father but thats stole her brotherinlaws savings about all i ever found out about her or him i never even learned his name her maiden name she acted embarrassed when i mentioned anything about her background so i didnt do it more than a time or two i figured that the old man had probably made his pile selling clap medicine or something like that and naturally she was embarrassed and it was best to stay off the subject after all although i had always worked my can off and never complained there were a few chapters in my own life which i preferred to remain sealed her money was in a bank in another city just where i hidden in the mattress dont know but she was so embarrassed about her maiden name that she never cashed any checks there in town or let the bank send her any dough whenever she ran short shed just hop a plane to this city and draw out what she wanted and be back the same night shed gone after some dough the morning this story broke in the newspapers a story about some people i used to know and i wow the wine and the hay yeeoweeeee laughed so goddamned hard when i read it that i almost busted a rib i read it and reread it all day long and each time i laughed safe now safe with a bag in a fleabag harder than ever the yearold stirling kidnap case appeared to be solved today with the arrest of an exstore manager and admitted associate of the notorious farraday gang the suspect is hj staples more than of the ransom money was recovered from his swank sarasota fla hotel suite staples first came under scrutiny of the authorities about four months ago when several hundred dollars in kidnap currency was deposited to the account of a store he then managed believing that the deposit was made as a feeler law officials refrained from arresting him until he put large and thoroughly incriminating sums into circulation ramona stirling was the only child of multimillionaire oilman arthur stirling and his semiinvalid wife three years old at the time ramona was snatched from the grounds of the familys luxurious tulsa estate after her nurse had been lured into the house by a fake telephone call the ransom of was demanded and promptly paid but an inexperienced newscaster revealed that the serial numbers of the currency had been recorded with the divulging of this information the stirlings lost all contact with the kidnapers and it is generally conceded that the child was murdered mrs stirling died less than six weeks after the kidnaping her husband went to his grave the following month in the absence of heirs the great stirling fortune was claimed by the state the suspect staples quit his job some three months ago and began traveling about the country making various small expenditures along the way at last convinced apparently that time had cooled off the hot money he arrived in florida yesterday and began to splurge his arrest followed grilled by state federal and local officials he told a wildly implausible story of how he came into possession of the money full details are not yet available but it is known that his tale involved ma farraday and frank dillon a former associate of staples who had been sought for several months in connection with the death of his wife and their unborn child officials place no credence whatsoever in the suspects explanations that staples was once on excellent terms with the gangsters is acknowledged it is pointed out however that the entire farraday family was wiped out more than two decades ago and that this being the case staples statement that dillon killed ma for the ransom money is nothing short of ridiculous moreover it was pointed out the farradays were bank robbers they were never known to have indulged in any other criminal activity and it is virtually unbelievable that they would have as for dillon authorities now believe that he was himself a murder victim and he is no longer being sought as a fugitive they theorized that he and mrs dillon somehow learned that staples had the ransom cash and that the latter killed both dillons body it was explained could have been buried in a coal car which was destined for a conveyorfed blast furnace i laughed and laughed when i read that story i felt safe from what not the thing i needed to be safe from good all day and then evening came on and i didnt laugh and it was just like always only worse the worst tramp any more and i didnt feel good anymore because it was of all the worst fleabag of all and couldnt take it quite a tragedy when you got to thinking about it and i the end had to be better than this so we drank the wine guess you know dear reader im a pretty softhearted son we smoked the hay we started sniffing the snow they ofabitch yes it was a terrible tragedy and whoever was say you cant do it guzzle the juice and puff the mary responsible for it ought to be jailed making a guy want and snjff the c but we did we did that and then we went what he couldnt get making him so he couldnt get much on the h we started riding the main line we got sick as but hed want a lot laying it all out for him every place bastards but we kept right on and after a while man oh man he turned the swell cars and clothes and places to live we didnt know from

anyone elsehelene came home we kept digging into the mattress and the porter kept my fairy princess and she saw i was feeling low so she fixed bringing in the stuff helene started vomiting a lot but me a big drink and right after that i began to get drowsy it didnt seem to bother her and it didnt bother me any i knew everything that was going on i could hear and talk even the puke was beautiful like everything else she was the i was really wide awake but still i was sleepy and if most beautiful woman in the world and all i wanted was to do that doesnt make sense i cant help it i went and

shears in her hand and she sat i guess lever gave a woman it was all had alld ever had snipping the ends of her hair staring down at me and i to give and was afraid she might not want it but had to looked at her my eyes dropping shut and she made herself make the offer she was all the women of the world rolled look like joyce and then like mona and then all the others into one so it was the very least could do andd have to do she said id disappointed her id turned out like all her it fast she was in the bat hroom puking i got up and shoved other men you deceived me she said youre no different
