bunkerhill battle as she saw it from the belfry t is like stirring living embers when at eighty one remembers all the achings and the quakings of the times that tried mens souls when i talk of whig and tory when i tell the rebel story to you the words are ashes but to me theyre burning coals i had heard the muskets rattle of the april running battle lord percys hunted soldiers i can see their redcoats still but a deadly chill comes oer me as the day looms up before me when a thousand men lay bleeding on the slopes of bunkers hill t was a peaceful summers morning when the first thing gave us warning was the booming of the cannon from the river and the shore child says grandma what s the matter what is all this noise and clatter have those scalping indian devils come to murder us once more poor old soul my sides were shaking in the midst of all my quaking to hear her talk of indians when the guns began to roar she had seen the burning village and the slaughter and the pillage when the mohawks killed her father with their bullets through his door then i said now dear old granny dont you fret and worry any for ill soon come back and tell you whether this is work or play there cant be mischief in it so i wont be gone a minute for a minute then i started i was gone the livelong day no time for bodicelacing or for lookingglass grimacing down my hair went as i hurried tumbling halfway to my heels god forbid your ever knowing when theres blood around her flowing how the lonely helpless daughter of a quiet household feels in the street i heard a thumping and i knew it was the stumping of the corporal our old neighbor on that wooden leg he wore with a knot of women round him it was lucky i had found him so i followed with the others and the corporal marched before they were making for the steeple the old soldier and his people the pigeons circled round us as we climbed the creaking stair just across the narrow river oh so close it made me shiver stood a fortress on the hilltop that but yesterday was bare not slow our eyes to find it well we knew who stood behind it though the earthwork hid them from us and the stubborn walls were dumb here were sister wife and mother looking wild upon each other and their lips were white with terror as they said the hour has come the morning slowly wasted not a morsel had we tasted and our heads were almost splitting with the cannons deafening thrill when a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode sedately it was prescott one since told me he commanded on the hill every womans heart grew bigger when we saw his manly figure with the banyan buckled round it standing up so straight and tall like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for pleasure through the storm of shells and cannonshot he walked around the wall at eleven the streets were swarming for the redcoats ranks were forming at noon in marching order they were moving to the piers how the bayonets gleamed and glistened as we looked far down and listened to the trampling and the drumbeat of the belted grenadiers at length the men have started with a cheer it seemed fainthearted in their scarlet regimentals with their knapsacks on their backs and the reddening rippling water as after a seafights slaughter round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood along their tracks so they crossed to the other border and again they formed in order and the boats came back for soldiers came for soldiers soldiers still the time seemed everlasting to us women faint and fasting at last theyre moving marching marching proudly up the hill we can see the bright steel glancing all along the lines advancing now the front rank fires a volley they have thrown away their shot for behind their earthwork lying all the balls above them flying our people need not hurry so they wait and answer not then the corporal our old cripple he would swear sometimes and tipple he had heard the bullets whistle in the old french war before calls out in words of jeering just as if they all were hearing and his wooden leg thumps fiercely on the dusty belfry floor oh fire away ye villains and earn king georges shillins but ye ll waste a ton of powder afore a rebel falls you may bang the dirt and welcome theyre as safe as danl malcolm ten foot beneath the gravestone that youve splintered with your balls in the hush of expectation in the awe and trepidation of the dread approaching moment we are wellnigh breathless all though the rotten bars are failing on the rickety belfry railing we are crowding up against them like the waves against a wall just a glimpse the air is clearer they are nearer nearer nearer when a flash a curling smokewreath then a crash the steeple shakes the deadly truce is ended the tempests shroud is rended like a morning mist it gathered like a thundercloud it breaks oh the sight our eyes discover as the blueblack smoke blows over the redcoats stretched in windrows as a mower rakes his hay here a scarlet heap is lying there a headlong crowd is flying like a billow that has broken and is shivered into spray then we cried the troops are routed they are beat it cant be doubted god be thanked the fight is over ah the grim old soldiers smile tell us tell us why you look so we could hardly speak we shook so are they beaten are they beaten are they beaten wait a while oh the trembling and the terror for too soon we saw our error they are baffled not defeated we have driven them back in vain and the columns that were scattered round the colors that were tattered toward the sullen silent fortress turn their belted breasts again all at once as we are gazing lo the roofs of charlestown blazing they have fired the harmless village in an hour it will be down the lord in heaven confound them rain his fire and brimstone round them the robbing murdering redcoats that would burn a peaceful town they are marching stern and solemn we can see each massive column as they near the naked earthmound with the slanting walls so steep have our soldiers got fainthearted and in noiseless haste departed are they panicstruck and helpless are they palsied or asleep now the walls theyre almost under scarce a rod the foes asunder not a firelock flashed against them up the earthwork they will swarm but the words have scarce been spoken when the ominous calm is broken and a bellowing crash has emptied all the vengeance of the storm so again with murderous slaughter pelted backwards to the water fly pigots running heroes and the frightened braves of howe and we shout at last theyre done for its their barges they have run for they are beaten beaten beaten and the battle s over now and we looked poor timid creatures on the rough old soldiers features our lips afraid to question but he knew what we would ask not sure he said keep quiet once more i guess they ll try it heres damnation to the cutthroats then he handed me his flask saying gal youre looking shaky have a drop of old jamaiky i m afeard there ll be more trouble afore the job is done so i took one scorching swallow dreadful faint i felt and hollow standing there from early morning when the firing was begun all through those hours of trial i had watched a calm clock dial as the hands kept creeping creeping they were creeping round to four when the old man said theyre forming with their bagonets fixed for storming it s the deathgrip thats a coming they will try the works once more with brazen trumpets blaring the flames behind them glaring the deadly wall before them in close array they come still onward upward toiling like a dragons fold uncoiling like the rattlesnakes shrill warning the reverberating drum over heaps all torn and gory shall i tell the fearful story how they surged above the breastwork as a sea breaks over a deck how driven yet scarce defeated our wornout men retreated with their powderhorns all emptied like the swimmers from a wreck it has all been told and painted as for me they say i fainted and the woodenlegged old corporal stumped with me down the stair when i woke from dreams affrighted the evening lamps were lighted on the floor a youth was lying his bleeding breast was bare and i heard through all the flurry send for warren hurry hurry tell him heres a soldier bleeding and he ll come and dress his wound ah we knew not till the morrow told its tale of death and sorrow how the starlight found him stiffened on the dark and bloody ground who the youth was what his name was where the place from which he came was who had brought him from the battle and had left him at our door he could not speak to tell us but t was one of our brave fellows as the homespun plainly showed us which the dying soldier wore for they all thought he was dying as they gathered round him crying and they said oh how theyll miss him and what will his mother do then his eyelids just unclosing like a childs that has been dozing he faintly murmured mother and i saw his eyes were blue why grandma how you re winking ah my child it sets me thinking of a story not like this one well he somehow lived along so we came to know each other and i nursed him like a mother till at last he stood before me tall and rosychecked and strong and we sometimes walked together in the pleasant summer weather please to tell us what his name was just your own my little dear theres his picture copley painted we became so well acquainted that in short thats why i m grandma and you children all are here at the atlantic dinner december i suppose its myself that youre making allusion to and bringing the sense of dismay and confusion to of course some must speak they are always selected to but pray whats the reason that i am expected to im not fond of wasting my breath as those fellows do that want to be blowing forever as bellows do their legs are uneasy but why will you jog any that long to stay quiet beneath the mahogany why why call me up with your battery of flatteries you say he writes poetry that s what the matter is it costs him no trouble a pen full of ink or two and the poem is done in the time of a wink or two as for thoughts never mind take the ones that lie uppermost and the rhymes used by milton and byron and tupper most the lines come so easy at one end he jingles em at the other with capital letters he shingles em why the thing writes itself and before hes half done with it he hates to stop writing he has such good fun with it ah that is the way in which simple ones go about and draw a fine picture of things they dont know about we all know a kitten but come to a catamount the beast is a stranger when grown up to that amount a stranger we rather prefer should nt visit us a felis whose advent is far from felicitous the boy who can boast that his trap has just got a mouse must nt draw it and write underneath hippopotamus or say unveraciously this is an elephant dont think let me beg these examples irrelevant what they mean is just this that a thing to be painted well should always be something with which were acquainted well you call on your victim for things he has plenty of those copies of verses no doubt at least twenty of his desk is crammed full for he always keeps writing em and reading to friends as his way of delighting em i tell you this writing of verses means business it makes the brain whirl in a vortex of dizziness you think they are scrawled in the languor of laziness i tell you theyre squeezed by a spasm of craziness a fit half as bad as the staggering vertigos that seize a poor fellow and down in the dirt he goes and therefore it chimes with the words etytology that the sons of apollo are great on apology for the writing of verse is a struggle mysterious and the gayest of rhymes is a matter thats serious for myself im relied on by friends in extremities and i dont mind so much if a comfort to them it is t is a pleasure to please and the straw that can tickle us is a source of enjoyment though slightly ridiculous i am up for a something and since i ve begun with it i must give you a toast now before i have done with it let me pump at my wits as they pumped the cochituate that moistened it may be the very last bit you ate success to our publishers authors and editors to our debtors good luck pleasant dreams to our creditors may the monthly grow yearly till all we are groping for has reached the fulfilment were all of us hoping for till the bore through the tunnel it makes me let off a sigh to think it may possibly ruin my prophecy has been punned on so often t will never provoke again one mild adolescent to make the old joke again till abstinent allgotomeeting society has forgotten the sense of the word inebriety till the work that poor hannah and bridget and phillis do the humanized civilized female gorillas do till the roughs as we call them grown loving and dutiful shall worship the true and the pure and the beautiful and preying no longer as tiger and vulture do all read the atlantic as persons of culture do lucy for her golden wedding october lucy the old familiar name is now as always pleasant its liquid melody the same alike in past or present let others call you what they will i know youll let me use it to me your name is lucy still i cannot bear to lose it what visions of the past return with lucys image blended what memories from the silent urn of gentle lives long ended what dreams of childhoods fleeting morn what starry aspirations that filled the misty days unborn with fancys coruscations ah lucy life has swiftly sped from april to november the summer blossoms all are shed that you and i remember but while the vanished years we share with mingling recollections how all their shadowy features wear the hue of old affections love called you he who stole your heart of sunshine half bereft us our households garland fell apart the morning that you left us the tears of tender girlhood streamed through sorrows opening sluices less sweet our gardens roses seemed less blue its flowerdeluces that old regret is turned to smiles that parting sigh to greeting i send my heartthrob fifty miles through every line t is beating god grant you many and happy years till when the last has crowned you the dawn of endless day appears and heaven is shining round you october hymn for the inauguration of the statue of governor andrew hingham october behold the shape our eyes have known it lives once more in changeless stone so looked in mortal face and form our guide through perils deadly storm but hushed the beating heart we knew that heart so tender brave and true firm as the rooted mountain rock pure as the quarrys whitest block not his beneath the bloodred star to win the soldiers envied sear unarmed he battled for the right in dutys neverending fight unconquered will unslumbering eye faith such as bids the martyr die the prophets glance the masters hand to mould the work his foresight planned these were his gifts what heaven had lent for justice mercy truth he spent first to avenge the traitorous blow and first to lift the vanquished foe lo thus he stood in dangers strait the pilot of the pilgrim state too large his fame for her alone a nation claims him as her own a memorial tribute read at the meeting held at music hall february in memory of dr samuel g howe i leader of armies israels god thy soldiers fight is won master whose lowly path he trod thy servants work is done no voice is heard from sinais steep our wandering feet to guide from horebs rock no waters leap no jordans waves divide no prophet cleaves our western sky

raiment drest we see no halo round his brow till love its own recalls and like a leaf that quits the bough the mortal vesture falls in autumns chill declining day ere winters killing frost the message came so passed away the friend our earth has lost still father in thy love we trust forgive us if we mourn the saddening hour that laid in dust his robe of flesh outworn ii how long the wreckstrewn journey seems to reach the faroff past that woke his youth from peaceful dreams with freedoms trumpetblast along her classic hillsides rung the paynims battlecry and like a redcross knight he sprung for her to live or die no trustier service claimed the wreath for spartas bravest son no truer soldier sleeps beneath the mound of marathon yet not for him the warriors grave in front of angry foes to lift to shield to help to save the holier task he chose he touched the eyelids of the blind and lo the veil withdrawn as oer the midnight of the mind he led the light of dawn he asked not whence the fountains roll no travellers foot has found but mapped the desert of the soul untracked by sight or sound what prayers have reached the sapphire throne by silent fingers spelt for him who first through depths unknown his doubtful pathway felt who sought the slumbering sense that lay close shut with bolt and bar and showed awakening thought the ray of reasons morning star whereer he moved his shadowy form the sightless orbs would seek and smiles of welcome light and warm the lips that could not speak no labored line no sculptors art such hallowed memory needs his tablet is the human heart his record loving deeds iii the rest that earth denied is thine ah is it rest we ask or traced by knowledge more divine some larger nobler task had but those boundless fields of blue one darkened sphere like this but what has heaven for thee to do in realms of perfect bliss no cloud to lift no mind to clear no rugged path to smooth no struggling soul to help and cheer no mortal grief to soothe

your casket may hold ill show you that rhymings as easy as lying if youll listen to me while the art i unfold heres a book full of words one can choose as he fancies as a painter his tint as a workman his tool just think all the poems and plays and romances were drawn out of this like the fish from a pool you can wander at will through its syllabled mazes and take all you want not a copper they cost what is there to hinder your picking out phrases for an epic as clever as paradise lost dont mind if the index of sense is at zero use words that run smoothly whatever they mean leander and lilian and lillibullero are much the same thing in the rhyming machine there are words so delicious their sweetness will smother that boardingschool flavor of which we re afraid there is lush is a good one and swirl another put both in one stanza its fortune is made with musical murmurs and rhythmical closes you can cheat us of smiles when youve nothing to tell you hand us a nosegay of milliners roses and we cry with delight oh how sweet they do smell perhaps you will answer all needful conditions for winning the laurels to which you aspire by docking the tails of the two prepositions i the style o the bards you so greatly admire as for subjects of verse they are only too plenty for ringing the changes on metrical chimes a maiden a moonbeam a lover of twenty have filled that great basket with bushels of rhymes let me show you a picture tis far from irrelevant by a famous old hand in the arts of design t is only a photographed sketch of an elephant the name of the draughtsman was rembrandt of rhine how easy no troublesome colors to lay on it cant have fatigued him no not in the least a dash here and there with a haphazard crayon and there stands the wrinkledskinned baggylimbed beast just so with your verse t is as easy as sketching you can reel off a song without knitting your brow as lightly as rembrandt a drawing or etching it is nothing at all if you only know how well imagine youve printed your volume of verses your forehead is wreathed with the garland of fame your poems the eloquent schoolboy rehearses her album the schoolgirl presents for your name each morning the post brings you autograph letters youll answer them promptly an hour is nt much for the honor of sharing a page with your betters with magistrates members of congress and such of course youre delighted to serve the committees that come with requests from the country all round you would grace the occasion with poems and ditties when theyve got a new schoolhouse or poorhouse or pound with a hymn for the saints and a song for the sinners you go and are welcome wherever you please youre a privileged guest at all manner of dinners youve a seat on the platform among the grandees at length your mere presence becomes a sensation your cup of enjoyment is filled to its brim with the pleasure horatian of digitmonstration as the whisper runs round of thats he or that

your own with its puny compulsion can summon the spirit that quickens the lyre it comes if at all like the sibyls convulsion and touches the brain with a finger of fire so perhaps after all its as well to be quiet if youve nothing you think is worth saying in prose as to furnish a meal of their cannibal diet to the critics by publishing as you propose but its all of no use and i m sorry ive written i shall see your thin volume some day on my shelf for the rhyming tarantula surely has bitten and music must cure you so pipe it yourself unsatisfied only a housemaid she looked from the

to swear he drops his whip he drops his rein he clutches fiercely for a mane hell lose his hold he sways and reels hell slide beneath those trampling heels the knees of many a horseman quake the flowers on many a bonnet shake and shouts arise from left and right stick on stick on hould tight hould tight cling round his neck and dont let go that pace cant hold there steady whoa but like the

one took the quiver from her back one held the cap he spent the night in and one a bit of bricabrac such as the gods themselves delight in then mars the foe of human kind strode up and showed his suit of armor so none at last was left behind save venus the celestial charmer poor venus what had she to sell for all she looked so fresh and jaunty her wardrobe as i blush to tell already seemed but quite too scanty her gems were sold her sandals gone she always would be rash and flighty her winter garments all in pawn alas for charming aphrodite the lady of a thousand loves the darling of the old religion had only left of all the doves that drew her car one fantailed pigeon how oft upon her fingertips he perched afraid of cupids arrow or kissed her on the rosebud lips like roman lesbias loving sparrow my bird i want your train she cried come dont lets have a fuss about it ill make it beautys pet and pride and youll be better off without it so vulgar have you noticed pray an earthly belle or dashing bride walk and how her flounces track her way like slimy serpents on the sidewalk a lovers heart it quickly cools in mine it kindles up enough rage to wring their necks how can such fools ask men to vote for woman suffrage the goddess spoke and gently stripped her bird of every caudal feather a strand of goldbright hair she clipped and bound the glossy plumes together and lo the fan for beautys hand the lovely queen of beauty made it the price she named was hard to stand but venus smiled the hebrew paid it jove juno venus where are you mars mercury phoebus neptune saturn but oer the world the wandering jew has borne the fans celestial pattern so everywhere we find the fan in lonely isles of the pacific in farthest china and japan wherever suns are sudorific nay even the oily esquimaux in summer court its cooling breezes in fact in every clime t is so no matter if it fries or freezes and since from aphrodites dove the pattern of the fan was given no wonder that it breathes of love and wafts the perfumed gales of heaven before this new pandoras gift in slavery womans tyrant kept her but now he kneels her glove to lift the fan is mightier than the sceptre the tap it gives how arch and sly the breath it wakes how fresh and grateful behind its shield how soft the sigh the whispered tale of shame how fateful its empire shadows every throne and every shore that man is tost on it rules the lords of every zone nay even the bluest blood of boston but every one that swings tonight of fairest shape from farthest region may trace its pedigree aright to aphrodites fantailed pigeon to r b h at the dinner to the president boston june how to address him awkward it is true call him great father as the red men do borrow some title this is not the place that christens men your highness and your grace we tried such names as these awhile you know but left them off a century ago his majesty weve had enough of that besides that needs a crown he wears a hat what if to make the nicer ears content we say his honesty the president sir we believed you honest truthful brave when to your hands their precious trust we gave and we have found you better than we knew braver and not less honest not less true so every heart has opened every hand tingles with welcome and through all the land all voices greet you in one broad acclaim healer of strife has earth a nobler name what phrases mean you do not need to learn we must be civil and they serve our turn your most obedient humble means means what something the wellbred signer just is not yet there are tokens sir you must believe there is one language never can deceive the lover knew it when the maiden smiled the mother knows it when she clasps her child voices may falter trembling lips turn pale words grope and stumble this will tell their tale shorn of all rhetoric bare of all pretence but radiant warm with natures eloquence look in our eyes your welcome waits you there north south east west from all and everywhere the ship of state a sentiment this sentiment was read on the same occasion as the family record which immediately follows it the latter poem is the dutiful tribute of a son to his father and his fathers ancestors residents of woodstock from its first settlement the ship of state above her skies are blue but still she rocks a little it is true and there are passengers whose faces white show they dont feel as happy as they might yet on the whole her crew are quite content since its wild fury the typhoon has spent and willing if her pilot thinks it best to head a little nearer south by west and this they feel the ship came too near wreck in the long quarrel for the quarterdeck now when she glides serenely on her way the shallows past where dread explosives lay the stiff obstructives churlish game to try let sleeping dogs and still torpedoes lie and so i give you all the ship of state freedoms last venture is her priceless freight god speed her keep her bless her while she steers amid the breakers of unsounded years lead her through dangers paths with even keel and guide the honest hand that holds her wheel woodstock conn july a family record woodstock conn july not to myself this breath of vesper song not to these patient friends this kindly throng not to this hallowed morning though it be our summer christmas freedoms jubilee when every summit topmast steeple tower that owns her empire spreads her starry flower its bloodstreaked leaves in heavens benignant dew washed clean from every crimson stain they knew no not to these the passing thrills belong that steal my breath to hush themselves with song these moments all are memorys i have come to speak with lips that rather should be dumb for what are words at every step i tread the dust that wore the footprints of the dead but for whose life my life had never known this faded vesture which it calls its own here sleeps my fathers sire and they who gave that earlier life here found their peaceful grave in days gone by i sought the hallowed ground climbed yon long slope the sacred spot i found where all unsullied lies the winter snow where all ungathered springs pale violets blow and tracked from stone to stone the saxon name that marks the blood i need not blush to claim blood such as warmed the pilgrim sons of toil who held from god the charter of the soil i come an alien to your hills and plains yet feel your birthright tingling in my veins mine are this changing prospects sun and shade in fullblown summers bridal pomp arrayed mine these fair hillsides and the vales between mine the sweet streams that lend their brightening green i breathed your air the sunlit landscape smiled i touch your soil it knows its childrens child throned in my heart your heritage is mine i claim it all by memorys right divine waking i dream before my vacant eyes in long procession shadowy forms arise far through the vista of the silent years i see a venturous band the pioneers who let the sunlight through the forests gloom who bade the harvest wave the garden bloom hark loud resounds the barearmed settlers axe see where the stealthy panther left his tracks as fierce as stealthy creeps the skulking foe with stonetipped shaft and sinewcorded bow soon shall he vanish from his ancient reign leave his last cornfield to the coming train quit the green margin of the wave he drinks for haunts that hide the wildcat and the lynx but who the youth his glistening axe that swings to smite the pine that shows a hundred rings his features something in his look i find that calls the semblance of my race to mind his name my own and that which goes before the same that once the loved disciple bore young brave discreet the father of a line whose voiceless lives have found a voice in mine thinned by unnumbered currents though they be thanks for the ruddy drops i claim from thee the seasons pass the roses come and go snows fall and melt the waters freeze and flow the boys are men the girls grown tall and fair have found their mates a gravestone here and there tells where the fathers lie the silvered hair of some bent patriarch yet recalls the time that saw his feet the northern hillside climb a pilgrim from the pilgrims far away the godly men the dwellers by the bay on many a hearthstone burns the cheerful fire the schoolhouse porch the heavenward pointing spire proclaim in letters every eye can read knowledge and faith the new worlds simple creed hush t is the sabbaths silencestricken morn no feet must wander through the tasselled corn no merry children laugh around the door no idle playthings strew the sanded floor the law of moses lays its awful ban on all that stirs here comes the tithingman at last the solemn hour of worship calls slowly they gather in the sacred walls man in his strength and age with knotted staff and boyhood aching for its weekday laugh the toilworn mother with the child she leads the maiden lovely in her golden beads the popish symbols round her neck she wears but on them counts her lovers not her prayers those youths in homespun suits and ribboned queues whose hearts are beating in the highbacked pews the pastor rises looks along the seats with searching eye each wonted face he meets asks heavenly guidance finds the chapters place that tells some tale of israels stubborn race gives out the sacred song all voices join for no quartette extorts their scanty coin then while both hands their blackgloved palms display lifts his gray head and murmurs let us pray and pray he does as one that never fears to plead unanswered by the god that hears what if he dwells on many a fact as though some things heaven knew not which it ought to know thanks god for all his favors past and yet tells him theres something he must not forget such are the prayers his people love to hear see how the deacon slants his listening ear what look once more nay surely there i trace the hinted outlines of a wellknown face not those the lips for laughter to beguile yet round their corners lurks an embryo smile the same on other lips my childhood knew that scarce the sabbaths mastery could subdue him too my lineage gives me leave to claim the good grave man that bears the psalmists name and still in ceaseless round the seasons passed spring piped her carol autumn blew his blast babes waxed to manhood manhood shrunk to age lifes wornout players tottered off the stage the few are many boys have grown to men since putnam dragged the wolf from pomfrets den our newold woodstock is a thriving town brave are her children faithful to the crown her soldiers steel the savage redskin knows their blood has crimsoned his canadian snows and now once more along the quiet vale rings the dread call that turns the mothers pale full well they know the valorous heat that runs in every pulsebeat of their loyal sons who would not bleed in good king georges cause when englands lion shows his teeth and claws with glittering firelocks on the village green in proud array a martial band is seen you know what names those ancient rosters hold whose belts were buckled when the drumbeat rolled but mark their captain tell us who is he on his brown face that same old look i see yes from the homesteads still retreat he came whose peaceful owner bore the psalmists name the same his own well israels glorious king who struck the harp could also whirl the sling breathe in his song a penitential sigh and smite the sons of amalek hip and thigh these shared their task one deaconed out the psalm one slashed the scalping hellhounds of calm the praying fathers pious work is done now sword in hand steps forth the fighting son on many a field he fought in wilds afar see on his swarthy cheek the bullets scar there hangs a murderous tomahawk beneath without its blade a knifes embroidered sheath save for the stroke his trusty weapon dealt his scalp had dangled at their owners belt but not for him such fate he lived to see the bloodier strife that made our nation free to serve with willing toil with skilful hand the warworn saviors of the bleeding land his wasting life to others needs he gave sought rest in home and found it in the grave see where the stones lifes brief memorials keep the tablet telling where he fell on sleep watched by a winged cherubs rayless eye a scroll above that says we all must die those saddening lines beneath the nightthoughts lent so stands the soldiers surgeons monument ah at a glance my filial eye divines the scholar son in those remembered lines the scholar son his hand my footsteps led no more the dim unreal past i tread o thou whose breathing form was once so dear whose cheering voice was music to my ear art thou not with me as my feet pursue the village paths so well thy boyhood knew along the tangled margin of the stream whose murmurs blended with thine infant dream or climb the hill or thread the wooded vale or seek the wave where gleams yon distant sail or the old homesteads narrowed bounds explore where sloped the roof that sheds the rains no more where one last relic still remains to tell here stood thy home the memoryhaunted well whose waters quench a deeper thirst than thine changed at my lips to sacramental wine art thou not with me as i fondly trace the scanty records of thine honored race call up the forms that earlier years have known and spell the legend of each slanted stone with thoughts of thee my loving verse began not for the critics curious eye to scan not for the many listeners but the few whose fathers trod the paths my fathers knew still in my heart thy loved remembrance burns still to my lips thy cherished name returns could i but feel thy gracious presence near amid the groves that once to thee were dear could but my trembling lips with mortal speech thy listening ear for one brief moment reach how vain the dream the pallid voyagers track no sign betrays he sends no message back no word from thee since evenings shadow fell on thy cold forehead with my long farewell now from the margin of the silent sea take my last offering ere i cross to thee
