side of the race track on that hot and cloudless afternoon his long hair blowing about in the fresh breeze and partially obscuring his face his golden helmet clutched so tightly in his gauntleted hands that he appeared to be trying to crush it the hands were shaking uncontrollably and occasional violent tremors racked his entire body his own car from which he had been miraculously thrown clear uninjured just before it had overturned lay of all places in its own coronado pits upside down and with its wheels spinning idly wisps of smoke ware coming from an engine already engulfed under a mound of foam from the fire extinguishers and it was clear that there was now little danger of an explosion from the unruptured fuel tanks alexis dunnet the first to reach harlow noticed that he wasnt looking at his own car but was staring trance like at a spot about two hundred yards farther along the track where an already dead man called isaac jethou was being cremated in the whiteflamed funeral pyre of what had once been his grand prix formula one racing car there was curiously little smoke coming from the blazing wreck presumably because of the intense heat given off by the incandescent magnesium alloy wheels and when the gusting wind occasionally parted the towering curtains of flame jethou could be seen sitting bolt upright in his cockpit the one apparently undamaged structure left in an otherwise shattered and unrecognizable mass of twisted steel at least dunnet knew i was jethou but what he was seeing was a blackened and horribly charred remnant of a human being the many thousands of people in the stands and lining the track were motionless and soundless staring in transfixed and incredulous awe and horror at the burning car the last of the engines of the grand prix cars there were nine of them stopped in sight of the pits some drivers standing by their sides died away as the race marshals frantically flagged the abandonment of the race the public address system had fallen silent now as did a sirens ululating wail as an ambulance screeching to a halt at a prudent distance from jethous car its flashing light fading into nothingness against the white blaze in the background rescue workers in aluminium asbestos suits some operating giant wheeled fireextinguishers some armed with crowbars and axes were trying desperately for some reason wholly beyond the bounds of logic to get sufficiently close to the car to drag the cindered corpse free but the undiminished intensity of the flames made a mockery of their desperation their efforts were as futile as the presence of the ambulance was unnecessary jethou was beyond any mortal help or hope dunnet looked away and down at the overalled figure beside him the hands that held the golden helmet still trembled unceasingly and the eyes still fixed immovably on the sheeted flames that now quite enveloped isaac jethous car were the eyes of an eagle gone blind dunnet reached for his shoulder and shook it gently but he paid no heed dunnet asked him if he were hurt for his face and trembling hands were masked in blood he had cartwheeled at least half a dozen times after being thrown from his car in the final moments before it had upended and come to rest in its own pits harlow stirred and looked at dunnet blinking like a man slowly arousing himself from a nightmare then shook his head two ambulance men with a stretcher came towards them at a dead run but harlow unaided except for dunnets supporting hand under his upper arm pushed himself shakily to his feet and waved them off he didnt however seem to object to what little help dunnets hand lent him and they walked slowly back to the coronado pits the still dazed and virtually uncomprehending harlow dunnet tall thin with dark hair parted in the middle a dark pencilline moustache and rimless glasses everyones idealised conception of a city accountant even though his passport declared him to be a journalist macalpine a fireextinguisher still held in one hand turned to meet them at the entrance to the pits james macalpine owner and manager of the coronado racing team dressed in a now stained tan gabardine suit was in his midfifties as heavily jowled as he was heavily built and had a deeply lined face under an impressive mane of black and silver hair behind him jacobson the chief mechanic and his two redhaired assistants the rafferty twins who for some reason unknown were invariably referred to as tweedledum and tweedledee still ministered to the smouldering coronado while behind the car two other men whitecoated firstaid men were carrying out more serious ministrations of their own on the ground unconscious but still clutching the pad and pencil with which she had been taking lap times lay mary macalpine the owners blackhaired twentyyearold daughter the firstaid men were bent over her left leg and scissoring open to the knee winered slacks that had been white moments ago macalpine took harlows arm deliberately shielding him from the sight of his daughter and led him to the little shelter behind the pits macalpine was an extremely able competent and tough man as millionaires tend to be beneath the toughness as of now lay a kindness and depth of consideration of which no one would have dared to accuse him in the back of the shelter stood a small wooden crate which was in effect a portable bar most of it was given over to an icebox stocked with a little beer and lots of soft drinks chiefly for the mechanics for working under that torrid sun was thirsty business there were also two bottles of champagne for it had not been unreasonable to expect of a man who had just reeled off a nearimpossible five consecutive grand prix victories that he might just possibly achieve his sixth harlow opened the lid of the crate ignored the icebox lifted out a bottle of brandy and halffilled the tumbler the neck of the bottle chattering violently against the rim of the glass more brandy spilled to the ground than went into the glass he required both hands to lift the glass to his mouth and now the rim of the tumbler castanetlike fashion struck up an even more erratic tattoo against his teeth than the bottle had on the glass he managed to get some of it down but most of the glasss contents overflowed by the two sides of his mouth coursed down the bloodstreaked chin to stain the white racing overalls to exactly the same colour as the slacks of the injured girl outside harlow stared bemusedly at the empty glass sank on to a bench and reached for the bottle again macalpine looked at dunnet his face without expression harlow had suffered three major crashes in his racing career in the last of which two years previously he had sustained nearfatal injuries on that last occasion he had been smiling albeit in agony as his stretcher had been loaded aboard the ambulance plane for the flight back to london and the left hand he had used to give the thumbsup signal his right forearm had been broken in two places had been as steady as if graven from marble but more dismaying was the fact that apart from a token sip of celebration champagne he had never touched hard alcohol in his life it happens to them all macalpine had always maintained sooner or later it happens to them all no matter how cool or brave or brilliant they were it happened to them all and the more steely their icy calm and control the more fragile it was macalpine was never a man to be averse to the odd hyperbolic turn of phrase and there was a handful but only a handful of outstanding exgrand prix drivers around who had retired at the top of their physical and mental form sufficient at any rate to disprove macalpines statement in its entirety but it was well enough known that there existed topflight drivers who had crashed or who had suffered so much nervous and mental fatigue that they had become empty shells of their former selves that there were among the current twentyfour grand prix drivers four or five who would never win a race again because they had no intention of ever trying to do so who kept going only in order to shore up the facade of a now empty pride but there are some things that are not done in the racing world and one of those is that you dont remove a man from the grand prix roster just because his nerve is gone but that macalpine was more often right than wrong was sadly clear from the sight of that trembling figure hunched on the bench if ever a man had gone over the top had reached and passed the limit of endurance before tumbling over the precipice of selfabnegation and hapless acceptance of ultimate defeat it was johnny harlow the golden boy of the grand prix circuits unquestionably until that afternoon the outstanding driver of his time and it was being increasingly suggested of all time with last years world championship safely his and the current years by any reasonable standards almost inevitably his with half the grand prix races still to run harlows will and nerve would have appeared to have crumbled beyond recovery it was plain to macalpine and dunnet that the charred being who had been isaac jethou would haunt him for however long his days were to be not that the signs hadnt been there before for those with eyes to see them and most of the drivers and mechanics on the circuits had the kind of eyes that were required ever since the second grand prix race of the season which he had easily and convincingly won unaware of the fact that his brilliant younger brother had been forced off the track and had telescoped his car into a third of its length against the base of a pine tree at something over a hundred and fifty miles an hour the signs had been there never a sociable or gregarious person he had become increasingly withdrawn increasingly taciturn and when he smiled and it was rarely it was the empty smile of a man who could find nothing in life to smile about normally the most icily calculating and safetyconscious of drivers his impeccable standards had become eroded and his previous near obsession with safety dismayingly decreased while contradictorily he had consistently kept on breaking lap records on circuits throughout europe but he had continued on his recordbreaking way capturing one grand prix trophy after the other at the increasingly mounting expense of himself and his fellow competitors his driving had become reckless and increasingly dangerous and the other drivers tough and hardened professionals though they all were began to go in fear of him for instead of disputing a corner with him as they would normally have done they had nearly all of them fallen into the habit of pulling well in when they saw his limegreen coronado closing up on their driving mirrors this in all conscience was seldom enough for harlow had an extremely simple racewinning formulato get in front and stay there by now more and more people were saying out loud that his suicidally competitive driving on the racetracks signified not a battle against his peers but a battle against himself it had become increasingly obvious latterly painfully obvious that this was one battle that he would never win that this last ditch stand against his failing nerve could have only one end that one day his luck would run out and so it had and so had isaac jethous and johnny harlow for all the world to see had lost his last battle on the grand prix tracks of europe and america maybe he would move out on the tracks again maybe he would start fighting again but it seemed certain then that no one knew with more dreadful clarity than harlow that his fighting days were over for a third time harlow reached out for the neck of the brandy bottle his hands as unsteady as ever the oncefull bottle was now onethird empty but only a fraction of that had found its way down his throat so uncontrollable were his movements macalpine looked gravely at dunnet shrugged his heavy shoulders in a gesture of either resignation or acceptance and then glanced out into the pits an ambulance had just arrived for his daughter and as macalpine hurried out dunnet set about cleaning up harlows face with the aid of a sponge and bucket of water harlow didnt seem to care one way or another whether his face was washed whatever his thoughts were and in the circumstances it would have taken an idiot not to read them aright his entire attention appeared to be concentrated on the contents of that bottle of martell the picture of a man if ever there was one who desperately needed and urgently sought immediate oblivion it was as well perhaps that both harlow and macalpine failed to notice a person standing just outside the door whose expression clearly indicated that he would take quite some pleasure in assisting harlow into a state of permanent oblivion rory macalpines son a dark curlyhaired youth of a normally amiable even sunny disposition had now a dark thundercloud on his face an unthinkable expression for one who for years and until only a few minutes previously regarded harlow as the idol of his life rory looked away towards the ambulance where his unconscious and bloodsoaked sister lay and then the unthinkable was no longer so he turned again to look at harlow and now the emotion reflected in his eyes was as close to outright hatred as a sixteenyearold was ever likely to achieve the official inquiry into the cause of the accident held almost immediately afterwards predictably failed to indict any one man as the sole cause of the disaster official race inquiries almost never did including the notorious inquiry into that unparalleled le mans holocaust when seventythree spectators were killed and no one was found to blame whereas it was common knowledge at the time that one man and one man only dead now these many years had been the person responsible for it this particular inquiry failed to indict in spite of the fact that two or three thousand people in the main stands would unhesitatingly have laid the sole charge at the door of johnny harlow but even more damning was the incontrovertible evidence supplied in the small hall where the inquiry was held by a tv playback of the entire incident the projection screen had been small and stained but the picture clear enough and the sound effects all too vivid and true to life in the rerun of the film it lasted barely twenty seconds but was screened five times three grand prix cars viewed from the rear but being closely followed by the telescopic zoom lens could be seen approaching the pits harlow in his coronado was closing up on the leading car a vintage privately entered ferrari that was leading only by virtue of the fact that it had already lost a lap moving even more quickly than harlow and well clear on the other side of the track was a works entered fire engine red ferrari driven by a brilliant californian isaac jethou in the straight jethous twelve cylinders had a considerable edge over harlows eight and it was clear that he intended to pass it seemed that harlow too was quite aware of this for his brake lights came on in keeping with his apparent intention of easing slightly and tucking in behind the slower car while jethou swept by suddenly incredibly harlows brake lights went out and the coronado swerved violently outwards as if harlow had decided he could overtake the car in front before jethou could overtake him if that had been his inexplicable intention then it had been the most foolhardy of his life for he had taken his car directly into the path of isaac jethou who on that straight could not have been travelling at less than miles an hour and who in the fraction of the second available to him had never even the most remote shadow of a chance to take the only braking or avoiding action that could have saved him at the moment of impact jethous front wheel struck squarely into the side of harlows front wheel for harlow the consequences of the collision were in all conscience serious enough for it sent his car into an uncontrollable spin but for jethou they were disastrous even above the cacophonous clamour of engines under maximum revolutions and the screeching of locked tyres on the tarmac the bursting of jethous front tyre was heard as a rifle shot and from that instant jethou was a dead man his ferrari wholly out of control and now no more than a mindless mechanical monster bent on its own destruction smashed into and caromed off the nearside safety barrier and already belching gouts of red flame and black oily smoke careered wildly across the track to strike the far side barrier rear end first at a speed of still over a hundred miles an hour the ferrari spinning wildly slid down the track for about two hundred yards turned over twice and came to rest on all four wrecked wheels jethou still trapped in the cockpit but even then almost certainly dead it was then that the red flames turned to white that harlow had been directly responsible for jethous death was beyond dispute but harlow with eleven grand prix wins behind him in seventeen months was by definition and on his record the best driver in the world and one simply does not indict the best driver in the world it is not the done thing the whole tragic affair was attributed to the racetrack equivalent of an act of god and the curtain was discreetly lowered to indicate the end of the act chapter two the french even at their most relaxed and unemotional are little given to hiding their feelings and the packed crowd at clermontferrand that day which was notably unrelaxed and highly emotional was in no mood to depart from their latin norm as harlow head bowed trudged rather than walked along the side of the coronado pits they became very vocal indeed their booing hissing catcalling and just plain shouts of anger accompanied by much gallic waving of clenched fists was as threatening as it was frightening not only was it an ugly scene it was one that looked as if it would only require one single flashpoint to trigger off a near riot to convert their vengeful emotions towards johnny harlow into physical action against him and this it was clear was the apprehension that was uppermost in the minds of the police for they moved in close to afford harlow such protection as he might require it was equally clear from the expressions on their faces that the police did not relish their task and from the way they averted their faces from harlow that they sympathized with their countrymens feelings a few paces behind harlow flanked by dunnet and macalpine walked another man who clearly shared the opinions of police and spectators angrily twirling his racing helmet by its strap he was clad in racing overalls identical to those that harlow was wearing nicolo tracchia was in fact the no driver in the coronado racing team tracchia was almost outrageously handsome with dark curling hair a gleaming perfection of teeth that no dentifrice manufacturer would ever dare use as an advertisement and a suntan that would have turned a lifeguard pale green that he wasnt looking particularly happy at that moment was directly attributable to the fact that he was scowling heavily the legendary tracchia scowl was a memorable thing of wonder in constant use and held in differing degrees of respect awe and downright fear but never ignored tracchia had a low opinion of his fellowman and regarded the majority of people and this with particular reference to his fellow grand prix drivers as retarded adolescents understandably he operated in a limited social circle what made matters worse for tracchia was his realisation that brilliant driver though he was he was fractionally less good than harlow and even this was exacerbated by the knowledge that no matter how long or desperately he tried he would never quite close that fractional gap when he spoke now to macalpine he made no effort to lower his voice which in the circumstances mattered not at all for harlow could not possibly have heard him above the baying of the crowd but it was quite clear that tracchia would not have lowered his voice no matter what the circumstances an act of god the bitter incredulity in the voice was wholly genuine jesus christ did you hear what those cretins called it an act of god an act of murder i call it no lad no macalpine put his hand on tracchias shoulder only to have it angrily shrugged off macalpine sighed at the very outside manslaughter and not even that you know yourself how many grand prix drivers have died in the past four years because their cars went wild wild wild tracchia at a momentary and most uncharacteristic loss for words gazed heavenwards in silent appeal good god mac we all saw it on the screen we saw it five times he took his foot off the brake and pulled out straight in front of jethou an act of god sure sure sure its an act of god because hes won eleven grand prix in seventeen months because he won last years championship and looks as if hes going to do the same this year what do you mean you know damn well what i mean take him off the tracks and you might as well take us all off the tracks hes the champion isnt he if hes that bad then what the hell must the rest of us be like we know thats not the case but will the public will they hell god knows that there are already too many people and damned influential people as well agitating that grand prix racing should be banned throughout the world and too many countries just begging for a good excuse to get out this would be the excuse of a lifetime we need our johnny harlows dont we mac even though they do go around killing people i thought he was your friend nikki sure mac sure hes my friend so was jethou there was no reply for macalpine to make to this so he made none tracchia appeared to have said his say for he fell silent and got back to his scowling in silence and in safety the police escort had been steadily increasingthe four men reached the coronado pits without a glance at or word to anyone harlow made for the little shelter at the rear of the pits in their turn nobody jacobson and his two mechanics were there also made any attempt either to speak to or stop him nor did any among them do even as much as trouble to exchange significant glances the starkly obvious requires no emphasis jacobson ignored him entirely and came up to macalpine the chief mechanic and he was one of acknowledged genius was a lean tall and strongly built man he had a dark and deeply lined face that looked as if it hadnt smiled for a long time and wasnt about to make an exception in this case either he said harlows clear of course of course i dont understand i have to tell you indict harlow and you set the sport back ten years too many millions tied up in it to allow that to happen isnt there now mr macalpine macalpine looked at him reflectively not answering glanced briefly at the still scowling tracchia turned away and walked across to harlows battered and fireblistered coronado which was by that time back on all four wheels he examined it leisurely almost contemplatively stooped over the cockpit turned the steering wheel which offered no resistance to his hand then straightened he said well now i wonder jacobson looked at him coldly his eyes expressing displeasure could be as formidable and intimidating as tracchias scowl he said i prepared that car mr macalpine macalpines shoulders rose and fell in a long moment of silence i know jacobson i know i also know youre the best in the business i also know that youve been too long in it to talk nonsense any car can go how long you want me to start now thats it tour hours jacobson was curt offence given and taken six at the most macalpine nodded took dunnet by the arm prepared to walk away then halted tracchia and rory were together talking in low indistinct voices but their words didnt have to be understood the rigid hostility in their expressions as they looked at harlow and his bottle of brandy inside the hut were eloquent enough macalpine his hand still on dunnets arm moved away and sighed again johnnys not making too many friends today is he he hasnt been for far too many days and i think that heres another friend that hes about not to make oh jesus sighs seemed to be becoming second nature to macalpine neubauer does seem to have something on his mind the figure in skyblue racing overalls striding towards the pits did indeed seem to have something on his mind neubauer was tall very blond and completely nordic in appearance although he was in fact austrian the no driver for team cagliari he had the word cagliari emblazoned across the chest of his overalls his consistent brilliance on the grand prix tracks had made him the acknowledged crown prince of racing and harlows eventual and inevitable successor like tracchia he was a cool distant man wholly incapable of standing fools at any price far less gladly like tracchia his friends and intimates were restricted to a very small group indeed it was a matter for neither wonder nor speculation that those two men the most unforgiving of rivals on the racetracks were offduty close friends neubauer with compressed lips and cold paleblue eyes glittering was clearly a very angry man and his humour wasnt improved when macalpine moved his massive bulk to block his way neubauer had no option other than to stop big man though he was macalpine was very much bigger when he spoke it was with his teeth clamped together out of my way macalpine looked at him in mild surprise you said what sorry mr macalpine wheres that bastard harlow leave him be hes not well and jethou is i suppose i dont know who the hell or what the hell harlow is or is supposed to be and i dont care why should that maniac get off scotfree he is a maniac you know it we all know it he forced me off the road twice today that could just as well have been me burnt to death as jethou im giving you warning mr macalpine im going to call a meeting of the gpda and have him banned from the circuits youre the last person who can afford to do that willi macalpine put his hands on neubauers shoulders the last person who can afford to put the finger on johnny if harlow goes whos the next champion neubauer stared at him some of the fury left his face and he stared at macalpine in almost bewildered disbelief when his voice came it was low almost an uncertain whisper you think i would do it for that mr macalpine no willi i dont im just pointing out that most others would there was a long pause during which what was left of neubauers anger died away he said quietly hes a killer hell kill again gently he removed macalpines hands turned and left the pits thoughtfully worriedly dunnet watched him leave he could be right james sure sure hes won five grand prix in a row but ever since his brother was killed in the spanish grand prix well you know five grand prix under his belt and youre trying to tell me that his nerve is gone i dont know whats gone i just dont know all i know is that the safest driver on the circuits has become so reckless and dangerous so suicidally competitive if you like that the other drivers are just plain scared of him as far as they are concerned the freedom of the road is his theyd rather live than dispute a yard of track with him thats why he keeps on winning macalpine regarded dunnet closely and shook his head in unease he macalpine and not dunnet was the acknowledged expert but macalpine held dunnet and his opinions in the highest regard dunnet was an extraordinarily shrewd intelligent and able person he was a journalist by profession and a highly competent one who had switched from being a political analyst to a sports commentator forthe admittedly unarguable reason that there is no topic on earth so irretrievably dull as politics the acute penetration and remarkable powers of observation and analysis that had made him so formidable a figure on the westminster scene he had transferred easily and successfully to the racetracks of the world a regular correspondent for a british national daily and two motoring magazines one british one american although he did a remarkable amount of freelance work on the side he had rapidly established himself as one of the very few really outstanding motor racing journalists in the world to do this in the space of just over two years had been a quite outstanding achievement by any standard so successful had he been indeed that he had incurred the envy and displeasure not to say the outright wrath of a considerable number of his less gifted peers nor was their minimal regard for him in any way heightened by what they sourly regarded as the limpetlike persistency with which he had attached himself to the coronado team on an almost permanent basis not that there were any laws written or unwritten about this sort of behaviour for no independent journalist had ever done this sort of thing before now that it had been done it was his fellowwriters said a thing that simply was not done it was his job they maintained and complained to write in a fair and unbiased fashion on all the cars and all the drivers in the grand prix field and their resentment remained undiminished when he pointed out to them reasonably and with unchallengeable accuracy that this was precisely what he did what really grieved them of course was that he had the inside track on the coronado team then the fastest burgeoning and most glamorous race company in the business and it would have been difficult to deny that the number of offtrack articles he had written partly about the team but primarily about harlow would have made up a pretty fairsize volume nor had matters been helped by the existence of a book on which he had collaborated with harlow macalpine said im afraid youre right alexis which means that i know youre right but i dont even want to admit it to myself hes just terrifying the living daylights out of everyone and out of me and now this they looked across the pits to where harlow was sitting on a bench just outside the shelter uncaring whether he was observed or not he halffilled a glass from a rapidly diminishing brandy bottle one did not have to have eyesight to know that the hands were still shaking diminishing though the protesting roar of the crowd still was it was still sufficient to make normal conversation difficult nevertheless the castanet rattle of glass against glass could be clearly heard harlow took a quick gulp from his glass then sat there with both elbows on his knees and stared unblinkingly and without expression at the wrecked remains of his car dunnet said and only two months ago hed never touched the hard stuff in his life what are you going to do james now macalpine smiled faintly im going to see mary i think by this time they might let me in to see her he glanced briefly his face seemingly impassive around the pits at harlow lifting his glass again at the redhaired rafferty twins looking almost as unhappy as dunnet and at jacobson tracchia and rory wearing uniform scowls and directing them in uniform directions sighed for the last time turned and walked heavily away mary macalpine was twentytwo years old pale complexioned despite the many hours she spent in the sun with big brown eyes gleamingly brushed black hair as dark as night and the most bewitching smile that ever graced a grand prix racing track she did not intend that the smile should be bewitching she just couldnt help it everyone in the team even the taciturn and terribletempered jacobson was in love with her in one way or another not to mention a quite remarkable number of other people who were not in the team this mary recognized and accepted with commendable aplomb although without either amusement or condescension condescension was quite alien to her nature in any event she viewed the regard that others had for her as only the natural reciprocal of the regard she had for them despite her quick nononsense mind mary macalpine was in many ways still very young lying in bed in that spotless soullessly antiseptic hospital room that night mary macalpine looked younger than ever she also looked as she unquestionably was very ill the natural paleness had turned to pallor and the big brown eyes which she opened only briefly and reluctantly were dulled with pain this same pain was reflected in macalpines eyes as he looked down at his daughter at the heavily splinted and bandaged left leg lying on top of the sheet macalpine stooped and kissed his daughter on the forehead he said sleep well darling good night she tried to smile with all the pills theyve given me yes i think i will and daddy darling it wasnt johnnys fault i know it wasnt it was his car i know it was were finding that out jacobson is taking the car down youll see will you ask johnny to come and see me not tonight darling im afraid hes not too well hehe hasnt been no no shock macalpine smiled hes been fed the same pills as yourself johnny harlow in shock i dont believe it three nearfatal crashes and he never once he saw you my darling he squeezed her hand ill be around later tonight macalpine left the room and walked down to the reception area a doctor was speaking to the nurse at the desk he had grey hair tired eyes and the face of an aristocrat macalpine said are you the person who is looking after my daughter mr macalpine yes i am dr chollet she seems very ill no mr macalpine no problem she is just under heavy sedation for the pain you understand i see how long will she be two weeks perhaps three no more one question dr chollet why is her leg not in traction it would seem mr macalpine that you are not a man who is afraid of the truth why is her leg not in traction traction is for broken bones mr macalpine your daughters left ankle bone im afraid is not just broken it is how would you say it in english pulverized yes i think that is the word pulverized beyond any hope of remedial surgery whats left of the bone will have to be fused together meaning that she can never bend her ankle again chollet inclined his head a permanent limp for life you can have a second opinion mr macalpine the best orthopaedic specialist in paris you are entitled no that will not be necessary the truth is obvious dr chollet one accepts the obvious i am deeply sorry mr macalpine she is a lovely child but i am only a surgeon miracles no no miracles thank you doctor you are most kind ill be back in about say two hours please not she will be asleep for at least twelve hours perhaps sixteen macalpine nodded his head in acceptance and left dunnet pushed away his plate with his untouched meal looked at macalpines plate similarly untouched then at the brooding macalpine he said i dont think either of us james is as tough as we thought we were age alexis it overtakes us all yes and at very high speed it would seem dunnet pulled his plate towards him regarded it sorrowfully then pushed it away again well i suppose its a damn sight better than amputation theres that theres that macalpine pushed back his chair a walk i think alexis for the appetite it wont work not with me nor with me i just thought it might be interesting to see if jacobson has turned up anything the garage was very long low heavily skylighted brilliantly lit with hanging spotlights and for a garage was remarkably clean and tidy jacobson was at the inner end stooped over harlows wrecked coronado when the metal door screeched open he straightened acknowledged the presence of mac alpine and dunnet with a wave of his hand then returned to his examination of the car dunnet closed the door and said quietly where are the other mechanics macalpine said you should know by this time jacobson always works alone on a crash job a very low opinion of other mechanics has jacobson says they either overlook evidence or destroy it by clumsiness the two men advanced and watched in silence as jacobson tightened a connection in the hydraulic brake line they were not alone in watching him directly above them through an open skylight the powerful lamps in the garage reflected on something metallic the metallic object was a handheld eight millimetre camera and the hands that held them were very steady indeed they were the hands of johnny harlow his face was as impassive as his hands were motionless intent and still and totally watchful it was also totally sober macalpine said well jacobson straightened and tenderly massaged an obviously aching back nothing just nothing suspension brakes engine transmission tyres steering all ok but the steering sheared impact fracture couldnt be anything else it was still working when he pulled out in front of jethou you cant tell me that the steering suddenly went in that one second of time mr macalpine coincidence is coincidence but that would be just a bit too much dunnet said so were still in the dark its broad daylight where i stand the oldest reason in the business driver error driver error dunnet shook his headjohnny harlow never made a driver error in his life jacobson smiled his eyes cold id like to have the opinion of jethous ghost on that one macalpine said this hardly helps come on hotel you havent even eaten yet jacobson he looked at dunnet a nightcap in the bar i think then a look in on johnny jacobson said youll be wasting your time sir hell be paralytic macalpine looked at jacobson consideringly then said very slowly and after a long pause hes still world champion hes still coronados number one so thats the way of it is it you want it some other way jacobson crossed to a sink began to wash his hands without turning he said youre the boss mr macalpine macalpine made no reply when jacobson had dried his hands the three men left the garage in silence closing the heavy metal door behind them only the top half of harlows head and supporting hands were visible as he clung to the ridgepole of the garages vroof and watched the three men walk up the brightly lit main street as soon as they had turned a corner and disappeared from sight he slid gingerly down towards the opened skylight lowered himself through the opening and felt with his feet until he found a metal crossbeam he released his grip on the skylight sill balanced precariously on the beam brought out a small flashlight from an inner pocket jacobson had switched off all the lights before leavingand directed it downwards the concrete floor was about nine feet below him harlow stooped reached for the beam with his hands slid down over it hung at the full stretch of his hand then released his grip he landed lightly and easily headed for the door switched on all the lights then went directly to the coronado he was carrying not one but two straphung cameras his eight millimetre cine and a very compact still camera with flashlight attachment he found an oily cloth and used it to rub clean part of the right suspension a fuel line the steering linkage and one of the carburettors in the engine compartment each of these areas he flashphotographed several times with the still camera he retrieved the cloth coated it with a mixture of oil and dirt from the floor swiftly smeared the parts he had photographed and threw the cloth into a metal bin provided for that purpose he crossed to the door and tugged on the handle but to no avail the door had been locked from the outside and its heavy construction precluded any thought or attempt to force it and harlows last thought was to leave any trace of his passing he looked quickly around the garage on his left hand side was a light wooden ladder suspended from two rightangle wall brackets a ladder almost certainly reserved for the cleaning of the very considerable skylight area below it and to one side lay in a corner the untidy coil of a towrope harlow moved to the corner picked up the rope lifted the ladder off its brackets looped the rope round the top rung and placed the ladder against the metal crossbeam he returned to the door and switched off the lights using his flashlight he climbed up the ladder and straddled the beam grasping the ladder while still maintaining his grip on the rope he manoeuvred the former until the lower end hooked on to one of the rightangle wall brackets using the looped rope he lowered the other end of the ladder until not without some difficulty he managed to drop it into the other bracket he released one end of the rope pulled it clear of the ladder coiled it up and threw it into the corner where it had been previously lying then swaying dangerously he managed to bring himself upright on the beam thrust himself head and shoulders through the opened skylight hauled himself up and disappeared into the night above macalpine and dunnet were seated alone at a table in an otherwise deserted lounge bar they were seated in silence as a waiter brought them two scotches macalpine raised his glass and smiled without humour when you come to the end of a perfect day god im tired so youre committed james so harlow goes on thanks to jacobson didnt leave me much option did he harlow running along the brightly lit main street stopped abruptly the street was almost entirely deserted except for two tall men approaching his way harlow hesitated looked around swiftly then pressed into a deeply recessed shop entrance he stood there immobile as the two men passed by they were nicolo tracchia harlows teammate and willi neubauer engrossed in lowvoiced and clearly very earnest conversation neither of them saw harlow they passed by harlow emerged from the recessed doorway looked cautiously both ways waited until the retreating backs of tracchia and neubauer had turned a corner then broke into a run again macalpine and dunnet drained their glasses macalpine looked questioningly at dunnet dunnet said well i suppose weve got to face it some time macalpine said i suppose both men rose nodded to the barman and left now moving at no more than a fast walk crossed the street in the direction of a neonsigned hotel instead of using the main entrance he went down a side alleyway turned to his right and started to climb a fireescape two steps at a time his steps were as surefooted as a mountain goat his balance immaculate his face registering no emotion only his eyes registered any expression they were clear and still but possessed an element of cleareyed and concentrated calculation it was the face of a dedicated man who knew completely what he was about macalpine and dunnet were outside a door numbered macalpines face registered a peculiar mixture of anger and concern dunnets face oddly showed only unconcern it could have been tightlipped unconcern but then dunnet was habitually a tightlipped man macalpine hammered loudly on the door the hammering brought no reaction macalpine glanced furiously at his bruising knuckles glanced at dunnet and started a renewed assault on the door dunnet had no comment to make either vocally or facially harlow reached a platform on the fourthfloor fireescape he swung over the guardrailing took a long step towards a nearby open window negotiated die crossing safely and passed inside the room was small a suitcase lay on the floor its contents spilled out in considerable disarray on die bedside table stood a lowwattage lamp which gave the only weak illumination in the room and a half empty bottle of whisky harlow closed and locked the window to the accompaniment of a violent tattoo of knocks on the door macalpines outraged voice was very loud and clear open up johnny open up or ill break the bloody door in harlow pushed both cameras under the bed he tore off his black leather jacket and black rollneck pullover and thrust them both after the cameras he then took a quick swill of whisky split a little in the palm of his hand and rubbed it over his face the door burst open to show macalpines outstretched right leg the heel of which hed obviously used against the lock both macalpine and dunnet entered then stood still harlow clad only in shirt and trousers and still wearing his shoes was stretched out in bed apparently in an almost comalike condition his arm dangled over the side of the bed his right hand clutching the neck of the whisky bottle macalpine grimfaced and almost incredulous approached the bed bent over harlow sniffed in disgust and removed the bottle from harlows nerveless hand he looked at dunnet who returned his expressionless glance macalpine said the greatest driver in the world please james you said it yourself it happens to all of them remember sooner or later it happens to them all but johnny harlow even to johnny harlow macalpine nodded both men turned and left the room closing the broken door behind them harlow opened his eyes rubbed his chin thoughtfully his hand stopped moving and he sniffed his palm he wrinkled his nose in distaste chapter three as the crowded weeks after the clermontferrand race rushed by there appeared to be little change in johnny harlow always a remote withdrawn and lonely figure remote and withdrawn he still remained except that he was now more lonely than ever in his great days at the peak of his powers and the height of his fame he had been a man relaxed to the point of abnormality his inner self under iron control and so in his quietness he seemed to be now as aloofly remote and detached as ever those remarkable eyes remarkable in the quality of their phenomenal eyesight not in appearance as clear and calm and unblinking as ever and the aquiline face quite devoid of expression the hands were still now hands that bespoke a man at peace with himself but it would seem likely that the hands belied and did not bespeak for it seemed equally that he was not at peace with himself and never would be again for to say that johnny harlows fortunes steadily declined from that day he had killed jethou and crippled mary one would be guilty of a sad misuse of the english language they hadnt declined they had collapsed with what must have been for him and most certainly for his great circle of friends acquaintances and admirers a complete and shattering finality two weeks after the death of jethou and this before his own home british crowd who had come almost to a man to forgive him for the dreadful insults and accusations heaped upon him by the french press and to cheer their idol home to victory he had suffered the indignity not to say the humiliation of running off the track in the very first lap he had caused no damage either to himself or any spectator but his coronado was a total writeoff as both front tyres had burst it was assumed that at least one of them had gone before the car had left the track there could not it was agreed have been any other explanation for harlows abrupt departure into the wilderness this agreement was not quite universal jacobson predictably had privately expressed his opinion that the accepted explanation was a very charitable assumption indeed jacobson was becoming very attached to the phrase driver error two weeks after that at the german grand prix probably the most difficult circuit in europe but one of which harlow was an acknowledged master the air of gloom and despondency that hung like a thundercloud over the coronado pits was almost palpable enough almost visible enough to take hold of and push to one sidewere it not for the fact that this particular cloud was immovable the race was over and the last of the grand prix cars had vanished to complete the final circuit of the track before coming into their pits macalpine looking both despondent and bitter glanced at dunnet who lowered his eyes bit his lower lip and shook his head macalpine looked away and lost himself in his own private thoughts mary sat on a canvas chair close beside them her left leg was still in heavy plaster and crutches were propped up against her chair she held a laptime notepad in one hand a stop watch and pencil in the other she was gnawing a pencil and her pale face held the expression of one who was pretty close to tears behind her stood jacobson his two mechanics and rory jacobsons face if his habitual saturnine expression were excepted was quite without expression his mechanics the redhaired rafferty twins wore as usual identical expressions in this case a mixture of resignation and despair rorys face registered nothing but a cold contempt rory said eleventh out of twelve finishers boy what a driver our world champion doing his lap of honour i suppose jacobson looked at him speculatively a month ago he was your idol rory rory looked across at his sister she was still gnawing her pencil the shoulders were drooped and the tears in her eyes were now unmistakable rory looked back at jacobson and said that was a month ago a limegreen coronado swept into the pits braked and stopped its crackling exhaust fading away into silence nicolo tracchia removed his helmet produced a large silk handkerchief wiped his matineeidol face and started to remove his gloves he looked and with reason particularly pleased with himself for he had just finished second and that by only a cars length macalpine crossed to him and patted the stillseated tracchia on the back a magnificent race nikki your best ever and on this brute of a course your third second place in five times out he smiled you know im beginning to think that we may make a driver of you yet tracchia grinned hugely and climbed from the car watch me next time out so far nicolo tracchia hasnt really been trying just trying to improve the performance of those machines our chief mechanic ruins for us between races he smiled at jacobson who grinned back despite the marked differences in the natures and interests there was a close affinity between the two men now when it comes to the austrian grand prix in a couple of weeks well im sure you can afford a couple of bottles of champagne macalpine smiled again and it was clear that though the smile did not come easily its reluctance was net directed against tracchia in the space of one brief month macalpine even though he still couldnt conceivably be called a thin person had noticeably lost weight in both body and face the already trenched lines in the latter seemed to have deepened and it was possible even to imagine an increase in the silver on that magnificent head of hair it was difficult to imagine that even the precipitous fall from grace of his superstar could have been responsible for so dramatic a change but it was equally difficult to imagine that there could have been any other reason macalpine said overlooking the fact arent we that therell be a real live austrian at the austrian grand prix chap called willi neubauer you have heard of him tracchia was unperturbed austrian our willi may be but the austrian grand prix is not his circuit hes never come in better than fourth ive been second in the last two years he glanced away as another coronado entered the pits then looked back at macalpine and you know who came in first both times yes i know macalpine turned away heavily and approached the other car as harlow got out removed his helmet looked at his car and shook his head when macalpine spoke there was no bitterness or anger or accusation in either voice or face just a faint resignation and despair well johnny you cant win them all harlow said not with this car i cant meaning loss of power in the higher revs jacobson had approached and his face was still without expression as he heard harlows explanation he said from the start no nothing to do with you jake i know that it was bloody funny kept coming and going at least a dozen times i got full power back but never for long he turned away and moodily examined his car again jacobson glanced at macalpine who gave him an all but imperceptible nod by dusk that evening the racetrack was deserted the last of the crowds and officials gone macalpine a lonely and brooding figure his hands thrust deeply in the pockets of his tan gabardine suit stood at the entrance of the coronado pits he wasnt however quite as alone as he might justifiably have imagined in the neighbouring cagliari pits a figure clad in a dark rollneck pullover and dark leather jacket stood hidden in a shadowed corner johnny harlow had a remarkable capacity for maintaining an absolute stillness and that capacity he was employing to the full at that moment but apart from those two figures the entire track seemed quite empty of life but not of sound there came the deepening clamour of the sound of a grand prix engine and a coronado lights on appeared from the distance changed down through the gears slowed right down as it passed the cagliari pits and came to a halt outside the entrance to the coronado pits jacobson climbed out and removed his helmet macalpine said well damn all the matter with the car his tone was neutral but his eyes were hard went like a bird our johnny certainly knows how to use his imagination weve got something more than just driver error here mr macalpine macalpine hesitated the fact that jacobson had made a perfect lap circuit was no proof of anything one way or another in the nature of things he would have been unable to drive the coronado at anything like the speed harlow had done again the fault may have occurred only when the engine had heated to its maximum and it was unlikely that jacobson could have reached that in a single lap finally those highlybred racing engines which could cost up to eight thousand pounds were extraordinarily fickle creatures and quite capable of developing and clearing up their own faults without the hand of man going anywhere near them jacobson inevitably regarded macalpines silence as either doubt or outright agreement he said maybe youre coming round to my way of thinking mr macalpine macalpine didnt say whether he was or he wasnt he said instead just leave the car where she is well send henry and the two boys down with the transporter to pick it up come along dinner i think weve earned it and a drink i think weve earned that too in fact i dont think ive ever earned so many drinks as i have in the past four weeks i wouldnt disagree with you on that mr macalpine macalpines blue aston martin lay parked in the rear of the pits both men climbed in and drove off down the track harlow watched the car depart if he had been disturbed by the conclusions jacobson had arrived at or macalpines apparent acceptance of them no signs of any such anxiety were reflected in his untroubled face he waited until the car had disappeared into the gathering darkness looked round carefully to make sure that he was entirely alone and unobserved then moved into the back of the cagliari pits there he opened a canvas bag he was carrying produced a flatbased lamplight with a large swivelling head a hammer cold chisel and screwdriver and set them on top of the nearest crate he pressed the switch on the handle of the lamplight and a powerful white beam illuminated the back of the cagliari pits a flick on the lever on the base of the swivelling head and the white dazzle was at once replaced by a red muted glow harlow took hammer and chisel in hand and set resolutely to work most of the crates and boxes did not in fact have to be forced for the esoteric collection of engine and chassis spares inside them could not conceivably have been of any interest to any passing thief he almost certainly wouldnt have known what to look for and in the remote event of his so knowing he would quite certainly have been unable to dispose of them the few crates that harlow did have to open he did so carefully gently and with the minimum of noise harlow spent the minimum of time on his examination presumably because delay always increased the danger of discovery he also appeared to know exactly what he was looking for the contents of some boxes were disposed of with only the most cursory of glances even the largest of the crates merited no more than a minutes inspection within half an hour after beginning the operation he had begun to close all the crates and boxes up again those he had been compelled to force open he closed with a clothheaded hammer to reduce noise to a minimum and leave the least perceptible traces of his passing when he was finished he returned his torch and tools to the canvas bag emerged from the cagliari pits and walked away into the near darkness if he was disappointed with the results of his investigation he did not show it but then harlow rarely showed any emotion fourteen days later nicolo tracchia achieved what he promised macalpine he would achievethe ambition of his life he won the austrian grand prix harlow by now predictably won nothing worse not only did he not finish the race he hardly even began it achieving only four more laps than he had in england and there he had crashed on the first lap he had begun well enough by any standards even his own he had made a brilliantly successful start and was leading the field by a clear margin after the end of the fifth lap next time round he pulled his coronado into the pits as he stepped out of his car he seemed normal enough with no trace of undue anxiety and nothing even closely resembling a cold sweat but he had his hands thrust deeply into his overall pockets and his fists were tightly balled this way you cant tell whether a mans hands are shaking or not he removed one hand long enough to make a dismissive gesture towards all the pit crew with the exception of the still chairborne mary who came hurrying towards him no panic he shook his head and no hurry fourth gears gone he stood looking out moodily over the track macalpine stared at him closely then looked at dunnet who nodded without even appearing to have seen the glance that macalpine had directed at him dunnet was staring at the clenched hands inside harlows pockets macalpine said well pull nikki in you can have his car harlow didnt answer immediately there came the sound of an approaching racing engine and harlow nodded towards the track the others followed his line of sight a limegreen coronado flashed by but still harlow stared out over the track at least another fifteen seconds elapsed before the next car neubauers royal blue cagliari came by harlow turned and looked at macalpine harlows normally impassive face had come as near as it was possible for it to register a degree of incredulity pull him in good god mac are you mad nikkis got fifteen clear seconds now that im out theres no way he can lose our signor tracchia would never forgive me or you if you were to pull him in now itll be his first grand prix and the one he most wanted to win harlow turned and walked away as if the matter was settled both mary and rory watched him go the former with dull misery in her eyes the latter with a mixture of triumph and contempt at which he was at no pains at all to conceal macalpine hesitated made as if to speak then he too turned and walked away although in a different direction dunnet accompanied him the two men halted in a corner of the pits macalpine said well dunnet said well what james please i dont deserve that from you you mean did i see what you saw his hands ties got the shakes again macalpine made a long pause then sighed and shook his head i keep on saying it it happens to them all no matter how cool or brave or brilliant hell ive said it all before and when a man has icy calm and iron control like johnny well when the break comes its liable to be a pretty drastic one and when does the break come pretty soon i think ill give him one more grand prix do you know what hes going to do now later tonight ratherhes become very crafty about it i dont think i want to know hes going to hit the bottle a voice with a very powerful glasgow accent said the word is that he already has both macalpine and dunnet turned slowly round coming out of the shadows of the hut behind was a small man with an incredibly wizened face whose straggling white moustache contrasted oddly with his monks tonsure even odder was the long thin and remarkably bent black cigar protruding from one corner of his virtually toothless mouth his name was henry he was the transporters old driver long long past retiring age and the cigar was his trademark it was said that he occasionally ate with the cigar in his mouth macalpine said without inflection eavesdropping eh eavesdropping it was difficult to say whether henrys tone and expression reflected indignation or incredulity but in either event they were on an olympian scale you know very well that i would never eavesdrop mr macalpine i was just listening theres a difference what did you say just now i know you heard what i said henry was still splendidly unperturbed you know that hes driving like a madman and that all the other drivers are getting terrified of him in fact they are terrified of him he shouldnt be allowed on a racetrack again the mans shot you can see that and in glasgow when we say that a mans shot we mean dunnet said we know what you mean i thought you were a friend of his henry aye im all that finest gentleman ive ever known begging the pardon of you two gentlemen its because im his friend that i dont want him killed or had up for manslaughter macalpine said without animosity you stick to your job of running the transporter henry ill stick to mine of running the coronado team henry nodded and turned away gravity in his face and a certain carefully controlled degree of outrage in his walk as if to say hed done his duty delivered his witchs warning and if that warning were not acted upon the consequences werent going to be his henrys fault macalpine his face equally grave rubbed his cheek thoughtfully and said he could be right at that in fact i have every reason for thinking he is is what james on the skids on the rocks shot as henry would say shot by whom by what chap called bacchus alexis the chap that prefers using booze to bullets you have evidence of this not so much evidence of his drinking as lack of evidence of his not drinking which can be just as damning sorry dont follow can it be that you have been holding out on me james macalpine nodded and told briefly of his duplicity in the line of duty it was just after the day that jethou had died and harlow had shown his lack of expertise both in pouring and drinking brandy that macalpine had first suspected that harlow had forgone his lifelong abstention from alcohol there had been of course no spectacular drinking bouts for those would have been automatically responsible for having him banned from the racetracks of the world a genius for avoiding company he just went about it quietly steadily persistently and above all secretly for harlow always drank alone almost invariably in out of the way places usually quite remote where he stood little or no chance of being discovered this macalpine knew for he had hired what was practically a fulltime investigator to follow him but harlow was either extremely lucky or aware of what was going on he was a man of quite remarkable intelligence and must have suspected the possibility of his being followed extremely astute and skilled in his avoidance of surveillance for he had been tracked down only three times to sources of supply small weinstuben lost in the forests near the hockenheim and nurburgring circuits even on those occasions he had been observed to be sipping delicately and with what appeared to be commendable restraint a small glass of hock which was hardly sufficient to blunt even the highlytuned faculties and reactions of a formula one driver what made this elusiveness all the more remarkable was that harlow drove everywhere in his flamered ferrari the most conspicuous car on the roads of europe but that he went to such extraordinary and extraordinarily successful lengths to escape surveillance was for macalpine all the circumstantial evidence he required that harlows frequent mysterious and unexplained absences coincided with harlows frequent and solitary drinking bouts macalpine finished by saying that a later and more sinister note had crept in there was now daily and incontrovertible evidence that harlow had developed a powerful affinity for scotch dunnet was silent until he saw that macalpine apparently had no intention of adding to what he had said evidence he said what kind of evidence olfactory evidence dunnet paused briefly then said ive never smelt anything macalpine said kindly that alexis is because you are not capable of smelling anything you cant smell oil you cant smell fuel you cant smell burning tyres how do you expect to be able to smell scotch dunnet inclined his head in acknowledgment he said have you smelt anything macalpine shook his head well then macalpine said he avoids me like the plague nowadays and you know how close johnny and myself used to be whenever he does get close to me he smells powerfully of menthol throat tablets doesnt that say something to you come off it james thats no evidence perhaps not but tracchia jacobson and rory swear to it oh brother are they unbiased witnesses if johnny is forced to step down whos going to be coronados number one driver with a good chance of being the next champion who but our nikki jacobson and johnny have never been on good terms and now the relationship is going from bad to worse jacobson doesnt like having his cars smashed up and what he likes even less is harlows contention that the smashes have nothing to do with him which brings into question jacobsons ability to prepare a car thoroughly as for rory well frankly he hates johnny harlows guts partly because of what johnny did to mary partly because shes never allowed the accident to make the slightest difference in her attitude towards him im afraid james that your daughter is the only person left on the team who is still totally devoted to johnny harlow yes i know macalpine was momentarily silent then said dully mary was the first person to tell me oh jesus dunnet looked miserably out on the track and without looking at macalpine said youve no option now you have to fire him for preference today youre forgetting alexis that youve just learnt this while ive known it for some time my mind has been made up one more grand prix the parking lot in the fading light looked like the last resting place of the behemoths of a bygone age the huge transporters that carried the racing cars spare parts and portable workshops around europe parked as they were in a totally haphazard fashion loomed menacingly out of the gloom they were completely devoid of life as evinced by the fact that no light showed from any of them the car park itself was equally deserted except for a figure that had just appeared from out of the gathering dusk and passed through the entrance to the transporter parking lot johnny harlow made no apparent attempt to conceal his presence from any chance observer if any such there had been swinging his little canvas bag he made his way diagonally across the parking lot until he brought up at one of the huge behemoths written large on the side and back was the word ferrari he didnt even bother to try the door of the transporter but produced a bunch of curiously shaped keys and had the door open in a matter of a few seconds he passed inside and closed and locked the door behind him for five minutes he did nothing other than move from window to window on either side of the transporter checking patiently continuously to see if his unauthorized entrance had been observed it was apparent that it had not been satisfied harlow withdrew the flashlamp from the canvas bag switched on the red beam stooped over the nearest ferrari racing car and began to examine it minutely there were about thirty people in the hotel lobby that evening among them were mary macalpine and her brother henry and the two redhaired rafferty twins the sound level of the conversation was notably high the hotel had been taken over for the weekend by several of the grand prix teams and the racing fraternity is not particularly renowned for its inhibitions all of them mainly drivers but with several mechanics had discarded their workaday clothes and were suitably attired for their evening meal which was as yet an hour distant henry especially was exceptionally resplendent in a grey pinstriped suit with a red rose in his buttonhole even his moustache appeared to have been combed mary sat beside him with rory a few feet away reading a magazine or at least appearing to do so mary sat silently unsmiling constantly gripping and twisting one of the walking sticks to which she had now graduated suddenly she turned to henry where does johnny go each evening we hardly ever see him after dinner nowadays johnny henry adjusted the flower in his buttonhole no idea miss maybe he prefers his own company maybe he finds the food better elsewhere maybe anything rory still held the magazine before his face clearly however he was not reading for his eyes were very still but at the moment his whole being was not in his eyes but in his ears mary said maybe its not just the food that he finds better elsewhere girls miss johnny harlows not interested in girls he leered at her in what he probably imagined to be a roguish fashion in keeping with the gentlemanly splendour of his evening wear except for a certain youknowwho dont be such a fool mary macalpine was not always milk and roses you know what i mean what do you mean miss dont be clever with me henry henry assumed the sad expression of the continuously misjudged im not clever enough to be clever with anybody mary looked at him in cold speculation then abruptly turned away rory just as quickly averted his own head he was looking very thoughtful indeed and the expression superimposed upon the thoughtfulness could hardly be described as pleasant harlow the hooded red light giving all the illumination he required probed the depths of a box of spares suddenly he half straightened cocked his head as if to listen switched off the torch went to a side window and peered out the evening darkness had deepened until it was now almost night but a yellowish halfmoon drifting behind scattered cloud gave just enough light to see by two men were heading across the transporter park heading straight towards the coronado unit which was less than twenty feet from where harlow stood watching there was no difficulty at all in identifying them as macalpine and jacobson harlow made his way to the ferrari transporters door unlocked it and cautiously opened it just sufficiently to give him a view of the coronado transporters door macalpine was just inserting his key in the lock macalpine said so theres no doubt then harlow wasnt imagining things fourth gear is stripped completely so he may be in the clear after all there was a note almost of supplication in macalpines voice theres more than one way of stripping a gear jacobsons tone offered very little in the way of encouragement theres that i suppose theres that come on lets have a look at this damned gearbox both men passed inside and lights came on harlow unusually halfsmiling nodded slowly closed and gently locked the door and resumed his search he acted with the same circumspection as he had in the cagliari pits forcing open crates and boxes when this was necessary with the greatest of care so that they could be closed again to show the absolute minimum of offered violence he operated with speed and intense concentration pausing only once at the sound of a noise outside he checked the source of the noise saw macalpine and jacobson descending the steps of the coronado transporter and walk away across the deserted compound harlow returned to his work chapter four when harlow finally returned to the hotel the lobby which also served as the bar was crowded with hardly a seat left vacant and a group of at least a dozen men pressing in close against the bar macalpine and jacobson were sitting at a table with dunnet mary henry and rory were still sitting in the same seats as harlow closed the street door behind him the dinner gong sounded it was that kind of small country hotel deliberately so styled where everyone ate at the same time or not at all it was a great convenience to management and staff though somewhat less so to the guests the guests were rising as harlow made his way across the lobby towards the stairs nobody greeted him few even bothered to look at him macalpine jacobson and dunnet ignored him entirely rory scowled at him in open contempt mary glanced briefly at him bit her lip and quickly looked away again two months previously it would have taken johnny harlow five minutes to reach the foot of those stairs that evening he made it in under ten seconds if he was in any way dismayed by his reception he hid his concern well his face was as impassive as that of a wooden indians arrived in his bedroom he washed cursorily combed his hair crossed to a cupboard reached for a high shelf brought down a bottle of scotch went into the bathroom sipped some of the scotch swirled it round his mouth then grimaced and spat it out he left the glass with its still almost untouched contents on the basin ledge returned the bottle to the cupboard and made his way down to the diningroom he was the last arrival a complete stranger entering would have been paid more attention than was accorded to him harlow was no longer the person to be seen with the diningroom was pretty well filled but not to capacity most of the tables held four people a handful held only two of the tables that held four people only three had as few as three people at them of the tables for two only henry sat alone harlows mouth quirked so briefly perhaps even involuntarily that it could have been more imagined than seen then without hesitation he crossed the diningroom and sat down at henrys table harlow said may i henry be my guest mr harlow henry was cordiality itself and cordial he remained throughout the meal talking at length on a wide variety of utterly inconsequential subjects which try as he might harlow found of only minimal interest henrys intellectual reach was normally limited in its nature and harlow found that it was only with considerable difficulty that he could keep up his conversational end against henrys pedestrian platitudes to make matters worse he had to listen to henrys observations from a distance of about six inches an aesthetic ordeal in itself as at even a distance of several yards henry could not with all charity have been called photogenic but henry appeared to have considered this closerange exchange of intimacies as essential and in the circumstances harlow would have found it hard to disagree with him the silence in the diningroom that evening was more in the nature of a cathedral hush one that could not have been attributed to a beatific enjoyment of die food which was of a standard to earn for the austrians the most astronomical odds against in the culinary stakes it was plain to harlow as it was plain to all present that the very fact of his being there had an almost totally inhibitory effect on normal conversation henry consequently considered it prudent to lower his voice to a graveyard whisper that could not be heard beyond the confines of their table which in turn necessitated this very personal facetoface approach harlow felt but did not express his profound relief when the meal was over henry also suffered from a severe case of halitosis harlow was among the last to rise he drifted aimlessly into the now again crowded lobby he stood there in apparent irresolution quite ignored and glancing idly around mary he saw there and rory while at the far end of the lobby macalpine was engaged with what appeared to be some form of desultory conversation with henry macalpine said well henry was wearing his selfrighteous expression smelled like a distillery sir macalpine smiled faintly coming from glasgow you should know something about those things a good job i owe you an apology henry henry inclined his head granted mr macalpine harlow averted his head from this tableau he hadnt heard a word of the exchange but then he didnt have to hear it suddenly like a man making up his mind he headed for the street door mary saw him go looked around to see if she was being observed came to the apparent conclusion that she wasnt gathered up her two sticks and limped after him rory in his turn waited for about ten seconds after his sisters departure then drifted aimlessly towards the door five minutes later harlow entered a cafe and took a seat at an empty table where he could keep an eye on the entrance a pretty young waitress approached opened her eyes and then smiled charmingly there were few young people of either sex in europe who did not recognize harlow on sight harlow smiled back tonic and water please the eyes opened even wider i beg your pardon sir tonic and water the waitress whose opinion of world champion drivers had clearly suffered a sudden revision brought the drink he sipped it occasionally keeping an eye on the entrance door then frowned as the door opened and mary clearly in a very apprehensive mood entered the cafe she saw harlow at once limped across the room and sat down at the table she said hallo johnny in the voice of one who was far from sure of her reception i must say id expected someone else you what someone else i dont understand who no matter harlows tone was as brusque as his words who sent you here to spy on me spy on you spy on you she stared at him the expression on her face one of lack of understanding rather than incredulity what on earth can you mean harlow remained implacable surely you know what the word spy means oh johnny the hurt in the big brown eyes was as unmistakable as that in the voice you know id never spy on you harlow relented but only marginally then why are you here arent you pleased just to see me thats neither here nor there what are you doing in this cafe i was i was just passing by and and you saw me and came in abruptly he pushed back his chain and rose wait here harlow went to the front door glanced at it briefly and opened it stepping just outside he turned and looked for several seconds back up the way he had come then turned round and looked down the street but his interest lay in neither direction but in a doorway directly across the street a figure stood there pushed back deeply into the recess without appearing to have noticed him harlow reentered the cafe closed the door behind him and returned to his seat he said arent you lucky to have those xray eyes frosted glass all the way and yet you see me sitting here all right johnny she sounded very weary i followed you im worried im dreadfully worried arent we all now and again you should see me out on those racetracks at times he paused then added with apparent inconsequence was rory still in the hotel when you left she blinked her puzzlement yes yes he was i saw him just as i was leaving could he have seen you thats a funny question im a funny fellow ask anyone around the racetracks could he have seen you well yes i suppose he could whywhy all this concern about rory t wouldnt like the poor little lad to be abroad in the streets at night and maybe catch a chill or maybe even get mugged harlow paused consideringly theres a thought now oh stop it johnny stop it i know well i know he cant stand the sight of you wont even speak to you ever since ever since ever since i crippled you oh dear god the distress in the face was very real hes my brother johnny but hes not me can i help it if look whatever his grudge cant you forget it youre the kindest man in die world johnny harlow kindness doesnt pay mary you still are i know you are cant you forget it cant you forgive him youre big enough much more than big enough besides hes only a boy youre a man what danger is he to you what harm can he do you you should see what harm a dangerous nineyearold can do in vietnam when he has a rifle in his hands she pushed her chair back the tonelessness in her voice belied the tears in her eyes she said please forgive me i shouldnt have bothered you good night johnny he laid a gentle hand on her wrist and she made no move to withdraw it merely sat waiting there with a numbed despair on her face he said dont go i just wanted to make sure of something what oddly it doesnt matter any more lets forget about rory lets talk of you he called to the waitress same again please mary looked at the freshly filled glass she said whats that gin vodka tonic and water oh johnny will you kindly stop oh johnnying me it was impossible to tell whether the irritation in his voice was genuine or not wow then you say you are worried as if you have to tell anyone that far less me let me guess at your worries mary i would say that there are five of them rory yourself your father your mother and me she made as if to speak but he waved her to silence you can forget about rory and his antagonism to me a month from now and hell think it was all a bad dream then yourself and dont deny you are worried about our shall we say relationship those things tend to mend but they take time then theres your father and mother and well me again im about right you havent talked to me like this for a long long time does that mean im about right she nodded without speaking your father i know hes not looking well that hes lost weight i suggest that hes worried about your mother and me very much in that order my mother she whispered how did you know about that nobody knows about that except daddy and me i suspect alexis dunnet may know about it theyre very close friends but i cant be sure but your father told me over two months ago he trusted me i know in the days when we were still on speaking terms please johnny well i suppose thats better than oh johnny in spite of all thats passed i believe he still does please dont tell him that i told you because i said id tell no one promise promise your father hasnt been very communicative in the past two months understandably and i hardly felt i was in a position to ask him questions no progress no trace of her no message since she left your marseilles home three months ago nothing nothing if shed been the type to wring her hands shed have done just that and she used to phone every day she wasnt with us write every week and now we and your father has tried everything daddys a millionaire dont you think he would have tried everything i should have thought so so youre worried what can i do mary briefly drummed her fingers on the table and looked up at him her eyes were masked in tears she said you could remove his other main worry me mary nodded at that precise moment macalpine was very actively concerned in investigating his other main worry he and dunnet were standing outside a hotel bedroom door with macalpine inserting a key in the lock dunnet looked around him apprehensively and said i dont think the receptionist believed a word you said who cares macalpine turned the key in the lock i got johnnys key didnt i and if you hadnt id have kicked his damned door in ive done it before havent i the two men entered closed and locked the door behind them wordlessly and methodically they began to search harlows room looking equally in the most likely as unlikely places and in a hotel room the number of places available for concealment to even the most imaginative is very limited three minutes and their search was over a search that had been as rewarding as it was deeply dismaying the two men gazed down in a brief and almost stunned silence at the haul on harlows bed four full bottles of scotch and a fifth half full they looked at each other and dunnet summed up their feelings in a most succinct fashion indeed he said jesus macalpine nodded unusually for him he seemed at a total loss for words he didnt have to say anything for dunnet to understand and sympathize with his feelings for the vastly unpleasant dilemma in which macalpine now found himself he had committed himself to giving harlow his last chance ever and now before him he had all the evidence he would ever require to justify harlows instant dismissal dunnet said so what do we do we take that damn poison with us thats what we do macalpines eyes were sick his low voice harsh with strain but hes bound to notice and at once from what we know of him now the first thing hell do on return is head straight for the nearest bottle who the hell cares what he does or notices what can he do about it more importantly what can he say about it hes not going to rush down to the desk and shout im johnny harlow someones just stolen five bottles of scotch from my room he wont be able to do or say a thing of course he cant but hell still know the bottles are gone whats he going to think about that again who cares what that young dipsomaniac thinks besides why should it have been us if we had been responsible hed expect the heavens to fall in on him the moment he returns but they wont we wont say a word yet could have been any thief posing as a member of the staff come to that it wouldnt have been the first genuine staff member with a leaning towards petty larceny so our little bird wont sing our little bird cant damn him damn him damn him too late my mary harlow said cant drive no more johnny harlows on the skids ask anyone i dont mean that and you know it i mean your drinking me drink harlows face was its usual impassive self who says that everybody everybodys a liar as a remark it was a guaranteed conversation stopper a tear fell from marys face on to her wrist watch but if harlow saw it he made no comment by and by mary sighed and said quietly i give up i was a fool to try johnny are you coming to the mayors reception tonight no i thought youd like to take me please and make you a martyr no why dont you come every other race driver does im not every other driver im johnny harlow im a pariah an outcast i have a delicate and sensitive nature and i dont like it when nobody speaks to me mary put both her hands on his ill speak to you johnny you know i always will i know harlow spoke without either bitterness or irony i cripple you for life and youll always speak to me stay away from me young mary im poison there are some poisons i could get to like very much indeed harlow squeezed her hand and rose come on you have to get dressed for this do tonight ill see you back to the hotel they emerged from the cafe mary using her walking stick with one hand while with the other she clung to harlows arm harlow carrying the other stick had slowed his normal pace to accommodate marys limp as they moved slowly up the street rory macalpine emerged from the shadows of the recessed doorway opposite the cafe he was shivering violently in the cold night air but seemed to be entirely unaware of this judging from the look of very considerable satisfaction on his face rory had other and more agreeable matters on his mind than the temperature he crossed the street followed harlow and mary at a discreet distance until he came to the first road junction he turned right into this and began to run by the time he had arrived back at the hotel he was no longer shivering but sweating profusely for he had not stopped running all the way he slowed down to cross the lobby and mount the stairs went to his room washed combed his hair straightened his tie spent a few moments in front of his mirror practising his sad but dutiful expression until he thought he had it about right then walked across towards his fathers room he knocked received some sort of mumbled reply and went inside james macalpines suite was by any odds the most comfortable in the hotel as a millionaire macalpine could afford to indulge himself as both a man and a millionaire he saw no reason why he shouldnt but macalpine wasnt indulging in any indulgence at that moment nor as he sat far back in an overstuffed armchair did he appear to be savouring any of the creature comforts surrounding him he appeared instead to be sunk in some deep and private gloom from which he roused himself enough to look up almost apathetically as his son closed the door behind him well my boy what is it couldnt it wait until the morning no dad it couldnt out with it then you can see im busy yes dad i know rorys sad but dutiful expression remained in position but theres something i felt i had to tell you he hesitated as if embarrassed at what he was about to say its about johnny harlow dad anything you have to say about harlow will be treated with the greatest reserve despite the words a degree of interest had crept into macalpines thinning features we all know what you think of harlow yes dad i thought of that before i came to see you rory hesitated again you know this thing about johnny harlow dad the stories people are telling about his drinking too much well macalpines tone was wholly noncommittal it was with some difficulty that rory managed to keep his pious expression from slipping this was going to be much more difficult than he expected its true the drinking i mean i saw him in a pub tonight thank you rory you may go he paused were you in that pub too me come on dad i was outside i could see in though spying lad i was passing by a curt but injured tone macalpine waved a hand in dismissal rory turned to go then turned again to face his father maybe i dont like johnny harlow but i do like mary i like her more than any person in the world macalpine nodded he knew this to be true i dont ever want to see her hurt thats why i came to see you she was in that pub with harlow what macalpines face had darkened in immediate anger cut my throat and hope i die you are sure i am sure dad of course im sure nothing wrong with my eyes im sure theres not macalpine said mechanically a little but not much of the anger had left his eyes its just that i dont want to accept it mind you i dont like spying this wasnt spying dad rorys indignation could be of a particularly nauseating righteousness at times this was detective work when the good name of the coronado team is at stake macalpine lifted his hand to stop the spate of words and sighed heavily all right all right you virtuous little monster tell mary i want her now but dont tell her why five minutes later rory had been replaced by a mary who looked simultaneously apprehensive and defiant she said who told you this never mind who told me is it true or not im twentytwo daddy she was very quiet i dont have to answer you i can look after myself can you can you if i were to throw you off the coronado team youve no money and you wont have till im dead youve got no place to go youve no mother now at least no mother you can reach youve no qualifications for anything whos going to employ a cripple without qualifications i would like to hear you say those horrible things to me in front of johnny harlow surprisingly perhaps i wont react to that one i was just as independent at your age more so i guess and taking a poor view of parental authority he paused then went on curiously you in love with this fellow ties not a fellow hes johnny harlow macalpine raised an eyebrow at the intensity in her voice as for your question am i never to be allowed any areas of privacy in my life all right all right macalpine sighed a deal if you answer my questions then ill tell you why im asking them ok she nodded fine true or false if your spies are certain of their facts daddy then why bother asking me mind your tongue the reference to spies had touched macalpine to the raw apologize for saying mind your tongue to me jesus macalpine looked at his daughter in an astonishment that was compounded half of irritation half of admiration you must be my daughter i apologize did he drink yes what i dont know something clear he said it was tonic and water and thats the kind of liar you keep company with tonic and bloody water stay away from him mary if you dont its back home to marseille for you why daddy why why why because god knows ive got enough trouble of my own without having my only daughter tying herself up to an alcoholic with the skids under him johnny alcoholic look daddy i know he drinks a little macalpine silenced her by the gesture of picking up the phone macalpine here will you ask mr dunnet to come to see me yes now he replaced the phone i said id tell you why i was asking those questions i didnt want to but im going to have to dunnet entered and closed the door behind him he had about him the look of a man who was not looking forward too keenly to the next few minutes after asking dunnet to sit down he said tell her alexis would you please dunnet looked even more acutely unhappy must i james im afraid so shed never believe me if i told her what we found in johnnys room mary looked at each in turn sheer incredulity in her face she said you were searching johnnys room dunnet took a deep breath with good reason mary and thank god we did i can still hardly believe it myself we found five bottles of scotch hidden in his room one of them was half empty mary looked at them stricken clearly she believed them all too well when macalpine spoke it was very gently i am sorry we all know how fond you are of him we took the bottles away incidentally you took the bottles away her voice was slow and dull and uncomprehending but hell know hell report the theft therell be police therell be fingerprints your fingerprints then macalpine said can you imagine johnny harlow ever admitting to anyone in the world that hed five bottles of scotch in his room run along girl and get dressed weve got to leave for this bloody reception in twenty minutes without it seems your precious johnny she remained seated her face quite without expression her unblinking eyes irremovably fixed on macalpines after a few moments his expression softened and he smiled he said im sorry that was quite uncalled for dunnet held the door while she hobbled from the room both men watched her go with pity in their eyes chapter five to the grand prix racing fraternity of the world as to seasoned travellers everywhere a hotel is a hotel is a hotel a place to sleep a place to eat a stopover to the next faceless anonymity the newlybuilt villa hotel cessni on the outskirts of monza however could fairly claim to be an exception to the truism superbly designed superbly built and superbly landscaped its huge airy rooms with their immaculately designed furniture their luxurious bathrooms splendidly sweeping balconies sumptuous food and warmth of service here one would have thought was the caravanserai nonpareil for the betterheeled millionaire and so it would be one day but not yet the villahotel cessni had as yet to establish its clientele its image its reputation and hopefully and eventually its traditions and for the achievement of those infinitely desirable ends the fair uses of publicity for luxury hotels as for hotdog stands could be very sweet indeed no sport on earth has a more international following and it was with this in mind that the management had deemed it prudent to invite the major grand prix teams to accommodate themselves in this palace for a ludicrously low nominal fee for the duration of the italian grand prix few teams had failed to accept the invitation and fewer still cared to exercise their minds with the philosophical and psychological motivations of the management all they knew and cared about was that the hotelvilla cessni was infinitely more luxurious and fractionally cheaper than the several austrian hotels they had so gratefully abandoned only twelve days ago next year it seemed likely they wouldnt even be allowed to sleep stacked sixdeep in the basement but that was next year that friday evening late in august was warm but by no means warm enough to justify airconditioning nevertheless the airconditioning in the lobby of the hotelvilla cessni was operating at the top of its bent making the temperature in that luxuriously appointed haven from the lower classes almost uncomfortably cool common sense said that this interior climatic condition was wholly unnecessary the prestige of an up and coming status symbol said that it was wholly necessary the management was concerned with prestige to the point of obsession the airconditioning remained on the cessni was going to be the place to go when the sun rode high macalpine and dunnet sitting side by side but almost concealed from each others sight by virtue of the imposing construction of the vast velvetlined armchairs in which they reclined rather than sat had more important things on their minds than a few degrees of temperature hither and yonder they spoke but seldom and then with a marked lack of animation they gave the air of those who had precious little to get animated about dunnet stirred our wandering boy is late on the road tonight he has an excuse macalpine said at least i hope to hell he has one thing he was always a conscientious workman he wanted a few more extra laps to adjust the suspension and gear ratios of this new car of his dunnet was gloomy it wouldnt have been possible i suppose to give it to tracchia instead quite impossible alexis and you know it the mighty law of protocol johnnys not only coronados number one hes still the worlds our dear sponsors without which we couldnt very well operate i could but ill be damned if ill lay out a fortune like that are highly sensitive people sensitive to public opinion that is the only reason they paint the names of their damned products on the outside of our cars is that the public will go out and buy those same damned products theyre not benefactors of racing except purely incidentally they are simply advertisers an advertiser wants to reach the biggest market ninetynine point repeater nine per cent of that market lies outside the racing world and it doesnt matter a damn if they know nothing about what goes on inside the racing world its what they believe that matters and they believe that harlow still stands alone so harlow gets the best and newest car if he doesnt the public lose their faith in harlow in coronado and in the advertisers and not necessarily in that order ah well the days of miracles may not yet he behind us after all he hasnt been observed or known to take a drink in the past twelve days maybe hes going to surprise us all and theres only two days to go to the italian grand prix so why did he have those two bottles of scotch which you removed from his room only an hour ago i could say he was trying to test his moral fibre but i dont think you would believe it would you frankly james no dunnet relapsed into another period of gloom from which he emerged to say any word from your agents in the south james nothing im afraid alexis ive just about given up hope fourteen weeks now since marie disappeared its too long its just too long had there been an accident i would have heard had there been foul play then im sure i would have heard had i been kidnap and ransomwell thats ridiculous of course i would have heard shes just vanished accident boatingi dont know and weve talked so often about amnesia and ive told you so often without immodesty that no one as well known as marie macalpine no matter what her mental trouble could go missing so long without being picked up i know marys taking that pretty badly now isnt she especially in the past twelve days harlow alexis we broke her heart sorry thats quite unfair i broke her heart in austria if id known how far she was gone ah but id no option taking her to the reception tonight yes i insisted to take her out of herself thats what i tell myself or is it just to ease my conscience again i dont know maybe im making another mistake it seems to me that that young fellow harlow has a great deal to answer for and this is his last chance james any more crazy driving any more fiascos any more drinking then its the chopper thats it thats entirely it macalpine nodded in the direction of the revolving entrance doors think we should tell him now dunnet looked in the direction indicated harlow was walking across the carraramarbled flags he was still clad in his customarily immaculate white racing overalls a young and rather beautiful young girl at the desk smiled at him as he passed by harlow flicked her an expressionless glance and the smile froze he continued on his way across the vast lobby and such is the respect that men accord the gods when they walk the earth that a hundred conversations died as he passed by harlow seemed unaware of the presence of any of them for he looked neither to left nor to right but it was a safe assumption that those remarkable eyes missed nothing an assumption borne out by the fact that apparently without noticing them he veered direction towards where macalpine and dunnet sat macalpine said no scotch or menthol thats for sure otherwise hed avoid me like the plague harlow stood before them he said without any inflection of irony or sarcasm enjoying the quiet evenfall gentlemen macalpine answered you could say that we might enjoy it even more if you could tell us how the new coronado is coming along shaping up jacobson for once agrees with me that a slight alteration in the ratios and the rear suspension is all thats necessary itll be all right for sunday no complaints then no its a fine car best coronado yet and fast how fast i havent found out yet but we equaled the lap record the last two times out well well macalpine looked at his watch better hurry we have to leave for the reception in half an hour im tired im going to have a shower two hours sleep then some dinner ive come here for the grand prix not for mingling with high society you definitely refuse to come i refused to come last time out too setting a precedent if you like its obligatory you know in my vocabulary obligation and compulsion are not the same things there are three or four very important people present tonight especially just to see you i know macalpine paused before speaking how do you know only alexis and i know mary told me harlow turned and walked away well dunnet pressed his lips tightly together the arrogant young bastard walking in here to tell us hes just equalled the lap record without even trying thing is i believe him thats why he stopped by isnt it to tell me that hes still the best in the business partly also to tell me to stuff my bloody reception also to tell me that hell speak to mary whether i like it or not and the final twist to let me know that mary has no secrets from him wheres that damned daughter of mine this should be interesting to see what should be to see if you can break a heart twice macalpine sighed and slumped even farther back in his armchair i suppose youre right alexis i suppose youre right mind you id still like to knock their two damned young heads together harlow clad in a white bathrobe and obviously recently showered emerged from the bathroom and opened up his wardrobe he brought out a fresh suit then reached up to a shelf above it clearly he didnt find what he expected to and his eyebrows lifted he looked in a cupboard with similarly negative results he stood in the middle of the room pondering then smiled widely he said softly well well well here we go again clever devils from the stillsmiling expression on his face it was clear that harlow didnt believe his own words he lifted the mattress reached under removed a flat halfbottle of scotch examined and replaced it from there he went into the bathroom removed the cistern lid lifted out a bottle of glenfiddich malt checked the levelit was about threeparts full replaced it in a certain position and then put the cistern lid back in place this he left slightly askew he returned to his bedroom put on a light grey suit and was just adjusting his tie when he heard the sound of a heavy engine below he switched out the light pulled back the curtains opened his window and peered out cautiously a large coach was drawn up outside the hotel entrance and the various drivers managers senior mechanics and journalists who were headed for the official reception were filing aboard harlow checked to see that all those whose absence that evening he considered highly desirable were among those present and they were dunnet tracchia neubauer jacobson and macalpine the last with a very pale and downcast mary clinging to his arm the door closed and the bus moved off into the night five minutes later harlow sauntered up to the reception desk behind it was the very pretty young girl hed ignored on the way in he smiled widely at her his colleagues wouldnt have believed it and she recovering quickly from the shock of seeing the other side of harlows nature smiled in return almost blushing in embarrassed pleasure for those outside immediate racing circles harlow was still the worlds number one harlow said good evening good evening mr harlow sir the smile faded im afraid youve just missed your bus i have my own private transport the smile came back on again of course mr harlow how silly of me your red ferrari is there something yes please i have four names here macalpine neubauer tracchia and jacobson i wonder if you could give me their room numbers certainly mr harlow but im afraid those gentlemen have all just left i know i waited until they had left i dont understand sir i just want to slip something under their doors an old prerace custom you race drivers and your practical jokes shed almost certainly never seen a race driver until that evening but that didnt prevent her from giving him a look of roguish understanding the numbers you want are and thats in the order of the names i gave you yes sir thank you harlow touched a finger to his lips now not a word of course not mr harlow she smiled conspiratorially at him as he turned away harlow had a sufficiently realistic assessment of his own fame to appreciate that she would talk for months about this brief encounter just as long as she didnt talk until that weekend was over he returned to his own room took a movie camera from a suitcase unscrewed its back carefully scratching the dull metallic black as he did so removed the plate and pulled out a small miniaturized camera not much larger than a packet of cigarettes he pocketed this rescrewed in place the back plate of the movie camera replaced it in his suitcase and looked thoughtfully at the small canvas bag of tools that lay there tonight he would not require those where he was going he knew where to find all the tools and flashlights he wanted he took the bag with him and left the room he moved along the corridor to room macalpines room unlike macalpine harlow did not have to resort to devious means to obtain hotel room keys he had some excellent sets of keys himself he selected one of these and with the fourth key the door opened he entered and locked the door behind him having disposed of the canvas bag in the highest and virtually unreachable shelf in a wall wardrobe harlow proceeded to search the room thoroughly nothing escaped his scrutiny macalpines clothing wardrobes cupboards suitcases finally he came across a locked suitcase so small as to be almost a briefcase fastened with locks that were very strong and peculiar indeed but harlow also had a set of very small and peculiar keys opening the small suitcase presented no difficulty whatsoever the interior held a kind of small travelling office containing as it did a mass of papers including invoices receipts chequebooks and contracts the owner of the coronado team obviously served as his own accountant harlow ignored everything except an elasticbound bunch of expired chequebooks he flipped through those quickly then stopped and stared at the front few pages of one of the chequebooks where all the payments were recorded together he examined all four recording pages closely shook his head in evident disbelief pursed his lips in a soundless whistle brought out his miniature camera and took eight pictures two of each page this done he returned everything as he had found it and left the corridor was deserted harlow moved down to tracchias room and used the same key to enter as he had on macalpines door hotel room keys have only marginal differences as they have to accommodate a master key what harlow had was in fact a master key as tracchia had considerably fewer possessions than macalpine the search was correspondingly easier again harlow encountered another but smaller briefcase the opening of which again provided him with the minimum of difficulty there were but few papers inside and harlow found little of interest among them except a thin book bound in black and red of what appeared to be a list of extremely cryptic addresses each address if address it were was headed by a single letter followed by two or three wholly indecipherable lines of letters it could have meant something it could have meant nothing harlow hesitated obviously in a state of indecision shrugged brought out his camera and photographed the pages he left tracchias room in as immaculate a condition as he had left macalpines two minutes later in harlow sitting on neubauers bed with a briefcase on his lap was no longer hesitating the miniature camera clicked busily away the thin black and red notebook he held in his hand was identical to the one he had found in tracchias possession from there harlow moved on to the last of his four objectives jacobsons room jacobson it appeared was either less discreet or less sophisticated than either tracchia or neubauer he had two bankbooks and when harlow opened them he sat quite still jacobsons income it appeared from them amounted to at least twenty times as much as he could reasonably expect to earn as a chief mechanic inside one of the books was a list of addresses in plain english scattered all over europe all those details harlow faithfully recorded on his little camera he replaced the papers in the case and the case in its original position and was on the point of leaving when he heard footsteps in the corridor he stood irresolute until the footsteps came to a halt outside his door he pulled a handkerchief from his pocket and was about to use it as a mask when a key turned in the lock harlow had time only to move swiftly and silently into a wardrobe pulling the door quietly to behind him when the corridor door opened and someone entered the room from where harlow was all was total darkness he could hear someone moving around the room but had no idea from the sound as to what the source of the activity might be for all he could tell someone might have been engaged in exactly the same pursuit as he himself had been a minute ago working purely by feel he folded his handkerchief cornerwise adjusted the straight edge to a point just below his eyes and knotted the handkerchief behind the back of his head the wardrobe door opened and harlow was confronted with the spectacle of a portly middleaged chambermaid carrying a bolster in her hands shed obviously just been changing it for the nighttime pillows she in turn was confronted with the shadowy menacing figure of a man in a white mask the chambermaids eyes turned up in her head soundlessly without even as much as a sigh she swayed and crumpled slowly towards the floor harlow stepped out caught her before she hit the marble tiles and lowered her gently using the bolster as a pillow he moved quickly towards the opened corridor door closed it removed his handkerchief and proceeded to wipe all the surfaces he had touched including the top and handle of the briefcase finally he took the telephone off the hook and left it lying on the table he left pulling the door to behind him but not quite closing it he passed swiftly along the corridor descended the stairs at a leisurely pace went to the bar and ordered himself a drink the barman looked at him in what came to being open astonishment you said what sir double gin and tonic is what i said yes mr harlow very good mr harlow as impassively as he could die barman prepared the drink which harlow took to a wall seat situated between two potted plants he looked across the lobby with interest there were some signs of unusual activity at the telephone switchboard where the girl operator was showing increasing signs of irritation a light on her board kept flashing on and off but she was obviously having no success in contacting the room number in question finally clearly exasperated she beckoned a page boy and said something in a low voice the page boy nodded and crossed the lobby at the properly sedate pace in keeping with the advertised ambience of the hotelvilla cessna when he returned it was at anything but a sedate pace he ran across the lobby and whispered something urgently to the operator she left her seat and only seconds later no less a personage than the manager himself appeared and hurried across the lobby harlow waited patiently pretending to sip his drink from time to time he knew that most people in the lobby were covertly studying him but was unconcerned from where they sat he was drinking a harmless lemonade or tonic water the barman of course knew better and it was as certain as that nights sundown that one of the first things that macalpine would do on his return would be to ask for johnny harlows drink bill on the convincing enough pretext that it was inconceivable for the champion to put his hand in his pocket for anything the manager reappeared moving with most unmanagerial haste in a sort of disciplined trot reached the desk and busied himself with the telephone the entire lobby was now agog with interest and expectation their undivided attention had now been transferred from harlow to the front desk and harlow took advantage of this to tip the contents of his glass into a potted plant he rose and sauntered across the lobby as if heading for the front revolving doors his route brought him past the side of the manager harlow broke step he said sympathetically trouble grave trouble mr harlow very grave the manager had the phone to his ear obviously waiting for a call to come through but it was still apparent that he was flattered that johnny harlow should take time off to speak to him burglars assassins one of our chambermaids has been most brutally and savagely assaulted good god where mr jacobsons room jacobsons but hes only our chief mechanic hes got nothing worth stealing ah like enough mr harlow but the burglar wasnt to know that was he harlow said anxiously i hope she was able to identify her attacker impossible all she remembers is a masked giant jumping out of a wardrobe and attacking her he was carrying a club she said he put his hand over the mouthpiece excuse me the police harlow turned exhaled a long slow sigh of relief walked away passed out through the revolving doors turned right and then right again reentered the hotel through one of the side doors and made his way unobserved back up to his own room here he withdrew the sealed film cassette from his miniature camera replaced it with a fresh one or one that appeared to be fresh unscrewed the back of his cinecamera inserted the miniature and screwed home the back plate of the cinecamera for good measure he added a few more scratches to the dulled black metal finish the original cassette he put in an envelope wrote on it his name and room number took it down to the desk where the more immediate signs of panic appeared to be over asked that it be put in the safe and returned to his room an hour later harlow his more conventional wear now replaced by a navy rollneck pullover and leather jacket sat waiting patiently on the edge of his bed for the second time that night he heard the sound of a heavy diesel motor outside for the second time that night he switched off the light pulled the curtains opened the window and looked out the reception party bus had returned he pulled the curtains to again switched on the light removed the flat bottle of scotch from under the mattress rinsed his mouth with some of it and left he was descending the foot of the stairs as the reception party entered the lobby mary reduced to only one stick now was on her fathers arm but when macalpine saw harlow he handed her to dunnet mary looked at harlow quietly and steadily but her face didnt say anything harlow made to brush by but macalpine barred his way macalpine said the mayor was very vexed and displeased by your absence harlow seemed totally unconcerned by the mayors reactions he said ill bet he was the only one you remember you have some practice laps first thing in the morning im the person who has to do them is it likely that i would forget harlow made to move by macalpine but the latter blocked his way again macalpine said where are you going out i forbid you youll forbid me nothing that isnt in my contract harlow left dunnet looked at macalpine and sniffed air is a bit thick isnt it we missed something macalpine said wed better go and see what it was we missed mary looked at them in turn so youve already searched his room when he was put on the track and now that his back is turned again youre going to search it again despicable utterly despicable youre nothing better than a couple of a couple of sneakthieves she pulled her arm away from dunnet leave me alone i can find my own room both men watched her limp across the foyer dunnet said complainingly considering the issues involved life or death issues if you like i do consider that a rather unreasonable attitude so is love macalpine sighed so is love harlow descending the hotel steps brushed by neubauer and tracchia not only did he not speak to them for they still remained on courtesy terms he didnt even appear to see them both men turned and looked after harlow he was walking with that overerect overstiff posture of the slightly inebriated who are making too good a job of trying to pretend that all is well even as they watched harlow made one barely perceptible and clearly unpremeditated stagger to one side but quickly recovered and was back on an overstraight course again neubauer and tracchia exchanged glances nodded to each other briefly just once neubauer went into the hotel while tracchia moved off after harlow the earlier warm night air had suddenly begun to chill the coolness being accompanied by a slight drizzle this was to tracchias advantage citydwellers are notoriously averse to anything more than a slight humidity in the atmosphere and although the hotelvilla cessni was situated in what was really nothing more than a small village the same urban principle applied with the first signs of rain the streets began to clear rapidly the danger of losing harlow among crowds of people decreased almost to nothingness the rain increased steadily until finally tracchia was following harlow through almost deserted streets this of course increased the chances of detection should harlow choose to cast a backward glance but it became quickly evident that harlow had no intention of casting any backward glances he had about him the fixed and determined air of a man who was heading for a certain objective and backward glances were no part of his forwardlooking plans tracchia sensing this began to move up closer until he was no more than ten yards behind harlow harlows behaviour was becoming steadily more erratic he had lost his ability to pursue a straight line and was beginning to weave noticeably on one occasion he staggered in against a recessed doorway shop window and tracchia caught a glimpse of harlows reflected face head shaking and eyes apparently closed but he pushed himself off and went resolutely if unsteadily on his way tracchia closed up even more his face registering an expression of mingled amusement contempt and disgust the expression deepened as harlow his condition still deteriorating lurched round a street corner to his left temporarily out of tracchias line of vision harlow all signs of insobriety vanished moved rapidly into the first darkened doorway round the corner from a back pocket he withdrew an article not normally carried by racing drivers a woven leather blackjack with a wrist thong harlow slipped the thong over his hand and waited he had little enough time to wait as tracchia rounded the corner the contempt on his face gave way to consternation when he saw that the illlit street ahead was empty anxiously he increased his pace and within half a dozen paces was passing by the shadowed and recessed doorway where harlow waited a grand prix driver needs timing accuracy and eyesight all of those harlow had in superabundance also he was extremely fit tracchia lost consciousness instantly without as much as a glance at it harlow stepped over the prostrate body and strode briskly on his way only it wasnt the way he had been going he retraced his tracks for about a quarter of a mile turned left and almost at once found himself in the transporter parking lot it seemed extremely unlikely that tracchia when he came to would have even the slightest idea as to where harlow had been headed harlow made directly for the nearest transporter even through the rain and near darkness the name in two feet high golden letters was easily distinguishable coronado he unlocked the door passed inside and switched on the lights and very powerful lights they were too as they had to be for mechanics working on such delicate engineering here there was no need for glowing red lights stealth and secrecy there was no one who was going to question johnny harlows right to be inside his own transporter nevertheless he took the precaution of locking the door from the inside and leaving the key halfturned in the lock so that it couldnt be opened from the outside then he used ply to mask the windows so that he couldnt be seen from outside only then did he make for the toolrack on the side and select the implements he wanted macalpine and dunnet not for the first time were illegally in harlows room and not feeling too happy about it not about the illegality but what they had found there more precisely they were in harlows bathroom dunnet had the cistern cover in his hand while macalpine held up a dripping bottle of malt whisky both men regarded each other at a momentary loss for words then dunnet said resourceful lad is our johnny hes probably got a crate hidden under the driving seat of his coronado but i think youd better leave that bottle where you found it why ever should i whats the point in that that way we may know his daily consumption if he cant get it from that bottle hell sure as hell get it elsewhere you know his uncanny way of vanishing in that red ferrari of his and then well never know how much he drinks i suppose so i suppose so he looked at the bottle and there was pain in his eyes the most gifted driver of our time perhaps the most gifted driver of all time and now its come to this why do the gods strike a man like johnny harlow down alexis because hes beginning to walk too close to them put the bottle back james only two doors away was another pair of unhappy men one of them markedly so tracchia from the incessant way in which he massaged the back of his neck appeared to be in very considerable pain neubauer watched him with a mixture of sympathy and anger neubauer said sure it was that bastard harlow im sure ive still got my wallet that was careless of him i think ill lose my room key and borrow the master tracchia momentarily ceased to massage his aching neck what the hell for youll see stay here neubauer returned within two minutes a key ring whirling round his finger he said im taking the blonde at reception out on sunday night i think ill ask for the keys of the safe next time tracchia said in agonized patience willi there is a time and a place for comedy sorry he opened the door and they passed out into the corridor it was deserted less than ten seconds later they were both inside harlows room the door locked behind them tracchia said what happens if harlow comes along who would you rather be harlow or us they had spent no more than a minute in searching when neubauer suddenly said you were quite right nikki our dear friend johnny is just that little bit careless he showed tracchia the cinecamera with the crisscross of scratches round each of the four screws securing the plate at the back produced a pocketknife selected a small screwdriver removed the plate and extracted the micro camera neubauer then extracted the cassette from the micro camera and examined it thoughtfully he said we take this tracchia shook his head and instantly screwed up his face in the agony caused by the thoughtless movement when he had recovered he said no he would have known we were here neubauer said so theres only one thing for it then tracchia nodded and again winced in pain neubauer lifted off the cover of the cassette unreeled the film and passed it under a strong desk lamp then not without some difficulty rewound the film replaced the cover put the cassette back in the micro camera and the micro camera in the cine tracchia said this proves nothing we contact marseilles neubauer nodded both men left the room harlow had a coronado pushed back by about a foot he peered at the section of floorboard revealed reached for a powerful torch knelt and examined the floor intently one of the longitudinal planks appeared to have two transverse lines on it about fifteen inches apart harlow used an oily cloth to rub the front line whereupon it became evident that the front line was no line at all but a very fine sharp cut the revealed heads of the two holding nails were bright and clear of any marks harlow brought a chisel to bear and the front of the inlet wooden section lifted with surprising ease he reached down an arm to explore the depth and length of the space beneath a fractional lifting of the eyebrows expressed some degree of surprise almost certainly as to the unseen extent of area available harlow brought out his arm and touched fingertips to mouth and nose there was no perceptible change in his expression he replaced the board section and gently tapped it into place using the butt of a chisel on the gleaming nailheads with a suitably oiled and dirty cloth he smeared the cuts and nails fortyfive minutes had elapsed between the time of harlows departure from the villahotel cessni and his return there the vast foyer looked semideserted but there must n fact have been over a hundred people there many of them from the official reception party all of them probably waiting to go in for late dinner the first two people harlow saw were macalpine and dunnet sitting alone at a small table with short drinks two tables away mary sat by herself a soft drink and a magazine in front of her she didnt give the impression of reading and there was a certain stiff aloofness in her bearing harlow wondered towards whom the hostility was directed towards himself likely enough but on the other hand there had grown up an increasing estrangement between mary on the one hand and macalpine on the other of rory there was no sign probably out spying somewhere harlow thought the three of them caught sight of harlow at almost the same instant as he saw them macalpine immediately rose to his feet id be grateful alexis if you could take mary in to dinner im going into the diningroom im afraid if i were to stay its all right james i understand harlow watched the calculated snub of the departing back without expression an absence of outward feeling that quickly changed to a certain apprehension as he saw mary bearing down on him no question now as to whom the unspokenhostility had been directed she gave the very distinct impression of having been waiting for him that bewitching smile that had made her the sweetheart of the racetracks was harlow observed in marked abeyance he braced himself for what he knew was going to be a low but correspondingly fierce voice must you let everybody see you like this and in a place like this harlow frowned in puzzlement youve been at it again he said thats right go ahead wound an innocent mans feelings you have my worded bond i mean my bonded word its disgusting sober men dont fall flat on their faces in the street look at the state of your clothes your filthy hands go on just look at yourself harlow looked at himself oh aha well sweet dreams sweet mary he turned towards the stairs took five steps and halted abruptly when confronted by dunnet for a moment the two men looked at each other faces immobile then there was an almost imperceptible lift of dunnets eyebrow when harlow spoke his voice was very quiet he said we go now the coronado yes we go now chapter six harlow drained his coffee it was by now his invariable custom to breakfast alone in his bedroom and crossed to the window the famed italian september sun was nowhere to be seen that morning the overcast was very heavy but the ground was dry and the visibility excellent a combination making for ideal racetrack conditions he went into the bathroom opened the window to its fullest extent removed the cistern cover took out the scotch turned on the hot water tap and systematically poured half the contents of the bottle into the basin he returned the bottle to its hidingplace sprayed the room very heavily with an airfresh aerosol and left he drove alone to the racetrack the passenger seat in his red ferrari was rarely occupied nowto find jacobson his two mechanics and dunnet already there he greeted them briefly and in very short order overailed and helmeted was sitting in the cockpit of his new coronado jacobson favoured him with his usual grimly despondent look he said i hope you can give us good practice laptime today johnny harlow said mildly i thought i didnt do too badly yesterday however one can but try with his finger on the starter button he glanced at dunnet and where is our worthy employer today never known him to miss a practice lap before in the hotel he has things to attend to macalpine did indeed have things to attend to what he was attending to at that moment had by this time become almost a routine chore investigating the current level of harlows alcohol supply as soon as he entered harlows bathroom he realized that checking the level of scotch in the bottle in the cistern was going to be a mere formality the wide open window and the air heavy with the scent of the aerosol spray made further investigation almost superfluous however investigate he did even though he had been almost certain what to expect his face still darkened with anger as he held the half empty bottle up for inspection he replaced the bottle left harlows room almost at a run actually ran across the hotel foyer climbed into his aston and drove off in a fashion that might well have left the astonished onlookers with the impression that he had mistaken the forecourt of the villahotel cessni for the monza circuit macalpine was still running when he arrived at the coronado pits there he encountered dunnet who was just leaving them macalpine was panting heavily he said wheres that young bastard harlow dunnet did not reply at once he seemed more concerned with shaking his head slowly from side to side gods sake man wheres that drunken layabout macalpines voice was almost a shout he mustnt be allowed anywhere near that damned track theres a lot of other drivers in monza who would agree with you whats that meant to mean it means that that drunken layabout has just broken the lap record by two point one seconds dunnet continued to shake his head in continued disbelief bloody well incredible two point one two point one two point one it was macalpines turn to take up the headshaking impossible a margin like that impossible ask the timekeepers he did it twice jesus you dont seem as pleased as you might james pleased im bloody well terrified sure sure hes still the best driver in the worldexcept in actual competition when his nerve goes but it wasnt driving skill that took him around in that time it was dutch courage sheer bloody suicidal dutch courage i dont understand you hed a halfbottle of scotch inside him alexis dunnet stared at him he said at length i dont believe k i cant believe it he may have driven like a bat out of hell but he also drove like an angel half a bottle of scotch hed have killed himself perhaps its as well there was no one else on the track at the time hed have killed them maybe but but a whole halfbottle want to come and have a look in the cistern in his bathroom no no you think id ever question your word its just that i cant understand it nor can i nor can i and where is our world champion at the moment left the track says hes through for the day says hes got the pole position for tomorrow and if anyone takes it from him hell just come back and take it away from them again hes in an uppish sort of mood today is our johnny and he never used to talk that way thats not uppishness alexis its sheer bloody euphoria dancing on clouds of seventy proof god almighty do i have a problem or do i have a problem you have a problem james on the afternoon of that same saturday macalpine had he been in a certain rather shabby little side street in monza might well have had justification for thinking that his problems were being doubly or trebly compounded two highly undistinguished little cafes faced each other across the narrow street they had in common the same peeling paint facade hanging reed curtains chequered clothcovered sidewalk tables and bare functional and splendidly uninspired interiors and both of them as was so common in cafes of this type featured highbacked booths facing endon to the street sitting well back from the window in such a booth on the southern and shaded side of the street were neubauer and tracchia with untouched drinks in front of them the drinks were untouched because neither man was interested in them their entire interest was concentrated upon the cafe opposite where close up to the window and clearly in view harlow and dunnet glasses in their hands could be seen engaged in what appeared to be earnest discussion across their booth table neubauer said well now that weve followed them here nikki what do we do now i mean you cant lipread can you we wait and see we play it by ear t wish to god t could lipread willi and id also like to know why those two have suddenly become so friendly though they hardly ever speak nowadays in public and why did they have to come to a little back street like this to talk we know that harlow is up to something very funny indeed the back of my neck still feels halfbroken i could hardly get my damned helmet on today and if he and dunnet are so thick then theyre both up to the same funny thing but dunnets only a journalist what can a journalist and a hasbeen driver be up to hasbeen did you see his times this morning hasbeen i said and hasbeen i meant youll see hell crack tomorrow just as hes cracked in the last four gps yes another strangething why is he so good in practice and such a failure in the races themselves no question its common knowledge that harlows pretty close to being an alcoholic id say he already is one all right so he can drive one fast lap maybe three but in an eightylap grand prix how can you expect an alco to have the stamina the reactions the nerve to last the pace hell crack he looked away from the other cafe and took a morose sip of his drink god what wouldnt i give to be sitting in the next booth to those two tracchia laid a hand on neubauers forearm maybe that wont be necessary willi maybe weve just found a pair of ears to do our listening for us look neubauer looked with what appeared to be a considerable degree of stealth and secrecy rory macalpine was edging his way into the booth next to the one occupied by harlow and dunnet he was carrying a coloured drink in his hand when he sat it was with his back to harlow physically they couldnt have been more than a foot apart rory adopted a very upright posture both his back and the back of his head pressed hard against the partition he was clearly listening very intently indeed he had about him the look of one who was planning a career either as a master spy or a double agent without question he had a rare talent for observing and listening without being observed neubauer said what do you think young macalpine is up to here and now tracchia spread his hands anything the one thing that you can be sure of is that he intends no good to harlow i should think he is just trying to get anything he can on harlow just anything hes a determined young devil and he hates harlow i must say i wouldnt care very much myself to be in his black books so we have an ally nikki yes i see no reason why not lets think up a nice little story to tell him he peered across the street young rory doesnt seem too pleased about something rory wasnt his expression held mixed feelings of vexation exasperation and perplexity because of the high back of the booth and the background noise level created by the other patrons of the cafe he could catch only snatches of the conversation from the next booth matters werent helped for rory by the fact that harlow and dunnet were carrying on this conversation in very low tones indeed both of them had tall clear drinks in front of them both drinks with ice and lemon in them only one held gin dunnet looked consideringly at the tiny film cassette he was cradling in the palm of his hand then slipped it into a safe inside pocket photographs of code youre sure code for sure perhaps even along with some abstruse foreign language im afraid im no expert on those matters no more than i am but we have people who are experts and the coronado transporter youre sure about that too no question so weve been nursing a viper to our own bosom if thats the phrase im looking for it is a bit embarrassing isnt it and no question about henry having any finger in the pie henry harlow shook his head positively my life on it even though as driver hes the only person whos with the transporter on every trip it makes even though and henry will have to go what option do we have so exit henry temporarily though he wont know it hell get his old job back hell be hurt of course but whats one brief hurt to thousands of lifelong ones and if he refuses ill have him kidnapped dunnet said matteroffactly or otherwise removed painlessly of course but hell go along ive got the doctors certificate already signed how about medical ethics the combination of ј and a genuine certificate of an already existing heart murmur makes medical scruples vanish like a snowflake in the river the two men finished their drinks rose and left so after what he presumably regarded as being a suitably safe interval did rory in the cafe opposite neubauer and tracchia rose hurriedly walked quickly after rory and overtook him in half a minute rory looked his surprise tracchia said confidentially we want to talk to you rory can you keep a secret rory looked intrigued but he had a native caution which seldom abandoned him whats the secret about you are a suspicious young person whats the secret about johnny harlow thats different tracchia had rorys instantaneous and cooperative attention of course i can keep a secret neubauer said well then never a whisper never one word or youll ruin everything you understand of course he hadnt the faintest idea what neubauer was talking about youve heard of the gpda course the grand prix drivers association right well the gpda has decided that for the safety of us all drivers and spectators alike harlow must be removed from the grand prix roster we want him taken off all the racetracks in europe you know that he drinks who doesnt he drinks so much that hes become the most dangerous driver in europe neubauers voice was lowpitched conspiratorial and totally convincing every other driver is scared to be on the same track as he is none of us knows when hes going to be the next jethou youyou mean he was drunk at the time thats why a good man dies rorybecause another man drinks half a bottle of scotch too many would you call that much different from being a murderer no by god i wouldnt so the gpda has asked willi and myself to gather die evidence about drinking i mean especially before a big race will you help us you have to ask me we know boy we know neubauer put his hand on rorys shoulder a gesture at once indicative of consolation and understanding mary is our girl too you saw harlow and mr dunnet in that cafe just now did harlow drink i didnt really see them i was in the next booth but i heard mr dunnet say something about gin and i saw the waiter bring two tall glasses with what looked like water in them water tracchia shook his head sadly anyway thats more like it though i cant believe that dunnet well who knows did you hear them talk about drink mr dunnet is there something wrong with him too tracchia said evasively well aware that that was the surest way of arousing rorys interest i dont know anything about mr dunnet about drink now they spoke in very low voices i caught something not much not about drink the only thing i heard was something about changed cassettes film cassettes or suchlike something harlow had given to mr dunnet didnt make any kind of sense to me tracchia said that hardly concerns us but the rest yes keep your eyes and ears open will you rory carefully concealing his newfound sense of selfimportance nodded man to man and walked away neubauer and tracchia looked at each other with fury in their faces a fury clearly that was not directed at each other through tightly clenched teeth tracchia said the crafty bastard hes switched cassettes on us that was a dud we destroyed on the evening of that same day dunnet and henry sat in a remote corner of the lobby in the villahotel cessni dunnet wore his usual nearinscrutable expression henry looked somewhat stunned although it was clear that his native shrewdness was hard at work making a reassessment of an existing situation and a readjustment to a developing one he tried hard not to look cunning he said you certainly do know how to lay it on the line dont you mr dunnet the tone of respectful admiration for a higher intellect was perfectly done dunnet remained totally unmoved if by laying it on the line henry you mean putting it as briefly and clearly as possible then yes i have laid it on the line yes or no jesus mr dunnet you dont give a man much time to think do you dunnet said patiently this hardly calls for thought henry a simple yes or no take it or leave it henry kept his cunning look under wraps and if i leave it well cross that bridge when we come to it henry looked distinctly uneasy i dont know if i like the sound of that mr dunnet how does it sound to you henry i mean well you arent blackmailing me or threatening me or something like that dunnet had the air of a man counting up to ten you make me say it henry youre talking rubbish how can one blackmail a man who leads the spotless life you do you do lead a spotless life dont you henry and why should i threaten you how could i threaten you he made a long pause yes or no henry sighed in defeat damn it all yes ive got nothing to lose for ј and a job in our marseilles garage id sell my own grandmother down the river god rest her soul that wouldnt be necessary even if it were possible just total silence thats all heres a health certificate from a local doctor its to say you have an advanced cardiac condition and are no longer fit for heavy work such as say driving a transporter i havent been feeling at all well lately and thats a fact dunnet permitted himself the faintest of smiles i thought you might have been feeling that way does mr macalpine know about this he will when you tell him just wave that paper you think hell wear it if you mean accept it yes hell have no option may i ask the reason for all this no youre getting paid ј not to ask questions or talk ever youre a very funny journalist mr dunnet very im told you were an accountant in what they call the city why did you give it up emphysema my lungs henry my lungs something like my cardiac condition in these days of stress and strain henry perfect health is a blessing that is granted to very few of us and now youd better go and see mr macalpine henry left dunnet wrote a brief note addressed a stout buff envelope marked it express and urgent in the top left corner inserted the note and microfilm and left as he passed out into the corridor he failed to notice that the door of the room next to his was slightly ajar consequently he also failed to observe a single eye peering out through this narrow gap in the doorway the eye belonged to tracchia he closed the door moved out on to his balcony and waved an arm in signal in the distance far beyond the forecourt of the hotel an indistinct figure raised an arm in acknowledgment tracchia hurried downstairs and located neubauer together they moved towards the bar and sat there ordering soft drinks at least a score of people saw and recognized them for neubauer and tracchia were scarcely less well known that harlow himself but tracchia was not a man to establish an alibi by halves he said to the barman im expecting a call from milan at five oclock what time do you have exactly five mr tracchia let the desk know im here the direct route to the post office lay through a narrow alleyway lined with mewstype houses and alternate garages on both sides the road was almost deserted a fact that dunnet attributed to its being a saturday afternoon in all its brief length of less than two hundred yards there was only an overalled figure working over the engine of his car outside the opened door of a garage in a fashion more french than italian he wore a navy beret down to his eyes and the rest of his face was so streaked with oil and grease as to be virtually unrecognizable he wouldnt dunnet thought inconsequentially have been tolerated for five seconds on die coronado racing team but then working on a coronado and on a battered old fiat called for different standards of approach as dunnet passed the fiat the mechanic abruptly straightened dunnet politely sidestepped to avoid him but as he did so the mechanic one leg braced against the side of the car to lend additional leverage for a takeoff thrust flung his entire bodily weight against him completely offbalance and already falling dunnet staggered through the opened garage doorway his already headlong process towards the ground was rapidly and violently accelerated by two very large and very powerful stockingmasked figures who clearly held no brief for the more gentle arts of persuasion the garage door closed behind him rory was absorbed in a lurid comic magazine and tracchia and neubauer alibis safely established were still at the bar when dunnet entered the hotel it was an entry that attracted the immediate attention of everyone in the foyer for it was an entry that would have attracted such attention anywhere dunnet didnt walk in he staggered in like a drunken man and even then would have fallen were it not for the fact that he was supported by a policeman on either side of him he was bleeding badly from nose and mouth had a rapidly closing right eye an unpleasant gash above it and generally a badly bruised face tracchia neubauer rory and the receptionist reached him at almost the same moment the shock in tracchias voice marched perfectly with the expression on his face he said god in heaven mr dunnet what happened to you dunnet tried to smile winced and thought better of it he said in a slurred voice i rather think i was set upon neubauer said but who did i mean where why mr dunnet why one of the policemen held up his hand and turned to the receptionist please at once a doctor in one minute less we have seven staying here she turned to tracchia you know mr dunnets room mr tracchia if you and mr neubauer would be so kind as to show the officers no need mr neubauer and i will take him up the policeman said im sorry we will require a statement from he halted as most people did when they were on the receiving end of tracchias most intimidating scowl he said leave your station number with this young lady you will be called when the doctor gives mr dunnet permission to talk not before meantime he must get to bed immediately do you understand they understood nodded and left without another word tracchia and neubauer followed by a rory whose puzzlement was matched only by his apprehension took dunnet to his room and were in the process of putting him to bed when a doctor arrived he was young italian clearly highly efficient and extremely polite when he asked them to leave the room in the corridor rory said why would anyone do that to mr dunnet who knows tracchia said robbers thieves people who would sooner rob and halfkill than do an honest days work he flicked a glance at neubauer one that rory was not intended to miss there are lots of unpleasant people in the world rory lets leave it to the police shall we you mean that youre not going to bother were drivers my boy neubauer said were not detectives im not a boy ill soon be seventeen and im not a fool rory brought his anger under control and looked at them speculatively theres something very fishy very funny going on ill bet harlow is mixed up in this somewhere barlow tracchia raised an amused eyebrow in a fashion that was little to rorys liking come off it rory you were the person who overheard harlow and dunnet having their confidential little stecitete aha thats just the point i didnt overhear what they said i just heard their voices not what they said they could have been saying anything maybe harlow was threatening him rory paused to consider this fresh and intriguing prospect and conviction burgeoned on the instant of course that was what it was harlow was threatening him because dunnet was either doublecrossing or blackmailing him tracchia said kindly rory you really must give up reading those horror comics of yours even if dunnet were doublecrossing or blackmailing harlow how would beating up dunnet help in any way hes still around isnt he he can still carry on this doublecrossing or blackmailing of yours im afraid youll have to come up with a better one than that rory rory said slowly maybe i can dunnet did say he was beaten up in that narrow alleyway leading towards the main street do you know what lies at the far end of the alleyway the post office maybe dunnet was going down there to dispose of some evidence he had on harlow maybe he thought it was too dangerous to carry that evidence around with him any more so harlow made good and sure that dunnet never got the chance to post it neubauer looked at tracchia then back at rory he wasnt smiling any more he said what kind of evidence rory how should i know rorys irritation was marked ive been doing all the thinking up till now how about you two trying to do a little thinking for once we might just at that tracchia like neubauer was now suddenly serious and thoughtful now dont go talking around about this lad apart from the fact that we havent a single shred of proof theres such a thing as the law of libel ive told you once rory said with some acerbity im not a fool besides it wouldnt look too good for you two if it was known that you were trying to put the finger on johnny harlow that you can say again tracchia said bad news travels fast here comes mr macalpine macalpine arrived at the head of the stairs his face much thinner now and far more deeply lined than it had been two months previously was grim and tight with anger he said this is true i mean about dunnet tracchia said im afraid so some person or persons have given him a pretty thorough going over in gods name why robbery it looks like robbery in broad daylight jesus the sweet joys of civilization when did this happen couldnt have been much more than ten minutes ago willi and i were at the bar when he went out it was exactly five oclock because i happened to be checking a phone call with the barman at the time we were at the bar when he came back and when he came back i checked my watch thought it might be useful for the police to know it was exactly twelve minutes past five he couldnt have got very far in that time where is he now there in his room then why are you three doctors in there with him he threw us out he will not macalpine predicted with certainty throw me out nor did he five minutes later it was the doctor who was the first to emerge followed in another five by macalpine his face at once thunderous and deeply worried he went straight to his own room tracchia neubauer and rory were sitting by a wall table in the foyer when harlow entered if he saw them he paid no heed but walked straight across the length of the foyer to the stairs he smiled faintly once or twice in response to tentative approaches and deferential smiles of greeting but otherwise his face remained its normal impassive self neubauer said well you must admit that our johnny doesnt look all that concerned about life you bet he doesnt rory could not have been accused of snarling because he hadnt yet mastered the art but he was obviously getting close ill bet hes not very concerned about death either ill bet if it was his own grandmother hed rory tracchia held up a restraining hand youre letting your imagination run wild the grand prix drivers association is a very respectable body of men we have what people call a good public image and we dont want to spoil it sure we like to have you on our side but wild talk like this can only damage everyone concerned rory scowled at each man in turn rose and walked stiffly away neubauer said almost sadly im afraid nikki that our young firebrand there is shortly about to experience some of the most painful moments of his life itll do him no harm tracchia said and it certainly wont do us any either neubauers prophecy was confirmed in remarkably short order harlow closed the door behind him and looked down at the prostrate figure of dunnet who although he had been duly and efficiently doctored had a face that looked as if it had emerged from a major road accident within the past few minutes allowing for the areas covered by bruises and a variety of plasters there was in all conscience little enough of his face to be seen just a nose double its usual size a completelyclosed rainbowcoloured right eye and stitches on the forehead and upper lip but sufficient to lend credence to his recent life and hard times harlow clucked his tongue in the usual sympathetic if rather perfunctory fashion took two silent steps towards the door and jerked it open rory literally fell into the room and measured his length on the splendid marble tiles of the villahotel cessni wordlessly harlow bent over him wound his fingers in rorys thick black curling hair and hauled him to his feet rory had no words either just a piercing heartfelt scream of agony still without speaking harlow transferred his grip to rorys ear marched him along the corridor to macalpines room knocked and went inside dragging rory with him tears of pain rolled down the unhappy rorys face macalpine lying on top of his bed propped himself up on one elbow his outrage that his only son should be so cruelly mishandled was clearly outweighed by the fact that it was harlow who was doing the mishandling harlow said i know im not very much in the grace and favour line with coronado at the moment i also know he is your son but the next time i find this spying young tramp eavesdropping outside the door of a room im in ill well and truly clobber him macalpine looked at harlow then at rory then back to harlow i cant believe it i wont believe it the voice was flat and singularly lacking in conviction i dont care whether you believe me or not harlows anger had gone hed slipped on his old mask of indifference but i know you would believe alexis dunnet go and ask him i was with him in his room when i opened the door a bit unexpectedly for our young friend here he had been leaning so heavily against it that he fell flat to the floor i helped him up by his hair thats why theres tears in his eyes macalpine looked at rory in a less than paternal fashion is this true rory wiped his sleeve across his eyes concentrated sullenly on the examination of the toes of his shoes and prudently said nothing leave him to me johnny macalpine didnt look particularly angry or upset just very very tired my apologies if i seemed to doubt you i didnt harlow nodded left returned to dunnets room closed and locked the door then as dunnet watched in silence proceeded to search the room thoroughly a few minutes later apparently still not satisfied he moved into the adjacent bathroom turned a tap and the shower on to maximum then went out leaving the door wide open behind him it is difficult for even the most sensitive microphone to pick up with any degree of clarity the sound of human voices against a background of running water without any byyourleave he searched through the outer clothing that dunnet had been wearing he replaced the clothing and looked at dunnets torn shirt and the white band that a wrist watch had left on a suntanned wrist has it occurred to you alexis harlow said that some of your activities are causing displeasure in certain quarters and that they are trying to discourage you funny bloody funny dunnets voice was understandably so thick and slurred that in his case the use of any antimicrophone devices was almost wholly superfluous why didnt they discourage me permanently only a fool kills unnecessarily we are not up against fools however who knows one day well now wallet loose change watch cufflinks even your halfdozen fountain pens and car keys all gone looks like a pretty professional roll job doesnt it the hell with that dunnet spat blood into a handful of tissue what matters is that the cassette is gone harlow hesitated then cleared his throat in a diffident fashion well lets say that a cassette is missing the only really viable feature in dunnets face was his unblemished right eye this after a momentary puzzlement he used most effectively to glower at harlow with the maximum of suspicion what the hell do you mean harlow gazed into the middle distance well alexis i do feel a little bit apologetic about this but the cassette that matters is in the hotel safe the one our friends now have the one i gave to you was a plant dunnet with what little could be seen of his sadly battered face slowly darkening in anger tried to sit up gently but firmly harlow pushed him down again harlow said now now alexis dont do yourself an injury another one i mean they were on to me and i had to put myself in the clear or i was finished although god knows i never expected them to do this to you he paused im in the clear now youd better be sure of that my boy dunnet had subsided but his anger hadnt im sure when they develop that film spool theyll find it contains micro photos about a hundred of line drawings of a prototype gas turbine engine theyll conclude im as much a criminal as they are but as my business is industrial espionage there can be no possible conflict of interests theyll lose interest in me dunnet looked at him balefully clever bastard arent you yes i am rather he went to the door opened it and turned round especially it seems when it is at other peoples expense chapter seven in the coronado pits on the following afternoon a heavily panting macalpine and a still sadly battered dunnet argued in low and urgent tones the faces of both men were marked with worry macalpine made no attempt to conceal the savagery he felt inside him he said but the bottles empty man drained to the last drop ive just checked jesus i cant just let him go out there and kill another man if you stop him youll have to explain why to the press itll be a sensation the international sporting scandal of the last decade itll kill johnny professionally i mean better have him killed professionally than have him kill another driver for real dunnet said give him two laps if hes in the lead then let him go he cant kill anyone in that position if not flag him in well cook up something for the press anyway remember what he did yesterday with the same skinful inside him yesterday he was lucky today today its too late even at a distance of several hundred feet the sound of twentyfour grand prix racing engines accelerating away from the starting grid was startling almost shattering both in its unexpectedness and earcringing fury of sound macalpine and dunnet looked at each other and shrugged simultaneously there seemed to be no other comment or reaction to meet the case the first driver past the pits already pulling fractionally clear of nicolo tracchia was harlow in his limegreen coronado macalpine turned to dunnet and said heavily one swallow does not make a summer eight laps later macalpine was beginning to question his ornithological expertise he was looking slightly dazed while dunnet was indulging in considerable eyebrowlifting jacobsons expression was not one indicative of any marked internal pleasure while rory was positively scowling although manfully trying not to only mary expressed her true emotion and that without inhibition she looked positively radiant three lap records gone she said incredulously three lap records in eight laps by the end of the ninth lap the emotions of those in the coronado pits as registered by their facial expressions had radically altered jacobson and rory were with difficulty refraining from looking cheerful mary was chewing anxiously on her pencil macalpine looked thunderous but the thunder was overlaid by deep anxiety forty seconds overdue he said forty seconds all the fields gone past and hes not even in sight what in gods name could have happened to him dunnet said shall i phone the trackmarshals checkpoints macalpine nodded and dunnet began to make calls the first two yielded no information and he was about to make a third when harlows coronado appeared and drew into the pits the engine note of the coronado sounded perfectly healthy in every way which was more than could be said for harlow when he had climbed out of his car and removed his helmet and goggles his eyes were glazed and bloodshot he looked at them for a moment then spread his hands the tremor in them was unmistakable sorry had to pull up about a mile out double vision could hardly see where i was going come to that i still cant get changed the bleak harshness in macalpines voice startled the listeners im taking you to hospital harlow hesitated made as if to speak shrugged turned and walked away dunnet said in a low voice youre not taking him to the course doctor im taking him to see a friend of mine an optometrist of note but many other things besides all i want him to do is a little job for me a job i couldnt get done in privacy and secrecy on the track dunnet said quietly almost sadly a blood sample just one positive blood sample and that will be the end of the road for grand prixs superstar the end of the road for a person who might well have good reason for believing he had reached the end of his professional career harlow as he sat relaxed in his chair in a hospital corridor seemed singularly unperturbed most unusually for him he was smoking a cigarette the hand holding the cigarette as steady as if it had been carved from marble harlow gazed thoughtfully at the door at the far end of the corridor behind that door macalpine his face registering a combination of disbelief and consternation looked at the man seated across the desk from him a benign and elderly bearded doctor in shirt sleeves macalpine said impossible quite impossible you mean to tell me there is no alcohol in his blood impossible or not i mean what i say an experienced colleague has just carried out a doublecheck he has no more alcohol in his blood than you would find in that of a lifelong abstainer macalpine shookhis head impossible he repeated look professor i have proof to us longsuffering doctors nothing is impossible the speed with which different individuals metabolize alcohol varies beyond belief with an obviously extremely fit young man like your friend outside but his eyes you saw his eyes bleary bloodshot there could be half a dozen reasons for that and the double vision his eyes seem normal enough how well he is seeing its hard to say yet there exists always the possibility that the eyes themselves are sound enough but that some damage may have been done to an optical nerve the doctor stood up a spot check is not enough id need a series of tests a battery of tests unfortunately not now im already overdue at the theatre could hecome along about seven this evening macalpine said he could expressed his thanks and left as he approached harlow he looked at the cigarette in his hand then at harlow then back at the cigarette but said nothing still in silence the two men left the hospital got into macalpines aston and drove back in the direction of monza harlow broke the silence he said mildly as the principal concerned dont you think you should tell me what the doctor said macalpine said shortly hes not sure he wants to carry out a series of tests the first is at seven oclock tonight still mildly harlow said i hardly think that will be necessary macalpine glanced at him in brief speculation and whats that meant to mean theres a layby half a kilometre ahead pull in please theres something i want to say at seven oclock that evening the hour when harlow was supposed to be in hospital dunnet sat in macalpines hotel room the atmosphere was funereal both men had large glasses of scotch in their hands dunnet said jesus just like that he said his nerve was gone he knew he was finished and could he break his contract just like that no more beating about the bush he said no more kidding especially kidding himself god knows what it cost the poor devil to say so and the scotch macalpine sampled his own and sighed heavily more in sadness than weariness quite humorous about it really says he detests the damned stuff and is thankful for a reason never to touch it again it was dunnets turn to have recourse to his scotch and whats going to happen to your poor devil now mind you james im not overlooking what this has cost you youve lost the best driver in the world but right now im more concerned about johnny me too but what to do what to do the man who was the subject of all this concern was displaying a remarkable amount of unconcern for a man who was the central figure in the greatest fall from grace in the history of motor racing johnny harlow seemed most extraordinarily cheerful as he adjusted his tie before the mirror in his room he whistled albeit slightly tunelessly to himself breaking off occasionally to smile at some private thought he shrugged into his jacket left his room went down to the lobby took an orangeade from the bar and sat down at a nearby table before he was even able to sip his drink mary came and sat beside him she took one of his hands in both of hers johnny she said oh johnny harlow gazed at her with sorrowful eyes she went on daddy just told me oh johnny what are we going to do we she gazed at him for long seconds without speaking looked away and said to lose my two best friends in one day there were no tears in her eyes but there were tears in her voice your two what do you mean i thought you knew now the tears were trickling down her cheeks henrys got bad heart trouble he has to go henry dear oh dear oh dear harlow squeezed her hands and gazed off into the middle distance poor old henry i wonder what will happen to him oh thats all right she sniffed daddys keeping him on in marseilles ah then its probably all for the best henry was getting past it anyway harlow remained thoughtful for some seconds apparently lost in deep thought then clasped marys hands with his free one he said mary i love you hang on will you back in a couple of minutes one minute later harlow was in macalpines room dunnet was there and he had the appearance of a man who was with difficulty keeping his anger under control macalpine was clearly highly distressed he shook his head many times he said not at any price not under any circumstances no no no its just not on one day the world champion the next trundling a lumbering transporter all over the place why man youd be the laughing stock of europe maybe harlows voice was quiet without bitterness but not half as much a laughing stock as id be if people knew the real reason for my retiral mr macalpine mr macalpine mr macalpine im always james to you my boy always have been not any more sir you could explain about my socalled double vision say that ive been retained as a specialist adviser what more natural besides you do need a transporter driver macalpine shook his head in slow and complete finality johnny harlow will never drive any transporter of mine and thats the end of it macalpine covered his face with his hands harlow looked at dunnet who jerked his head towards the door harlow nodded and left the room dunnet let some seconds pass in silence then he said picking his words carefully and without emotion and thats the end of me ill say goodbye to you then james macalpine ive enjoyed every minute of my assignment except for the last minute macalpine removed his hands slowly lifted his head and stared at dunnet in wonderment he said what on earth do you mean i mean this isnt it obvious i value my health too much to stay around and feel sick every time i think of what youve done that boy lives for motor racing its the only thing he knows and now he has n place left in the world to go and i would remind you james macalpine that in the space of four short years the coronado has been hauled up from the depths of near obscurity and made into the most successful and respected grand prix racing car in the world through one thing and one thing only the incomparable driving genius of that boy to whom you have just shown the door not you james not you johnny harlow made coronado but you cant afford to be associated with failure hes no use to you any more so you drop him into the discard i hope you sleep well tonight mr macalpine you should do you have every reason to be proud of yourself dunnet turned to leave macalpine with tears in his eyes spoke softly alexis dunnet turned macalpine said if you ever speak to me like that again ill break your blasted neck im tired im dead tired and i want to sleep before dinner go tell him he can have any bloody job he likes on the coronadomine if he so cares dunnet said ive been bloody rude please accept my apologies and thank you very much james macalpine smiled faintly not mr macalpine i said thank you james both men smiled at each other dunnet left closing the door with a quiet hand went down in to the lobby where harlow and mary were seated side by side untouched drinks before them the aura of profound despondency that overhung their table was almost palpable dunnet picked up a drink from the bar joined harlow and mary smiled broadly lifted his glass and said cheers heres to the fastest transporter driver in europe harlow left his drink untouched he said alexis im in one of my less humorous moods this evening dunnet said cheerfully mr james macalpine has had a sudden and complete change of mind and heart his final words were go and tell him he can have any blasted job he likes on the coronadomine if he so cares harlow shook his head dunnet went on gods sake johnny im not having you on harlow shook his head again im not doubting you alexis im just flabbergasted how on earth did you managewell perhaps its just as well you dont tell me he smiled faintly i dont think i really want mr macalpines job oh johnny there were tears in her eyes but not tears of sorrow not in that radiant face she rose flung her arms around his neck and kissed him on the cheek harlow though slightly startled was not noticeably embarrassed thats my girl dunnet said approvingly a last long farewell to the fastest lorry driver in europe she stared at him what on earth do you mean the transporter leaves for marseilles tonight someone has to drive it there this is a job usually reserved for the transporter driver harlow said my god id rather overlooked that part of it now as ever was there appears to be a considerable degree of urgency i think youd better see james now harlow nodded rose and left for his room where he changed into dark trousers navy rollneck sweater and leather jacket he went to see macalpine and found him stretched out on his bed looking ill and pale and little short of positively haggard macalpine said i have to admit johnny that the reason for my decision is based largely on selfinterest tweedledum and tweedledee good mechanics though they are couldnt drive a wheelbarrow jacobson has already left for marseilles to make loading arrangements for the morning its asking a lot i know but i must have number four the new x car and the spare engine at the vignolles test track by noon tomorrow we have the track for two days only a lot of driving i know and youll have only a few hours sleep if that youll have to start loading in marseilles by am tine now what shall i do with my own car ah the only transporter driver in europe with his own ferrari alexis will take my aston while i personally will drive your rusty old bucket of bolts to vignolles tomorrow then youll have to take it to our marseilles garage and leave it there for keeps im afraid i understand mr macalpine mr macalpine mr macalpine are you sure this is what you want to do johnny never surer sir harlow went down to the lounge to find that mary and dunnet were no longer there he went upstairs again found dunnet in his room and asked wheres mary gone for a walk bloody chilly evening to go for a walk i dont think shes in any condition to feel the cold dunnet said drily euphoria i believe they call it seen the old boy yes the old boy as you call him really is becoming an old boy hes put on five years in the last six months more like ten years understandable with his wife vanishing just like that maybe if youd lost someone to whom youve been married for twentyfive years hes lost more than that whats that supposed to mean i dont even know myself his nerve his selfconfidence his drive his will to fight and win harlow smiled some time this week well give him those lost ten years back again youre the most incredibly arrogant selfconfident bastard ive ever known dunnet said admiringly when harlow made no reply he shrugged and sighed well to be a world champion i suppose you have to have some little belief in yourself and now what off on my way out ill pick up from the hotel safe this little bauble that im going to deliver to our friend in the rue st pierre seems a damned sight safer than trying to walk to the post office how about having a drink in the bar and seeing if anyones interested in me why should they be they have the right cassette or think they have which amounts to the same thing thats as maybe but its just possible that the ungodly might change their minds when they see me taking this envelope from the hotel safe rip it open throw the envelope away examine the cassette and stick it in my pocket they know theyve been fooled once you can bet your life that theyll be more than prepared to believe that theyve been fooled twice for long seconds dunnet stared at harlow in total disbelief when he spoke his voice was a whisper he said this isnt just asking for trouble this is ordering your own pine box only the best of oak for world champions with goldplated handles come on they went down the stairs together dunnet turned off towards the bar while harlow went to the desk as dunnets eyes roved round the lobby harlow asked for and received his envelope opened it extracted the cassette and examined it carefully before putting it in an inside pocket of his leather jacket as he turned away from the desk dunnet wandered up almost casually and said in a quiet voice tracchia his eyes almost popped out of his head he almost ran to the nearest phone booth harlow nodded said nothing passed through the swing doors then halted as his way was barred by a leathercoated figure he said what are you doing here mary its bitterly cold i just wanted to say goodbye thats all you could have said goodbye inside im a very private person besides youll be seeing me again tomorrow in vignolles will i johnny will i tsk tsk someone else who doesnt believe i can drive dont try to be funny johnny because im not feeling that way im feeling sick ive this awful feeling that something dreadful is going to happen to you harlow said lightly its this halfhighland blood of yours fey is what they call it having the second sight if its any consolation to you the secondsighters have an almost perfect per cent record of failure dont laugh at me johnny there were tears in her voice he put an arm round her shoulders laugh at you with you yes at you never come back to me johnny ill always come back to you mary what what did you say johnny a slip of the tongue he squeezed her shoulders pecked her briskly on the cheek and strode off into the gathering darkness chapter eight the giant coronado transporter its vast silhouette outlined by at least a score of lights on the sides and back not to mention its four powerful headlamps rumbled through the darkness and along the almost wholly deserted roads at a speed which would not have found very much favour with the italian police speed patrols had there been any such around that night which fortunately there werent harlow had elected to take the autostrada across to turin then turned south to cuneo and was now approaching the col de tende that fearsome mountain pass with the tunnel at the top which marks the boundary between italy and france even in an ordinary car in daylight and in good dry driving conditions it calls for the closest of care and attention the steepness of the ascent and descent and the seemingly endless series of murderous hairpin bends on both sides of the tunnel make it as dangerous and difficult a pass as any in europe but to drive a huge transporter at the limit of its adhesion and roadholding in rain that was now beginning to fall quite heavily was an experience that was hazardous to a degree for some it was plainly not only hazardous but harrowing to a degree the redhaired twin mechanics one curled up in the bucket seat beside harlow the other stretched out on the narrow bunk behind the front seats though quite exhausted were clearly never more wide awake in their lives not to put too fine a point on it they were frankly terrified either staring in horror at each other or closing their eyes as they slid and swayed wildly on each successive hairpin bend and if they did leave the road it wouldnt be just to bump across the surrounding terrain it would be to fall a very long way indeed and their chances of survival were nonexistent the twins were beginning to realize why old henry had never made it as a grand prix driver if harlow was aware of the very considerable inner turmoil he was causing he gave no signs of it his entire being was concentrated on his driving and on scanning the road two even three hairpin bends ahead tracchia and by now tracchias associates knew that he was carrying the cassette and that they intended to separate him from that cassette harlow did not for a moment doubt when and where they would make their attempt was a matter for complete conjecture crawling round the hairpins leading to the top of the col de tende made them the perfect target for an ambush whoever his adversaries were harlow was convinced they were based in marseilles it was unlikely that they would care to take the risk of running foul of the italian law he was certain that he hadnt been trailed from monza the chances were that they didnt even know what route he was taking they might wait until he was much nearer their home base or even arrived at it on the other hand they might be considering the possibility that he was getting rid of the cassette en route speculation seemed not only unrewarding but useless he put the wide variety of possibilities out of his mind and concentrated on his driving while still keeping every sense alert for danger as it was they made the top of the col without incident passed through the italian and french customs and started on the wickedly winding descent on the other side when he came to la giandola he hesitated briefly he could take the road to ventimiglia thus taking advantage of the new autoroutes westwards along the riviera or take the shorter but more winding direct route to nice he took into account that the ventimiglia route would entail encountering the italian and french customs not once but twice again and decided on the direct route he made nice without incident followed the autoroute past cannes reached toulon and took the n to marseilles it was about twenty miles out of cannes near the village of beausset that it happened as they rounded a bend they could see about a quarter of a mile ahead four lights two stationary two moving the two moving lights were red and obviously handheld for they swung steadily through arcs of about ninety degrees there was an abrupt change in the engine note as harlow dropped a gear the sound brought the dozing twins to something like near wakefulness just in time to identify a bare second after harlow the legends on the two stationary lights red and blue and flashing alternately one said stop the other police there were at least five men behind the lights two of them standing in the middle of the road harlow was hunched far forward over the wheel his eyes narrowed until even the pupils seemed in danger of disappearing he made an abrupt decision arm and leg moved in swift and perfect unison and again the engine note changed as the big diesel dropped another gear ahead the two moving red lamps stopped swinging it must have been evident to those wielding them that the transporter was slowing to a halt fifty yards distant from the roadblock harlow stamped the accelerator pedal flat to the floor the transporter designedly had been in the correct gear to pick up maximum acceleration and it was in that gear that harlow held it the engine revolutions climbing as the distance between the transporter and the flashing lights ahead steadily and rapidly decreased the two men with the red lights moved rapidly apart it had dawned on them and a very rude awakening it must have been that the transporter had no intention of stopping inside the cab the faces of tweedledum and tweedledee registered identical expressions of horrified and incredulous apprehension harlows face registered no expression at all as he watched the shadowy figures who had been standing so confidently in the middle of the road fling themselves to safety towards either verge above the still mounting roar of the diesel could be heard the sound of the splintering of glass and the screeching of buckling metal as the transporter overran the pedestalmounted flashing lights in the middle of the road twenty yards farther on there came a series of heavy thuds from the rear of the transporter a drumming sound that continued for another thirty or forty yards until harlow swung the swaying transporter round a fortyfive turn in the road harlow changed up once and then again into top gear he appeared to be quite unconcerned which was considerably more than could be said for the twins tweedledum said in a stricken voice jesus johnny are you mad youll have us all in prison before the night is out that was a police block man a police block without police cars police motorcycles or police uniforms i wonder why the good lord gave you pair two eyes apiece tweedledee said but those police signs i will refrain from giving you pitying looks harlow said kindly please do not overtax your minds i would also point out that the french police do not wear masks which this lot did nor do they fix silencers to their guns silencers the twins spoke as one you heard those thumps and bumps on the back of the transporter what do you think they were doing throwing stones after us tweedledum said then what hijackers members of an honoured and respected profession in these parts harlow trusted he would be forgiven for this wicked slur on the honest citizens of provence but it was the best he could think of on the spur of the moment and besides the twins though excellent mechanics were of a rather simple cast of mind who would readily believe anything that a person of the stature of johnny harlow were to tell them but how could they have known we were coming they didnt harlow was improvising rapidly theyre usually in radio contact with lookouts posted a kilometre or so on either side of them weve probably just passed the second one when a likelylooking prospect such as us comes along it takes only a few seconds to have the lights in position and working a backward lot those froggies tweedledum observed arent they just they havent even got round to great train robberies yet the twins composed themselves for slumber harlow apparently tireless was as alert and watchful as ever after a few minutes in his outside rear mirror he caught sight of a pair of powerful headlights approaching at high speed as they closed harlow briefly considered moving out to the middle of the road to block its passage just in case the occupant or occupants belonged to whatever opposition there might be but he dismissed the idea immediately if they were illdisposed all they would have to do would be to shoot holes in his rear tyres at their leisure as effective a way as any of bringing the transporter to a halt as it happened the person or persons showed no signs of hostility but one curious event occurred as it overtook the transporter all the cars lights both front and rear went out and remained out until it was at least a hundred yards ahead the driver of the car seeing by courtesy of the transporters headlights when its lights did come on again it was too far away for its rear numberplate to be identified only seconds later harlow saw another pair of powerful headlights closing at even higher speed this oar did not cut its lights as it overtook the transporter and it would have been most improbable had it done so for it was a police car with both siren and flashing blue light in splendid working order harlow permitted himself an almost beatific smile and just over a mile later still had an expression of pleased anticipation on his face as he gently braked the transporter ahead the police car blue lamp still flashing was parked by the side of the road immediately ahead of it was another car with a policeman pad in hand interrogating the driver through an opened window there could be little question what the interrogation was about except on the autoroutes the legal speed limit in france is kph the man being interrogated must have been doing at least when he had passed the transporter the transporter still moving slowly pulled out to the left to overtake both cars and harlow had no difficulty in making out the numberplate of the front car it read pniiik like most major cities marseilles has places well worth looking at and others that do not qualify in that category certain sections of northwest marseilles unmistakably belong in the latter category seedy and rundown exsuburban areas now more industrial than they are residential the rue gerard was typical of such an area while it might barely escape being described as an eyesore it was a singularly unprepossessing street almost entirely given over to small factories and large garages the largest building in the street was a brick and corrugated iron monstrosity about halfway along on the left above the huge ribbed metal door was in foothigh letters the single word coronado as harlow trundled the transporter down the rue gerard he seemed unmoved by the unlovely spectacle before him the twins were sound asleep as harlow approached the garage the metal door began to roll upwards and as harlow swung out to make his approach lights came on inside the garage was a cavernous place eighty feet long and about fifty in width it seemed ancient in construction and appearance but was about as wellkept wellswept and clean as anyone could reasonably expect such a garage to be lined up against the righthand wall were no fewer than three coronado formula cars and pedestalmounted beyond those three unmistakable fordcosworth v engines nearest the door on the same side was a black citroen ds the lefthand side of the garage was given over to rows of lavishly equipped workbenches while at the rear of the garage stacked headhigh were dozens of crates of spares and tyres running both longitudinally and laterally were overhead beams for moving the engines about and for loading up the transporter harlow eased the transporter in and stopped it precisely under the main longitudinal loading beam he stopped the engine shook the sleeping twins and climbed down to the garage floor jacobson was there to meet him he didnt seem particularly glad to meet him but then jacobson never seemed particularly glad to meet anyone he looked at his watch and said grudgingly two oclock fast trip empty road what now bed weve an old villa just round the corner its not much but it serves well be here in the morning to start loading after we unload that is the two resident mechanics will be here to help us jacques and harry theyve left jacobson looked even more sour than usual homesick they said theyre always getting homesick homesick means too much hard work new boys are italian not half bad though jacobson did not appear to have noticed the back of the transporter until then he said what the hell are those marks bullets somebody tried to hijack us this side of toulon at least i think it was an attempted hijack but if it was they werent very good at their job and why the hell should anyone want to hijack you what good could a couple of coronados be to anyone none maybe their information was wrong this is the kind of wagon they use for transporting those very large cargoes of scotch or cigarettes a million two million francs a load something really worth hijacking anyway no harm done fifteen minutes with a panelbeater and a spray gun and shell be as good as new ill report this to the police in the morning jacobson said under french law its an offence not to report such an incident not he added bitterly that it will do any bloody good the four men left the garage as they did harlow glanced casually at the black citroen the numberplate read pniiik as jacobson had said the old villa round the corner was not much but it served barely harlow sat in a chair by the side of a sparsely furnished room which apart from a narrow bed and some worn linoleum had as its only other item of furniture another chair which served as a bedside table the window of the bedroom which was on street level had no curtains just thin gauze netting although the room light was out some faint degree of illumination was afforded by the weak street lights outside harlow twitched the netting fractionally aside and peered out the mean narrow little street outside compared to which the rue gerard was an arterial highway was completely deserted harlow glanced at his watch the luminous hands said that it was two fifteen suddenly harlow cocked his head listening intently it could have been his imagination he thought or perhaps what he heard was the sound of faint footfalls in the passageway outside noiselessly he crossed to his bed and lay down on it it did not creak because it was a flock mattress that had a long if probably dishonourable history behind it his hand reached under the pillow which was of the same vintage as the mattress and brought out his blackjack he slipped the thong over his right wrist then returned his right hand under the pillow the door opened stealthily breathing deeply and evenly harlow partly opened his eyes a faint shadow stood in the doorway but it was impossible to recognize who it was harlow remained as he was perfectly relaxed and apparently soundly asleep after a few seconds the intruder closed the door as stealthily as he had opened it and harlows now highly attuned hearing could distinguish the soft sound of footsteps fading away harlow sat up rubbing his chin in puzzled indecision then left his bed and took up his vantage point by the window a man this time clearly identifiable as jacobson had just left the house he crossed the street and as he did so a dark car a small renault rounded the corner and stopped almost directly opposite jacobson stooped and talked to the driver who opened the door and stepped out he removed his dark overcoat folded it neatly there was an unpleasant and rather menacing certainty about all his movements placed it in the back seat patted his pockets as if to reassure himself that nothing was missing nodded to jacobson and began to cross the street jacobson walked away harlow retreated to his bed where he lay with his blackjacked right hand under his pillow facing the window his eyes fractionally open almost at once he saw a shadowy figure his features indistinguishable because he was illuminated from behind appear at the window and peer in he brought up his right hand and examined what it held there was nothing indistinguishable about this it was a large and very unpleasant looking pistol and as harlow watched he slid back a catch on the side it was then that harlow saw that the gun had a lengthy cylindrical object screwed on to the end of the muzzle a silencer a piece of equipment designed to silence a shot for a fraction of a second and harlow for ever the figure disappeared harlow left his bed with considerable alacrity a blackjack as compared to a silenced gun had its distinct limitations he crossed the room and took up position against the wall about two feet from the hinged side of the door for ten long seconds which even harlow found rather wearing on the nerves there was total silence then there came the barely audible creak from a floorboard the villa didnt go in much for deeppiled carpeting in the passageway outside the door handle depressed with almost millimetric stealth then slowly returned to position as the door very very smoothly and gently began to open the gap between the door and jamb widened until it was about ten inches momentarily the door ceased to move a head began to poke its way cautiously through the gap the intruder had a thin swarthy face black hair plastered close to his narrow head and a pencilline moustache harlow leaned back on his left leg raised his right leg and smashed the heel of his right foot against the door just below the keyhole from which the key had been thoughtfully and earlier removed there was a muffled halfcough halfscream of agony harlow jerked the door wide open and a short thin darksuited man stumbled into the room both hands the right still clutching the gun were clasped to the bloodmasked shattered middle of his face the nose was certainly broken what had happened to cheekbones and teeth were at the moment a matter for the most idle conjecture it certainly didnt concern harlow his face was entirely without pity he swung his blackjack none too lightly and brought it down over the intruders right ear moaning the man sank to his knees harlow took the gun from an unresisting hand and ran his free band over the mans body at his belt he discovered a sheath knife which he withdrew it was six inches long doubleedged needlepointed and razorsharp gingerly harlow slipped the knife into his outside leather jacket pocket changed his mind switched over gun and knife entwined his hand in the mans black greasy hair and pulled him ruthlessly to his feet equally ruthlessly he pressed the blade of the knife into his back until he was sure the tip had penetrated the skin harlow said outside with the knife pressing ever deeper into his spine harlows wouldbe killer had little option the two men emerged from the villa and crossed the deserted street towards the little black renault harlow pushed the man into the front seat while he himself got into the back harlow said drive police when the man spoke it was understandably with some muffled difficulty he said no can drive harlow reached for his blackjack and struck the man with approximately the same force as before but this time over the left ear the man sagged wearily against the wheel harlow said drive police he drove if his performance could be called driving it was understandably the most erratic and harrowing journey harlow had ever experienced apart from the fact that the man was barely conscious he had to drive with one hand only having to take his hand off the wheel to change gear using the other hand to hold a bloodsaturated handkerchief against his shattered face fortunately the streets were deserted and the police station only ten minutes away harlow halfpushed halfcarried the unhappy italian into the station deposited him not too gently on a bench then went to the desk behind it were two large burly and apparently genial policemen both in uniform one an inspector the other a sergeant they were studying with surprise and considerable interest the man on the bench who was now in a state of almost complete collapse holding both hands to his blood smeared face harlow said i want to lodge a complaint about thisman the inspector said mildly it looks more to me that he should be lodging a complaint against you harlow said you will be requiring some identification he pulled out his passport anddriving licence but the inspector waved them away without even looking at them even to the police your face is better known than that of any criminal in europe but i had thought mr harlow that your sport was motor racing not boxing the sergeant who had been studying the italian with some interest touched the inspector on the arm well well well he said if it isnt our old friend and true luigi the lightfingered difficult to recognize him though he looked at harlow how did you make his acquaintance sir he came visiting me im sorry there was some violence apologies are out of order the inspector said luigi should be beaten up regularly preferably once a week but this one should last him a couple of months was it ah necessary wordlessly harlow produced the knife and gun from his pockets and laid them on the counter the inspector nodded with his record a minimum of five years you will press charges of course please do it for me i have urgent business ill look in later if i may incidentally i dont think luigi came to rob me i think he came to kill me id like to find out who sent him i think that could be arranged mr harlow there was a grimfaced thoughtfulness about the inspector that boded ill for luigi harlow thanked them left climbed into the renault and drove off apart from the fact that he had no compunction in the world about borrowing luigis car it was highly unlikely that its owner would be in any fit state to use it for quite some time to come it had taken luigi ten minutes to drive from the villa to the police station it took harlow just under four and then less than another thirty seconds to be parked fifty yards away from the big roller door of the coronado garage the door was closed but bars of light could be seen on either side of it fifteen minutes later harlow stiffened and leaned forward a small side door let into the main door had opened and four men emerged even in the negligible street lighting provided for the rue gerard harlow had no difficulty in recognizing jacobson neubauer and tracchia the fourth man he had never seen before presumably he was one of jacobsons mechanics jacobson left the closing and locking of the door to the others and walked quickly up the street in the direction of the villa as he came abreast on the other side of the street he didnt as much as glance in harlows direction there are thousands of small black renaults on the streets of marseilles the other three men locked the door climbed into a citroen and drove off harlows car lightless pulled away from the kerb and followed it was to be in no sense a chase or pursuit just two cars moving at a leisurely pace through the suburbs of the city the one following the other at varying but always discreet distances only on one occasion did harlow fall well back and switch on his sidelights at the sight of an approaching police car but he had no difficulty in making up the lost ground eventually they came to a fairly broad treelined boulevard in an obviously wellto do area large villas hiding behind exceptionally high brick walls lined both sides of the road the citroen rounded a rightangled corner fifteen seconds later harlow did the same and immediately switched on his sidelights about yards ahead the citroen had pulled up outside a villa and a man it was tracchia had already left the car and was advancing towards the gates with a key in his hand harlow pulled out to overtake the parked car and as he did so he saw the gates swing open the other two occupants of the citroen ignored the passing renault harlow turned into the first side street and parked he got out pulled on luigis dark coat and lifted the collar high he walked back to the boulevard which bore the corner name plate of rue georges sand and made his way along it till he came to the villa where the citroen had turned in it was called the hermitage a name that harlow considered singularly inappropriate in the circumstances the walls on either side of the gate were at least ten feet high topped with broken bottle glass embedded in concrete the gates were of the same height and had what appeared to be very sharp spikes on top twenty yards beyond the gates was the villa itself a rambling oldfashioned edwardian building much behung with balconies lights showed through chinks in the curtains on both floors cautiously harlow tested the gates they were locked he glanced both ways to ensure that the boulevard was deserted then produced a ring of fairly large keys he studied the lock studied the keys selected one and tried it it worked first time he pocketed the keys and walked away fifteen minutes later harlow parked his car in an undistinguished little street almost an alleyway he mounted a flight of street steps and at the top did not even have to knock or ring a bell the door opened and an elderly man plump greyhaired and wrapped in a chinese dressinggown beckoned him inside the room into which he led harlow seemed to be a cross between an electronic laboratory and a photographers dark room it was filled with festooned with impressively scientificlooking equipment which appeared to be of the most advanced kind it did however possess two comfortable armchairs the elderly man waved harlow towards one of them he said alexis dunnet warned me but you do come at a most inconvenient hour john harlow pray a seat i have come upon most inconvenient business giancarlo and i havent time to sit down he produced the film cassette and handed it over how long to develop this and give me separate enlargements of each how many frames you mean giancarlo nodded sixty give or take you do not ask for much giancarlo was heavily sarcastic this afternoon harlow said jeanclaude is in town tsk tsk tsk code harlow nodded he is i will see what he can do harlow left on the way back to the villa he pondered the problem of jacobson almost certainly the first thing that jacobson would have done on his return to the villa would have been to check his harlows room the absence of harlow would have caused him no surprise at all no worthwhile assassin was going to incriminate his employer by leaving a corpse in the room next to his there were acres of water in and around marseilles and heavy lead weights would not be difficult to come by if one knew where to look and luigi die lightfingered had given the distinct impression of one who wouldnt have had to look too far jacobson was going to have a mild heart attack whether he met harlow now or at the arranged meeting time of am but if he did not meet harlow until he was going to assume that harlow had been absent until that time and jacobson who was nothing if not suspicious was going to wonder like fury what harlow had been up to in the long watches of the night it would be better to confront jacobson now in the event he had no option he entered the villa just as jacobson was about to leave it harlow regarded two things with interest the bunch of keys dangling from jacobsons hand no doubt he was en route for the garage to perform some doublecrossing operation on his friends and colleagues and the look of utter consternation on the face of jacobson who must have been briefly and understandably under the impression that harlows ghost had come back to haunt him but jacobson was tough and his recovery if not immediate was made in a commendably short time four oclock in the bloody morning jacobsons shock showed through in his strained and overloud voice where the hell have you been harlow youre not my keeper jacobson i bloody well am too im the boss now harlow ive been looking and waiting for you for an hour i was just about to contact the police well now that would have been ironic ive just come from them youve what do you mean harlow what i say im just back from handing over a thug to the police a lad who came calling on me in the still watches of the night gun and knife in hand i dont think he came to tell me bedtime stories he wasnt very good at his job hell be in bed now a hospital bed under heavy police guard jacobson said come inside i want to hear more about this they went inside and harlow told jacobson as much as he thought it was prudent for jacobson to know of his nights activities then said god im tired ill be asleep in one minute flat harlow returned to his spartan accommodation and took up watch by the window in less than three minutes jacobson appeared in the street the bunch of keys still in his hand and headed in the direction of the rue gerard headed presumably for the coronado garage what his intentions were harlow for the moment neither knew nor cared harlow left the house and drove off in luigis renault in a direction opposite to that which jacobson had taken after about four blocks he turned into a narrow lane stopped the engine ensured that the doors were locked from the inside set his wrist alarm for am and composed himself for a very brief sleep as a place to lay his weary head johnny harlow had developed a powerful and permanent aversion to the coronado villa chapter nine it was just coming up for dawn when harlow and the twins entered the coronado garage jacobson and an unknown mechanic were already there they looked harlow reflected just as exhausted as he himself felt harlow said thought you told me you had two new boys one of them didnt turn up when he does jacobson said grimly hes out come on lets empty the transporter and load up the brilliant early morning sun which presaged rain later in the day was over the rooftops when harlow backed the transporter out into the rue gerard jacobson said on your way then the three of you ill be in vignolles about a couple of hours after you some business to attend to first harlow didnt even bother to make the natural inquiry as to what that business might be in the first place he knew that whatever answer he got would be a lie in the second place he knew what the answer was anyway jacobson would have an urgent appointment with his associates in the hermitage in the rue georges sand to acquaint them with the misfortunes of luigi the lightfingered so he merely contented himself with a nod and drove off to the twins vast relief the journey to vignolles was not a replica of the hairraising trip between monza and marseilles harlow drove almost sedately in the first place he had time in hand then again he knew he was so tired that he had lost the fine edge of his concentration finally within an hour of leaving marseilles it had begun to rain lightly at first then with increasing intensity which drastically reduced visibility nevertheless the transporter reached its destination by harlow pulled the transporter to a stop midway between the stands and a large chaletlike building and climbed down followed by the twins it was still raining and the skies were heavily overcast harlow gazed round the grey and empty desolation of the vignolles track stretched his arms and yawned home sweet home god im tired and hungry lets see what the canteen has to offer the canteen had not in fact a great deal to offer but all three men were too hungry to complain as they ate the canteen slowly began to fill up mainly with officials and employees of the track everyone knew harlow but almost no one acknowledged his presence harlow remained quite indifferent at noon he pushed back his chair and made for the door and as he reached for the handle the door opened and mary entered she more than overcompensated for the general lack of welcome shown by the others she smiled at him in delight wrapped her arms around his neck and hugged him tightly harlow cleared his throat and looked round the canteen where the diners were now showing a vast degree more interest in him he said i thought you said you were a very private person i am but i hug everyone you know that well thank you very much she rubbed her cheek youre scruffy filthy and unshaven what do you expect of a face that hasnt seen water or felt a blade for twentyfour hours she smiled mr dunnet would like to see you in the chalet johnny though why he couldnt come to see you in the canteen im sure mr dunnet has his reasons such as not wanting to be seen in my company she wrinkled her nose to show her disbelief and led the way out to the rain she clung to his arm and said i was so scared johnny so scared and so youd every right to be harlow said solemnly its a perilous mission lugging a transporter to marseilles and back johnny sorry they hurried through the rain to the chalet up the wooden steps across the porch and into the hall as the door closed mary reached for harlow and kissed him as a kiss it was neither sisterly nor platonic harlow blinked his unresisting astonishment she said but i dont do that to everyone or anyone you mary are a little minx ah yes but a lovable little minx i suppose so i suppose so rory watched this scene from the head of the chalet stairs he was scowling most dreadfully but had the wit to disappear swiftly as mary and harlow turned to mount the stairs rorys last meeting with harlow was still a very painful memory twenty minutes later showered shaved but still looking very tired harlow was in dunnets room the account of the nights activities hed given to dunnet had been brief succinct but had missed out nothing of importance dunnet said and now straight back into marseilles in the ferrari ill check on giancarlo and the films then go and extend my sympathies to luigi the lightfingered will he sing take a linnet if he talks the police will forget that they ever saw his gun and knife which will save our friend from five years mailbag sewing or breaking boulders in a quarry or whatever luigi does not strike me as the noblest roman of them all how do you get back here by ferrari but i thought that james said that that i was to leave it in marseilles im going to leave it in that disused farmyard down the road i want the ferrari tonight i want to get into the villa hermitage tonight i want a gun for almost fifteen interminable seconds dunnet sat quite still not looking at harlow then he brought up his typewriter from beneath the bed upended it and undipped the base plate this was lined with felt and was equipped with six pairs of spring clips in the clips were held two automatic pistols two silencers and two spare ammunition magazines harlow removed the smaller pistol a silencer and a spare magazine he pressed the magazine release switch examined the magazine already in the gun and pressed it home again he put all three items in the inner pocket of his leather jacket and zipped it up he left the room without another word seconds later he was with macalpine macalpines complexion was quite grey and he was unquestionably a very sick man with an illness insusceptible to physical diagnosis he said leaving now you must be exhausted harlow said itll probably hit me tomorrow morning macalpine glanced through the window the rain was sheeting down he turned back to harlow and said dont envy you your trip to marseilles but the forecast says itll clear this evening well unload the transporter then i think youre trying to say something sir well yes macalpine hesitated i believe you have been kissing my daughter thats a barefaced lie she was kissing me incidentally one of these days im going to clobber that boy of yours you have my best wishes macalpine said wearily do you have designs upon my daughter johnny i dont know about that but she sure as hell has designs on me harlow left and literally bumped into rory in the corridor outside they eyed each other speculation in harlows eyes trepidation in rorys harlow said aha eavesdropping again almost as good as spying isnt it rory what me eavesdrop never harlow put a kindly arm around his shoulder rory my lad i have news i not only have your fathers permission for but approval of my intention to clobber you one of these days at my convenience of course harlow gave rory a friendly pat on the shoulder there was considerable menace in the friendliness harlow smiling descended the stairs to find mary waiting she said speak to you johnny sure but on the porch that blackhaired young monster has probably got the whole place wired for sound they went out on the porch closing the door behind them the chill rain was falling so heavily that it was impossible to see more than halfway across the abandoned airfield mary said put your arm around me johnny i obediently put my arm round you in fact as a bonus ill put them both around you please dont talk like that johnny im scared im scared all the time now scared for you theres something terribly wrong isnt there johnny what should be wrong oh you are exasperating she changed the subject or appeared to going to marseilles yes take me with you no thats not very gallant no what are you johnny what are you doing she had been pressing closely against him but now she drew back slowly wonderingly she put her hand inside his leather jacket pulled the pocket zip and took out the automatic she gazed down hypnotized at the blue metallic sheen of the gun nothing thats wrong sweet mary she put her hand in his pocket again took out the silencer and stared at it with eyes sick with worry and fear she whispered this is a silencer isnt it this way you can kill people without making a noise i said nothing thats wrong sweet mary i know i know you never would but i must tell daddy if you wish to destroy your father then do so it was brutal harlow realized but he knew of no other way go ahead tell him destroy my what do you mean theres something i want to do if your father knew hed stop me hes lost his nerve everybodys opinion to the contrary i havent lost mine what do you mean destroy him i dont think hed long survive the death of your mother my mother she stared at him for long seconds but my mother your mothers alive i know she is i think i can find out where she is if i do ill go and get her tonight youre sure the girl was weeping silently youre sure im sure my sweet mary harlow wished he felt as confident as he sounded there are police johnny no i could tell them where to get the information but they wouldnt get it they have to operate within the law instinctively she dropped her brown tearfilled eyes from his and gazed at the gun and silencer in her hand after a few moments she lifted her eyes again harlow nodded slightly just once took them gently from her returned them to his pocket and closed the zip she looked at him for a long moment then took his leather lapels in her hands come back to me johnny ill always come back to you mary she tried to smile through her tears it was not a very successful effort she said another slip of the tongue that was not a slip of the tongue harlow turned his leather collar high descended the steps and walked quickly through the driving rain he did not look back less than one hour later harlow and giancarlo were occupying the two armchairs in giancarlos scientific laboratory harlow was leafing through a thick pile of glossy photographs harlow said im a very competent cameraman although i do say so myself giancarlo nodded indeed and very full of human interest those subjects of yours we are alas temporarily baffled by the tracchia and neubauer documents but then that makes them even more interesting dont you think not that macalpine and jacobson are lacking in interest far from it do you know that macalpine has paid out just over ј in the past six months i guessed it was a lot but that much even for a millionaire that must bite what are the chances of identifying the lucky recipient at present zero its a zurich numbered account but if they are presented with proved criminal acts especially murder the swiss banks will open up harlow said theyll get their evidence giancarlo looked at harlow in lengthy speculation then nodded i should not be surprised now as for our friend jacobson he must be the wealthiest mechanic in europe his addresses incidentally are those of the leading bookmakers of europe gambling on the geegees giancarlo gave him a pitying look no great feat to find what it was the dates made it easy each lodgement was made two or three days after a grand prix race well well an enterprising lad is our jacobson opens up a whole new vista of fascinating possibilities doesnt it doesnt it now you can take those photographs i have duplicates thank you very much indeed harlow handed back the photographs think i want to be caught with that bloody lot on me harlow said his thanks and goodbye and drove straight to the police station on duty was the inspector who had been there in the early hours of the morning his former geniality had quite deserted him he now had about him a definitely lugubrious air harlow said has luigi the lightfingered been singing sweet songs the inspector shook his head sadly alas our little canary has lost his voice meaning his medicine did not agree with him i fear mr harlow that you dealt with him in so heroic a fashion that he required painkilling tablets every hour i had four men guarding him two outside the room two inside ten minutes before noon this ravishingly beautiful young blonde nurse thats how those cretins describe her cretins my sergeant and his three men she left two tablets and a glass of water and asked the sergeant to see that he took his medicine exactly at noon sergeant fleury is nothing if not gallant so precisely at noon he gave luigi his medicine what was the medicine cyanide it was late afternoon when harlow drove the red ferrari into the courtyard of the deserted farm just south of the vignolles airfield the door of the empty barn was open harlow took the car inside stopped the engine and got out trying to adjust his eyes to the gloom of the windowless barn he was still trying to do this when a stockingmasked figure seemed to materialize out of this selfsame gloom despite the almost legendary speed of his reactions harlow had no time to get at his gun for the figure was less than six feet away and already swinging what looked like a pickaxe handle harlow catapulted himself forward getting in below the vicious swing of the club his shoulder crashing into his assailant just below the breastbone the man completely winded gasped in agony staggered backwards and fell heavily with harlow on top of him one hand on the prostrate mans throat while with the other he reached for his gun he did not even manage to get the gun clear of his pocket he heard the faintest of sounds behind him and twisted round just in time to see another masked figure and a swinging club and catch the full impact of a vicious blow on the right forehead and temple he collapsed without a sound the man whom harlow had winded climbed unsteadily to his feet and although still bent almost double in pain swung his leg and kicked harlow full in his unconscious and unprotected face it was perhaps fortunate for harlow that his attacker was still in so weakened a state otherwise the kick might well have been lethal clearly his attacker was dissatisfied with his initial effort for he drew his foot back again but his companion dragged him away before he could put his potentially lethal intentions into effect the winded man still bent over staggered to and sat on a convenient bench while the other man proceeded to search the unconscious harlow in a very thorough fashion indeed it was noticeably darker inside the barn when harlow slowly began to come to he stirred moaned then shakily raised shoulders and body off the ground until he was at arms length from it he remained in this position for some time then with what was clearly a herculean effort managed to stagger to his feet where he remained uncontrollably swaying like a drunken man his face felt as if it had been struck by a passing coronado after a minute or two more by instinct than anything else he lurched out of the garage crossed the courtyard falling down twice in the process and made his erratic way towards the airfield tarmac the rain had now stopped falling and the sky was beginning to clear dunnet had just emerged from the canteen and was heading towards the chalet when he caught sight of this staggering figure less than fifty yards away weaving its seemingly alcoholic way across the airfield tarmac for a moment dunnet stood like a man turned to stone then broke into a dead run he reached harlow in seconds put a supporting arm around his shoulders as he stared into his face a face now barely recognizable the forehead was wickedly gashed and hideously bruised and the blood that had seeped and was still seeping had completely masked the right side of his face and blinded his right eye the lefthand side of the face was in little better condition the left cheek was one huge bruise with a transverse cut he bled from nose and mouth his lip was split and at least two teeth were missing christ almighty dunnet said dear christ almighty dunnet halfguided halfcarried the staggering semiconscious harlow across the tarmac up the steps across the porch and into the hall of the chalet dunnet cursed under his breath as mary chose just that moment to emerge from the livingroom she stood stockstill for a moment brown eyes huge in a white appalled face and when she spoke her voice was a barely audible whisper johnny she said oh johnny johnny johnny what have they done to you she reached forward and gently touched the bloodmasked face beginning to tremble uncontrollably as the tears rolled down her face no time for tears mary my dear dunnets voice was deliberately brisk warm water sponge towel after that bring the firstaid box on no account are you to tell your father well be in the lounge five minutes later in the lounge a basin of bloodstained water and a bloodstained towel lay at harlows feet his face was clear of blood now and the end result was if anything worse looking than ever inasmuch as the gashes and bruises stood out in clear relief dunnet ruthlessly applying iodine and antiseptics was taping up the gashes and from the frequent wincing expressions on the face of his patient it was clear that harlow was suffering considerably he put finger and thumb inside his mouth wrenched winced again and came out with a tooth which he regarded with disfavour before dropping into the basin when he spoke despite the thickness of his speech it was clear that however damaged he might have been physically mentally he was back on balance you and me alexis i think we should have our photographs taken for the family albums how do we compare for looks dunnet examined him judicially about evenstephen i should say true true mind you i think nature gave me an unfair start over you stop it stop it will you mary was openly crying hes hurt hes terribly hurt im going to get a doctor no question the bantering note had left harlows voice and there was iron in it now no doctors no stitches later not tonight mary her eyes brimming with tears gazed fixedly at the glass of brandy harlow held in his hand the hand was steady as that of a stone statue she said not with bitterness only a dawning of understanding you fooled us all the nerveshattered world champion with the shaking hands you fooled us all the time didnt you johnny yes please leave the room mary i swear ill never talk not even to daddy leave the room leave her be dunnet said if you talk mary you know hed never look at you again my god it never rains but it pours youre our second alarm this afternoon tweedledum and tweedledee are missing dunnet looked at harlow for his reaction but there was none harlow said they were working on the transporter at the time it was a statement not a question how the hell do you know in the south hangar with jacobson dunnet nodded slowly they saw too much harlow said too much it must have been by accident because god knows they werent overburdened by intelligence but they saw too much whats jacobsons story the twins went for a teabreak when they didnt come back after forty minutes he went looking for them theyd just vanished did they in fact go to the canteen dunnet shook his head then if theyre ever found it will be in the bottom of a ravine or a canal remember jacques and henry in the coronado garage dunnet nodded jacobson said theyd become homesick and gone home theyve gone home all right in the same way that tweedledum and tweedledee have gone home hes got two new mechanics down there but only one turned up for work this morning the other didnt ive no proof but ill get it the missing lad didnt turn up because i put him in hospital in the middle hours of the night dunnet showed no reaction mary stared at harlow with unbelieving horror in her eyes harlow went on sorry mary jacobson is a killer murderer if you like hell stop at nothing to protect his own interests i know he was responsible for the death of my young brother in the first grand prix of this season that was what first made alexis persuade me to work for him mary said in total disbelief you work for alexis a journalist harlow went on as if he had not heard her he tried to kill me in the french grand prix i have photographic proof he was responsible for jethous death he tried to get me last night but using a fake police trap to stop the transporter he was responsible for the murder of a man in marseilles today dunnet said calmly who luigi the lightfingered he was fed a painreliever in hospital today it certainly removed him from all pain permanently cyanide jacobson was the only person who knew about luigi so he had him eliminated before he could sing to the police my fault id told jacobson my fault but id no option at the time i cant believe it mary was totally bewildered i cant believe it this is a nightmare believe what you like just stay a mile away from jacobson hell read your face like a book and will begin to become very interested in you i should hate for jacobson to become very interested in you id rather you didnt end up in a gravel pit and always remember youre crippled for life and jacobson did it while he had been talking harlow had been carrying out a thorough examination of his pockets cleaned out he said matteroffactly completely wallet passport driving licence money car keys but i have spares all my skeleton keys he pondered briefly that means ill require a rope hook and tarpaulin from the transporter and then mary interrupted fear in her eyes youre not you cant go out again tonight you should be in hospital harlow glanced at her briefly expressionlessly then went on and then of course they took my gun i shall require another alexis and some money harlow pushed himself to his feet walked quickly and quietly to the door and jerked it open rory who had clearly been listening with his ear pressed hard against the door more or less fell into the room harlow seized him by the hair and rory yelped in agony as harlow straightened him up harlow said look at my face rory rory looked winced and the colour drained from his own harlow said youre responsible for that rory suddenly without warning he struck rory flatly handed across the left cheek it was a heavy blow and would normally have sent rory reeling but he couldnt in this case because harlows left hand was firmly entwined in his hair harlow struck him again backhanded and with equal force across the right cheek then proceeded to repeat the process with metronomic regularity mary screamed johnny johnny have you gone mad she made to throw herself at harlow but dunnet moved swiftly to pin her arms from behind dunnet appeared remarkably unperturbed by the turn events had taken im going to keep this up rory harlow said until you feel the way i look harlow kept it up rory made no attempt to resist or retaliate his head was beginning to roll from side to side quite helplessly as harlow continued to strike him repeatedly then considering that the softeningup process had probably gone far enough harlow stopped harlow said i want information i want the truth i want it now you eavesdropped on mr dunnet and myself this afternoon did you not rorys voice was a trembling painwracked whisper no no i swear i didnt i swear he broke off with a screech of pain as harlow resumed the treatment after a few seconds harlow stopped again a sobbing mary still securely held by dunnet was looking at him in stupefied horror harlow said i was beaten up by some people who knew i was going to marseilles to see about some very important pictures they wanted those pictures very very badly they also knew that i would be parking the ferrari in a barn in a disused farmhouse a little way down the road mr dunnet was the only other person who knew about the pictures and the farmyard you dunk perhaps he told maybe like his sisters rorys cheeks were now liberally streaked with tears i dont know yes yes he must have done harlow spoke slowly and deliberately interspersing every other few words with a resounding slap mr dunnet is not a journalist mr dunnet has never been an accountant mr dunnet is a senior officer of the special branch of new scotland yard and a member of interpol and he has accumulated enough evidence against you for aiding and abetting criminals to ensure that youll spend the next few years in a remand home and borstal he removed his left hand from rorys hair whom did you tell rory tracchia harlow pushed rory into an armchair where he sat hunched his hands covering his aching scarlet face harlow looked at dunnet wheres tracchia gone to marseilles he said with neubauer he was out here too he would be and jacobson out in his car looking for the twins he said hes probably taken a spade with him ill get the spare keys and fetch the ferrari meet you at the transporter in fifteen minutes with the gun and money harlow turned and walked away rory rising rather unsteadily to his feet followed dunnet put an arm round marys shoulders pulled out a breast handkerchief and proceeded to clean her tearravaged face mary looked at him in wonderment are you what johnny said you were special branch interpol well yes im a police officer of sorts then stop him mr dunnet i beg of you stop him dont you know your johnny yet mary nodded miserably waited until dunnet had effected his running repairs then said hes after tracchia isnt he hes after tracchia hes after a lot of people but the person hes really after is jacobson if johnny says that jacobson is directly responsible for the deaths of seven people then hes directly responsible for the deaths of seven people apart from that he has two personal scores to settle with jacobson his young brother dunnet nodded and the other look at your left foot mary chapter ten at the roundabout south of vignolles a black citroen braked to give precedence to harlows red ferrari as the ferrari swept by jacobson at the wheel of the citroen rubbed his chin thoughtfully turned his car towards vignolles and stopped by the first roadside telephone booth in the vignolles canteen macalpine and dunnet were finishing a meal in the now almost deserted room they were both looking towards the door watching mary leave macalpine sighed my daughter is in low spirits tonight your daughter is in love i fear so and where the hell has that young devil rory got to well not to put too fine a point on it harlow caught that young devil eavesdropping oh no not again again the ensuing scene was quite painful really i was there i rather think that rory was afraid that he might find johnny here johnny in fact is in bed i dont think hed any sleep last night and that sounds a very attractive proposition to me bed i mean i feel unaccountably tired tonight if you will excuse me alexis he half rose to his feet then sat down again as jacobson entered and approached their table he looked very tired indeed macalpine said what luck zero ive searched everywhere within five miles of here nothing but ive just had a report from the police that two people answering closely to their descriptions have been seen in le beausset and there cant be many people around like the terrible twins ill just have a bite and go there have to find a car first though mines on the blink hydraulics gone macalpine handed jacobson a set of car keys take my aston well thank you mr macalpine insurance papers everything in the glove box very kind of you to go to such trouble i must say theyre my boys too mr macalpine dunnet gazed expressionlessly into the middle distance the ferraris speedometer registered kph harlow was clearly paying scant attention to the french no kph restriction but from time to time purely from instinct for it seemed unlikely that there was any police car in france capable of overtaking him he consulted his rear mirror but there was at no time anything to be seen except the coils of rope hook and firstaid box on the back seat and the hump of a dirty white tarpaulin which had been clearly flung carelessly on the floor an incredible forty minutes after leaving vignolles the ferrari passed the marseilles sign a kilometre farther on the ferrari pulled up as traffic lights changed to red harlows face was so battered and bruised and covered in plaster that it was impossible to tell what expression it wore but the eyes were as calm and steady and watchful as ever his posture as immobile as ever no impatience no drumming of fingers on the wheel but even harlows total relaxation could be momentarily upset mr harlow the voice came from the rear of the car harlow swung round and stared at rory whose head had just emerged from its cocoon of canvas tarpaulin when harlow spoke it was with slow deliberate spaced words what the hell are you doing there rory said defensively i thought you might be needing a bit of a hand like harlow restrained himself with what was obviously an immense effort i could say this is all i need but i dont think that would help much from an inner pocket he fished out some of the money that dunnet had given him three hundred francs get a hotel and phone vignolles for a car in the morning no thank you mr harlow i made a terrible mistake about you im just plain stupid i guess i wont say sorry for all the sorties in the world are not enough the best way to say sorry is to help please mr harlow look laddie ill be meeting people tonight people who would kill you soon as look at you and now im responsible for you to your father the lights changed and the ferrari moved on what little could be seen of harlows face looked slightly bemused and thats another tiling rory said whats wrong with him my father i mean hes being blackmailed dad blackmailed rory was totally incredulous nothing hes ever done ill tell you some time are you going to stop those people from blackmailing him i hope so and jacobson the man who crippled mary i must have been mad to think it was your fault are you going to get him too yes you didnt say i hope so this time you said yes thats right rory cleared his throat and said diffidently you going to marry mary mr harlow the prison walls appear to be closing round me well i love her too different like but just as much if youre going after the bastard who crippled mary im coming too watch your language harlow said absently he drove some way in silence then sighed in resignation ok but only if you promise to stay out of sight and keep safe ill stay out of sight and keep safe harlow made to bite his upper lip and winced as he bit the gash in that lip he looked in the rear mirror rory now sitting on the back seat was smiling with considerable satisfaction harlow shook his head in what might have been disbelief or despair or both ten minutes later harlow parked the car in an alleyway about three hundred yards away from the rue georges sand packed all the equipment into a canvas bag slung it over his shoulder and set off accompanied by a rory whose expression of complacency had now changed to one of considerable apprehension other factors apart there was a sound enough reason for rorys nervousness it was a bad night for the purposes harlow had in mind a full moon hung high in a cloudless starlit riviera sky the visibility was at least as good as it would have been on an overcast winters afternoon the only difference was that moonshadows are much darker harlow and rory were now pressed close into the shadow of one of the tenfoot high walls that surrounded the villa hermitage harlow examined the contents of the bag now then rope hook tarpaulin twine insulated wirecutters chisels firstaid box yes the lot what is that lot for mr harlow first three for getting over that wall twine for tying things up or together like thumbs wirecutters for electric alarms if i can find the wires chisels for opening things firstaid box well you never know rory will you kindly stop your teeth from chattering our friends inside could hear you forty feet away i cant help it mr harlow now remember youre to stay here the last people we want here are the police but if im not back in thirty minutes go to the phone box on the corner and tell them to come here at the double harlow secured the hook to the end of the rope for once the bright moonlight was of help with his first upward cast the hook sailed over the branch of a tree within the grounds he pulled cautiously until the hook engaged firmly round the branch slung the white tarpaulin over his shoulder climbed the few feet that were necessary draped the tarpaulin over the broken glass embedded in the concrete pulled himself farther up sat gingerly astride and looked at the tree that had provided this convenient branch the lower branches extended to within four feet of the ground harlow glanced down at rory the bag the bag came sailing upwards harlow caught it and dropped it on the ground inside he took the branch in his hands swung inwards and was on the ground in five seconds he passed through a small thicket of trees lights shone from the curtained windows of a ground floor room the massive oaken door was shut and almost certainly bolted in any event harlow considered that a frontal entry was as neat a way as any of committing suicide he approached the side of the house keeping to shadows wherever possible the windows on the ground floor offered no help all were heavily barred the back door predictably was locked the ironic thought occurred to harlow that the only skeleton keys which could have probably opened that door were inside that house he moved round to the other side of the house he didnt even bother looking at the barred lower windows he looked upwards and his attention was at once caught and held by a window that was slightly ajar not much perhaps three inches but still ajar harlow looked around the grounds about twenty yards away were a cluster of garden and potting sheds and a greenhouse he headed resolutely in their direction rory meanwhile was pacing up and down in the lane outside continually glancing at the rope in what appeared to be an agony of indecision suddenly he seized the rope and began to climb by the time he had dropped to the ground on the other side harlow had a ladder against the lower sill of the window and had reached the level of the window itself he pulled out his torch and carefully examined both sides of the window both sides had what were clearly electrical wires stapled to the framework of the window harlow reached inside his bag produced the wirecutters snipped both wires lifted the sash high and passed inside within two minutes he had established that there was no one on the upper floor canvas bag and unlit torch in his left hand the silenced pistol in the other he stealthily descended the stairs towards the hallway light streamed from a door that was slightly ajar and the sound of voices from inside one of them a womans carried very clearly this room he temporarily ignored he prowled round the ground floor ensuring that all the rooms were empty in the kitchen his torch located a set of steps leading down to the basement harlow descended those and played his torch round a concretefloored concretewalled cellar four doors led off this cellar three of those looked perfectly normal the fourth had two massive bolts and a heavy key such as one might expect to find in a medieval dungeon harlow slid the bolts turned the key passed inside located and pressed a light switch whatever it was it was certainly no dungeon it was a very modern and immaculately equipped laboratory although what precisely it was equipped to do was not immediately apparent harlow crossed to a row of aluminium containers lifted the lid of one sniffed the white powdery contents wrinkled his nose in disgust and replaced the lid as he left he passed by a wall telephone obviously from the dial an external exchange one he hesitated shrugged and walked out leaving the door open and the light on rory just at the precise moment when harlow was mounting the steps from the cellar was hidden in the deep shadow on the edge of the thicket of trees from where he stood he could see both the front and the side of the house his face held a considerable degree of apprehension an apprehension that suddenly changed to something very close to fear a squat powerfully built man clad in dark trousers and a dark rollneck pullover had suddenly appeared from behind the back of the house for a moment the man the patrolling guard that harlow hadnt bargained for stood stockstill staring at the ladder propped against the wall then he started running towards the front door of the house as if by magic two items had appeared in his hands a large key and a very much larger knife harlow stood in the hallway outside the occupied room thoughtfully regarding the bar of light streaming from the partially opened door and listening to the sound of voices he tightened the silencer on his gun took two quick steps forward then violently smashed the door open with the sole of his right foot the door all but parted company with its hinges there were five people inside the room three of them were curiously alike and might well have been brothers heavy wellsuited obviously prosperous men blackhaired and very swarthy the fourth was a beautiful blonde girl the fifth was willi neubauer they stared as if mesmerized at harlow who with his bruised and battered face and silenced pistol must have presented a less than friendly appearance harlow said the hands high please all five lifted their hands higher higher the five occupants of the room stretched their arms very high indeed what the devil does this mean harlow neubauers tone was intended to be harsh and demanding but it burred with the sharp edge of strain i come calling on friends harlow interrupted in an iron voice the judge will have more patience with you than i have shut up took out the almost panicstricken scream was barely recognizable as rorys voice harlow had the catlike reflexes that befitted the outstanding grand prix driver of his time he turned and fired in one movement the dark man who had been just about to start a vicious downstroke screamed in agony and stared in disbelief at his shattered hand harlow ignored him and had whirled back to face the others even before the dark mans knife had struck the floor one of the swarthy men had dropped his right hand and was reaching inside his jacket harlow said encouragingly go on the swarthy man lifted his right hand very quickly indeed harlow stepped prudently to one side and gestured briefly with his gun towards the wounded man join your friends moaning in pain his left hand clutching his bleeding right the dark man did so just then rory entered the room harlow said thank you rory all sins forgiven get the firstaid box from that bag i told you we might need it he surveyed the company coldly and i do hope this is the last time we need it he pointed his gun at the blonde girl come here you she rose from her chair and came slowly forward harlow smiled at her chillingly but she was either too shocked or stupid to realize what lay behind that smile i believe you have some pretensions towards being a nurse harlow said even though the late and unlamented luigi might not agree with that theres the firstaid box fix your friends hand she spat at him fix it yourself harlow gave no warning there was a blur of movement and the silencer of the pistol smashed against the blondes face she screamed staggered and fell to a sitting position blood welling from gashes on both cheek and mouth jesus rory was appalled mr harlow if its any consolation rory this charmer is wanted for premeditated murder he looked at the blonde and what little could be seen of his face was totally devoid of pity get to your feet and fix your friends hand then if you wish your own face not that i care the rest of you face down on the floor hands behind your back rory see if they have guns the first man that as much as twitches will be shot through the back of the head rory searched them when he had finished he looked down almost in awe at the four guns he had placed on the table they all had guns he said what did you expect them to be carrying powder puffs now rory the twine you know what to do as many knots as you like the twine as tight as possible and the hell with their circulation rory set about his task with enthusiasm and in very short order had the hands of all six securely bound behind their backs the dark man now had his hand roughly bandaged harlow said to neubauer wheres the gate key neubauer glared venomously and kept silent harlow pocketed his gun picked up the knife his wouldbe assailant had dropped and pressed the tip against neubauers throat just breaking the skin im going to count three then im going to push this knife clear through to the back of your neck one two hall table neubauers face was ashen on your feet all of you down to the cellar they trooped down to the cellar all with highly apprehensive expressions on their faces so apprehensive was the last of the six one of the three swarthy men that he made a sudden vicious lunge at harlow probably with the intention of knocking him down the steps and then stamping on him which was a very foolish thing to do for he had already had eyewitness proof of the quite remarkable speed of harlows reactions harlow stepped nimbly to one side struck him above the ear with the barrel of his pistol and watched him topple then fall halfway down the steps harlow caught one of his ankles and dragged him down the lower half of the stairs the unconscious mans head bumping from concrete step to concrete step one of the other swarthy men shouted gods sake harlow are you mad youll kill him harlow dragged the unconscious man down the last step until his head hit the concrete floor and looked indifferently at the man who had made the protest so im probably going to have to kill you all anyway he ushered them into the cellar laboratory and with rorys assistance dragged the unconscious man in after them harlow said lie down on the floor rory tie their ankles together very tightly please rory did so displaying not only enthusiasm for but now positive enjoyment in his work when he had finished harlow said go through their pockets see what identification papers they are carrying not neubauer we all know who our dear willi is rory returned to harlow with quite a bundle of identification documents in his hand he looked uncertainly at the woman on the floor what about the lady mr harlow never confuse that murderous bitch with a lady harlow looked at her wheres your handbag i havent got a handbag harlow sighed crossed to where she lay and knelt beside her when im finished with the other side of your face no man will ever look at you again not that youll be seeing any men for a long time to come no court is going to overlook the testimony of four policemen who can identify you and the fingerprints on that glass he looked at her consideringly then lifted his gun and i dont suppose the wardresses will care what you look like wheres that handbag in my bedroom the tremble in her voice accurately reflected the fear in her face where in your bedroom the wardrobe harlow looked at rory rory if you would be so kind rory said uncertainly how will i know which bedroom harlow said patiently when you come to a bedroom where the dressingtable looks like the toilet counter in a pharmacy then youll have found the right bedroom and bring down the four guns from the livingroom rory left harlow got to his feet crossed to the desk where hed placed the identification documents and began to study those with interest after about a minute he looked up well well well marzio marzio and marzio sounds like a firm of wellestablished solicitors and all from corsica i seem to have heard of the marzio brothers before im quite certain the police have and will be delighted to have those documents he laid down the papers pulled six inches of a roll of standmounted scotch tape and affixed it lightly to the edge of the desk he said youll never guess what thats for rory returned bearing with him a handbag so large as to be more a valise than a handbag along with four guns harlow opened the bag examined the contents which included a passport then unzipped only a side compartment and pulled out a gun my my so annemarie puccelli carries a firearm around with her no doubt to fend off those wouldbe nasty attackers bent on robbing her of those cyanide tablets such as she fed to the late luigi harlow replaced the gun then dropped into the bag the other documents and the four guns rory had brought he extracted the firstaid box from the bag took out a very small bottle and poured white tablets into his hand how convenient exactly six tablets one for each i want to know where mrs macalpine is being held and im going to know in less than two minutes florence nightingale there will know what those are florence nightingale had no comment to make her face was paperwhite and drawn she appeared to have put on ten years in ten minutes rory said what are those things sugarcoated cyanide quite pleasant to take really take about three minutes to melt oh no you cant do that shock had drained rorys face of all its colour you just cant thatthats murder you want to see your mother again dont you besides its not murder its extermination were dealing with animals not human beings look around you what do you think the end product of this charming old cottage industry is rory shook his head he seemed to be completely numbed heroin think of the hundreds more likely thousands of people theyve killed i insulted animals by calling them animals theyre the lowest form of vermin on earth it would be a pleasure to wipe out all six of them among the six bound prostrate prisoners there was a considerable amount of sweating and liplicking in evidence all six were plainly terrified there was a ruthless implacibility in harlow that made it all too horrifyingly plain that he was in deadly earnest harlow knelt on neubauers chest tablet in one hand gun in the other he struck neubauer stifffingered in the solar plexus neubauer gasped and harlow stuck the silencer of his pistol into his opened mouth so preventing him from clenching his teeth with finger and thumb he held the tablet alongside the silencer harlow said where is mrs macalpine he withdrew the gun neubauer was babbling almost mad with fear bandol bandol bandol in a boat what type where in the bay motor yacht forty feet or so blue with white top the chevalier its called harlow said to rory bring me that strip of scotch tape from the side of the table he repeated his twofingered assault on neubauers solar plexus once again the gun was in the mouth harlow dropped the tablet in i dont believe you he strapped the tape across neubauers mouth just to prevent you from spitting that cyanide tablet out harlow moved across to the man who had made the vain attempt to pull his gun tablet in hand he sank to his knees totally panicstricken the man started screaming at harlow before the latter could speak are you mad are you mad for gods sake its true the chevalier bandol blue and white shes anchored two hundred metres offshore harlow stared at the man for a long moment nodded rose crossed to the wall phone lifted the receiver and dialed police secours which can be variously interpreted as policehelp or policeemergency he made contact almost instantly harlow said im speaking from the villa hermitage in the rue georges sand yes thats it in a basement room you will find a fortune in heroin in the same room you will find the equipment for the bulk manufacture of heroin also in the same room you will find six people responsible for the manufacture and distribution of this heroin they will offer no resistance they are securely bound three of them are the marzio brothers i have taken their identification papers along with those of a wanted murderess called annemarie puccelli these will be given to you later tonight there came from the earpiece the sound of a voice talking rapidly urgently but harlow ignored it he said i will not repeat myself i know that every emergency call is taperecorded so theres no point in trying t detain me until you get here he hung up to find rory gripping his arm rory said desperately youve got your information the three minutes arent up you could still get that tablet from neubauers mouth ah that harlow put four of the tablets back in the small bottle held up the fifth five grains acetylsalicylic acid aspirin thats why i taped his mouth i didnt want him shouting to his pals that all he had been fed was an aspirin there cant be an adult human being in the western world who doesnt know the taste of aspirin look at his face hes not terrified any more hes just hopping mad come to that they all look hopping mad ah well he picked up the girls handbag and looked at her well borrow this temporarily fifteen twenty years whatever the judge cares to give you they left bolting and locking the door behind them took the gate key from the hall table ran through the open front door down the driveway then unlocked and opened the gates harlow pulled rory into the shadow of a cluster of pine trees rory said how long do we stay here just till we make sure that the right people get here first only seconds later they heard the ululating wails of approaching sirens very shortly afterwards sirens still on and lights flashing two police cars and a police van came at speed through the gateway and pulled up in a shower of spraying gravel and at least seven policemen ran up the steps and through the open doorway despite harlows reassurance that the prisoners had been immobilized they all considered it necessary to have their guns in their hands harlow said the right people got here first fifteen minutes later harlow was seated in an armchair in giancarlos laboratory giancarlo leafing through a bundle of documents in his hands heaved a long sigh you do lead an interesting life john here there everywhere youve done us a great service tonight the three men you speak of are indeed the notorious marzio brothers widely supposed to be sicilians and in the mafia but theyre not as youve discovered theyre corsicans corsicans regard the sicilian mafiosa as bungling amateurs those three have been at the top of our list for years never any evidence but they wont get out of this one not when theyre found alongside several million francs worth of heroin well one good turn deserves another he handed some papers over to harlow jeanclaude has preserved his honour he broke the code this evening interesting reading no after about a minute harlow said yes a list of tracchias and neubauers dropoffs throughout europe no less how long to get through to dunnet giancarlo looked at him almost pityingly i can reach any place in france inside thirty seconds there were almost a dozen policemen in the outer office of the police station together with neubauer and his five felonious companions neubauer approached the sergeant at the desk i have been charged i wish to phone my lawyer i have the right you have the right the sergeant nodded to the phone on the desk communications between lawyer and client are privileged he indicated an adjacent phone booth i know what thats for so that the accused can talk to their lawyers may i the sergeant nodded again a phone rang in a rather luxurious flat not half a mile from the police station tracchia was reclining at his ease on a couch in the lounge beside him was a luscious brunette who evinced a powerful aversion to wearing too many clothes tracchia scowled picked the phone up and said my dear willi i am desolate i was unavoidably detained neubauers voice carried clearly are you alone no then be alone tracchia said to the girl georgette my dear go powder your nose she rose sulkily and left the room into the phone he said clear now you can thank your lucky stars that you were unavoidably detained otherwise youd be where i am now on the way to prison now listen tracchia listened very intently indeed his normally handsome face ugly in anger as neubauer gave a brief account of what had happened he finished by saying so take the lee enfield and binoculars if he gets there first pick him off when he comes ashore if he survives paulis attentions if you get there first go aboard and wait for him then lose the gun in the water whos aboard the chevalier now just pauli ill take yonnie with me i may need a lookout or signalman and look willi not to worry youll be sprung tomorrow associating with criminals is not a crime in itself and theres not a single shred of evidence against you how can we be sure how can you be sure that you yourself are in the clear i wouldnt put anything beyond that bastard harlow just get him for me that willi will be a pleasure harlow was on the phone in giancarlos laboratory he said so simultaneous arrests am tomorrow theres going to be an awful lot of unhappy people in europe by am im in a bit of a hurry so ill leave giancarlo to give you all the details hope to see you later tonight meantime i have an appointment chapter eleven rory said mr harlow are you secret service or special agent or something harlow glanced at him then returned his eyes to the road he was driving quickly but nowhere near his limit there seemed to be no compelling urgency about the task on hand he said im an out of work race driver come on who are you kidding no one in your own phraseology rory just giving mr dunnet a bit of a hand like doing what mr harlow i mean mr dunnet doesnt seem to be doing very much does he mr dunnet is a coordinator i suppose im what might be called his field man yes but doing what investigating other grand prix drivers keeping an eye on them rather and mechanics anyone connected with racing i see rory clearly did not see at all im not being rude mr harlow but why pick you why not investigate you a fair question probably because ive been so very lucky in the last two years or so that they figured that i was making more money honestly than i possibly could dishonestly that figures rory was in a very judicial mood but why were you investigating because something has been smelling and smelling badly on the grand prix circuits for over a year now cars were losing that seemed a certainty to win cars were winning that shouldnt have had a chance cars had mysterious accidents gars went off the track where acre was no earthly reason why they should have gone off the track they ran out of petrol when they shouldnt have run out of petrol engines overheated through a mysterious loss of oil or coolant or both drivers fell ill at the most mysterious times and the most inconvenient times and as there is so much prestige pride power and above all profit in running a highly successful racing car it was at first thought that a manufacturer or more likely a race team owner was trying to corner the market for himself but he wasnt as you so brightly remark he wasnt this became clear when manufacturers and team owners discovered that they were all being victimized they approached scotland yard only to be told that they were powerless to intervene the yard called in interpol in effect mr dunnet but how did you get on to people like tracchia and neubauer in the main illegally round the clock telephone switchboard watch maximum surveillance of all suspects at every grand prix meeting and interception of all incoming and outgoing mail we found five drivers and seven or eight mechanics who were stashing away more money than they could have possibly earned but it was an irregular sort of thing for most of them its impossible to fix every race but tracchia and neubauer were stashing it away after every race so we figured they were selling something and theres only one thing you can sell for the kind of money they were getting drugs heroin indeed he pointed ahead and rory caught the sign bandol picked up by the headlights harlow slowed lowered his window poked his head out and looked up bands of cloud were beginning to spread across the sky but there was still much more starlit sky than cloud harlow withdrew his head and said we could have picked a better night for the job far too damn bright theyre bound to have a guard maybe two for your mother point is will they be keeping a watch not only seeing that your mother doesnt escape but that no one comes aboard no reason why they should assume that anyone should try to board the chevalier i cant think of any way they can have heard of the misfortune that has happened to neubauer and his pals but thats the way an organization like the marzio brothers has survived so longby never taking chances so we assume there is a guard mr harlow that is what we assume harlow drove into the little town parked the car in an empty highwalled builders yard where it could not possibly be seen from the narrow alleyway outside they left the car and soon keeping in deep shadow were cautiously picking their way along the small waterfront and harbour they halted and scanned the bay to the east isnt that her although there was no one within earshot rorys voice was a tense whisper isnt that her the chevalier for sure there were at least a dozen yachts and cruisers anchored in the brilliantly moonlit and almost mirrorsmooth little bay the one nearest the shore was a rather splendid motor yacht nearer fifty feet than forty and had very definitely a blue hull and white topsides and now rory said what do we do now he was shivering not because of cold or as had been the case in the villa hermitage of apprehension but because of sheer excitement harlow glanced thoughtfully upwards the sky was still heavily overcast although there was a bar of cloud moving in the direction of the moon eat im hungry eat eat butbut i mean rory gestured towards the yacht all things in their time your mothers hardly likely to vanish in the next hour besides if we were to ah borrow a boat and go out to the chevalier i dont much fancy being picked out in this brilliant moonlight there are clouds moving across lets bide a wee lets what an old scottish phrase lets wait a little while festina lente rory looked at him in bafflement festina what you really are an ignorant young layabout harlow smiled to rob his words of offence an even older latin phrase make haste slowly they moved away and brought up at a waterside cafe which harlow inspected from the outside he shook his head and they walked on to a second cafe where the same thing happened the third cafe they entered it was threeparts empty they took seats by a curtained window rory said whats this place got that the others havent harlow twitched back the curtain a view their vantage point commanded an excellent view of the chevalier i see rory consulted his menu without enthusiasm i cant eat a thing harlow said encouragingly lets try a little something five minutes later two enormous dishes of bouillabaisse were set before them five minutes after that rorys dish was completely empty harlow smiled at both the empty plate and rory then his smile abruptly vanished rory look at me dont look elsewhere especially dont look at the bar act and speak naturally blokes just come in whom i used to know very slightly a mechanic who left the coronado team a few weeks after i joined your father fired him for theft he was very friendly with tracchia and from the fact that hes in bandol its a million to one that he still is a small dark man in brown overalls so lean and scrawny as to be almost wizened sat at the bar with a full glass of beer before him he took his first sip of it and as he did so his eyes strayed to the mirror at the back of the bar he could clearly see harlow talking earnestly to rory he spluttered and halfchoked over his beer he lowered his glass put coins on the counter and left as unobtrusively as possible harlow said yonnie they used to call him i dont know his real name i think hes certain we neither saw nor recognized him if hes with tracchia and he must be this makes it for sure that tracchia is already aboard either tracchias temporarily relieved him of guard duties so that he could come ashore for a muchneeded drink or tracchias sent him away because he doesnt want any witnesses around when he picks me off when i go out to the boat harlow pulled back the curtains and they both looked out they could see a small outboardpowered dinghy heading directly towards the chevalier rory looked questioningly at harlow harlow said our nicolo tracchia is an impulsive not to say impetuous lad which is why hes not quite the driver he could be five minutes from now hell be in the shadows somewhere outside waiting to gun me down the moment i step out of here run up to the car rory bring me some of that twine and adhesive tape i think we may need it meet me about fifty yards along the quay there at the head of the landing steps as harlow signalled the waiter for his bill rory left walking with some degree of restraint as soon as he had passed through the beadcurtained doorway he broke into a dead run arrived at the ferrari he opened the boot stuffed twine and tape into his pockets closed the boot hesitated then opened the drivers door and pulled out the four automatics from under the seat he selected the smallest pushed the other three back into concealment studied the one he held in his hand eased the safety catch off looked guiltily around and stuffed the automatic into an inside pocket he made his way quickly down to the waterfront near the top of the landing steps was a double row of barrels stacked two high harlow and rory stood silently in the shadow the former with a gun in his hand they could both see and hear the outboard dinghy approaching the engine slowed then cut out there came the sound of feet mounting the wooden landing steps then two figures appeared on the quay tracchia and yonnie tracchia was carrying a rifle harlow moved out from the shadows keep quite still he said tracchia that gun on the ground hands high and turn your backs to me i get tired of repeating myself but the first of you to make the slightest suspicious movement will be shot through the back of the head at four feet i am not likely to miss rory see what your former friend and his friend are carrying rorys search produced two guns throw them in the water come on you two behind those barrels face down hands behind your backs rory attend to our friend yonnie with the expertise born of recent and intensive practice rory had yonnie trussed like a turkey in less than two minutes harlow said you know what the tape is for rory knew what the tape was for he used about a couple of feet of black insulated adhesive tape that effectively ensured yonnies total silence harlow said clan he breathe just just is enough not that it matters well leave him here maybe someone will find him in the morning not that that matters either up tracchia but arent you mr tracchia we need whos to say there isnt another guard aboard tracchia here is a specialist in hostages so hell know what we want him for rory looked up at the sky that cloud thats moving towards the moon is taking its time about it it doesnt appear to be in any great hurry about it but well take a chance on it we have our life assurance with us the outboard motor dinghy moved across the moonlit water traccia was at the controls while harlow gun in hand sat amidships facing him rory was in the bows facing forward at this point the blue and white yacht was only a hundred yards away in the wheelhouse of the yacht a tall and powerfully built man had a pair of binoculars to his eyes his face tightened he laid down the binoculars took a gun from a drawer left the wheelhouse climbed the ladder there and spreadeagled himself on the cabin roof the dinghy came alongside the waterskiing steps at the stern and rory made fast at a gesture from harlow tracchia climbed the ladder first and moved back slowly as harlow the gun trained on him climbed the steps in turn rory followed harlow made a gesture that rory should remain where he was thrust his gun in tracchias back and moved off to search the boat one minute later harlow rory and a blackly scowling tracchia were in the chevaliers brightly lit saloon harlow said no one aboard it seems i take it that mrs macalpine is behind that locked door below i want the key tracchia a deep voice said stand still dont turn round drop that gun harlow stood still didnt turn round and dropped his gun the seaman walked into the saloon from the after door tracchia smiled almost beatifically that was well done pauli my pleasure signor tracchia he passed by rory gave him a contemptuous shove that sent him reeling into a corner of the settee and moved forward to pick up harlows gun you drop your gun now rorys voice had a most distinct quaver to it pauli swung around an expression of total astonishment on his face rory had a gun clutched in two very unsteady hands pauli smiled broadly well well well what a brave little gamecock he brought up his gun rorys hands and arms were trembling like an aspen leaf in an autumn gale he compressed his lips screwed his eyes shut and pulled the trigger in that confined space the report of the gun was deafening but even so not loud enough to drown out paulis shout of agony pauli stared down in stupefaction as the blood from his shattered right shoulder seeped down between the clutching fingers of his left hand tracchia too wore a similarly bemused expression one that changed to one of considerable pain as harlows vicious swinging left hook sank deeply into his stomach he bent double harlow struck him on the back of the neck but tracchia was tough and durable still bent almost double he staggered through the after door out on to the deck as he did so he passed rory very pale and looking very faint and clearly through with shooting exploits for the night it was as well harlow was in such close pursuit that he might well have been the victim of rorys extremely wobbly marksmanship rory looked at the wounded pauli then at the two guns lying at his feet rory rose and pointed his gun at pauli he said sit down painwracked though he was pauli moved with alacrity to obey there was no saying where rorys next unpredictable shot might lodge itself as he moved to a corner of the saloon the sound of blows and grunts of pain could be clearly heard from outside rory scooped up the two guns and ran through the after door on deck the fight had clearly reached its climax tracchia his wildly flailing feet clear of the deck and his body arched like a bow had his back on the guardrail and the upper half of his body over the water harlows hands were on his throat tracchia in turn was belabouring harlows already sadly battered and bruised face but the belabouring was of no avail harlow his face implacable pushed him farther and farther out suddenly changing his tactics he removed his right hand from tracchias throat hooked it under his thighs and proceeded to tip him over the guardrail when tracchia spoke his voice came as a wholly understandable croak i cant swim i cant swim if harlow had heard him there was not even the most minuscule change of expression on his face to register that fact he gave a final convulsive heave the flailing legs disappeared and tracchia entered the water with a resounding splash that threw water as high as harlows face a barred cloud had at last crossed the moon harlow gazed down intently into the water for about fifteen seconds produced his torch and made a complete circuit of the water around the yacht until he arrived back at his starting place again still breathing deeply and quickly he peered over the side then turned to rory he said maybe he was right at that maybe he cant swim rory tore off his jacket i can swim im a very good swimmer mr harlow harlows iron hand grabbed him by the collar of his shirt you rory are out of your mind rory looked at him for a long moment nodded picked up his jacket and put it on again he said vermin yes they went back into the saloon pauli was still huddled in a settee moaning harlow said the key to mrs macalpines cabin pauli nodded in the direction of a cabinet drawer harlow found the key removed the firstaid box from its clip on the bulkhead ushered pauli below at the point of his gun opened the first cabin door gestured pauli inside and threw in the firstaid box he said ill have a doctor here within half an hour meantime i dont care a damn whether you live or die he left and locked the cabin door from the outside in the next cabin a woman of about forty sat on a stool by her bunk pale and thin from her long confinement she was still quite beautiful the resemblance to her daughter was startling she was listless totally apathetic the epitome of resignation and despair the sound of the gun and the commotion on the upper deck could not have gone unregistered but no signs of registration showed in her face a key turned in the lock the door opened and harlow came in she made no move he walked to within three feet of her and still she gazed uncaringly downwards harlow touched her shoulder and said very gently ive come to take you home marie she turned her head in slow and unbelieving wonderment initially and understandably not recognizing the battered face before her then slowly almost incredulously recognition dawned upon her she rose unsteadily to her feet half smiled at him then tremblingly took a step forward put her thin arms around his neck and buried her face in his shoulder johnny harlow she whispered my dear dear johnny johnny harlow what have they done to your face nothing that time wont cure harlow said briskly after all it wasnt all that hot to begin with he patted her back as if to reassure her of his actual presence then gently disengaged himself i think theres someone else who would like to see you marie for someone who claimed that he could not swim tracchia was cleaving through the water like a torpedo he reached the landing steps scrambled up to the quay and headed for the nearest phone booth he put through areverse charge call to vignolles and had to stand there for almost five minutes before his call came through the french telephone service is not world renowned he asked for jacobson and finally reached him in his bedroom tracchias account of the evenings happenings were succinct and to the point but could have been shorter as it was heavily burdened with a wide range of expletives so thats it jake tracchia finished up that bastard has outsmarted us all jacobsons face as he sat on his bed was tight with anger but he was clearly in control of himself he said not quite yet so weve lost our ace in the hole well just have to get ourselves another one wont we you understand meet you at bandol inside the hour usual place passport yes in my bedside table drawer and for christs sake bring me a set of dry clothing or ill have pneumonia before the night is out tracchia emerged from the phone booth he was actually smiling he went to take up position among some crates and barrels seeking a safe position where he could keep the chevalier under observation and in the process of doing so literally tripped over the prostrate yonnie good god yonnie id forgotten just where you were the bound and gagged man looked up with pleading eyes tracchia shook his head sorry cant untie you yet that bastard harlow young macalpine rather has shot pauli i had to swim for it the two of them will be coming ashore any minute harlow may check whether youre still here if he does and youre gone hell raise a hue and cry immediately if youre still here hell reckon that you can be left in cold storage for a while gives us more time to play with when theyve landed and gone take the dinghy out to the chevalier find a bag and stuff it with all the papers in the two top drawers of the charttable god if the police were ever to lay hands on that lot among other things your days would be numbered youll take them to your place in marseilles in my car and wait mere if you get those papers youre in the clear harlow didnt recognize you it was too dark in the shadows here nobody even knows your name understand yonnie nodded glumly then turned his head in the direction of the harbor tracchia nodded the sound of the outboard was unmistakable and soon the dinghy appeared in sight round the bows of the chevalier tracchia prudently withdrew twenty or thirty yards along the waterfront the dinghy came alongside the landing steps and rory was the first out painter in hand as he secured the dinghy harlow helped marie ashore then followed himself her suitcase in his hand his gun was in his other hand tracchia toyed briefly with the idea of waylaying harlow in the shadows but almost immediately and very prudently changed his mind he knew that harlow would be in no mood to be taking any chances and if necessary would shoot and shoot to kill without the slightest compunction harlow came straight to where yonnie lay bent over him straightened and said hell keep the three crossed the road to the nearest phone booth the one that tracchia had lately occupiedand harlow went inside tracchia moved stealthily along behind the cover of barrels and crates until he reached yonnie he produced a knife and cut him free yonnie sat up and he had the expression of a man who would have given a great deal to be able to shout in pain he rubbed hands and wrists in agony rory was no respecter of circulations by and by gingerly and clearly not enjoying the process he removed the insulated tape from his face he opened his mouth but tracchia clapped his hand across it to prevent what would be doubtless a torrential outpouring of imprecations quiet tracchia whispered theyre just on the other side of the road harlows in the phone booth he removed his hand when they leave im going to follow them to see that they do really leave bandol as soon as theyre out of sight get down to the dinghy use the oars we dont want harlow hearing the outboard start up and coming back to investigate me row yonnie said huskily he flexed his fingers and winced my hands are dead youd better get them back to life fast tracchia said unfeelingly or youre going to be dead ah now he lowered his voice still further hes just left the phone box be dead quiet that bastard harlow can hear a leaf drop twenty feet away harlow rory and mrs macalpine walked up a street away from the waterfront they turned a corner and disappeared tracchia said get going he watched yonnie head for the landing steps then followed quickly after the trio in front for about three minutes he trailed them at a very discreet distance indeed then lost sight of them as they turned another left corner he peered cautiously round the corner saw that it was a culdesac hesitated and then stiffened as he heard the unmistakable sound of a ferrari engine starting up shivering violently in his still soaking clothes he pressed himself into the darkness of a recessed and unlit alleyway the ferrari emerged from the culdesac turned left and headed north out of bandol tracchia watched it go then hurried back to the phone booth there was the usual frustrating delay in getting through to vignolles eventually he succeeded in reaching jacobson he said harlows just left with rory and mrs macalpine he made a phone call before he left almost certainly to vignolles to tell macalpine that hes got his wife back id leave by the back door if i were you no worry jacobson sounded confident i am leaving by the back door the fireescape ive already got our cases in the aston and our passports in my pocket im now on my way to collect our third passport see you tracchia replaced the receiver he was about to open the booth door when he stopped and stood as if a man turned to stone a large black citroen had slid silently down to the waterfront showing only sidelights even those were switched off before the car came to a halt no flashing lights no howling sirens but it was indisputably a police car and one paying a very private visit four uniformed policemen came out of the car tracchia pried open the door of the booth so that the automatic light went out then leaned as far back as possible praying that he wouldnt be seen he wasnt the four policemen at once disappeared behind the barrels where yonnie had been two of them with lit torches in hand and reappeared within ten seconds one of them carrying some unidentifiable objects in his hand tracchia did not need to see it to know what the man was carrying the twine and black tape that had immobilized and silenced yonnie the four policemen held a brief conference then headed for the landing steps twenty seconds later a rowing boat was heading purposefully but silently towards the chevalier tracchia emerged from the booth fists clenched his face black with anger and softly but audibly swearing to himself the only printable word and one that was repeated many times was harlow the bitter realization had come to tracchia that harlow had not phoned vignolles he had phoned the local police in her room in vignolles mary was getting ready for dinner when a knock came at her door she opened it to find jacobson standing there he said can i have a private word with you mary its very important she regarded him with mild astonishment then opened the door for him to enter jacobson closed the door behind him she said curiously whats so important what do you want jacobson pulled a gun from his waistband you im in trouble and i need some form of security to make sure that i dont get into more trouble youre the security pack an overnight bag and give me your passport she gave him her passport and packed the bag jacobson crossed to the bed and snapped shut the catches of her case youd better come now where are you taking me now i said he lifted his gun menacingly then youd better shoot me now number eight cuneo then parts beyond his voice was harsh but had the ring of sincerity i never make war on women youll be released within twentyfour hours ill be dead in twentyfour hours she picked up her handbag may i go to the bathroom i feel sick jacobson opened the bathroom door and looked inside no window no telephone ok mary entered the bathroom and closed the door behind her she took a pen from her handbag scribbled a few shaky words on a piece of paper placed the paper face down on the floor behind the door and left jacobson was waiting for her he had her case in his left hand a gun in the other both gun and right hand were buried deep in his jacket pocket on board the chevalier yonnie thrust the last of the documents from the charttable into a large briefcase he returned to the saloon placed the briefcase on a settee and went down the companionway to the accommodation quarters he went to his own cabin and there spent a hurried five minutes in cramming his own most personal possessions into a canvas bag he then made a tour of the other cabins rifling the drawers for whatever money or articles of value that he might find he found a considerable amount returned to his own cabin and stuffed them inside his bag he zipped the bag shut and climbed up the companionway four steps from the top he stopped his face should have been masked in disbelief and terror but it wasnt yonnie had run out of emotions and the capacity to display them four very large armed policemen were resting comfortably on the settees in the saloon a sergeant with the briefcase on his knees his elbow on the case and a gun in his hand pointing approximately hi the direction of yonnies heart said genially going some place yonnie chapter twelve once again the ferrari was moving through the darkness harlow was not idling but neither was he pushing the car hard as on the trip from marseilles to bandol it seemed that the need for urgency was not there mrs macalpine was in the front passenger seat wearing at harlows insistence a double safety belt a rather drowsy rory was stretched out on the back seats harlow said so you see it was all quite simple really jacobson was the mastermind behind this particular operation it will turn out that the marzio brothers were the ones that really mattered anyway it was jacobsons idea to gamble on the grand prix drivers and he altered the odds in his favour by suborning no fewer that five drivers plus even more mechanics he paid them plenty but he made a fortune himself i was the thorn in his flesh he knew better than to try to get at me and as i was winning the majority f the races it was making his business very difficult indeed so he tried to kill me at clermontferrand i have proof both stills and cine film in the rear rory stirred sleepily but how could he do that to you while you were on the track me and a lot of others two ways a radiocontrolled explosive device on a suspension strut or a chemically operated explosive device on the hydraulic brake lines both devices i imagine would blow clear on detonation and leave no trace of their presence anyway its on film record that jacobson replaced both a strut and a brake line rory said which is why he always insisted on being alone when inspecting smashed cars harlow nodded temporarily lost in thought mrs macalpine said but how how could you degrade yourself in this awful fashion well it wasnt all that pleasant but you know the blaze of publicity i live in i couldnt move privately more or less to brush my teeth than to do the job i was asked to i had to take the heat off myself step out of the limelight and become a loner it wasnt all that difficult as for working my way down to the transporter job well i had to find out whether the stuff was coming from the coronado garage or not it was the stuff the dust european jargon for heroin my dear marie there are more ways to dusty death than losing control on a grand prix racetrack the way to dusty death she shivered and repeated the words the way to dusty death did james know about this johnny he knew six months ago that the transporter was being used oddly enough he never suspected jacobson theyd been together too long i suppose some way any way they had to have the price of his silence you were that price and for good measure he was also being blackmailed for approximately twentyfive thousand pounds a month she was silent for almost a minute then she said did james know i was still alive yes but he knew about the heroin all those months he knew think of all those people ruined perhaps dead think of all harlow reached out his right hand and caught her left in his i think marie that perhaps he loves you a car approached then headlights dipped harlow dipped his briefly as if by mistake the approaching cars headlights came on full beam then dipped again as they passed each other the driver of the other cab turned to his passenger a girl with her hands bound in front of her tut tut tut jacobson sounded in almost high humour young lochinvar headed in the wrong direction in the ferrari mrs macalpine said and james will have to stand trial for his complicity in this heroin traffic james will never stand trial for anything but heroin harlow said heroin heroin rory did you hear anyone mentioning the word heroin mothers been through a pretty rough time mr harlow i think she is beginning to imagine things the aston martin pulled up outside a darkened cafe on the outskirts of bandol a violently shivering traccia emerged from the shadows and climbed into the back of the aston martin he said complete with insurance policy i see now for gods sake jake stop at the first clump of trees outside bandol unless i change out of these clothes damn quick im going to freeze to death right wheres yonnie in gaol jesus even the abnormally phlegmatic jacobson was shaken what in the hell happened id sent yonnie out in the dinghy while i was phoning you id told him to bring ashore all the papers and documents in the two top drawers in the charttable you know how important those are jake i know there was no disguising the harsh edge of strain in jacobsons voice remember id told you that i thought harlow had phoned vignolles he hadnt the bastard had phoned the bandol police they arrived while i was still in the phone booth there was nothing i could do they rowed out to the chevalier and nabbed him there and the papers one of the police was carrying a large attache case i dont think that bandol is a very healthy place for us to be jacobson was back on balance again he drove off but not in a fashion ostentatious enough to attract attention as they reached the outskirts of the town he said thats it then what with those papers and that cassette the whole operations blown termine fine the end of the road he seemed remarkably calm and now operation flyaway ive had it planned for months first stop is our flat in cuneo nobody knows about it nobody except willi and he wont talk besides its not under our names anyway he pulled up alongside a thicket of trees the boots unlocked and the grey case is yours those clothes youre wearing leave them among the trees why its a perfectly good suit and whats going to happen if the customs search us and find a suit of soaking wet clothes you have a point tracchia said and got out of the car when he returned in two or three minutes jacobson was in the back seat tracchia said you want me to drive were in a hurry and my name is not nicolo tracchia as tracchia engaged gear he went on we should have no trouble with the customs and police at the col de tende the word wont be out for hours yet its quite possible that they havent discovered that mary is missing yet besides theyve no idea where were heading no reason why they should notify border police but by the time we reach the swiss frontier we may be in trouble so two hours in cuneo well switch cars leave the aston in the garage and take the peugeot pack some more clothes for ourselves pick up our other passports and identification papers then call in erita and our photographer friend within the hour erita will have turned our mary into a blonde and very shortly afterwards our friend will have a nice shiny british passport for her then we drive up to switzerland if the word is out then the border boys will be on the alert well as alert as those cretins can be in the middle of the night but theyll be looking for an aston martin with one man and a brunette inside thats assuming our friends back in vignolles have managed to put two and two together which i very much doubt but they wont be looking for two men and blonde in a peugeot with passports carrying completely different names tracchia was now driving the car close to its limits and he had almost to shout to make himself heard the aston martin is a magnificent machine but not particularly renowned for the quietness of its engine there were carping critics who occasionally maintained that the engines for the david brown tractor division found their way into the wrong machines ferrari and lamborghini owners had been known to describe it as the fastest lorry in europe tracchia said you sound very sure of yourself jake i am tracchia glanced at the girl by his side and mary here god knows were no angels but i dont want any harm to come to her no harm i told her i dont make war on women and ill keep my word on that shes our safe conduct if the police come after us or johnny harlow or harlow when we get to zurich each of us will go to the bank in turns cash and transfer money while the others keeps her as hostage then we fly out into the wild blue yonder you expect trouble in zurich none we havent even been arrested far less convicted so our zurich friends wont open up besides were under different names and with numbered accounts the wild blue yonder with teleprinted copies of our photographs at every airport in the world only the major ones on scheduled flights lots of minor airfields around theres a private flight division in kloten airport and i have a pilot friend there hell file a flight plan for geneva which will mean that we dont have to pass customs well land somewhere quite a way from switzerland he can always claim that he was hijacked ten thousand swiss francs should fit it you think of everything dont you jake there was genuine admiration in tracchias voice i try jacobson uncharacteristically sounded almost complacent i try the red ferrari was drawn up outside the chalet in vignolles macalpine held his sobbing wife in his arms but he was not looking as happy as he might have done in the circumstances dunnet approached harlow how do you feel boy bloody well exhausted ive bad news johnny jacobsons gone he can wait ill get him theres more to it than that johnny what hes token mary with him harlow stood immobile his drawn and weary face without expression he said does james know ive just told him and i think hes just telling his wife he handed a note to harlow i found this in marys bathroom harlow looked at it jacobson is taking me to cuneo without even a pause he said ill go now you cant man youre totally exhausted you said so yourself not any more come with me dunnet accepted the inevitable you stop me but ive no gun guns we have rory said he produced four as proof of his assertion we harlow said youre not coming i would remind you mr harlow rory said with some asperity that i saved your life twice tonight all good things come in threes i have the right harlow nodded you have the right macalpine and his wife were staring numbly at them the expressions on their faces were an extraordinary combination of happiness and a broken bewilderment macalpine said tears in his eyes alexis has told me everything ill never be able to thank you ill never be able to forgive myself and the rest of my life will be too short for the apologies i have to make to you you destroyed your career ruined yourself to bring my marie back ruined me harlow said calmly nonsense theres another season coming up he smiled without mirth and therell be a fair bit of the topflight opposition missing he smiled again this time encouragingly ill bring mary back with your help james everybody knows you you know everybody and youre a millionaire theres only one way from here to cuneo phone someone preferably some big trucking firm in nice offer them ј to block the french end of the cool de tende my passports gone you understand ive a friend in nice who would do it for nothing but whats the use johnny its a job for the police no and im not thinking about the continental habit of first of all riddling wanted cars and then asking the dead bodies questions what i johnny whether you or the police get to them first makes no difference i know now that you know everything have known for a long time those are the two men who will bring me down harlow said mildly theres a third man james willi neubauer but hell never talk admission to kidnapping would bring him another ten years in prison you werent listening to me james phone nice phone nice now all i said was that i would bring mary back macalpine and his wife stood together listening to the howl of the ferrari engine die away in the distance in what was almost a whisper marie macalpine said what did that mean james all i said is that i would bring mary back ive got to phone nice and at once then the biggest drink the chateau can offer a small dinner then bed theres nothing more we can do now he paused then went on almost sadly i have my limitations i do not operate in johnny harlows class what did he mean james what he said macalpine tightened his arm around his wifes shoulder he brought you back didnt he hell bring our mary back dont you know theyre in love what did he mean james macalpine said in a dead voice tie meant that neither of us would ever see jacobson and tracchia again the nightmare journey to the col de tende a journey that would live in the minds of dunnet and rory for ever was conducted with only one exception in absolute conversational silence partially because harlow was completely concentrated on the job on hand partially because both dunnet and rory had been reduced to a state pretty close to abject terror harlow was not only driving the ferrari to its limitsin the opinions of his two passengers he was driving it far beyond its limits as they drove along the autoroute between cannes and nice dunnet looked at the speedometer it read kph something over miles per hour he said may i say something for a flicker of a second harlow glanced at him but of course jesus christ almighty superstar if you want the best driver in the world like enough the best driver whos ever lived but in all bloody hell language harlow said mildly my young future brotherinlaw is sitting behind us this is the way you earn a living well yes while the seatbelted dunnet clung in desperate apprehension to any available handhold harlow braked changed down and with all four wheels in a screaming slide and at just under a hundred miles an hour rounded a corner that few other drivers however competent would have attempted at seventy but you must admit its better than working jesus dunnet lapsed into a semistunned silence and closed his eyes like a man in prayer very probably he was the no the road between nice and la giandola where it links up with the road from ventimiglia is a very winding one with some spectacular hairpins and rising in places to over three thousand feet but harlow treated it all as if he were driving along the autoroute presently both dunnet and rory had their eyes closed it could have been exhaustion but more likely they didnt want to see what was going on the road was entirely empty they crossed over the col de braus went through sospel at a ludicrously illegal speed passed through the col de brouis and reached la giandola without having met a single car which was perhaps just as well for the nerves of any driver who might have been coming the other way then they went north through saorge fontan and finally the township of tende itself it was just beyond tende that dunnet stirred and opened his eyes he said am i still alive i think so dunnet rubbed his eyes what was that you just said about your brotherinlaw just was a long time ago harlow pondered looks as if someone has to look after the macalpine family i might as well make it official you secretive soandso engaged well no i havent asked her yet and i have news for you alexis youre going to drive this car back to vignolles while i sleep the sleep of the just in the back seat with mary you havent even asked her yet and youre certain youre going to get her back dunnet looked at harlow in disbelief and shook his head you johnny harlow are the most arrogant human being ive ever known dont you knock my future brotherinlaw mr dunnet rory said sleepily from the back by the way mr harlow if i am going to be your brotherinlaw can i call you johnny harlow smiled you can call me anything you like just as long as its said in a tone of proper respect yes mr harlow johnny i mean suddenly his voice was no longer sleepy do you see what i see ahead of them were the headlights of a car negotiating the vicious hairpins of the lower end of the col de tende ive been seeing it for quite some time tracchia dunnet looked at him how can you tell two things harlow dropped two gears as he approached the first hairpin there arent half a dozen people in europe who can drive a car the way that car is being driven he dropped another gear and slid round the hairpin with all the calm relaxation of a man sitting in a pew in a church show an art expert fifty different paintings and hell immediately tell you who the artist is im not talking about anything so wildly different as rembrandt and renoir the same school of painters i can recognize the driving technique of any grand prix driver in the world after all there are fewer grand prix drivers than there are painters traccia has the habit of braking slightly early for a corner then accelerating quickly through it he threw the ferrari tyres shrieking in protest round the next corner thats tracchia it was indeed tracchia seated beside him jacobson was peering anxiously through the rear window he said theres someone coming up behind its a public road anyone can use it believe me nikki this is not just anyone in the ferrari harlow said i think we better get ready he pressed a button and the windows slid down then he reached for his gun and placed it beside him and ill be greatly obliged if neither of you shoot mary dunnet said i just hope to hell that tunnels blocked he brought out his own gun the tunnel was indeed blocked completely and solidly blocked a very large furniture van was jammed diagonally and apparently immovably into its mouth the aston martin rounded the last hairpin tracchia swore bitterly and braked the car to a halt both men gazed apprehensively through the rear window mary looked too though with hope not fear jacobson said dont tell me that damned truck jammed there is sheer coincidence turn the car nikki god there they are the ferrari came sliding round the last corner and accelerated towards them tracchia tried desperately to turn his car a manoeuvre made more difficult when harlow braking heavily rammed his ferrari into the side of the aston jacobson had his gun out and was firing at apparent random jacobson harlow said urgently not tracchia youll kill mary both men leaned out of their windows and fired just as their windscreen smashed and starred jacobson ducked low for safety but he ducked too late he screamed in agony as two bullets lodged in his left shoulder in the confusion and noise mary opened the door and jumped out as quickly as her crippled leg would permit her neither man for the moment even noticed that she was gone tracchia only the top of his head visible above the windscreen eventually managed to wrench his car round and clear then accelerated desperately away four seconds later with dunnet having practically dragged mary inside the ferrari was in pursuit harlow apparently oblivious to the inflicted cuts had already smashed his fist through the shattered windscreendunnet completed the work with the butt of his pistol not once but several times mary cried out in fear as harlow took the ferrari down through the hairpins of the col de tende rory had his arm round his sister and although he did not voice his fear he was plainly just as terrified as mary was dunnet firing his gun through the empty space where the windscreen had been didnt look particularly happy either harlows face was still implacable to an observer it must have appeared that the car was being driven by a maniac but harlow was in complete control to the accompaniment of the sound of tortured tyres and engine bellowing in the lower gears he descended the cool as no one had ever done before and assuredly no one would ever do again by the sixth hairpin he was only a matter of feet behind the aston stop shooting harlow shouted he had to shout to make himself heard above the sound of an engine at maximum revolutions in bottom gear why because its not final enough the aston now only a cars length ahead slid desperately round a righthand hairpin bend harlow instead of braking accelerated spun the wheel viciously to the right and the car slid halfway round the corner on all four screaming skidding tyres at rightangles to its line of travel only a second previously apparently completely out of control but harlow had judged matters to a hairraising degree of nicety the side of the ferrari smashed fairly and squarely into that of the aston the ferrari already practically stopped rebounded into the middle of the curve the aston moving diagonally now and hopelessly unmanageable slid out towards the edge beyond the edge there was a drop of six hundred feet into the darkened and unseen depths of a ravine below harlow was out of the stopped ferrari just before the teetering aston vanished over the side he was followed almost immediately by the others they peered over the edge of the road the aston descending with apparently incredible slowness turned slowly over and over as it fell it disappeared into the depths and the darkness of the ravine there was a brief thunderclap of sound and a great gout of brilliant orange flame that seemed to reach halfway up to where they stood then there was only the silence and the darkness on the road above all four stood quiet and still like people in a trance then mary shuddering buried her face in harlows shoulder he put his arm around her and continued to gaze down unseeingly as it seemed into the hidden depths of the ravine the end
