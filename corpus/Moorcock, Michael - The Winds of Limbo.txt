the winds of limbothe winds of limbo by michael moorcock when the fireclown spoke promising salvation and life to the dying planet his listeners trembled what was the secret of his hypnotic power did he plan to save earth for all mankindor to make it his slaveplanet chapter one it was a vast cavern part of it was natural part of it had been hollowed out by the machines of men some parts were deep in dancing shadows and others were brilliantly illuminated by a great blazing massa roaring crackling miniature replica of the sun itself that hung constantly quivering and erupting near the high roof beneath this blazing orb a tall column rose up as if to meet it and arms akimbo upon a platform at the top stood a gross figure clad in ragged harlequin costume a soft floppy conical hat was jammed over his lank yellow hair his fatrounded face was painted white his eyes and mouth adorned with smears of red yellow and black and on the ragged red jerkin stretched taut upon his great belly was a vivid yellow sunburst below this gross harlequin the dense crowd surrounding the column ceased its movement as he raised an orange hand that seemed to shoot from his torn sleeve like fingers of flame he laughed it was as if the sun had voiced unearthly humor speak to us the crowd pleaded fireclown speak to us he ceased his laughing and looked down at them with a peculiar expression moving behind the paint at length he bellowed i am the fireclown speak to us i am the fireclown equipped for your salvation i am the gift bearer alive with the fire of life from which the earth itself was formed i am the earths brother a woman in a padded dress representing the body of a lion cried shrilly and what are we you are maggots feeding off your mother when you mate it is like corpses coupling when you laugh it is the sound of the winds of limbo why why shouted a young man with a lean mean face and a pointed chin that could pierce a throat he leaped exuberantly while his eyes glinted and looked you have shunned the natural life and worshipped the artificial but you are not lostnot yet what shall we do sobbed a government official sweating in the purple jacket and purple pantaloons of his rank caught by the ritual enough to fidget and forget to stay in the shadows his cry was echoed by the crowd what shall we do follow me i will reinstate you as children of the sun and brothers of the earth spurn meand you perish in your artificiality renounced by nature on whom you have turned your proud backs and again the clown broke into a laugh he breathed heavily and roared his insane and enigmatic humor at the cavern roof flames from the suspended miniature sun leaped stretched and shot out as if to kiss the fireclowns acolytes who laughed and shouted surging about him applauding him the fireclown looked down as he laughed drinking in their adoration in a shadow cast by the dais detached from the milling crowd a gaunt negro stood as if petrified his eyelids painted in checks of red and white his mouth colored green he wore an extravagant yellow cutaway coat and scarlet tights he looked up at the fireclown and there were tears of hunger in his eyes the negros name was junnar the faces of the crowd were lashed and slashed by the leaping fire some eyes dull some bright some eyes blind and some hot overloaded with heat many of the figures wore masks molded in plastic to caricature their own faceslong noses no noses slit eyes cow eyes lipless mouths gaping mouths some were painted in gaudy colors others were naked and some wore padded clothes representing animals or plants here they gathered around the dais many hundreds of them loving the man who capered like a jester above them lashing them with his wriggling rhetoric laughing laughing scientists pickpockets spacemen explorers musicians confidence tricksters blackmailers poets doctors whores murderers clerks perverts government officials spies policemen social workers beggars actors politicians riffraff here they all were and they shouted and as they shouted the gross fool capered yet more wildly and the flame responded frenetically to his dancing and his own wordless cries the fireclown they sobbed the fireclown they bellowed the fireclown the fireclown they howled and laughed the fireclown he giggled and he danced like a madmans puppet upon his dais and sang his mirth all this in the lowest level of the multistoried labyrinth that was the city of switzerland with a great effort the negro junnar turned his eyes away from the fireclown stumbled backwards wrenched his body round and ran for one of the back exits bent on leaving before he was completely trapped by the fireclowns spell behind him the sound of the maddened crowd diminished as he ran along fusty illsmelling corridors until he could no longer hear it then he began to walk up ramps and stairs until he came to an escalator he stepped on to the escalator and let himself be taken up to the top a hundred feet from the bottom this corridor was also deserted but better lighted and cleaner that those he had left he looked up and found a sign at an intersection ninth level hogarth laneleading to divebomber street and orangeblossom road he made for orangeblossom road an old residential corridor but very sparsely inhabited these days found the elevators at the end pressed a button and waited impatiently for five minutes before one arrived he entered it and rose nonstop to the fortyninth level outside he crossed the bright bustling corridor and got into a crowded lift bound for the sixtyfifththe topmostlevel the liveried operator recognized him and said deferentially any tips for when the next elections going to be held mr junnar junnar abstracted tried to smile politely he shook his head tomorrow if the rlms had their way he said but were not worried people have faith in the solrefs he frowned he had caught himself using a party slogan again apparently the operator hadnt noticed but junnar thought he saw a hint of irony in the mans eyes he ignored it frowned again this time for a different reason obviously people were losing faith in the solar referendum party a sign of the times he thought at length the elevator reached the sixtyfifth level and the operator called out conscientiously sixtyfive please show appointment cards as you go through the barrier the people began to shuffle out some towards the transport that would take them right across the vast plateau of the top level some towards the distant buildings comprising the seat of government various ministries and the private accommodations of important statesmen politicians and civil servants built with the money of frightened businessmen during the war scares of the s the city had grown upwards and outwards so that it now covered almost twothirds of what was once the country of switzerlandone vast building a warren with mountains embedded in it it had begun as a warren of supershelters below the mountains the war scares had died down but the city had remained along with the businessmen and when the world government was formed in it seemed the natural place for the capital in in a bid to get full rights of citizenship for outworld settlers the solar referendum party had been formed four years later it had risen to power its first act had been to declare that from henceforth they were a solar government running the affairs of the federation of solar planets but since then more than sixty years had passed the solrefs had lost much of their original dynamism having become the most powerfully conservative party in the solar house the official at the barrier knew junnar and waved him through sun poured in through the glassalloy dome far above his head and the artificially scented air was refreshing after the untainted stuff of the middle levels and the impure air of the lowest he walked across the turfcovered plaza listening to the splashing fountains that at intervals glinted among beds of exotic flowers he was struck by the contrast between the hot excitement the smell of sweat and the surge of bodies he had just left and this cool wellcontrolled expanse artificially maintained yet as beautiful as anything nature could produce but he did not pause to savor the view his pace was hurried compared with the movement of the few other people who sauntered with dignity along the paths at a distance the tall white blue and silver buildings of the ambiguously named private level reflected the sun and enhanced the atmosphere of calm and assurance of the top junnar crossed the plaza and walked up a clean graveled path towards the wide stone arch that opened on to a shady court around this court many windows looked down upon the cool pool in its center goldfish glinted in the pool at the archway a porter left his lodge and planted himself on the path until junnar reached him he was a sourfaced man dressed in a dark grey blouse and pantaloons he looked at junnar with vague disapproval as the flamboyant negro stopped and produced his pass sighing here you are drew youre very conscientious today my job is to check all passes sir junnar smiled at him you dont recognize me is that it i recognize you very well sir but it would be more than my jobs worth to let me in without checking my pass junnar finished for him youre an annoying man drew the porter didnt reply he was not afraid of incurring junnars disapproval since he had a strong union that would be only too ready to take up cudgels on his behalf if he was fired without adequate grounds so temporarily disoriented was junnar that he allowed this tiny conflict to carry him further and as he went into the court he shrugged and said its better to have friends than enemies though drew immediately he felt foolish he took out a pack of proprietary brand marijuanas and lit one as he went through a glasspanelled door into the quiet deserted hall of the building the hall was lined with mirrors he stood staring at himself in one of them drawing deeply on the sweet smoke collecting his thoughts and pulling himself together this was the third time he had aliened one of the fireclowns audiences and each lime the clowns magnetism had drawn him closer and the atmosphere of the great cavern had affected him more profoundly he didnt want his employer to notice that after a moments contemplation junnar went to the central glass panel which was on the right and withdrew a small oblong box from his pocket he put it close to his mouth junnar he said the panel slid back to reveal a black empty shaft there was a peculiar dancing quality about the blackness junnar stepped into it and instantaneously was opening the inner door of a cabinet he walked out and the door closed behind him he was in a corridor lighted by windows that stretched from floor to ceiling and showed in the distance the thick banks of summer cloud far below immediately opposite him was a great door of redtimed chrome it now opened slightly in the big beautiful room two men awaited him one was young one was old both showed physical similarities both appeared impatient junnar entered the room and dropped his cigarette into a disposal column good afternoon sir he said to the old man and nodded to the young man good afternoon mr powys the old man spoke his voice rich and resonant well junnar whats happening down there now chapter two alan powys fingered the case of papers under his arm studying his grandfather and the painted negro as they confronted one another they made a strange pair minister simon powys was tall and heavy without much obvious fat but his face was as grim and disturbing as an easter island gods the leonine set of his head was further enhanced by the flowing mane of white hair which reached almost to his shoulders hanging straight as if carved he wore the standard purple suit of a highranking cabinet ministerhe was minister for space transport an important officepleated jacket padded pantaloons red stockings and white pumps his white shirt was open at the neck to reveal old but firm flesh and on his breast was a golden star symbol of his rank junnar was sighing and spreading his hands if you minister powys want to stop him you should act now his power increases daily people are flocking to him he seems harmless insofar as he doesnt appear to have any great political ambitions but his power could be used to threaten societys stability could be im sure it will be minister powys spoke heavily but can we convince parliament of the danger theres the irony probably not alan powys spoke distantly conscious of an outsiders presence he thought he glimpsed momentarily a strange expression on the negros face helen and that mob of rabblerousers she calls a political party are only too pleased to encourage him minister powys grumbled not to mention certain members of the government who seem as fascinated by him as schoolgirls on their first dates he straightened his shoulders which were beginning to stoop with old age there must be some way of showing them their mistake alan powys chose not to argue with his grandfather in junnars presence personally however he thought the old man overemphasized the fireclowns importance perhaps junnar sensed this for he said softly the fireclown has a certain ability to attract and hold interest the most unlikely people seem to have come under his spell his magnetism is intense and almost irresistible have you been to one of his audiences mr powys alan shook his head then go to onebefore you judge believe me he has something hes more than a crank alan wondered why the normally selfpossessed and taciturn negro should choose to speak in this way perhaps one day he would attend a meeting he certainly was curious who is he anyway alan asked as his grandfather paced towards the window comprising the outer wall of the room no one knows junnar said his origins like his theories are obscure he will not tell anyone his real name there are no records of his fingerprints at identity center he seems demented but no mental hospital has heard of him perhaps as he says he came down from the sun to save the world dont be facetious junnar minister powys pursed his lips paused then took a long breath and said who was down there today vernitz chief of the china policehe is in the city on a vacation and to attend the police conference next sixday martha gheld professor of electrobiology at tel aviv all the persian representatives currently elected to parliament including isfahan minister powys was too well bred to shout but there was astonishment in his voice isfahan was the leader of the solref faction in the solar house including all the persian solrefs im afraid junnar nodded not to mention a number of dutch swedish and mexican party members we had advised our members not to take part in the fireclowns farcical audiences p doubtless they were all there on factfinding missions alan interrupted a faint gleam in his eyes doubtless powys said grimly choosing to ignore his grandsons irony your niece was there too junnar said quietly that doesnt surprise me the womans a fool to think that she could be the next president alan knew that his cousin helen curtis leader of the radical liberal movement and his grandfather were both planning to run for president in the forthcoming presidential elections one of them was sure to win all right junnar simon powys dismissed his secretary the negro went out through a side door opening on an inner passage leading to his own office when the door had closed alan said i think you place too much importance on this character grandfather hes harmless enough perhaps he could threaten societybut its doubtful if he would you seem to have an obsession about him no one else in politics at least seems so concerned if the situation became serious people would soon leave him or act against him why not wait and see no i seem to have an obsession do i well it may be that im the only man not blinded to what this fireclown represents i have already drafted a bill which if it gets passed could easily put a stop to the fools posturing alan laid his briefcase on the desk and sat down in one of the deep armchairs but will it surely it isnt wise at this stage to back what could easily be an unpopular motion the fireclown is an attractive figure to most peopleand as yet harmless if you were to oppose him openly it might cost you votes in the presidential election you could lose it alan felt he had scored a point he knew how important winning was to the old man since the formation of the solar referendum party a powys of every generation had held the presidential chair for at least one term of his lifea powys had in fact formed the first solref cabinet yet it was likely the powys would not be voted in for public opinion was gradually going against the solrefs and tending to favor the more vociferous and dynamic rlm which had grown rapidly in strength under helen curtiss fiery leadership throughout his life simon powys had aimed at the presidency and this would be his last chance to gain it i have never sacrificed principles for mere votecatching simon powys said scornfully it is unworthy of a powys to suggest it alan your mother would have been horrified if she had heard such a remark coming from her own son though you have the look of a powys the blood whoever gave it you is not powys blood for a second before he controlled himself alan felt pain at this remark this was the first time his grandfather had referred to his obscure originshe had been illegitimate his mother dying soon after he was born though in his grim way simon powys had assured his grandsons education and position he had always been withdrawn from alan caring for him but not encouraging friendship or love his wife had died five years earlier and she and alan had been close when eleanor powys died simon had begun to see a little more of alan but had always remained slightly distant however this remark about his bastardy was the first spoken in anger obviously the matter of the presidency was weighing on his mind alan ignored the elder powys reference and smiled city administrationif i may return to the original topicisnt worried by the fireclown he inhabits the disused lower levels and gives us no trouble doesnt threaten to come upstairs at all leave him alone grandfatherat least until after the election minister powys went to the picture window and stared out into the twilight his erect body silhouetted against the distant mountains the fireclown is a tangible threat alan he has admitted that he is bent on the destruction of our whole society on the rejection of all its principles of progress and democracy with his babbling of fireworship and natureworship the fireclown threatens to throw us all back to disorganized and retrogressive savagery grandfatherthe man isnt that powerful you place too much importance on him simon powys shook his head his heavy hands clasping behind him i say i do not then you are wrong p alan said angrily half aware that his anger was not so much inspired by the old mans righteousness as by his earlier wounding remark simon powys remained with his back to alan silent at least his grandfathers solid reputation for integrity and sticking to what he thought was well earned alan reflected but that reputation might not save him if the fireclown became a political issue in the elections his own view shared with a great many people was that the fireclowns mysterious appearance a year ago was welcome as an agent to relieve the comparative monotony of running the smoothly ordered city of switzerland goodbye grandfather he said picking up his briefcase im going home ive got a lot of work to get through this evening simon powys turneda considered and majestic movement you may like to know that i have approached the city council on this matter suggesting that they completely seal off the lower levels i hope they will adopt my suggestion city administration of course would be responsible for carrying it out as assistant director you would probably be in charge of the project if the city council has any sense theyll ignore your suggestion they have no evidence of lawbreaking on the fireclowns part they can take no legal steps against him all he has done so far as i can see is to address a public meetingand that isnt a crime in this democracy youve been boasting of to make it one would invalidate your whole argument dont you agree one short step back could save us from a long slide down minister powys said curtly as alan left the room entering the elevator that would take him home to the sixtyfourth level alan decided that he could have misjudged his grandfather over the matter of the fireclown he had heard a great deal about him and his audiences and emotionally was attracted by the romantic character of the man but he had argued the fireclowns case too strongly without really knowing it at first hand he left the elevator and crossed to the middle of the corridor taking the fastway belt towards his flat as he neared it he crossed to the slowway with instinctive practice produced a small box from his pocket and spoke his name into it the door of the flat opened in the wall in the passage his manservant took his briefcase and carried it into the study we were expecting you home earlier sir madeleine apologizes but she feels the polter may be overdone my fault stefanos he was not particularly fond of synthetic poultry anyway and miss curtis is waiting for you in the living room i told her you hadnt dined thats all right outwardly decisive he was inwardly confused he even felt a slight trembling in his legs and cursed himself for an uncontrolled buffoon he had only seen helen once briefly since their affair had ended at a party he entered the austere living room good evening helen how are you they did not shake hands hello alan he could not guess why she was here but he did not particularly want to know he was afraid he might get involved emotionally with her again he sat down she seated herself opposite him in the other padded armless chair she was made upwhich was unusual her lips were a light green and she had on some sort of ultrawhite powder her eyebrows and eyelids were red her taste he thought had never been all it might she had an almost triangular face short black hair and a small nose so that she looked rather like a catsave for the makeup which made her look like a corpse i hear you attended the fireclowns audience today he said casually where did you hear that bush telegraph have you been at a cocktail party no he smiled halfheartedly but spies are everywhere these days youve been to see uncle simon then is he planning to use the information against me in the election i dont think sono she was evidently nervous her voice was shaking slightly probably his own was too they had been very closein love evenand the break when it had finally come had been made in anger he had not been alone with her since what do you think your chances are of winning it she smiled good yes they seem to be will you be pleased she knew very well that he wouldnt be her political ambitions had been the main reason for their parting unlike all the rest of his family including remote cousins he had no interest in politics maybe he thought with a return of his earlier bitterness simon powys had been right about his blood being inherited from his unknown father he shook his head shrugging slightly smiling vaguely ii dont know he lied of course he would be disappointed if she won he hated the political side of her character whereas he had nothing against women in politicsit would have been atavistic and unrealistic if he had an objectionhe felt that her talents lay elsewhere perhaps in the painting she no longer had time for she had been potentially a very fine painter its time the solar system had a shakeup she said the solrefs have been in for too long probably he said noncommittally then desperate to get it over why are you here helen i wanted some help what kind of help personal no of course not dont worry when you said it was over i believed you ive still got the mark on my shoulder this had been on his conscience and her reference to it hurt him he had struck her on her shoulder not really intending the blow to be hard but it had been im sorry about that he said stumblingly i didnt mean i know i shouldnt have brought it up she smiled and said quickly actually i want some information alan i know that youre politically uncommitted so im sure you wont mind giving it to me but i dont have any secrets helen im not in that positionim only a civil servant you know that its not really a secret all i want is somewhat dyou call itadvance information about what i heard a rumor that the city council plans to close off the lower levels is that true i really couldnt say helen news was travelling fast obviously an indiscreet councilor had mentioned simon powys letter to someone and this had been the start of the rumor on the other hand his grandfather when he told him of it had understood that he would keep the old mans confidence he could say nothingthough the truth would put paid to the rumor but youre in city administration you must know youd be responsible for the project wouldnt you if such a project were to be carried out yes but i have been told nothing either by the city council or my director i should ignore the rumor anyway why should it bother you because if its true it would be interesting to know which councilors backed the motion and who egged them on the only man with sufficient power and a great enough obsession is your grandfathermy uncle simon powys how many solar referendum councilors are in the council he asked vaguely he was smelling her perfume now he remembered it with a sad nostalgia this was becoming too much to bear there are five solrefs three rlms one independent socialist and one crespignite who slipped in somewhere on the pensioners vote giving if you are so ignorant of simple politics a majority to the solrefs and virtual control of the council since the crespignite is bound to vote with them on nearly every issue so you want to tell the people that this hypothetical closing down of the lower levels is a solref plota blow to their liberty my very words she said with a kind of triumphant complacency he got up and you expect me to help youto betray confidence not to mention giving my own grandfathers opponents extra ammunitionand let you know what the city council decides before it is made public youre becoming foolish helen politics must be addling your brains but it means nothing to you anyway yourenot interested in politics thats so one of the reasons im not interested is because of the crookedness that seems to get into the best of peoplepeople who think any means to win elections are fair im not naive helen im from the same family as you i grew up knowing politics thats why i stay out of it surely you dont support this victimization of the fireclown alan he is a simple spontaneous im not interested in hearing a list of the fireclowns virtues and whether i support any victimization as you call it is of no importance as a matter of fact im attracted to the fireclown and consider him no danger at all but it seems to me that both you and grandfather are using this man for your own political ends and ill have no part of it he paused considering what he had said then added finally there has been no victimization and there isnt likely to be thats what you think i support the fireclown for good reasons his ambitions and the ambitions of the rlm are linked he wants to bring sanity and real life back to this machineridden world we want real values back again oh god he shook his head impatiently helen ive got a great deal of work to do before i go to bed tonight very well i have too if you reconsider even if there was a plot to arrest the fireclown i wouldnt tell you so that you could use it for political fuel helen he suddenly found himself moving towards her gripping her arm listen why get involved with this youve got a good chance of winning the election without indulging in dealings of this sort wait until youre president then you can make the fireclown into a solar trust if you like you cant understand she said grimly shaking herself free of his hand you dont realize that you have to be comparatively ruthless when you know what youre aiming for is right then im glad you know whats right he said pityingly im bloody glad you know its more than i do she left in silence and he went back to his chair slumping down heavily and feeling with morose pleasure that he had scored the mood didnt last long by the time stefanos came in to tell him his meal was waiting for him he had sunk into a brooding unconstructive melancholy brusquely he told his manservant to eat the meal himself and then go out for the rest of the evening thank you sir stefanos said wonderingly chewing his ridged underlip as he left the room in this mood in which his confrontation of his exmistress had left him alan felt incapable of work the work was of little real importance anyway routine stuff which he had hoped to clear up before he took his vacation in two weeks time he decided to go to bed hoping that a good ten hours sleep would help him forget helen he had reached the point where he felt he must see the mysterious figure for himself since so many matters seemed to be revolving around him all of a sudden he walked into the darkened hall and ordered the light on the light responded to his voice and flooded the flat the tiny escalator leading upstairs began to move too and he stepped on it letting it carry him to the landing he went into his bedroom it was as sparsely furnished as the rest of the flata bed a mellowlamp for reading a small shelf of books a wing on the headboard of the bed for anything he cared to put there and a concealed wardrobe the air was fresh from the ventilators also hidden he took off his scarlet jacket and pants told the wardrobe to open told the cleaning chute to open and dropped them in he selected a singlepiece sleeping suit and moved moodily to sit on the edge of the bed then he got up and went back to the wardrobe removed an ordinary suit of street garments and put them on rapidly feeling that he should have taken something with hima weapon or a notebook or an alarm signaller which would contact the police wherever he washe left the flat and took the fastway towards the elevators he was going to the lower levels he was going to find the fireclown chapter three he was unreasoningly annoyed that the liveried operator should recognize him and stare at him curiously as he was taken down to the fortyninth level in the back of his mind he was thrilling to the experience unremembered since boyhood of exploration he had chosen nondescript clothes so that he might move about incognito he was alone in the unmanned elevator as it dropped swiftly to the ninth level causing him the added excitement of being alone and virtually helpless against danger he stepped boldly into the illlit corridor namedincongruouslyorangeblossom road and then advanced cautiously until he saw a sign which read escalators five levels he rode the escalators into the chilly depths of the city of switzerland feeling as if he were descending into some frozen hell and at the same time making a mental note that if people were indeed inhabiting the lower levels then city administration should out of humanity do something about the heating arrangements he wished he had some warmer clothing but that would have meant applying to garment center since he rarely went outside save on vacation and then all necessary apparel was supplied but as he advanced deeper he became aware of a growing warmth and a thick unpleasant smell that he gradually recognized as being predominantly the smell of human perspiration in spite of his revulsion he sniffed it curiously as he walked slowly down the ramp leading to the notorious first level reputed to be the haunt of undesirables well before the fireclown first made his appearance he saw with a slight shock that the light was dancing and had an unusual quality about it as he drew closer his excitement increased naked flame the light came from a great burning torch which also gave off uncontrolled heat he approached it as close as he dared and stared at it marveling he had seen recordings of the phenomenon but this was the first time he withdrew hastily as the heat produced sweat from his forehead walking along a corridor that reminded him with its dancing naked light of the fairyland of his childhood fantasies on reflection he decided it was more like the ogres castle but so delighted was he by this wholly new experience that he forgot caution for a while it only returned as he rounded another corner and saw that the roof was actually composed of living rock so moist that it dripped condensed water alan powys was not an unsophisticated young man yet this was so remote from his everyday experience that he could not immediately absorb it on any intellectual level from ahead came soundsthe sounds of excited human voices he had expected a vast conclave of some description but he heard only a few people and they were conversing occasionally as he drew nearer he heard a reverberating laugh which seemed to him so full of delighted and profound humor that he wished he knew the joke so that he could join in if this was the fireclowns famous laughter then it did not strike him as at all insane still he told himself keeping in the shadows there were many forms of madness a cave came into view on his right he hugged the lefthand wall and inched forward his heart pounding the cave appeared to turn at a rightangle so that he could only see the light coming from it but now he could make out fragments of words and phrases at intervals there came a spluttering eruption of green light and each time he was caught in the flare shape it into something we can control no good if s only a hint of what we might your eyeshield back im going to a hissing eruption and a tongue of green flame seemed to turn the bend in the cave and come flickering like an angry cobra towards alan he gasped and stepped back as the roaring laughter followed the eruption had he been seen no the conversation was continuing the pitch of the voices now high with excitement he crossed the corridor swiftly and stood in the mouth of the cave straining his ears to make out what they were talking about then he felt a delicate touch on his arm and heard a whispering voice say im afraid you cant go in there private you know he turned slowly and was horrified at the apparition that still touched his arm he withdrew nauseated the horrible figure laughed softly serves you right they could keep me just to stop people nosing around i didnt know you had any kind of secrecy alan babbled i really do apologize if we welcome visitors but we prefer to invite them you dont mind the skinless man nodded towards the corridor alan backed into it forcing himself to ignore the bile in his throat forcing himself to look at the creature without obvious revulsionbut it was difficult flesh veins and sinews shone on his body as if the whole outer covering had been peeled off how could he move how could he appear so calm my skins syntheticbut transparent something in it takes the place of pigment they havent worked out a way of giving the stuff pigmentation yeti was lucky enough to be the guineapig i could use cosmetics but i dont my names corso im the fireclowns trusty henchman and deal with anyone interested in corning to his audiences you arrived at the wrong time we had one this afternoon obviously corso was used to random explorers particularly those curious about the fireclown deciding to play his part in the role corso had mistakenly given him alan looked down at the floor oh im sorry whens the next one day after tomorrow i can come then very welcome alan turned to retrace his way see you then said the skinless man when alan turned the corner of the corridor he had to lean against the wall for some moments before he could continue too many unexpected shocks this evening he told himself as he began to recover his composure his curiosity started to operate again what was going on from what he had seen and heard the fireclown and a group of his friends were conducting some sort of laboratory experimentand corso the skinless man had been left on guard to turn pryers away well everyone had a right to their privacy but his curiosity came close to overwhelming him he began to return towards the cave when a soft voice that he recognized said it wouldnt be wise if you went back a second time corso would know you were no innocent wouldbe initiate junnar he hissed what are you doing here but he heard only a faint scuffling and received no reply perhaps however the negros advice was good there was no point in making anyone suspicious since he would if discovered be excluded from any future chance of seeing the fireclown he began to return toward the ramp what on earth had junnar been doing in the lower levels was he there on his own business or on simon powys perhaps the negro would tell him tomorrow if he could find an excuse for leaving the ca building and visiting his grandfathers apartment vaguely irritated that he had seen so little of the fireclowns domain and nothing at all of the fireclown himself he finally arrived on the sixtyfourth level took the fastway to his flat and went to bed with something of his earlier sudden mood eliminated the day after tomorrow he would definitely attend the fireclowns audience very deliberately the next morning alan concentrated his thoughts entirely on his job by the time he arrived at his office in city administration on north top he had turned his thoughts to the matter of elevator installation which the city council had decided was necessary to speed up pedestrian flow between levels his assistant directorship was well earned but he had to admit that having it was partly due to his family connections and the education which his grandfather had insisted on him having but he was a hard and conscientious worker who got on well with his staff and the director seemed pleased with him he had been doing the job for two years since he had left the university he spent the morning catching up on lost time until just before lunch when carson the director called him into his office carson was a thin man with an unsavory appearance he was much respected by those working under him his chin however always looked as if he needed a shave and his swarthy face always appeared to need a wash but this wasnt his fault after a little time in his company the first impression of his unsavoriness vanished swiftly carson said mildly sit down alan i wonder if you could leave the elevator matter for a while and turn it over to sevlin to get on with something else has cropped up powys sat down and watched carson leaf through the papers on his desk the director finally selected one and handed it to him it was headed low level project and a glance told alan it was the proposed plan to seal off the lower levels from the upper ones so helen had been right in her thinking simon powys did hold sufficient sway with the city council to have his suggestions put into action carson was staring at his own right thumb he did not look up it will involve temporarily rerouting pedestrian traffic of course though to save trouble we could work at night it would be worth paying the men double overtime to get it done as quickly as possible with a minimum of fuss alan said with an edge to his voice exactly the council hasnt announced this publicly i presume theres no need tono one lives in the lower levels any more there will be emergency doors constructed naturally but these will be kept locked it shouldnt bother anyone except the fireclown alan was so furious that he found difficulty in controlling himself ah yes the fireclown i expect hell find somewhere else to go probably hell leave the city altogether i suspect hes no real right to live there in the first place but the newspapers the laservid the rlmand therefore the main weight of public opinionall regard the fireclown in a favorable way he has a good part of the world on his side this isnt political dynamiteits a political megabang quite carson nodded still regarding his thumb but we arent concerned with politics are we alan this is just another job for usa simple one lets get it over with alan took the papers carson handed him and got up the director was right but he could not help feeling personally involved ill get started after lunch he promised he went back to his office put the papers in his confidential drawer went to the roof of the ca building and took a cab across the spacious artificial countryside to the top towards his grandfathers apartments which lay close to the solar house at south top but when he got there he found only junnar and another of his cousinshelens brother denholm curtis curtis dressed with challenging bad taste his clothes were a deliberate attack a weapon which he flaunted they proclaimed him an iconoclast impatient of any accepted dogma whether reasonable or not above the striped and polkadotted trappings draping his lean body was a firm sensitive headthe heavy powys head with calm eyes hopeful seeming to be aware of detail and yet disdainful of it curds eyes were fixed on the future hello denholm how are you he and his cousin shook hands fineand you not bad and hows the thirty five group still bent on gingering up the mother party curtis led the radical wing of the solref party his group was small but vociferous and carried a certain amount of weight in the solar house yet though they stuck to the traditional party of the powys family he would have been much more at home in his sisters movement but his interest was in changing the party to change the policy rather than splitting away from it and forming a fresh one curtis hadnt replied to alans question he glanced at the big wallclock just as his grandfather came hurrying in through the side door grandfather alan stepped quickly forward but old simon powys shook his head sorry alan i have to get to the solar house immediately coming denholm curtis nodded and the two of them left the room almost at a run something was in the air alan guessed and it wasnt the closing down of the lower levels this seemed much more important whats going on junnar the negro looked slightly embarrassed as their eyes met but he spoke coolly theyre calling on old benjosef to resign benjosef a dedicated member of the solrefs was solar president his two terms of office had been popular but not particularly enlightened he had not had much public support over the last year partly because he was slow to agree on a policy of expansion and colonization involving mars and ganymede on what issue the planets ganymede and mars are ready for settlers there are businessmen willing to invest in them ships ready to take thembut benjosef is reluctant to pursue a policy of expansion because he says we havent a sufficiently good organization for controlling it yet he wants to wait another ten years to build up such an organization but everyone else is impatient to get started you know the story i know it alan agreed the projects to make the two planets inhabitable and fertile had been started over a hundred years previously and it had been hard enough holding private enterprise and wouldbe settlers back before they were ready benjosef had been foolish to take a stand on the issue but he had done what he thought was right and his conviction now seemed likely to topple him what are his chances of staying in power for the rest of his term alan asked curiously bad minister powys and the majority of solrefs have to stand by him of course but mr curtis and his group have sided with the rlms the other parties are fairly equally divided between both sides but mr curtis support should give the vote against the president once again alan was glad he had decided to have no part of politics even his just and stern old grandfather was going to behave like a hypocrite giving a vote of confidence for benjosef while encouraging curtis to vote against him he decided that there wasnt much he could do since everyone would be at the solar house including of course helen the current session ended in two weeks and the next president would have to be elected during the recession probably he thought ironically both the main runners had their machines all geared for action youll be kept pretty busy from now on i should think he said to junnar the negro nodded and alan continued what were you doing in the lower levels last night keeping an eye on the fireclown junnar said shortly for grandfather yes of course why is he so malevolent toward the fireclown he seems harmless to me has grandfather any special knowledge that the public doesnt have alan was only partly interested in what he himself was saying the other half of his mind was wondering about the electionsand helen junnar shook his head i dont think so its a question of your point of view minister powys sees the fireclown as a threat to society and its progress others simply see him as a romantic figure who wants a return to a simpler life thats why hes such a popular cause with so many people we all wish life were simplerwere suckers for the kind of simple answer to our problems that a man like the fireclown supplies simple answers sure enough alan nodded but hardly realistic who knows junnar said tersely is grandfather going to use the fireclown as a platform i expect so it will be taken for granted that whoever wins will encourage the expansion bill so the other main dispute will be the fireclown but if s out of all proportion why should the fireclown become a major issue junnar smiled cynically probably because the politicians want him to be that answer satisfied alan and he added hitler as i remember used the jews before him nero used the christians minority groups are always useful they turn peoples attention away from real issues which the politicians have no control over so miss curtis and minister powys are using the fireclown is that it one in support one against people will take an interest in a battle over such a colorful figure and forget to question other policies it sounds almost unbelievable yet it happens history proves that what does grandfather plan to do about the fireclown if re gets to power maybe nothing junnar said maybe nothing at all once hes in power then he smiled brightly no its not fair after all i am simon powys private secretary he really is deeply concerned about what the fireclown represents rather than the man himself the apparent return ofloyalty in junnar brought an awakening echo in alan he nodded perhaps we dont do either of them justice i was forgetting they are both powyses with a strong sense of family honor junnar coughed i think id better go over to the solar house myself can i arrange an appointment for you to see your grandfather no dont bother are you going to the fireclowns audience tomorrow probably i may see you there yes said alan he glanced at his watch and noted that he would arrive back to his office late he and junnar walked into the corridor and went their separate ways alan sighed as he studied the low level project basically it was a simple job to organize the sealing off of all entrances stopping elevators and escalators and cutting off light and heating where they existed ten levels were to be shut down involving the moving of less than a thousand people to accommodation higher up the residents of levels nine and ten would welcome the change he knew they at least could be relied upon to support the operation no it wasnt the project itself but the way the newspapers and entertainment media would treat it what helen curtis would say about it it was going to cause city administration and the city council as much trouble as if they told the populace they had decided to torture and kill all pet dogs in the city and this move would have worldwide repercussionsthe fireclown had been the subject of innumerable popular features treating him in a sympathetic manner already he was convinced that his grandfather had committed political suicide by this move but for the moment he wasnt worried so much about that as about the trouble he and the director would come in for he in particular would be slanderedthe grandson of the man who wanted to victimize the innocent fireclown he would be talked of as a puppet in the hands of the old man doubtless he would even be shouted at in the public corridors he contacted city works waited for the manager to be located tristan bula was like junnar a zimbabwean from what had once been rhodesia the state of zimbabwe had grown to great power in the african federation and many of the solar systems best administrators came from there good afternoon tristan alan was on friendly terms with the manager new project id like to have a word with you about bula pretended to groan is it important all my available manpower is taken up at the moment the city council wants us to give this priority its also highly confidential is there anyone else in the room with you bula turned looked behind him and said would you mind leaving the room for a minute or two miss nagib his pretty egyptian secretary crossed the screen okay alan what is it city council wants us to seal off ten levelsnumbers one to ten to be precise concrete in the entrances lighting heat and water supply cut off elevators and escalators to stop operation it took bula a moment to absorb all this his face showed incredulity but thats where the fireclown is what are we expected to do wall him upentomb him of course not all residents will be moved before the project goes ahead id thought of housing them in those spare corridors in section six of the fifteenth level and sections twelve and thirteen of the seventeenth level theyll need to be checked to make sure theyre perfectly habitable the chemical research institute was going to take them over since theyre getting a bit cramped but theyll have to just a minute alan whats going to happen to the fireclown presumably hell take the alternative accommodation were offering to everyone else alan said grimly you know he wouldnt do that i dont know the fireclown well im having no part of it bula said rebelliously then he switched out completely taken aback alan sat at his desk breathing heavily this he decided was only a hint of how the news would be received by the public his colleague had always struck him as a solid practical man who did his job wella good civil servant like himself if tristan bula could be so affected by the news as to risk his position by refusing to obey the city council then how would others take it the word riot popped into alans head there had been no public disorder in a hundred years this was even bigger than hed expected another thingbula felt so strongly about it that he wasnt likely to keep the project secret someone had to convince the zimbabwean that the closing off of the levels was not a threat against the fireclown reluctantly he would have to tell carson of his little scene with the manager slowly he got up from his desk slowly he walked into carsons office chapter four benjosef had resigned after a meeting in the solar house lasting well into the night as benjosef tried to put his arguments to the solar representatives the old president had been shouted down denholm curtis had asked for a vote of no confidence in benjosef the ballot had been secret and though simon powys had seemed to support benjosef it had been a masterly deception he had managed to convey the image of a strong man standing beside his leader put of nothing but loyalty in spite of favoringor appearing to favor benjosef s cautious policies simon powys had risen in public esteem doubtless the heavy solref vote would be his in the election alan was sure that his grandfather had actually voted again benjosef principles the old man might haveand plenty of thembut they seemed at that moment to carry little weight against simon powys actions this strange duality which seemed to come upon even the best politicians was not new to alan yet it constantly shocked him at benjosef baffled by what he considered mad recklessness on the part of the solar house reluctantly resigned as president his term of office which should have continued for another eighteen months to finish with the current session alan read and saw all this as he breakfasted glancing from newssheet to laservid and constructing all the details of the dramatic and in some ways tragic session he rather sympathized with benjosef perhaps he was old and wise perhaps he was just old simon powys was only five years younger but he possessed a forceful vitality that belied his age alan observed judiciously that helen curtis had not actually demanded the president s resignation though other members of her party had been vociferous in attacking him it would not have been diplomatic or polite for a wouldbe president to ask the current head to step down he sighed and finished his coffeea new brand from which the caffeine had been removed and replaced by a stimulant described as less harmful the strange thing was it tasted better though he would have liked to have denied this so now the fight was between his grandfather and his cousin would simon powys see the light of day at last and ignore the fireclown issue as yet of course it had not really become an issue it would take a political battle to make it one or would he plug on alan had a sad feeling that he wouldparticularly if helen drew the fireclown into her platform when he got to the office carson was looking pale and even less savory than usual people were not chosen as directors of city administration for their looks but at this moment alan rather wished they had a smiling pleasantfaced heman who could cozen the public into realizing the truth of the situation what did bula have to say sir alan asked i was unable to contact him alan i tried the works but he must have left as soon as he switched out on you i tried his private number but his wife said he had not come back when i tried again later he still wasnt there what was he doing i wonder i can tell you he was broadcasting the news everywhere not only broadcasting but elaborating on ityou can imagine what he said i can imagine what would be said by some but bula ive just had chairman fou on the line he says the council is most disturbed thinks we should have been able to judge bula better i pointed out somewhat obscurely that they appointed bula but it seems were the scapegoatsfrom the publics point of view and evidently from the councils the news this morning was so full of stormy scenes in the solar house that they probably havent gotten round to us yet alan said with mock cheerfulness but doubtless well be getting it in an hour or two i expect so well weve still got work to do im going over to works myself to see what the men think of the project if they oppose it as strongly as bula were going to have trouble with the unions before long what will we do if that happens brick up the bloody levels ourselves i suppose carson swore black labor alan said shocked wed have a systemwide strike on our hands then it was true im hoping the city council will realize the implications and back down gracefully carson walked towards the door but they didnt seem as if they were going to judging by chairman fous tone goodbye alan better stick to something routine until i find out whats happening when alan buzzed for his filing clerk his secretary came in he raised an eyebrow wheres levy he didnt come in this morning mr powys is he sick i dont think so i heard a rumor hed asked for his back pay from the cashiers and said something about resigning i see then will you bring me the pedestrian transport file number pv i think it is as he ploughed through the monotonous work alan learned from his secretary that about a quarter of the staff in the ca building had not turned up for work that morning that represented over three hundred people where were they all it was evident why they had left the whole business was growing into a monster if three hundred people from one building alone could feel so strongly about the fireclown how many millions were there supporting him to alan it was incredible he knew intuitively that so many people could not be roused merely because of the proposed closing down of ten virtually unused levelsor for that matter give up their jobs in support of the fireclown it must be that the fireclown represented something some need in modern mankind which perhaps the sociologists would know about he decided not to ask a sociologist and risk being plied with so many explanatory theories that his mind would be still further confused but what was this tenuous zeitgeist perhaps the world would be in flames before he ever found out perhaps whatever happened no one would ever really know he decided he was being too melodramatic on the other hand he was extremely disturbed he had a liking for peace and quietone of the reasons why he had rejected the idea of entering politicsand the worlds mood was distinctly unpeaceful facing facts he realized that this was not a localized outbreak that it would have to grow in magnitude before it died down or was controlled what had his grandfather started nothing really of course his move had merely served to bring it out into the open whatever it was but the peoples hysteria was increasing becoming evident everywhere a hysteria that had not entered the human race since the war scares two centuries earlier it seemed to have blown up overnight though perhaps he had seen its beginnings in the worship of the fireclown the demand for benjosefs resignation and other smaller incidents that he had not recognized for what they were the morning dragged in the back of his mind something else nagged him until he realized that this was the night when the fireclown was to hold his audience he felt slightly perturbed at attending it now that public anger seemed to be building to such a pitch but he had said he would go promised himself that he would goand he would carson came back just as alans secretary brought him some lunch any luck alan said offering his boss a slice of bread impregnated with beef extract carson refused it with an irritable wave of his hand apologizing for his brusque gesture with a slight smile none most of the workmen didnt turn up this morning anyway the union leaders deny influencing them but someone has bula yes he spoke to a public meeting last night attended by most of the men who work for him told them that this victimization of the simple fireclown was a threat also to their liberty the usual stuff and once the news got round he wasnt the only one talking and rabblerousing at least a dozen others have used the same theme in speeches to incredibly big crowds they didnt have to do much convincing either the crowds were already on their side its all happened so suddenly alan repeated his earlier thoughts aloud you wouldnt think a thing like this could grow so fast people arent even bothering to speak to their political representatives or beam the city council thats whats so peculiar we might have expected angry letters demanding that we call a halt to the projectand if wed had enough of them we should have had to thats democracy after all id really thought the idea of law and order had finally sunk into the human race looks as if i was wrong disproves the fireclowns cant about artificial living producing artificial men and ideas the publics chockablock with human nature this morning they seem as hysterical and as bloodthirsty as they ever were mass neurosis and all that carson stared at his thumb inspecting the nail it was dirty however much he cleaned them his nails always seemed to get dirty a few moments afterwards by midafternoon carson and alan were staring in blank incredulity at one another at least two hundred more people had not come back after lunch it was useless to attempt continuing work another disturbing point was that they had been unable to contact the city council the beam had been jammed continuously obviously some people had decided to ask the city council about the matter i think wed better go quietly to our homes carson said with a worried attempt at jocularity ill keep a skeleton staff on and give the rest the afternoon off i might as well theyll probably be walking out soon anyway glad of this for his own reasons alan agreed he returned to his flat and changed into the nondescript suit he had worn earlier he had had some trouble getting there for the corridors were packed angry and excited conversations were going on all over the place ordered discipline had given way to disorganized hysteria and it rather frightened him to see ordinary human beings behaving in a manner which to him was a rejection of their better selves outside in the jostling corridor he was carried by the crowd to the elevators and had to wait for nearly a quarter of an hour as the mobs impatience grew there just werent enough elevators to take them all at once down down down the levels into level nine and they milled down the escalators and ramps alan unable to go back now even if he had wanted to the smoke from the torches of the first level the smell of sweat the atmosphere of tension the ululating roar of the crowd all attacked his senses and threatened to drug his brain as the crowd entered a huge cavern which he knew had once been part of an underground airstrip during the years when the city had first been planned and at last he saw the fireclown standing upon the tall column that served him as a dais seeming to balance his huge bulk precariously on the platform there above him alan saw the spluttering mass of the artificial sun he remembered having heard of it the fireclown had made itor had it madeand somehow controlled it whats this whats this the fireclown was shouting why so many has the whole world suddenly seen the error of its ways there were affirmative shouts from all around him as the crowd answered somewhat presumptuously for the rest of the planets millions the fireclown laughed his gross bulk wobbling on the dais thousands upon thousands of people were packing into the cavern threatening to crush those already at the center alan found himself borne towards the dais as the fireclowns reverberating laugh swept over them no more the fireclown cried suddenly corsotell them they cant come in tell them to come back later well be suffocated the fireclown seemed baffled by the crowds sizebewildered perhaps by his own power yet was it his own power alan wondered was not the mob identifying the fireclown with something else some deeprooted need in them which was finding expression through the clown but it was immaterial to speculate the fact remained that the fireclown had become the mobs symbol and its leader whatever he told them they would dounless perhaps he told them to do nothing at all the mob was beginning to chant fireclown fireclown fireclown speak to us how shall the world end he cried in fire in fire how shall it be born again in fire and the fire shall be the fire of mans spirit the fireclown roared the fire in his brain and his belly too long has the world lived on artificial nourishment the nourishment of processed food the nourishment of ideas that exist in a vacuum we are losing our birthright our heritage faces extinction he paused as the mob moved like a mighty restless tide then he continued i am your phoenix awash with the flames of life i am your salvation you see flames above he raised an orangepainted hand to the spluttering orb near the ceiling of the cavern you see flames around you he indicated the torches but these fires only represent the real flames the unseen flames which exist within you and the mother of life which sweeps the heavens above youthe sun the sun the mob shrieked yes the sun billions of years ago our planet was formed from the stuff of the sun the sun nurtured life and it finally nurtured the life of our earliest ancestors it has nurtured us since but does modern man honor his mother no no no our ancestors worshipped the sun for millennia why because they recognized it as the mother of life without the sun man could never have been born on earth the earth itself could not have been formed some of the mob obviously old hands at this shouted fire is life yes the fireclown roared fire is life and how many of you here have ever seen the sun how many of you have ever been warmed directly by its rays how many of you have ever seen a naked flame a wordless bellow greeted each question alan had to fight the infectious hysteria of the crowd though it was true that many of the citys populace had never been outside they had led better and fuller lives within the walls and there was nothing forbidding them to take a vacation beyond the city it was a kind of agoraphobia not the state which held them back they had at any rate reaped the benefits of the sun in less direct waysfrom the great solar batteries which supplied power to the city as if he anticipated these unspoken thoughts the fireclown carried on we are misusing the sun we are perverting the stuff of life and changing it to the stuff of death we use the sun to power our machines and keep us alive in plastic metal and concrete coffins we use the sun to push our spaceships to the planetsplanets where we are forced to live in wholly artificial conditions or planets which we warp and change from what they naturally are into planets that copy earth that is wrong who are we to change the natural order we are literally playing with fireand that fire will soon turn and shrivel us yes yes in an effort to remain out of the fireclowns spell alan encouraged himself to feel dubiously towards the logic of what he was saying the fireclown continued in that vein for some time drumming the words into the ready ears of the mob again and again the fireclowns argument wasnt new it had been said in milder ways by philosophers and politicians of a certain bent for centuriespossibly since the birth of the industrial revolution but for all this the argument wasnt necessarily right it came back to the question of whether it was better for man to be an unenlightened savage in the caves or whether he should use the reasoning powers and the powers of invention which were his in order to gain knowledge feeling as if he had hit upon an inkling of the trouble alan realized that the fireclown and those like his grandfather who opposed him were both only supporting opinions any forthcoming dispute was likely to be a battle between ignorance of one sort and ignorance of another yet the fact remainedtrouble was brewing big trouble unless something could be done about it all religions have seen the sun as a representation of god the fireclown was saying now perhaps he was sincere alan thought perhaps he was innocent of personal ambition unaware of the furor he was likely to create thoughtless of the conflict that was likely to ensue and yet alan was attracted to the fireclown he liked him and took a delight in the mans vitality and spontaneity it was merely unfortunate that he should have come at a time when public neurosis had reached such a peak now a voice was shouting something about the city council fragmented phrases reached alan about the closing of the levels an attack against the fireclown a threat to free speech it was marvelous how they accepted the principles of democracy and rejected them at the same time by talk of mob action marvelousand deeply frightening he turned to see if he could get back and out he could not the mob pressed closer packed itself tighter a horrifying vision of thousands of mouthing faces surrounded him he panicked momentarily and then suppressed his panic it could not help him little could the fireclowns voice bellowed for silence swore at the mob reviled it abashed the crowd quieted you see you see this is what you do so the city council is to close off the levels perhaps it is because of me perhaps it isnt but does it matter certain elements shouted that it did matter what kind of threat am i to the city council what threat am i to anyone i tell younone alan was mystified by these words just as the mob was none i want no part of your demonstrations your petty fears and puny conflicts i do not expect action from you i do not want action i want you only to become aware you can change your mental attitude study the words you are using today study them and you will find them meaningless you have emotionsyou have words but the words you have do not describe your emotions try to think of words that will then you will be strong then you will have no need for your stupid overvaunted socalled intelligence then you will have no need to march against the council building alan himself sought for words to describe the fireclowns state at that moment what had been said had impressed him in spite of his decision to observe as objectively as possible they meant nothing much really they had been said before but they hinted at somethinggave him a clue noble bewilderment the elephant attacked by small boys and yet concerned for them alan was impressed by what he felt to be the fireclowns intrinsic innocence but such an innocence it could topple the world placards now began to appear in the crowd no to burying the fireclown hands off the lower levels council cant quench the fire of man amused by the ludicrous messages alan made out others sons of the sun reject council plan was perhaps the best his mind began to skip taking in first a fragmented scenefaces placards turbulent movement a womans ecstatic face then a clipping of sound a sudden idea that he could easily follow the fireclown if he could hear the man convince him in cooler more intellectual phrases the flaring gash of light that quickly bubbled from the tiny sun and then seemed to be drawn back into it fools the fireclown was shouting incredulity and anger mixed on his painted face it seemed to alan that the paint had been stripped away and for the first time he became aware of the man who stood there an individual complex and enigmatic but the glimpse did not last for he felt the pressure from behind decreasing at least half the mob had turned away and were surging towards the caverns exit and the fireclown alan looked up the fireclown was appealing to them to stay but his words were drowned by the babble of hysteria now alan was borne back with the crowd was forced to turn and move with it or risk being trampled he looked up at the dais and saw that the fat body of the fireclown had developed a slump that hardly seemed in keeping with his earlier vitality as the mob boiled up to the third level alan saw helen curtis only a few yards ahead of him and to his left he kept her in sight and managed gradually to inch through the stabbing elbows and hard shoulders on the ninth level he was just able to get into the same elevator with her he shouted over the heads of the others helen what the hell are you doing here he saw a placard fireclown first victim of dictatorship bob up and down and realized she was holding it do you think this will win you votes he demanded she made no reply but smiled at him im glad to see you came are you with us no im not and i dont think the fireclown is either he doesnt want you to fight for his rightsim sure hes perfectly able to look after himself its the principle rubbish the doors of the giant elevator slid up and they crossed the corridor to the row of elevators opposite the liveried attendants attempted to hold the crowd away but were pushed back into their own elevators by the force of the rush he managed to catch up with her and stood with his body tight against her side unable to shift his position this sort of thing may win you immediate popularity with the rabble but what are the responsible voters going to think im fighting for what i think right she said defiantly grimly youre fighting he shook his head look when we reach sixtyfive make your way home speak for the fireclown in the solar house if you must but dont make a fool of yourself when thishysteria dies down youll look ridiculous so you think this is going to die down she said sweetly the doors opened the elevators disgorged their contents and they were on the move again streaming across the quiet gardens towards the distant civic buildings it was night the sky beyond the dome was dark the crowd exhibited a moments nervous and calm its pace slowed and then as helen shouted there thats where they are and flung her hand theatrically towards the council building they moved on again spreading out and running laservid cameramen and stillphotographers were waiting for them taking pictures as they surged past helen began to run awkwardly her placard waving in her hands let her go alan thought old emotions returning to heighten his confusion he turned back no she mustnt do it he hated her political ambitions but they meant much to her she could throw everything away with this illconsidered action of hers or would she perhaps the day of ordered government was already over helen he ran after her tripped and fell heavily on a bed of trampled blue roses got up helen he couldnt see her ahead of the crowd lights were going on in the civic buildings fortuitously and perhaps happily for the city councilall of whom had private apartments in the council buildingthe headquarters of the city police were only a block away and that building was lit up also he hoped the police would use restraint in dealing with the crowd when he finally saw helen again she was leading the van of the mob who now chanted the unoriginal phrase we want the council unarmed policemen in their blue smocks and broad belts began to muscle their way through the crowd laservid cameras tracked them alan grasped helens arm trying to make himself heard above the chant helen for gods sake get outyoure liable to be arrested the police are here so what her face was flushed her eyes overbright her voice high he reached up and tore the placard from her hands flinging it to the ground i dont want to see you ruined she stood there her body taut with anger staring into his face you always were jealous of my political success p cant you see whats happening to you if you must play followmyleader do it in a more orderly way you could be president soon and i still will be go away he shook her shoulders open your eyes open your eyes oh dont be so melodramatic leave me alone my eyes are wide open but he could see she had softened slightly perhaps simply because of the interest he was taking in her then a voice blared go back to your homes if you have any complaints lodge them in the proper manner the council provides facilities for hearing complaints this demonstration will get you nowhere the police are authorized to stop anyone attempting to enter the council building helen listened until the broadcast finished then she shouted dont let them put you off theyll do nothing until they see we mean business two hundred years of peace had taught helen curtis nothing about peaceful demonstration it was such a small issue alan told himself bewilderedly such a small issue that could have been settled by a hundred angry letters instead of a mob of thousands the crowd was attempting to press past the police barrier finally the barrier broke and fights between the police and the demonstrators broke out several times alan saw a policeman lose his temper and strike a demonstrator he was disgusted and perturbed but there was nothing he could do wearily he walked away from the scene for the time being all emotion had been driven from him chapter five miserably unsure of his direction alan let his feet carry him aimlessly he was sure that the riot marked some important change in the course of earths history but knew with equal certainty that it would be twenty years before he could look back and judge why it had happened helen i love you he thought helen i love you but it was no good they were completely separated now he had picked an old scab he should have left it well alone he looked up and found that he was approaching the building which housed his grandfathers apartment he realized at the same time that he needed someone to talk to there had been no one since he and helen had parted the stern old man would probably refuse to listen and would almost certainly refuse to give him any advice or help but there was nothing else for it he did not have a sonarkey for the matterlift so he climbed the stairs very slowly and went to the main door of the big apartment a servant answered and showed him in simon powys was sitting in his lounge intently watching the laservid relaying scenes of the riots outside he turned his great head and alan saw that his brooding eyes held a hint of triumph so the fireclown was uninterested in power was he simon powys smiled slightly and pointed at the set then whats that alan a riot alan said hollowly but though its in the name of the fireclown he didnt encourage it that seems unlikely you were mixed up in it for a while werent you i saw you on thathe pointed again at the screen and helen too is taking an active part very active alan kept his tone dry you disapprove i tried to stop her so youve changed your opinion of the fireclown you realize i was right if i had my way every one of those rioters would be flung into prisonand the fireclown exiled from the planet slightly shocked by the savagery of his grandfathers last remark alan remained silent together they watched the laservid the police seemed to be coping though their numbers had had to be increased i havent changed my opinion grandfather he said quietly not really anyway his grandfather also paused before replying i wish you knew what i knewthen youd fight the fireclown as strongly as im attempting to the mans a criminal perhaps hes more than that perhaps this is the last night well be able to sit comfortably and watch the laservid we both seemed to underestimate the fireclowns popularity alan mused are you going to continue your campaign against him of course i should have thought you would spend your time better trying to find out why the public is attracted to him the fireclowns a menace why alan said grimly because he threatens the stability of society weve had equilibrium for two hundred years why does he threaten the stability of society simon powys turned round in his chair are you trying to be impertinent alan im trying to tell you that the fireclown himself means nothing the public is in this mood for another a deeper reason i was down there in the cavern on the first level i saw the fireclown try to stop them from doing this but they wouldnt listen to him why but the old man stubbornly refused to get drawn into an argument and alan felt a hollow sense of frustration his urge to try to clarify his thoughts by means of conversation was unbearably strong he tried again grandfather yes the fireclown pleaded with the crowd not to make this demonstration i saw him but the crowd wasnt interested in what he said theyre using him just as you and helen are using him for your own reasons there is something deeper going on cant you see that again the old man looked up at him very well the fireclown symbolizes somethingsomething wrong in our society is that it if thats the case we cannot strike at the general we must strike at their particular because that is what is tangible i am striking at the fireclown alan wasnt satisfied his grandfathers words were reasonable yet he suspected that no thought or sensibility lay behind them his answer had been too pat i intend to do everything possible to bring the fireclowns activities to a halt simon powys continued the public may be too blind to see what is happening to them what dangerous power the clown wields over them but i will make them see i will make them see alan shrugged it seemed to him that the blind were accusing the blind politicians he said suddenly angry what hollow individuals they are suddenly his grandfather rose in his chair and got up his back to the laservid his face taut with suppressed emotion by god i brought you up as a powys in spite of your mothers shaming me i recognized you i refused to take the easy way out and pay some woman to call you her own you received the name of powys and the benefits of that name and this is how you reward me by coming to my own house and insulting me i fostered a bastardand now that bastard reverts to type you have never understood the responsibilities and the need to serve which mark our family we are not powerseekers we arent meddlers in the affairs of others we are dedicated to furthering civilization and humanity throughout the solar system what do you understand of that alan whateveryournameis i think it most noble alan sneered trying to hold back the tears of pain and anger in his eyes his body trembled as it had done when as an adolescent he had been told the story of his birth most noble grandfather all you and the powys clan have done for me but you could not keep my mother alive with your high sentiments you would not let her marry the man who fathered me i know that much from grandmother some rough spaceman wasnt it could you kill him by shame the way you killed my mother your mother killed herself i did everything for her and judged her for everything nothe old mans face softened ive always given you the benefit of every doubt grandfather ive always respected you but in this business of the fireclown ive seen that you can be unreasoningly dogmatic that perhaps what ive heard about you was true your attack on me was unfairjust as your attack on the fireclown is unfair if you knew alan if you knew just what the old man straightened his back i apologize for what i said to you im tiredbusy daynot thinking properly ill see you tomorrow perhaps alan nodded wordlessly and left moved to an emotion towards his grandfather which he decided could only be love love after what they had both said it seemed to him that everything was turning upside down the chaos of the mob the chaos of his own moods the chaos of his private lifeall seemed to point towards something some remedy perhaps for his own and the worlds ills on the roof of the building he looked around for a car which would carry him above the riot below to north top where he could probably use one of the small private elevators above the dome the sky was clear and the moon rode the sky in a casual arc near the edge of the roof he saw junnar the zimbabwean was also watching the distant rioters youre too late he said cheerfully you missed the best of it theyre dispersing now i was in the best of it alan joined him and saw that a much smaller crowd continued to demonstrate but that most of the people were moving slowly back towards the elevatorcone did you see any arrests junnar asked no did you the police didnt seem too keen i think they took a couple inprobably examples what does all this mean junnar whats happening to the world im not with you junnar stared at alan in curiosity nobody is i guess im sure that these riots are not just the result of the fireclowns speeches in his cavern im sure theyve been brewing for ages why are the people so frustrated they have to break out like this suddenly what do they want what do they lack you may know as well as i do that mass demonstrations in the past often had nothing to do with the placards they waved and the cant they chantedit was some universal need crying out for satisfaction something that has always been in man however happy and comfortable his world is what is it this time i think i know what you mean junnar offered alan a marijuana but he refused that down therethe fireclownthe impatience to expand to the new earthtype planetsthe bitter arguments in the solar houseindividual frustrationthe time for a change leaders in the newssheets and laservid programs all threatening to topple society from its carefully maintained equilibrium you mean its some kind ofjunnar groped for a word force thats entered the race that we should be doing something changing our direction in some way i think thats roughly what i mean im finding it hard to put it into words myself well this is perhaps what the fireclown means when he says were turning our backs on the natural life with all our material comfort perhaps we should look inward at ourselves instead of looking outward at the new colony planets well what do we do about it mr powys i wish i knew so do i junnar exhaled the sweet smoke and leaned back against the rail you seem to understand what the fireclowns getting at you must believe that hes innocent of causing these riots cant you tell my grandfather that junnars manner changed i didnt say the fireclown was innocent mr powys i agree with your grandfather hes a menace he spoke fiercely almost as fiercely as simon powys had done earlier alan sighed oh all right goodnight junnar night mr powys as he climbed into an automatic car and set the control he caught a final glimpse of the negros sad face staring up at the moon like a dog about to bay to alan the world seemed suddenly sick all the people in it seemed equally sick and it was bad enough today what would it be like tomorrow he wondered next morning he breakfasted late waiting for carson to call him if he was wanted at the office both laservid and newssheet were full of last nights rioting not only had the city council building been attacked but others taking advantage of the demonstration had indulged in sheer hooliganism smashing shopfronts in the consumer corridors breaking light globes and so on damage was considerable arrests had been made but the press didnt seem to complain instead they had a better angle to spread ca man grapples presidential candidate alan powys attacks fireclown supporters a picture showed him wrenching helens banner from her grasp in the story he was described as an angry spokesman for the establishment and helen as the heroine of the hour going among the people to stand or fall with them maybe she had been playing her game better than he had at first thought he decided on the laservid a commentators voice was heard over the noise of the riot last night beautiful wouldbe president miss helen curtis led a peaceful party of demonstrators to the city council building on top they were there to protest against the abuse of council power which as everyone knows now was to take the form of a secret closing of ten of the lowest levels of the city of switzerland miss curtis and her supporters saw this as a deliberate move to stop free speech an attempt to silence the very popular figure known as the fireclown whose harmless talks have given many people so much comfort and pleasure the peaceful demonstration was savagely broken up by the large bodies of policemen who forced themselves through the crowd and began making random arrests almost before the people could lodge their protest it is not surprising that some of the less controlled elements among the demonstrators resisted arrest shot of demonstrator kicking a policeman in the behind reliable witnesses attest to police brutality towards both men and women in the van of the police bullyboys came alan powys grandson of miss curtiss rival in the forthcoming presidential electionsand assistant director of city administration who had already begun work on closing off the lower levels shot of alan grappling with helen but even mr powys couldnt silence the demands of the crowd shot of him walking away he hadnt realized laservids were tracking him the whole time and he went back to report his failure to his grandfather simon powys shot of him entering the apartment building the cameras panned back to the riot and the commentary continued in the same vein he was horrified by the liesand helpless against them what could he do deny them against an already prejudiced public opinion obviously someone up there the commentator was saying doesnt like the fireclown perhaps because hes brought a bit of life back into our drab existence this program decries the totalitarian methods of the city council and tells these hidden men that it will oppose all their moves to encroach further upon our liberties fadeout and then fresh shots of a surlylooking man talking to a laservid reporter reporter this is mr lajos who narrowly escaped wrongful arrest in yesterdays demonstration mr lajos tell the viewers what happened to you lajos i was brutally attacked by two policemen lajos stood staring blankly into the camera and had to be prodded by the reporter reporter did you sustain injuries mr lajos lajos i sustained minor injuries and if i had not been saved in time i would have sustained major injuries about my head and body lajoss head seemed singularly free from any obvious injuries reporter did the police give you any reason for their attack lajos no i was peacefully demonstrating when i was suddenly set upon i was forced to defend myself reporter of course of course thank you mr lajos back in the studio a smiling reporter bent towards the camera its victory for miss curds and her supporters folks the fireclown wont be bothered by the councilnot so long as we keep vigilant anywayfor the council told the people a few minutes ago that the picture faded and carsons face appeared in its place that was the one irritation of combining communication and entertainment in the single laservid set sorry if i butted in alan have you heard the news something about meor about the council the counciltheyve backed down theyve decided not to close off the levels after all maybe now we can get on with some work will you come to the office as soon as you can alan nodded and put down the newssheet right away he said and switched out as he took the fastway to the elevators he mused over the manner in which the riot had been reported he was certain that the police had tried not to use violence yet towards the end they might have lost their patience these days the police force required superior intelligence and education to get into it and modern police werent the goodfornothingelse characters of earlier times still it could have been that because one side ignored established law and order so did the other violence tended to breed violence violence he thought is a selfgenerating monster the more you let it take control the more it grows he didnt know it but he was in for a taste of it two muscular arms suddenly shot out to each side of him his face slammed against them and he lost his balance on the fastway falling backwards and sliding along two figures rushed along beside him and yanked him onto the slowway get up one of them said alan got up slowly dazed and wary he stared at the tall thinfaced man and his fatter glowering partner they were dressed in engineers smocks what did you do that for alan said youre alan powys arent you i am what do you want youre the man who attacked helen curtis yesterday i did not youre lying the man flicked his hand across alans face it stung we dont like council hirelings who attack women i attacked no one alan prepared desperately to defend himself the fat man hit him fairly lightly in the chest on the fastway people were passing pretending not to notice alan punched the fat man in the face and kicked the thin mans shins neither had expected it alan himself was surprised at his own bravery he had acted instinctively he was also shocked by his own violence now the pair were pummeling him and he struck back at random a blow in his stomach winded him a blow in his face made him dizzy his own efforts became weaker and he was forced to confine himself to protecting his body as best he could then it was over a new voice shouted stop that breathing heavily alan looked up and saw the slightly ashamed face of tristan bula he noticed too that all three were wearing a sun emblem on their clothinga little metal badge the thinfaced man said its powysthe man who wanted to close the levels the one who attacked miss curtis last night dont be a fool bula said angrily he didnt want to close the levels he was taking orders from the council i know himhe isnt likely to have attacked helen curtis either bula came closer hello tristan alan said painfully youve started something havent you never mind about that what were you doing last night as bula approached the two men stepped back i was arguing with helen telling her she was stupid just as youre stupid none of you knows what youre doing you got a lot of press cuttings this morning if i were you id stay off the public ways he turned to the two engineers get going youre nothing better than hoodlums you pay too much attention to what the press says alan tried to smile the pot calling the kettle black you started all this tris you should have thought for a while before you began shouting the news about youre damned ungrateful bula said i just saved you from a nasty beating i did what i had toi wasnt going to let the fireclown be shoved around this way he may get worse alan said bula grimaced and walked away with the two engineers alan looked around for his briefcase but couldnt find it he got onto the fastway again and took the elevator to the top but when he arrived he didnt go to city administration hed heard two people talking in the elevator there was going to be a debate in the solar house on last nights riots careless of what carson would think when he didnt turn up alan took a car towards the majestic solar house where representatives from all over the solar system had gathered he wanted very badly to see his grandfather and his exmistress in action solar house was a vast circular building with tall slender towers at intervals around its circumference each tower was topped by a gleaming glassalloy dome the center of the circle housed the main hall containing many thousands of places for members each nation had like the city of switzerland its own councils and subcouncils sending a certain number of candidates depending on its size to the solar house when alan squeezed his way into the public gallery the house was almost full many representatives must have just arrived back in their constituencies after the debate on the outgoing presidents policies only to hear the news of the riot and returned politics hadnt been nearly so interesting for years alan thought the debate had already opened in the center of the spiral was a small platform upon which sat the president benjosef looking old and sullen the chief mediator morgan tregarith in rubyred robes and metallic mask of justice the cabinet ministers including simon powys in full purple in the narrowest ring of benches surrounding the platform were the leaders of the opposition partieshelen curtis in a dark yellow robe belted at the waist with fluffs of lace at bodice and sleeves ancient baron rolf de crespigny leader of the rightwing reactionary democratic socialists john holt thinlipped in black leader of the solar nationalists bela hakasaki melancholyfaced hungarianjapanese leader of the divisionists luis jaffe of the new royalists and about a dozen more all representing varying creeds and opinions all comparatively weak compared with the solrefs rlms or even the demosocs behind the circle comprising the opposition leaders all the other solar representatives sat first the minor lights in the solref cabinetdenholm curtis undersecretary for hydroagriculture was therethen the members of the rlm shadow cabinet de crespignys shadow cabinet shared a tier with john holts behind them were four smaller groups behind them again six or seven until finally the rankandfile split into planets and continents and finally individual nations there were probably five thousand men and women in the solar house and they all listened carefully as alfred gupta minister for police affairs answered a charge made by helen curtis that the police had used violence towards last night s crowd miss curtis has accused chief of police sandai of exercising insufficient control over his officers that the men were allowed to indulge in offensive language towards members of the public attacked these members in a brutal manner and did not allow them to lodge a protest which they had prepared for the city council these are all grave chargescharges which have also appeared in the press and on our laservid screensand miss curtis mentions proof of police violence having appeared on those media if the charges are true then this is a matter of considerable magnitude but i suggest that the charges are fabrication a falsification of what actually happened i have here a statement from chief sandai he held up a piece of paper and then proceeded to read from ita straightforward account of what had actually happened agreeing that some police officers had been forced to defend themselves against the mob having been pressed beyond reasonable endurance alan had seen one or two of the policemen attack with very little provocation but he felt from his own observation of the previous nights trouble that the chiefs statement was fairly accurate although painting his officers a trifle too white to ring true the house itself seemed fairly divided on the question but when helen got up to suggest that the paper contained nothing but lies she was loudly cheered she went on in an ironical manner to accuse the solar referendum government of deliberately provoking the riot by allowing the city council to close off the levels minister for civil affairs ule bengtsson pointed out that it was not the governments policy to meddle in local politics and that if this matter had been discussed in the solar house in the first place then it might have been possible to veto the council but no such motion he observed cynically had been placed before the house this was indisputable alan saw that helen had decided to change her tactics asking the president pointblank if it was not the solar referendum party s fixed intention to silence and get rid of the fireclown who though he represented no political threat was in his own way revealing the sterility of the governments policies in all aspects of life on earth and beyond it benjosef remained seated his expression as it had always been was strangely affectionate like an old patriarch who must sometimes chide his children he spoke from his chair you have heard miss curtis accuse my government of underhand methods in an attempt to rid ourselves of this man who calls himself the fireclown i speak in honesty for myself and for the majority of my cabinet when i say we have no interest whatsoever in the fireclown or his activities so long as they remain within the law alreadyhe glanced at helen with a halfsmile on his faceit is doubtful whether his supporters have kept within the law though i have heard that the fireclown did not encourage last nights riot alan looking down on the old man felt glad that someone at least seemed to be keeping things in fair perspective then surprisingly the house was shaken by a tremendous verbal roar and he saw that several thousand representatives had risen to their feet and were for the second time in fortyeight hours shouting the president down he saw his grandfather glance towards the chief mediator his features hidden behind his mask the mediator nodded simon powys got up and raised his hands shouting to be heard very gradually the noise died down you do not disbelieve president benjosef surely we do helen gurus voice was shrill and it was echoed by hundreds of others you think the government is deliberately seeking to outlaw the fireclown we do again helen curtis statement was taken up by many of the others and you also think the fireclown wanted last nights riot there was a slight pause before helen curtis replied it was the only way his friends could help him personally he is an ingenuous man unaware of the forces working against him in the solar house and elsewhere so you think the rioters were justified we do is this democracy simon powys said quietly is this what my family and others fought to establish is this law noit is anarchy it is anarchy which the fireclown has inspired and you have been caught up in the mood why because perhaps you are too unintelligent too impatient to see how mankind may profit from this law we have created the fireclowns babblings are meaningless he talks of our speech having no meaning and turns sensible individuals into a maddened mob with the choice of a few emotional phrases that say nothing to the mind and everything to the belly the fireclown has caught popular fancy that much is obvious he sighed and stared around the house i am speaking personally now for some time i have been aware of the fireclowns potential ability to whip up the worst elements in human nature i have seen him as a very great threat to the solar nations stability to our progress to our development and to individual liberty and i note from last nights events that i was right alan saw in astonishment that his grandfathers level words had calmed the assembly that they seemed to be having some effect he had to admit that the old man seemed to be right as hed said yet in a way his words were too convincing it was still a feeling he hada feeling that no one in the assembly had as yet discussed anything alan thought that for them the fireclown had ceased to exist he was witnessing a clash between different ways of thought not a debate about the clown at all he remembered the old russian technique of choosing a vague name for their enemies and then using it specifically to denounce themattacking the albanians instead of the chinese had been one example everyone had known who the real enemies were but there was never a direct reference to them still that had been a calculated technique rather a good one for its purpose but simons angry relatives were now using it unconsciously they were attacking and defending something they were unable to verbalize but which perhaps wrongly they were identifying with the fireclown he looked down at the great assembly and for a moment felt pity then immediately felt abashed by his own arrogance perhaps he misjudged themperhaps they were not less aware but more hypocritical than he thought helen curtis was speaking again staring directly into her uncles eyes as he remained standing up on the platform i have never doubted minister powys sincerity in his denunciation of the fireclown but i do say he is a perfect example of the reactionary and conservative elements in the house who are unable to see a change as progress they see their kind of progress a progress which is inherent in their policies i see a different kind theirs leads to sterility and decay ours on the other hand leads to an expansion of mans horizons we wish to progress in many directions not just one that is why i see the fireclown as a victim of the solref government he offers scope and life and passion to human existence the solrefs merely offer safety and material comfort if miss curtis had studied the solar referendum manifesto in any detail simon powys exclaimed addressing the assembly she would have noted that we are pledged first to forming a strong basis upon which future society might work and expand evidently from the mobworship of this disgusting monster the fireclown we have yet to succeed you see the fireclown as a threat you see him as a monster you hound this man because in his naive and simple manner he has reawakened mankinds spirit helen spoke directly to powys her finger pointing up at him then you are a hollow man with no conception of the realities so the fireclown miss curtis tells me is a happy innocent bereft of schemes or ambition a prophet content only to be heard powys smiled at the assembly i say the fireclown is a tangible threat and that this madman intends to destroy the world alan craned forward his grandfather would not possibly have made so categorical a statement without evidence to back it up prove it helen curtis sneered you have gone too far in your hatredsenseless and unfounded hatredof the fireclown prove it simon powys face took on a sterner expression as he turned to speak to the president i have already alerted the city police he said calmly so there is no immediate danger if they work quickly there is no question of iti have been supplied with full proof that the fireclown is planning to destroy the world by flame in short he intends to blow up the planet chapter six alan was astounded for a moment his mood of cynicism held and he was aware of a cool feeling of disbelief as the house hushed for a second began to murmur helen suddenly looked frightened she stared rapidly around the house then up at powys whose stern manner could not disguise his triumph acting on my information the police have discovered a cache of plutonium warheads he continued warheads someone shouted we havent got any they were outlawed in fortytwo presumably the fireclown or some of his friends manufactured them it is well known that several scientists have been aiding him with his peculiar experiments with fire but he would need fantastic resources simon powys spread his hands aware that his moment of power had come presumably he said the fireclown has them i told you all that he was more than a mere irritation his power is even more extensive than i at first guessed helen sat down her face pale she made no attempt to question powys statement she was baffled yet as convinced of the truth as everyone else in the house the crowd in the public gallery was muttering and shoving to get a closer look at simon powys the old mans leonine head was raised evidently he no longer felt the need for oratory the house was his if the police discover the warhead cache we shall hear the news in a few moments he glanced towards the towering central doorway and satdown as the tension built up alan felt he could take no more of it he was preparing to turn back into the crowd behind him when a uniformed figure appeared at a side door and made his way down the tiers towards the platform it was chief sandai his brownyellow face shiny with sweat watched by everyone he climbed up the few steps of the platform and approached president benjosef respectfully the microphone picked up his voice and relayed it throughout the house mr president it is my duty to inform you that acting upon my own initiative i have declared a state of emergency in the city of switzerland a cache of plutonium warheads equipped with remote control detonators of a type used for setting off bombs from space has been found hidden on the first level my men have impounded them and await orders benjosef glanced at powys are you sure you have found all the bombs he said no sir all we know of are those we found there could be others these were stored in a disused warhouse cavern you are certain that there was no oversight when the warhouse was cleared of its armaments in the past perfectly certain sir these are new additions they were being kept in containers previously used for the same purpose that is all benjosef sighed well minister powys this is really your department now isnt it how did you find out about the bombs my secretary eugene junnar first reported his suspicions to me two days ago later investigations proved them to be true as soon as i knew i informed the police powys spoke slowly savoring his triumph benjosef addressed chief sandai and have you any evidence to show who was responsible for this illegal stockpile yes sir it is almost certain that the man concerned is the individual known as the fireclown the chamber was guarded by men known to be in his employ they at first tried to stop us from entering but offered no physical resistance one of them has since admitted himself to be a follower of the fireclown and the fireclown powys asked urgently chief sandai swallowed and wiped his forehead not in our custody yet sir angry impatience passed rapidly across simon powys face before being replaced by a further jutting of the jaw and an expression of resolve you had better find him and his accomplices as soon as you can sandai he may well have other bombs already planted have you sealed spaceports and checked all means of exit from the city itself naturally sir sandai seemed aggrieved then hurry and find him man the existence of the world may depend on locating him and arresting him immediately sandai galloped down the steps and strode hastily from the house alan didnt wait for any further development in the debate simon powys had made his point illustrated it perfectly and punched it home relentlessly to the assembly it was practically certain the presidency was his pushing through the crowded gallery he left to take an elevator down and an escalator out of the house the news must already have leaked to the press for laservid reporters were swarming around chief sandai who was obviously flustered and trying to shove his way past them careless of who saw him and the inference that might be put on his act alan began to run across the turf towards the nearest elevator cone he was sure that his earlier judgment of the fireclown could not have been so hopelessly wrong it was only instinct that drove him but he was so sure that his instinct was right that he was going back for the second time to the labyrinthine first level to look at the evidence for himself by the time he got to the lower levels another group of vociferous reporters were already on the scene police guards surrounded a stack of square heavy metal boxes unmarked at the bottom of the ramp which led down to the first level taking advantage of the police guards occupation with the reporters alan worked his way round them and entered the tunnel which he had gone down earlierthe one which led to the fireclowns laboratory two guards stood on each side of the entrance alan produced his city administration card and showed it to the men who inspected it closely just want to look round sergeant he said coolly to one of them ca would like to know what s going on here so we can take whatever precautions are necessary they let him through and he found himself in a big chamber equipped with all kinds of instruments and devices he couldnt recognize the purpose of many of them the place was dark lit only by an emergency bulb burning near the door it seemed to have been vacated very rapidly for there was evidence that an experiment had been taking place and had been hastily abandoned the door of a cooling chamber was open broken test tubes crunched beneath his feet chemicals glinted in the halflight splashed across floor benches and equipment he didnt touch anything but made his way to another door it was an oldfashioned steel door nearly a foot thick but it opened when he pushed in the room the darkness was complete he went back to find some means of lighting and finally settled for a portable emergency bulb picking it up by its handle and gingerly advancing into the next room the acrid smell of the spilled chemicals was almost unbearable his eyes watered this must have been a storeroom most of the chemical jars were still intact so were the boxes of spare parts neatly labelled yet there was nothing to suggest any warlike purpose for the laboratory there was little manufacturing equipment it was certain the place had only been used for research yet of course it was possible that a small manufacturing plant might have been housed in another section of the first level he came out of the storeroom and pushed another door on his left at first he thought it was locked but when he pushed again it gave whereas the storeroom had smelled of chemicals this one smelled merely damp it was an office files and notebooks were stacked around although a microfile cabinet had been damaged and its contents removed he noticed also a small old fashioned closed circuit television screen and wondered what the cameras were aimed at he switched it on the screen flickered and showed part of the corridor outside he turned the control but each picture showed an uninteresting corridor a cavern or a room until he turned once more and the screen brightened to show a welllighted room in it were two men and a woman the woman was unknown to alan but the men were unmistakablethe skinless corso his red peeled body even more repulsive in good light and the fireclown his great bulk seeming to undulate as he breathed his face still painted excitedly alan tried to get sound but there appeared to be no sound control on the set he had no idea where the trio were but it was fairly certain that cameras were only trained on parts of the first level therefore they must be close by the woman came up to the fireclown and pressed her body against him her right arm spread up across his back the fingers of the hand caressing him he smiledsomehow an extremely generous gesture considering he was now a hunted manand gently pushed her away saying something to her she did not appear annoyed corso was more animated he obviously felt a need for urgency which the fireclown did not alan suddenly heard a movement in the first chamber and hastily killed the set mr powys sir the sergeants voice shouted what is it he replied inwardly wishing the man dead wondered if you were all right thats the only thing sirthe smell in here is almost overpowering im fine sergeant thanks he heard the sergeant return to his post now he noticed a smaller door leading off the room it had no lock of any sort just a projection at the top he reached up to inspect it when the door wouldnt open it was a small bar of metal sliding into a socket he fiddled with it for a while pulled at it and at last the right combination of chances released the mechanism and he pulled the door alan had never seen a bolt before the emergency bulb lit the place and showed him a narrow lowroofed passage a rusted sign hung suspended lopsidedly by one chain the other had broken alan caught hold of it disliking the touch of grimy rust on his fingers and made out what it said restricted to all personnel he let the sign go and it swung noisily against the wall as he continued along the tunnel finally he came to another door but this one would not open at all he went past it until he reached the end of the tunnel this was half blocked by the fallen bulk of another massive steel door he pulled himself over it wondering if anyone had ever come this way since the lower levels which had primarily been used for storing armaments battlemachines and military personnel had been abandoned with the great disarmament of a noise ahead of him suddenly startled alan and he automatically switched off the emergency bulb voices sounded at first indistinct and then clearer as alan moved cautiously closer we shouldnt have left those machines intact if some fool fiddles about with them heaven knows what happen let them find out it was the fireclowns voice sounding like a pulsebeat and wholl be blamed he heard corso say tiredly you will i wish youd never talked me into this you agreed with my discoveries corso have you changed your mind now i suppose not damn alan heard someone stumble a woman giggled and said youre too hasty corso whats the hurry at present theyre combing the corridors they know about we have plenty of time unless they find the boat before we get there corso said querulously alan was creeping behind them now following them as they moved along in the dark im only worried about the fuel are you sure weve enough fuel corso the fireclown spoke although this man had been accused of planning to blow up the world alan felt a glow as he listened to the rich warm voice we wouldnt make luna certainly on what weve got but weve got enough to take us as far as we want to go good alan heard a low whine a hissing noise a thump and then the voices were cut off suddenly a few yards further on his hand touched metal he switched on the emergency bulb and discovered that he had come to a solid wall of steel this was completely smooth and he could not guess how it opened he tried for almost an hour to get it to work but finally his body feeling hollow with frustration he gave up and began to make his way back in the direction he had come a short time later the ground quivered for a few seconds and he had to stop thinking insanely that the stockpile of bombs had exploded when it was over he thought he could guess what had caused it the fireclown had made some reference to a boata space boat perhaps that had taken off though how it was possible so deep underground he couldnt guess he was feeling intensely tired his limbs and his head ached badly and he was incapable either of sustained thought or action he had to keep stopping every few yards in order to rest his body trembling with reaction but reaction to what to some new nervous or mental shock or was it the cumulative effect of the past few days he had been unable to sort out and analyze his emotions earlier and was even less capable of doing so now an acute sense of melancholy possessed him as he stumbled miserably on at last arriving back at the office wearily he dumped the emergency bulb down in the main chamber suddenly becoming conscious of a tremendous heat emanating from some source outside when he reached the entrance the guards had gone somewhere in the distance he heard shouts and other noises as he reached the opening on to the main corridor he saw that it was ablaze with light and the lighta weird greenblue blazewas coming from the fireclowns great cavern a policeman ran past him and alan shouted whats happening fire the policeman continued to run now pouring like a torrent the flames were eddying down the corridor a surging swift moving inferno there was nothing for the fire to feed on yet it moved just the same as if of its own volition fascinated alan watched it approach the heat was soon unbearable and he backed into the chamber only at that moment did it dawn on him that he should have run towards the ramps he was completely trapped also the laboratory contained inflammable chemicals which would ignite as soon as the blaze reached them he ran towards the entrance again stupefied by the heat and saw that it was too late the wall of heaving flame had almost reached him he still felt no panic part of him almost welcomed the flames but the air was becoming less and less breathable he wrenched open doors looking for another exit the only possible one seemed to be that which hed just come back from it occurred to him that the fireclown had been misjudged all roundby everyone except his grandfather who had realized the danger the fireclown had released an inferno on the city of switzerland but how he had never seen or heard of any flames like those which now began to dart around the corridor he coughed and rubbed the sweat out of his eyes at last his brain began to function again but too late now for him to do anything constructive suddenly the entrance was filled with a roaring mass of fire he retreated from it hit his back against the corner of a bench stumbled towards the office as he slammed the steel door behind him he heard an explosion as the flame touched some of the spilled chemicals air was still flowing in from another source in the small tunnel he kept the door open the other door sealing off the flames began to heat and he realized with fantastic horror that when it melted as it inevitably must he would die he would he decided leave the office and head into the tunnel at the last minute sitting in the darkness his confused mind began to clear as the heat rose and he faced death a peculiar feeling of calm came upon him and belatedly he began to think the thoughts were not particularly helpful in his present predicament they told him of no way of escape but they helped him face the inevitable he thought he understood now the philosophic calm which came to men facing death for some days he realized he had been moving in a kind of halfdream grasping out for something that might have beenhe hesitated and then let the thought comelove his emotions had ruled him he had been their toy unaware of his motives he had always been to a degree unstable in this way perhaps because of his tendency to suppress the unpleasant ideas which sometimes came to him having no parents unloved by his grandfather his childhood had been spent in a perpetual quest for attention at school he had been broken of his exhibitionism and the nature of his job gave him no means of expressing these feelings now he sought perhaps that needed love in the fireclown with his constant evoking of parent images certainly he had sought it in helen so much so that a similar need in her had clashed with his own and now spurred on by his grandfathers bitter references to his illegitimacy he had embarked on a search which had led him to thisdeath he got up abstractedly watching the door slowly turning red hot had many others like him identified the fireclown with some need to feel wanted he smiled it was too pat reallytoo cheap but he had hit upon a clue to the fireclowns popularity even if he was not yet near to the exact truth looking at it from another angle he assembled the facts they were few and obvious the fireclowns own psychological need had created the creed that he had preached and it had found an echo in the hearts of a large percentage of the worlds population but the creed had not really supplied an answer to their ills had only enabled them to find expression the door turned to smoky white and he smelled the steel smoldering a slight glow filled the room and his mouth was dry of saliva his body drained of sweat the world had reached some kind of crisis point perhaps it was as the fireclown had said because man had removed himself from his roots and lived an increasingly artificial life yet alan couldnt completely accept this an observer from another star for instance might see the rise and fall of manmade constructions as nothing more than a natural changeprocess did human beings consider an anthill unnatural wasnt the city of switzerland itself merely a huge anthill he saw with surprise that the door had faded from white to red hot and the heat in the room was decreasing immediately there was some hope he forgot his reverie and watched the change intently soon the door was only warm to his touch he pushed at it but it wouldnt budge then he realized that the heat had expanded the metal he waited impatiently giving an experimental push every now and then until at last the door gave and he stepped into the ruined laboratory the fire had destroyed much but now the room swam with liquid an occasional spurt from the walls close to the ceiling told him the source of his salvation evidently the old section of the city had had to protect itself against fire more than any other partthe old automatic extinguishers had finally functioned and engulfed the fire in the passage outside it was the same the extinguishers had not been testednot even known aboutfor years but activated by the extreme heat they had finally done the job they had been designed for with relief he began to run up the pitchdark corridor at last finding his way to the ramp a small heap of containers was still there but there were not so many as he had seen earlier had the police managed to take them or had they been salvaged by the fireclown it was of course virtually impossible for fire to destroy the pbombs shielding but how many knew that these days how much panic alan wondered had been the result of the fireclowns holocaust levels all the way up had been swept by fire he was forced to push his body on and on climbing the emergency stairways avoiding charred corpses and wreckage naked flame had not been used in the city for many years and fire precautions had been laxthere had been no need for them until now alan wondered wryly if the fireclowns popularity was as great as it had been yesterday the first group of men he met were on the fifteenth level they were forcing open a door in a residential corridor obviously equipped as a rescue team they stared at him astonished where did you come from one of them asked rubbing a dirty sleeve over his sootblackened face i was trapped down belowold fire extinguishers put out the fire they may have put out the fire that the initial fire started another said but they wouldnt have worked on the first lot we tried nothing puts it out once its under way then why is it out now just thank the stars it is out we dont know why it suddenly subsided and disappeared between the fifteenth and sixteenth levels we can only guess that the stuff its made of doesnt last forever we dont know why it burns and we dont know what it burns to think we trusted the fireclown and he did this to our homes youre sure it was the fireclown who else he had the pbomb cache didnt he it stands to reason he had other weapons tooflameweapons hed made himself alan passed on the semimelted corridors gave way to untouched corridors full of disturbed people milling around men organizing them into rescue teams emergency hospital stations had been set up and doctors were treating shock and burn victims the lucky survivors the lowest level had been built to withstand destruction of this kind but the newer levels had not been if he had been on the tenth level or even the ninth where a few families had still lived before the blaze he wouldnt be alive now though climbing the emergency stairs and ramps was hard going alan chose these instead of the overcrowded fearfilled elevators on he climbed grateful for the peace and quiet of the stairs in contrast to the turbulence in the corridors he was crossing the corridor of the thirtieth level when he saw that one of the shopfrontsit was a consumer corridorbore a gaudy slogan a freer life with the rlm it said the place was the election headquarters of the radical liberal movement another postera tridi buildupshowed the smiling face of helen curtis at the top above the picture it said curtis and at the bottom below the picture it said president the troublesome for had been left out he stopped and spoke to the door of the place may i come in the door opened he walked into a posterlined passage and into a large room stacked with election literature bundles of leaflets and posters all brightly colored were stacked everywhere there didnt seem to be anyone around he picked up a plastipaper poster of helen an audiostrip in its lining began to whisper softly curtis for president curtis for president curtis for president he flung it down and as it crumpled the whispering stopped i see thats another vote ive lost said helens voice behind him i had a feeling i was going to meet you he said quietly still staring at the fallen poster it would be likely in my own election headquarters this is only the storeroom do you want to see the offices theyre smart her voice unlike her words was not a bit cheerful what are you going to do with all this now he said waving a tired arm around the room use it of course what did you expect i should have thought a campaign wouldnt have been worth your time now you think because i supported the fireclown when he was popular i wont have a chance now hes unpopularis that it yes he was surprised her spirit it seemed was still there she didnt have a chance of winning the elections now was she hiding the fact from herself he wondered look alan she said forcefully i could have walked into the presidency without a fight if this hadnt happened now its going to be a tough fightand im rather glad you always liked a fight certainlyif the oppositions strong enough he smiled was that levelled at me by any chance ive heard it said that if a man doesnt love a woman enough she thinks hes strong if he loves her too much she thinks hes weak was the opposition weak helen youre very sensitive today her voice was deliberately cool no i wasnt levelling anything at you i was talking about your grandfathers happy turn of luck our positions are completely reversed now arent they i dont know how i feel about it he said stopping the tendency to sulk helens retort had stung him im not really in support of either of you i think on the whole i favor the rlms they could still win the constituency elections couldnt they even if you didnt get the presidency that would give you a strong voice in the house if they kept me as leader alan her face softened as she admitted a truth which previously she had been hiding from not everyone who approved of my stand yesterday approves of it today i hate to say i warned you of it you should have known better helen than to go around whipping up mobs people have to trust politicians as well as like them they want a modern uptodate president certainlybut they also want a respectable one when the voters sit down and think about it even if this fireclown business hadnt taken the turn it has theyll choose the candidate they can feel confidence in fiery politics of your sort only work for short spells helen even i know that much admittedly after showing yourself as a woman of the people you could have stuck to parliamentary debate to make your points and probably danced home but now youve identified yourself so strongly with the fireclown that you havent a hope of winning i should give it up he looked at her wistfully she laughed shortly striding up and down between the bales of posters i havent a dogs chanceyoure right but ill keep on fighting lucky old simon eh hes now the man who warned the people of their danger who else could they vote for dont get bitter helen why dont you start painting again you know what youre doing in that field really even i know more about politics than you do you should never have entered them there are people who are natural born politicians but youre just not one of them ive asked you this a dozen times previously but id still like to know what makes you go on with it one of the strongest reasons is because the more people disapprove of my actions the harder i pursue them fair enough she turned staring at him quizzically with her head cocked on one side he smiled in a word youre just plain obstinate maybe if id encouraged you in your political work you might have been a wellknown painter by nowand well rid of all this trouble maybe but its more than that alan she spoke softly levering herself up on to one of the bales she sat there swinging her legs looking very beautiful she no longer wore the makeup shed had on earlier but ive got myself into this now and im going to stick at it until the end sink or swim he told her about his visit to the first levelomitting that hed heard the fireclown and his friends leavingand of his narrow escape i thought i was going to be killed he said and i thought of you i wondered in fact if we werent both searching for the same thing searching i didnt know you were the searching kind alan until this fireclown business blew up i was the hiding kind i hid a lot from myself but something grandfather said must have triggered something else in me he paused was it only three days ago he mused wonderingly what did he say oh alan answered lightly he made a rather pointed reference to the fact that my ancestry isnt all it might be that was cruel of him maybe it did me good maybe it brought something into the open anyway i started getting curious about the fireclown then you visited me and i was even more curious perhaps because you associated yourself with the fireclowns creed i associated him with you and it led on from there i went to see the fireclown the same night you know did you speak to him personally she sounded envious no i never got to see him actually but i attended yesterdays audience i thought i understood why you supported him in his own heavy way he made sense of a kind he frowned but the same could be said for grandfather i suppose that was a good speech this morning yes it was she was staring at him her mouth slightly open her breasts moving beneath her lacy bodice as she breathed im glad all this has happened he continued its done a lot of good for me i think youre glad about the pbombs being foundabout the fire too no i couldnt really believe the fireclown was guilty until i saw the evidence for myself and i still dont hate him for what he tried to dofor what he still might try to do for that matter i feel sorry for him in his own way he is the naive and generous giant you tried to tell me about thats what i think you were down therewere you satisfied that the fireclown was responsible for stockpiling those bombs and starting the fire the evidence was plain im afraid its idiotic she said angrily why should he do a thing like that a man so full of love loveor hate helen what do you mean he professed to love mankindbut he hated mankinds works he hated what he thought were our faults not exactly true love eh well never know i wonder if he escaped i hope he hasso long as he doesnt try any more sabotage for the second time in the last few days alan found himself concealing something from his exmistress he didnt tell her that he knew the fireclown had managed a getaway at least from earth instead he said should he escape after all he was responsible for the deaths of least a hundred people the residential corridors on nine and ten all the way up to fifteen were full of corpses probably a great many more were roasted in their homes a nasty death helen i know i came close to it myself should he escape without punishment a man like the fireclown is probably not conscious of his crime alan so whos to say hes intelligent i dont think hes insane in any way we can understand warped perhaps oh well let s stop talking about the fireclown theres a worldwide search out for him now the fact that he vanished seems to prove his guilt at least for simon powys and the public ive noticed a few remained loyal to the fireclown for some time after they found out about the bombs if the fire hadnt started hed probably still have strong support from people who thought the bombs were planted you cant plant a stack of pbombs helen the fireclown must have made them hes the only one with the resources thats what everyone thinks but a few of us politicians know better alan nuclear weapons have been banned for years what are you talking about not everyone gave up all their stockpile in the early days of the great disarmament alan there were quite a few who hung on to some secret arms piles until they saw how things were going of course when the solar government was found to work and the threat of war dwindled away to nothing they forgot about them or got rid of them good god nuclear bombs im not superstitious wars a thing of the past but it seems dreadful that the weapons should still be around there are plenty she said ironically at least enough to fight a major solar war chapter seven alan like the rest of his contemporaries had lived sc long in a peaceful world that the concept of war particularly war fought on a nuclear scale was horrifying for nearly a century the world had hovered on the brink of atomic conflict but time after time governments had jus managed to avoid it with the final outlawing of nuclear weapons in a great sigh of relief had gone up the human race had come dangerously close to destroying itself but at last it could progress without that fear forever pressing on it and now helens casual reference to a solar war you dont mean that as a serious suggestion do you he asked her alan the solar cabinet myself and one or two other party leaders have been aware of the existence of nuclear arms for some time simon powys in his speech before the house this morning could not reveal that because if the news leaked we might well have a fresh panic on our hands anyway it suited his purpose to suggest that the fireclown manufactured them the fireclown might have been able to make his but he could just as easily have bought them bought alan gasped bought them from whom from one of the men who specialize in such things over the years there has been a constant black market in nuclear arms the police have been aware of it and they have been vigilant many of those who discovered forgotten caches have been arrested and the weapons destroyed but some havent and these men would welcome physical conflictpreferably on earth or between earth and one of the other worlds so that they could get to safety on the unthreatened world if one side began an attack with nuclear arms the other would have to defend itselfand the dealers could then get any price that they wanted but surely arms dealing on such a scale is impossible not if the cards are played right and it has been evident to me for some time that someone is playing their cards right if he gets the hand he wantsbang suddenly overnight without any kind of warning and none of the psychological protection people perhaps had a hundred years ago wed be plunged into a war of colossal destruction i cant believe it perhaps its better remember this is only what the dealers wish forit might not happen thats why its so secret it might be possible to remove the danger once and for all with none of the public knowing it was there the rlm shadow cabinet have a plan to prevent the eventuality simon powys has another i think ours is better now you know one of the reasons im in politics and why i stay in ill accept that he said a trifle dubiously do you think the fireclowns tied up with any of these dealers if hes tied up with one hes probably tied up with them all those we havent caught are the most powerful and have very likely formed themselves into a syndicate thats what the rumors say at any rate i saw no evidence of a plant when i explored the fireclowns level so its probable that he could have bought the pbombs theres another angle to it helen said thoughtfully admittedly i may not have been wholly objective about the fireclown but what if the dealers had planted the pbombs on him knowing that someone would eventually find out why should they do that alan bent down and picked up a handbill his eyes fixed on it it was another picture of helen this time in a heroic pose fifty words of text underneath briefly outlined her ideals in purple adjectives the arms dealers want a warpreferably one that wouldnt have too destructive results and wouldnt involve all three habitable planets first hint that the fireclown has a stockpile supply the evidence to be found take advantage of the scareand the possibility of the fireclown possessing more weaponsthen unload a readymade batch of weapons for defense of the solar government that way you see there might not be a war at allbut the dealers would profit just the same that sounds close to the truthif the dealers did frame the fireclown of course but we have proof that he caused the destruction of fifteen levels how do you explain that that fire was impossible to extinguish he had obviously made it in the same way he manufactured that weird artificial sun in the cavern he may have been pushed into itself defense no i dont think so theres one way we can get more information she said briskly jumping down off the bale we can go and see simon powys hed know more about it than anyone do you want to do that im curious more than that alan she smiled nervously i may be able to wheedle something out of the old patriarch that would be advantageous to me in the election if i could prove that the fireclown was framed it would help a lot he shook his head wondering at her incredible optimism all right he said lets go simon powys received them with the air of the conquering roman general receiving the defeated barbarian leaders all he needed alan thought was a toga and a laurel crown he smiled urbanely greeted them conventionally offered them drinks which they accepted come into the study he said to his grandson and niece he led the way he had furnished the place with deliberate archaism there were even a few family portraitsof the bestremembered members of the powys clan the first denholm alan and simon powys hung there as well as the two women presidents of the solar government a proud and slightly somberlooking group the bookcases were of mahogany filled primarily with books on politics history and philosophy the novels were of the same typepolitical novels by disraeli trollope koestler endelmans and de la vega alan rather envied his grandfathers onetrack mind it made him good at his career to tell you the truth simon powys said heavily i feel sorry for you both you were misled as most people were and this business musthave left you slightly in the air it hasnt done you much good politically has it helen a pityyouve got good powys stuff in youstrong will impersonal ambition and an eye to the main chance she smiled though youll probably say uncle simon that i lack selfdiscipline and could do with a spot more commonsense youd probably be right about the selfdiscipline i lost out on that onei think im finished now dont you alan admired her guile simon powys nodded regretfully he probably did regret his nieces political demise just as he obviously regretted alans never having shown an interest in politics still you were rather foolish yknow i know she said contritely he turned to alan and you my boy i suppose you understand why i was so adamant earlier yes grandfather the old man seemed to warm to both of them i shall be president no doubt when the next session begins it was really my last opportunity to take such high responsibilityfamily tradition demands a powys of every generation to serve at least one term i was hoping that you alan would follow on but i suppose the task will fall to helens son and denholms i wish my daughter he cleared his throat seemingly moved to strong emotion although alan thought the last line had been a bit stagey it was probably for his benefit he wondered why he should have felt such momentary love for his grandfather at their earliest interview what made you suspicious of the fireclown in the first place helen said in the manner of a whodunit character preparing the detective for his denouement instinct i suppose could have told you there was something fishy about him the first time i heard of him made junnar go down and have a look the first opportunity he could there was also another business which i cant really talk about he knows about the illegal stockpiles uncle helen said forthrightly really a bit unwise to spread it around isnt it im not in the habit of betraying confidences grandfather alan said tritely with a hard look at helen no i suppose if s all right but presumably helen has impressed you with the need for secrecy of course helen said well i had a feeling hed been connected with the dealers theyre the only group of criminals powerful enough to hide a man and help him change his identity i guessed that he had probably come from their hideout though this was all conjecture you understand the police investigated him and could find nothing to indicate it though they agreed with me so in fact unless it can be established that the pbombs are part of the old stock there is nothing to connect him with the dealers helen said trying hard not to show her disappointment i have already been in touch with the laboratory analyzing the bombs they tell me they are old stockyou would have discovered that soon anyway at the next committee meeting obviously we cant tell the public that obviously said helen though it might have strengthened my own case in the house slightly not to any important degree whats this committee alan asked curiously we call it the one hundred committee after a slightly less effective british antinuclear group which existed in the middle of the twentieth century actually there are only ten of us the committee is pledged to locating every single nuclear weapon left over from the old days and seeing the offenders punished where possible we work of course in close collaboration with the highly secret arpthe arms removal police our work has been going on for years helen is the secretary and i am the chairman other important politicians comprise the remaining eight very worthy said alan are you effective we have been in the past though our job is becoming more difficult since the dealers work together pooling their resources they would welcome an opportunity to sell what they haveperhaps helen has already told you yes she has but it occurred to me that you could offer to buy the dealers out now surely it would be better to pay their price and have the arms without waiting for a crisis to decide you thats our main bone of contention helen put in uncle doesnt agree with buying them now i want to do that the fantastic price these brigands would demand would beggar the solar nation simon powys said gruffly to his grandson we must do it in secret and justify the expenditure at the same time it would be impossible i feel theyll overstep the mark at some stage then well catch them the expenditures worth it helen said we could recuperate from poverty but survival in a nuclear war if we caught the fireclown then alan said slowly it might give us a lead to the arms dealer possibly powys agreed though he might not admit to it secondly he might not even know who the dealers are they are naturally extremely cautious however they are certainly going to take advantage of the trouble the fireclown has caused the man must be caughtand destroyed before he makes any more trouble grandfather alan was shocked the death penalty had been abolished for more than a hundred years im sorryim extremely sorry helen you must forgive an old mans tongue these concepts were not quite so disgusting when i was a young man certainly we must imprison or exile the fireclown alan nodded its funny he said that the fireclown should preach a return to nature that in fact science leads to mankinds destruction and yet he should be planning that same destructionor at very least is a tool of those who would welcome it life said the old man with the air of a philosopher is full of that sort of paradox chapter eight ill see you home alan said lightly as they left the apartment that would be nice she said they walked slowly through the gardens repaired and beautiful again the starlight was augmented by soft beams from the roof structure which had the appearance of many tiny moons shining down each one casting a single exquisite beam the top had been well designed to live here was the ambition of every young man and woman it gave people thought those at the top something to aim for if only i could speak to the fireclown personally helen said wistfully then at least id be able to form a better idea of what hes really like alan preferred to say nothing they reached the door of her apartment on the sixtythird level and went in familiar smells greeted him smells which he always associated with helenfresh slightly scented of soap and oils it was strange he reflected that womens apartments always seemed to smell better than mens maybe it was an obvious thought he noticed he was breathing a little more quickly slightly more shallowly neither recognized by outward expression the thought that was in their minds yet each was aware of the others emotions alan was slightly fearful for he remembered the conflict between them as well as their old happiness and realized that helen probably did too would you like a nightcap she invited id prefer coffee if youve got it unconsciously he had given her her opportunity he was torn now half afraid of what seemed likely to happen she came over to him as he sat down in a comfortable chair beside a small shelf of booktapes she leaned down and stroked his face lightly you look dreadfully tired alan ive had a hard day he smiled he took her hand and kissed it ill go and get the coffee she said when she came back she had changed into a pair of chaste pyjamas and a robe of thick dark blue material she had a tray of coffeereal coffee from the smell she put it down on a table and drew up a chair so that the tablewas between them helen he thought oh helen i love you they were staring at each other both wondering perhaps if this reunion would take on the same pattern as their previous affair were wiser now she said softly handing him his coffee its a powys traitwe learn by our mistakes there are always different mistakes to be made he warned her it was the last attempt to retreat from the situation and allow her to do the same as gracefully as possible thats experience she said and the fears were forgotten now they looked at one another as if they were new friends when they made love that night it was entirely different from anything either had ever before experienced they treated one another delicately yet passionately as if a return to their earlier less selfconscious love would plunge them back into the turmoil of four months before in the morning alans arm was aching painfully from having cradled her head all night he raised her head gently and propped himself on his elbow tracing the softness of her shoulder with his fingers she opened her eyes and seemed to be looking at him like a respectful stranger presumably there was a similar expression in his own face for he felt he shared her emotion he kissed her lightly on the lips and pushed back the bed clothes swinging himself out of the narrow bed he sat slightly hunched on the edge studying his head and torso reflected in the mirror opposite ive got an idea where the fireclown is he said suddenly she was half asleep and didnt seem to hear him he didnt repeat himself then but went into the kitchen to make coffee he was feeling rather tired now and his legs shook a little as the machine came alive and produced two beakers of hot coffee he transferred the coffee into cups and took them back she was sitting up what did you say about the fireclown you know where he is no but we might be able to guess he told her about overhearing the trio in the passage why didnt you tell me about this yesterday that was yesterday he said simply she understood and nodded they took off in a small spaceboat ive thought about it since and i think there must be a launching ramp leading through the rock to somewhere outside the city those old bombs had be launched from somewhere that sounds logical you say he remarked that they didnt have enough fuel to make luna they may have made a transcontinental flight unlikely you cant land even a small rocket without at least a few people observing it ive got a feeling theyre orbitingmaybe waiting for someone to pick them up or they may have gone to st renes why should they do that the monastery of st rene lafayette was the home of a group of monks who practiced a form of scientific mysticism little was known about the order and it was thought that the monks were harmless the monastery was in fact an abandoned spacestation which the monks had taken over the world had decided they were quaintly mad and had all but forgotten them well helen said sipping her coffee its just a connection that my mind made i associated one crank with a group of others i suppose unless they were orbiting its the only place they could have gone alan agreed i wonder how we could find out by going there perhaps wed need a boat we havent got one my brother has a nice jobone of the latest paolos would he let us take it we dont need to ask i often use it i have a pilots license the audiolocks respond to my voice the ground staff at the port know mewed have a good chance of getting away with it and going to our deaths maybe the fireclown appears to be more ruthless than we thought remember but are the monks they are bound to give sanctuary to those they term unclears i believe if s worth a try he got up im going to have a bath is my green suit still here yes good he glanced at the chronom on the wall its still early if we leave now we could he turned to her where is your brothers ship hamburgshes a sealander a fast cab could get us there in an hour youd better get up and get ready he grinned at her as she sprang out of bed hamburg spaceport was surrounded by a pleasant gardencity with a population of less than two million in contrast to the capital city of switzerland its buildings were single or doublestoried beyond the spaceport buildings water glinted in the summer sun beneath a pale and cloudless blue sky as the cab spiralled down towards the landing roof a huge bulbous ship suddenly erupted from the waves water boiling to steam as it lumbered upwards helen pointed the titan bound for mars and ganymede probably carrying one of the last seed consignments they need by the time the cab brought them down on the roof the ship had disappeared from his lodge the only building on the roof an official in a brown velvet cutaway and baggy cerise pantaloons came sauntering towards them he was a firmfaced man with a smile good morning miss curtis sorry to hear about yesterday he said many peoples faith in the fireclown seems to have been misplaced yes indeed said helen forcing a smile in response to his im planning to make a pleasure trip until the fuss dies down is the solar bird ready i expect so she was being checked in the locks i believe she should be okay now do you want to go straight down yes please he took them into his lodge a neat office with a big window overlooking the sea which was still heaving and steaming after the titans takeoff a small elevator cage was set in one wall the man opened the gate for them glancing at alan in a speculative way alan returned his stare blandly and followed helen into the elevator it began to hiss downward a man in coveralls let them out a plump redfaced man with a mechanics badge on his sleeve good morning miss helen nice to see you good morning freddie this is mr powysfreddie weinschenk they shook hands and weinschenk led them along an artificially lit corridor alan had never been in hamburg before but he knew the general design of a modern spaceport they were now below ground level he guessed heading along a tunnel which led under the seabed finally freddie ordered a door to open and they were in a dark cool chamber with metal walls from one wall the back half of a small spaceyacht projected seeming at first to be stuck on the wall until alan realized that the other half lay outside and that they were actually in a pressure chamber thanks freddie helen went up to the airlock and spoke to it it began to slide open then slowly the four doors all opened and they went into the cramped cabin of the ship freddie shouted from outside if youre leaving immediately miss ill start the chamber up thanks freddie see you when we get back helen went to the control panel and touched a stud the airlocks closed behind them she switched on the exterior viewer so they could see the chamber freddie had left and alan saw that the room was swiftly being flooded soon it was full and the wall surrounding the ship began to expand away from the ship itself and he saw the ramp extending outwards into open sea well make a soft takeoff helen said strapping herself in the pilots couch alan got into the other couch we dont want anyone to think were in a hurry she added the softer the better he smiled ive only been into space once and i didnt much care for the trip she was an old chemical ship and i was certain she was going to break down every inch of the journey youll see a lot of difference in the solar bird she activated the drive its unlikely they could improve a nuclear ship any further theyll have to start thinking of some new type of engine now i suppose just as the old type starts getting familiar and comfortable the control panel was alive now its instruments measuring and informing alan felt a double pounding beat for a second or so and then the ship was speeding up the ramp leaving it plunging up through water and then was in daylight racing into the sky she switched on the chartviewer selected the area of space she wanted it showed her the position of the spacestation monastery and gave her all the information she needed i hope your hunch is right she said and turned round to see that alan had blacked out there had been no reason for this at all since the mounting pressure outside was completely countered by the ships internal mechanisms it was probably some kind of reflex she decided im a fool he said when he was awake again did anything happen or was it just my imagination just imagination im afraid but you needed the sleep anyway where are we in orbit we should be getting pretty close to the station in a little while for the time being im going to pretend were in troublethat way well lull any suspicions the monks might have if they are harboring the fireclown soon the wheel of the big station came in sight the sun bright on its metal there were two ships they could see hugged in its receiving bays a big one and a little one the big one was of unfamiliar design they could see its title etched on its hull from where they were pimeson funny name for a ship alan commented the monksif it is their shiphave got funny ideas she reached out to press a red stud thats the mayday signal with any luck they should get it in a moment their screen flickered and a face appeared on ita thin man leannosed and thinlipped would it be impertinent to deduce that you are in trouble he said it wouldnt be no helen replied can you help us who knows can you maneuver your ship so that we can grapple or shall we send out help the steering seems to be all right she said ill come in she coasted the ship until they were near one of the empty bays and the stations magnegraps pulled them into the bay when finally they climbed from their ship into the unpleasant air of the monastery they were greeted by the thinfaced monk he was dressed in a blue habit that did nothing for his already pale face his hair was short but he had no tonsure his eyes and cheeks were sunken but in his own way he looked healthy enough he held out a skeletal hand with incredibly long fingers i am auditor kurt he said as alan shook hands it is good that we can be of service to you please come this way he took them into a small barely furnished room and offered them tea which they accepted what exactly is wrong with your ship he asked politely im not sure im not familiar with the typeits new i could not get the landing jets to work when i tested them preparatory to reentering the atmosphere its just as well i did test them she had personally jammed the jet control it could be fixed easily you were lucky to be so close the monk nodded alan was wondering how he could find out if the fireclown was here im extremely interested in your order he said conversationally im something of a student of religions perhaps you can tell me about yours only that we were founded as long ago as although this order did not come into existence until and did not come here until about twenty years ago we are a branch of the original faith which did not pay a great deal of attention to its mystical aspects until we founded the order of st rene st rene is not the true name of our inspired founderthat is secret to almost allbut that is the name we use for him i should like to see the monastery is that possible alan looked around the small room avoiding the monks intent gaze normally it would be possiblebut ah we have repairs going on in many parts we are not really prepared for visitors oh then whose is the ship other than ours in the receiving bay which one there are two the pimeson and the odmethuselah both ours the monk said hastily both ours then why did you ask which one i spoke of the monk smiled we monks have devious minds im afraid it is the nature of our calling excuse me ill go and check that the mechanics are repairing your ship he rose and left they heard the door seal itself behind him they were locked in alan sipped his tea if the fireclowns here theyre not likely to let on to outsiders whod take the news back to earth he said well have to think of a means of getting a look around this place have you noticed the atmosphere its weird the atmosphere of the place fitted well with the spacestation monastery circling in space away from the things of earth it had a detached air of calm about it and yet there was a feeling of excitement here too it was possible of course that he was imagining it for he was very excited himself do you think they know what hes up to or is he just making use of their habit of affording people sanctuary alan asked her they seem unworldly to say the least she replied shivering a little for the room was not well heated the door opened and auditor kurt came back your boat has been fixed my friends i see from the registration plates that it is owned by denholm curtisan important man on earth is he not hes my brother helen said wondering if the monk was getting at anything in particular alan became aware at last that they might be in danger if the fireclown was here and knew they were here too he might decide it was risky to let them go so you are helen curtis who then is this gentleman im alan powys ah yes simon powys grandson from what i have seen of recent lasercasts miss curtis and minister powys are at odds over certain issues which side do you support mr powys neither alan said coldly just call me a disinterested spectator a peculiar expression came on the monks face for a second alan could work out what it indicated i should say you were the least disinterested the monk mused then he said briskly you asked earlier if you could look over the monastery to tell you the truth we are not always willing to let strangers inspect our home but i think it would be all right if you wanted to take a quick tour before you leave why the monks sudden change was he planning to lead them into some sort of trap alan had to take the chance thanks a lot he said they began to walk along the curving corridor this part the monk told them was reserved for the monks cells they turned into a narrower corridor which led them to another similar to the one theyd just left though the curve was tighter here is what we term our clearing house the monk smiled opening a door and letting them precede him through it was a fairly large room several monks sat on simple chairs they were dressed in brown dungarees the monk in the center was dressed like auditor kurt in a blue habit and was chanting some sort of litany how would you worry somebody he chanted by destroying their confidence the other monks mumbled in reply how would you make somebody happy by casting forth their engrams said the monks in unison how would you help somebody teach them tobe clear by the spirit of the eight dynamics intoned the blueclad monk i command thee to cast forth thy engrams forthwith the monks seemed to freeze concentrating intently above them behind the monk in the blue habit a weird machine whirred and buzzed dials swinging around strangely marked faces lights flashing alan said respectfully what are they doing they are attempting to learn the ultimate secret of the great triangle auditor kurt whispered ah alan nodded intelligently they left this room and entered another here a great screen was blank and there were comfortable chairs scattered around before it sit down said kurt we are expecting a special event today alan and helen sat down and watched the screen they fidgeted for over half an hour as nothing happened and kurt continued to watch the screen impassively not looking at them alans sense of danger was heightened and he had a feeling the monk was deliberately keeping them in suspense then all at once big letters began to form on the screen until a whole sentence was emblazoned there another brother clear said the message it meant nothing to either of them alan turned to the monk half suspicious that a trick had been played on them but the monk was looking ecstatic and incredibly pleased what does it mean alan asked desperately what it saysthe hampering engrams have been exorcised from one of our brothers he is now a clear and ready to become a brother auditor as i am it is a time for rejoicing in the monastery when this comes about alan scratched his head and looked at helen who was equally perplexed well beamed thinfaced auditor kurt now you have seen a little of our monastery half convinced that he was the victim of a practical joke alan nodded mutely he was no nearer to finding out if the fireclown was here although perhaps a check on the pimeson when they got back to earth would help them thank you for showing us helen said brightly she too was obviously uncertain of what to do next ohthe monk seemed to remember somethingthere is one other thing i should like to show you before you leave will you follow me they walked until they were close to the center of the spacewheel came to a small door in the curved wall of central control auditor kurt ordered it open it hissed back and they stepped through good afternoon mr powys said the fireclown amiably chapter nine so you did come here helen blurted out i have no idea how you deduced it he grinned but i must praise your intelligence i hope no one else on earth thinks as you do alan kept silent they would be safer if they didnt tell the fireclown how they had worked out his hiding place he looked around corso and the woman were also there lounging in their seats and staring amusedly at the rest he felt dwarfed by the fireclowns bulk not only physicallythe man stood at least six foot sixbut also psychologically he could only stare stupidly unable to say anything yet it was peculiar now that they were face to face he did not feel afraid any longer the mans strange magnetism was tangible and once again he found himself liking the fireclown unable to believe that he had committed an act of mass murder and plotted to blow up the earth so you are alan powys mused the fireclown as if the name had some special meaning his face was still heavily painted with wide lips and exaggerated eyes but alan could make out the features under the paint a little clearer they seemed thoughtful and why are you here anyway corso said moving his repulsive red and glinting body in the chair to ask questions helen said she was pale and alan could understand whythe skinless man took a lot of getting used to questions the clowns body moved in a great shrug he turned his back on them and paced towards his seated friends questions by the solar firmament what questions can i answer they are simpleand demand only simple replies if you are truthful with us the fireclown whirled round and laughed richly i never lie didnt you know that i never lie but perhaps you mislead alan said quietly may i sit down of course they both sat down we want to know if you planned to blow up the world helen said with a trace of nervousness in her voice why should i i wanted to save it not hurt it you did a good job with the fire which swept switzerland alan retorted am i to blame for that i warned them not to tamper are you trying to tell us you werent responsible for that fire alan said grimly ive been watching the lasercasts im aware of whats being said of me now they are fickle those people if they had really listened to me this would not have happened but nobody listened properly i agree with that alan nodded i saw themthey were using you as a means of rousing their own latent emotions but you should have known what you were doing and stopped p i never know what i am doing i am the fireclown paused and glared at him i was not responsible for the fire not directly at any rate some of those policemen must have tampered with my fire machines they are very delicate i have been experimenting with means of controlling chemical and atomic fire i produced that little artificial sun and could have produced more if i had not been interrupted by those meddlers why are you experimenting with fire whats your purpose helen leaned forward in her chair why i have no reasons i am the fireclown i have no purpose save to exist as the fireclown you do me too much honor miss curtis to expect action and plans from me for a time i spoke to the people in switzerland now thats over i shall do something else he roared with laughter again his grotesque body shaking if you have no plans no thought for the future then why did you buy pbombs from the arms dealers i know nothing of bombs or dealers i had no inkling that those bombs were in my cavern either he was blinded by the fireclowns overpowering presence or the man was telling the truth alan felt he seemed to have a lusty disregard for all the things that concerned helen and himself he did not seem to exist in the time and space that alan shared with the rest of the human race seemed to tower over it observing it with complete and amused detachment but how far could he trust this impression alan wondered perhaps the fireclown was the best actor in the world you must know something of whats happening helen exclaimed your appearance at a time of acute crisis in societys development could not be mere coincidence society has had crises before young lady again he shrugged it will have others crises are good for it i thought you ingenuous then i changed my mind i cant make you out at all she sank back into the chair why should you make me out why should you waste time trying to analyze others when you have never bothered to look within yourself my own argument against machines and machineliving is that it hampers man from really looking into his own being you have to take him away from it put him in the wilderness for a short time before you can see that i speak truth in my way i worship the sun as you know because the sun is the most tangible of natures workings i thought you represented a new breakthrough in thought helen said quietly i thought you knew where you were going that is why i supported you identified myself and my party with you there is no need to seek salvation in others young lady again he became disconcertingly convulsed with that weird and enigmatic laughter she got up bridling very well ive learned my lesson i believe you when you say you werent planning destruction im going back to earth to tell them that im afraid mr corso here who advises me on such matters has suggested that you stay for a while until i am ready to leave alan saw his logic when are you leaving he said a few days i expect perhaps less you wont of course tell us where alan smiled at the fireclown for the first time and when the man returned his smile grotesquely exaggerated by the paint around his lips he felt dazzled almost petrified with warmth and happiness it was the fireclowns only answer why did the fireclown have this ability to attract and hold people just as if they were moths drawn to a flame auditor kurt had left the room while they were conversing now he returned with another man behind him a visitor for you fireclown both alan and helen turned their heads to look at the newcomer he was a small dark man with a moody face a marijuana was between his lips i commend you on your choice of rendezvous he said somewhat mockingly his hooded eyes glanced at the others in the room stopped for a moment on alan and helen he looked questioningly at the fireclown i hope you havent been indiscreet my friend no said the fireclown shortly he chuckled well mr bias have you brought what i wanted certainly it is outside in the ship i came with we must talk where is this not private enough for you the fireclown asked petulantly no it is not i have to be overcautious you understand the fireclown lumbered towards the door ducking beneath it as he made his way out corso he shouted from the corridor youd better come too the skinless man got up and followed bias from the room the door closed bias helen said forlornly so the fireclown has been lying to us who is he suspected head of the arms syndicate she sighed damn oh damn the fireclown p the woman a fullbodied brunette with a sensuously generous mouth got up from her seat she stared down at alan regarding him closely helen glared at her and what part do you play in this she asked a very ordinary one she said the fireclowns my lover then your lovers a cunning liar helen snorted i shouldnt condemn him until you know what hes doing the woman said sharply the three of them were alone together now that kurt had left too youre disappointed arent you the woman said looking candidly at helen you wanted the fireclown to be some sort of savior pointing the direction for the world to go well youre wrong and those who think hes a destroyer are wrong also he is simply what he isthe fireclown he acts according to some inner drive which i have never been able to fathom and which i dont think he understands or bothers about himself how long have you known him helen asked some years we met on mars my names cornelia fisher ive heard of you helen stared at the woman in curiosity you were a famous beauty when i was quite young you disappeared suddenly so you went to mars hardly the place for a woman like you was it you must be over forty but you dont look thirty cornelia fisher smiled thanks to the fireclown i suppose yes i went to mars the life of a wellknown beauty as you call me is rather boring i wasnt satisfied with it i wasnt satisfied with anything i decided that i was leading a shallow existence and thought id find a deeper one on mars of course i was wrong it was merely less comfortableshe paused seeming to think back though the peace and quiet helped and the scenery i dont know if youve seen it since the revitalization plan was completed but it is very beautiful now but i never really lost my ennui until i met the fireclown he was a martian then alan knew there were a few families of second and third generation colonists responsible for working on the revitalization project no he came to mars after a spaceship accident hes from earth originally but i dont know much more about him than you do once youve been with the fireclown for a short time you learn that it doesnt matter who he is or what he doeshes just the fireclown and thats enough its enough for him i think too though there are strange currents running beneath that greasepaint whether hes in control of them or not i couldnt say his connection with bias seems to disprove part of what youve said alan spoke levelly unable to decide what to think now i honestly dont know what he and bias are doing cornelia fisher folded her arms and walked towards her handbag which lay on the chair shed vacated she opened it and took out a packet of cigarettes alan tried to look unconcerned but he had never seen a nicotine addict before she offered them defiantly they both refused with rapid shakes of their heads she lit one and inhaled the smoke greedily id swear hes not buying arms why should he he has no plans of the kind earth condemns him for having maybe he doesnt tell you everything helen suggested maybe he doesnt tell me anything because he hasnt got anything to tell me i dont know alan went to the door and tested it it was shut firmly judging by the evidence he said i can only suppose that the accusations made by my grandfather against the fireclown are basically correct those pbombs were part of the arms syndicates stockand we have seen that the fireclown already knows bias who you say helen is the head of the syndicate its never been proved of course she said but im pretty sure im right then the world is in danger i wonder if the fireclown would listen to reason his kind of reason is different from ours said cornelia fisher if i see him again ill try hes too good to get mixed up in this sordid business he has a tremendous personalityhe could use his talents to alans voice trailed off what could the fireclown use his talents for cornelia fisher raised her eyebrows his talents to do what what does safe little terra want with men of talent and vision society doesnt need them any more thats a foolish thing to say helen was angry a complex society like ours needs expert government and leaders more than ever before we emerged from muddle and disorder over a hundred years ago were progressing in a definite direction now we know what we want to do and if bias and his friends dont spoil it with their plots and schemings well do it eventually the only argument today is how planned progress it was a dream for ages and now its a reality until this arms trouble blew up there were no random factors we had turned politics into an exact science at long last random factors have a habit of emerging sooner or later alan pointed out if it wasnt the nuclear stockpiles it would have been something else and those random factors if they dont throw us too far out of gear are what we need to stop us from getting complacent and sterile id rather not be blown to smithereens helen said the fireclown isnt a danger to you i know cornelia fisher sounded as if she was less convinced than earlier well soon know if the arp fails to get hold of those stockpiles helens voice sounded a bit shaky alan went over to her and put his arm round her comfortingly a short time later the fireclown returned seemingly excited bias was not with him alan couldnt guess at corsos expression he could only see the red flesh of his face looking like so much animated butchers meat did you get some more pbombs helen asked mockingly the fireclown ignored her corso said what are you hinting at miss curtis i know bias is head of the arms syndicate well thats more than we do bias is supplying us with materials for our ship the pimeson which we badly need there has been no talk of armaments not a very convincing lie helen sneered now corso also ignored helen he watched the fireclown in a way that a mother cat might watch her youngwarily yet tenderly corso seemed to play nursemaid to the clown in some ways it will take time to fit said the fireclown suddenly but thank god we could get them we couldnt possibly have made them ourselves his gaudy red and yellow costume swirled around him as he turned to grin at alan i wonder if youd want to he mused mysteriously want to what alan asked come for a trip in the pimeson i think it would do you good why me and what kind of good you could only judge that for yourself then you could dispose of us in deep space is that it helen said weve seen too much eh the fireclown heaved a gusty sigh do as you like young woman ive no axe to grind whatever takes place on earth has no importance for me now i tried to tell the people something but its obvious i didnt get through to them let the darkness sweep down and engulf your hollow kind i care not its no good helen shook her head i cant believe anything you say not now if you had it wouldnt have made any difference corsos ghastly face grinned the rest of the world lost faith in their idol and the world hates nothing so much as an idol who turns out to have feet of clay not of course that the clown wished to be one in the first place then why did you start that setup on the first level why did he make speeches to thousands why did he let them adore him at his audiences helens voice was high nearhysterical as alan watched and listened a mood of absolute detachment filled him he didnt really care about the pros and cons any more he only wondered what the fireclowns reasons were for suggesting the trip the fireclown was originally living down there in secret we were working on our machines we needed help scientists and techniciansso we asked for it got it but the scientists told their friends about the fireclown they began to ask him about things he told them all he did in the final analysis was supply an outlet for their emotional demands helen fell silent alan came to a decision id like to take that trip he said if helen can come too good the fireclowns resonant voice seemed suddenly gay i should like to take you im glad yes glad both alan and helen waited for the fireclown to add to this statement but they were disappointed he went and leaned against a bulkhead his great face bent towards his chest his whole manner abstracted was he thinking of the trip alan wondered or had he simply forgotten about them now that they had agreed to go somehow he felt the latter was the more likely answer the fireclown seemed a peculiar mixture of idiot and intellectual alan decided that he was probably insane but what this insanity might lead tothe destruction of earthcould not easily be assessed he must wait and perhaps he would learn from the trip wherever it took them mars possibly or ganymede chapter ten helen was getting understandably restless five hours had passed and the fireclown still stood in the position he had taken up against the bulkhead corso and cornelia fisher had talked sporadically with alan but helen had refused to join in alan felt for her she had placed all her hopes on gaining information from the fireclown and he guessed she had desperately wanted him to disprove the allegations now being made against him on earth but frustratingly they were no nearer to getting an explanation were worse confused if anything if he had been studying any other individual alan would have suspected the fireclown of sleeping with his eyes open but there was no suggestion of slumber about the clowns attitude he was it seemed meditating on some problem that concerned him possibly the nature of the problem was such that an ordinary man would see no logic or point in solving it the fireclown seemed to exist in his own timesphere and his mind was unfathomable at last the grotesque giant moved now he rumbled the pimeson will be ready we have been lucky to find shelter with the monks for they are probably the only men who can come close to understanding the nature of the ship and doubtless they will have done their work by now come he moved towards the door alan glanced at helen and then at the other two corso and cornelia fisher remained where they were helen got up slowly the fireclown was already thumping up the corridor before they reached the door i hope you know what youre doing she whispered im afraid alan what if his plan is to kill us maybe it is he tried to sound selfpossessed but he could do that just as easily here as in deep space couldnt he there are several ways of dying she held his hand and he noticed she was shivering he had never realized before that anyone could be so afraid of death momentarily he felt a sympathy with her fears they followed the gaudy figure of the fireclown until they reached the bay section auditor kurt was there they have just finished he told the fireclown spinning the wheel of the manually operated airlock your equations were perfectly correctit was we who were at fault the field is functioning with one hundred per cent accuracy five of us were completely exhausted feeding it bias being able to supply those parts was a great stroke of luck the fireclown nodded his thanks and all three stepped through the short tunnel of the airlocks and entered a surprisingly large landing deck alan who had seen the pimeson from space wondered how it could be so big for a considerable portion of spaceships was taken up with engines and fuel touching a stud the fireclown closed the ships lock a section of the interior wall slid upwards revealing a short flight of steps they climbed the steps and were on a big control deck the covered ports were extremely large comprising more than half the area of the walls controls variedsome familiar some not and there were many scarcely functional featuresrich red plush couches and chairs fittings of gold or brass heavy velvet curtains of yellow and dark blue hung against the ports it all looked bizarre and faintly archaic reminding alan in a way of his grandfathers study i shall darken the room the fireclown announced i can operate the ship better that way sit where you will the fireclown did not sit down as alan and helen sat together on one of the comfortable couches he stood at the controls his huge bulk blotting out half the instruments from alans sight he stretched a hand towards a switch and flicked it up the lights dimmed slowly and then they were in cold blackness helen gripped alans arm and he patted her knee his mind on other things as a low whining arose from the floor alan sensed tension in the fireclowns movements heard from the darkness he tried to analyze them but failed he saw a screen suddenly light with bright whiteness color flashed and swirled and they saw a vision of space but against the darkness of the cosmos the spheres which rolled on the screen flashing by like shoals of multicolored billiard balls were unrecognizable as any heavenly bodies alan had ever seen not asteroids by any means not planetsthey were too solid in color and general appearance they shone but not with the glitter of reflected sunlight and they passed swiftly by in hordes moved by the beauty astonished by the unexpected sight alan couldnt voice the questions which flooded into his mind in the faint light from the screen the fireclowns silhouette could be seen in constant motion the whining had ceased the spheres on the screen began to jump and progress more slowly the picture jerked and one sphere smoky blue in colour began to grow until the whole screen itself glowed blue then it seemed to burst and they flashed towards the fragments then through them and sawa star sol commented the fireclown they were getting closer and closer to the sun well burn up alan cried fearfully nothe pimeson is a special ship ive avoided any chance of us burning seethe flames the flames alan thought that the word scarcely described the curling writhing wonder of those shooting sheets of fire the control deck was not noticeably warmer yet alan felt hot just looking the fireclown was roaring his enigmatic laughter his arm pointing at the screen there he shouted his voice too loud in the confines of the cabin there get used to that for a moment look they could not help but look both were fascinated held by the sight and yet alan felt his eyes ache and was certain he would be blinded by the brightness the fireclown strode to another panel and turned a knob the port coverings began to rise slowly and light flowed in a searing stream into the cabin brightening everything to an extraordinary degree when the ports were fully open alan shouted his wonder it seemed they were in the very heart of the sun why werent they made sightless by the glare why didnt they burn this is impossible alan whispered we should have been destroyed in a second what is thisan illusion of some sort have you hypno be quiet said the fireclown his shape a blob of blackness in the incredible light ill explain laterif it is possible to make you understand hushed they let themselves be drawn out into the dancing glare alans soul seemed full for the first time it even seemed natural that he should be here he felt affinity with the flames he began to identify with them until he was them time stopped thought stopped life alone remained then blackness swam back from far away he observed that his rigid body was being shaken that a voice was bellowing in his ear you have seen you have seen now you know now you know come backthere is more to see shocked it seemed back into his body he opened his eyes he could see nothing still but felt the grip on his shoulders and knew that the fireclown his voice excited perhaps insanewas shouting from in front of his face that is why i call myself the fireclown i am full of the joy of the flames of life how the word stumbled hoarsely from his lips but the fireclowns hands left his shoulders and he heard the man screaming at helen shaking her also there could be no fear now alan decided though earlier he might have been perturbed by the fireclowns ravings he now half ignored them aware that there was no need to listen what he demanded now was an explanation how could we have seen that and lived he shouted roughly groping out to seize the fireclowns tattered clothing and tug at it how he heard helen mumble satisfied the fireclown moved away from her jerking himself free from alans grip he got up and followed the fireclown through the blackness touched his body again sensing the tremendous strength in the man the fireclown shook with humor again give me a moment he laughed i have to feed the ship further directions alan heard him reach the control panel heard him make adjustments to studs and levers heard the now familiar whine he groped his way back to helen she put her arms round him she was crying whats the matter nothing reallynothing its just thethe emotion i suppose the lights came on arms akimbo the fireclown stood grinning down at them i see you are somewhat stunned i had hoped to turn you madbut you are obviously too entrenched in your own narrow sanity to be helped that grieves me you promised me you would explain alan reminded him shakily if you could understand i said if you remember ill explain a little i am not yet ready to tell you my full reason for bringing you with me now see he turned and depressed a stud and a section of one port slid up to reveal normal space with the sun flaringstill near but not so near as to be dangerous we have returned to our ordinary state for a while now you see the sun as any traveler would see it from this region of space what do you think of it think of it i dont understand you good what are you getting at how important do the conflicts now taking place on earth seem to you now i havent he couldnt find the words they were important still did the fireclown think that this experience transcendental as it might have been could alter his view of earths peril impatiently the fireclown turned to helen is your ambition to become president of earth still as strong as it was miss curtis she nodded thisvision or whatever it washas no bearing on what are as far as youre concerned mundane problems relating to our society i still want to do my best in politics it has changed nothing i have probably benefited from the experience if that s the case i shall be better equipped to deal with earth affairs the fireclown snorted but alan felt helen had never sounded so selfconfident as she did now i still want to know how you achieved the effect alan insisted very well put simply we shunted part of ourselves and part of the ship out of normal time and hovered as it were on its edges unaffected by many of its rules but thats impossible scientists have never if it was impossible alan powys it couldnt have happened and you couldnt have experienced it as for your scientists they have never bothered to enquire i discovered the means of doing this after an experience which almost killed me and certainly affected my thoughtprocess the sun almost killed me realize that but i bear it no malice you and i and the ship existed in a kind of time freeze the ships computer has a mind constructed according to my own definitionsthey are meaningless to the rigidly thinking scientists of earth but they work for me because i am the fireclown i am unique for i survived death by fire and fire gave my brain lifebrought alive inspiration knowledge he pointed back at the sun now dwindling behind them there is the fire that gave birth to earth and fed its denizens with vitality worship itworship it in gratitude for without it you would not and could not exist there is truthperhaps the sum of truth it flames living and is selfsufficient careless of why for why is a question that need notcannotbe answered we are fools to ask it would you then deny man his intellect alan asked firmly for that is what your logic suggests should we have stayed in the caves not using the brains whichhe shruggedthe sun if you like gave us not using an entire part of ourselvesthe part which set us over the animals which enabled us to live as weaklings in a world of the strong and the savage to speculate to build and to plan you say we should be content merely to existi say we should think and if our existence is meaningless then our thoughts might in time give it meaning the fireclown shook his painted head i knew you would not understand he said sadly there is no communication between us alan said i am sane you are mad the fireclown for the first time seemed hurt by alans pronouncement quietly without his usual zest he said i know the truth i know it men down the ages have known a truth such as the one you know you are not unique fireclown not in history i am unique alan powys for one reason if none other i have seen the truth for myself and you shall see it perhaps did you not become absorbed into the fire of the sun did you not lose all niggling need for meaning therein yes the forces are overwhelming i admit but they are not everything the fireclown opened his mouth and once more bellowed with laughter then you shall see more he closed the port and the room darkened where are we going helen demanded grimly antagonistically but the fireclown only laughed and laughed and laughed until the strange spheres began to roll across the screen again then he was silent chapter eleven hours seemed to pass and helen dozed in alans arms alan too was half asleep mesmerized by the colored spheres on the screen he came fully awake as the spheres began to jerk and slow a bright red filled the screen divided itself into fragments more spheres appeared but these were suns suns a profusion of suns as closely packed as the planets to sol huge blue suns green yellow and silver suns a thousand suns moving in stately procession around the ship the screens slid up from the ports and light ever changing flickered through the cabin where are we helen gasped the center of the galaxy the fireclown announced grandly all around them the huge discs of flame of all colors and all possible blends of color spun at extraordinary speeds passing by in an orbit about an invisible point alan once again could not retain his selfpossession something within him forced him to look and wonder at the incredible beauty these were the oldest suns in the galaxy they had lived and died and lived again for billions of years here was the source of life the beginning of everything though the fireclown would probably have denied it the vision wasprofound it had significance of such magnitude that alan was unable to grasp it philosophically he resigned himself to never knowing what the experience implied he felt that the fireclowns belief of existence without significance beyond itself was preposterous yet he could see how one could arrive at such a conclusion he himself was forced to cling to his shredding personality the whirling stars dwarfed him dwarfed his ideas dwarfed the aspirations of humanity now chuckled the fireclown in his joyous insanity what is earth and all its works compared with the blazing simplicity ofthis helen spoke with difficulty they aredifferent she said they are linked because they all exist together but they are different this is the order of created matter we seek an order of cognizant matter and the stars however mighty however beautiful have no cognizance they might perish at some stage man because he thinks may one day make himself immortalnot personally perhaps but through the continuance of his race i think that is the difference the fireclown shrugged you have wondered what is real have you not you have wondered that we have lost touch with the realities we human beings that our language is decadent and that it has produced a doublethinking mentality which no longer allows us contact with the natural facts he waved his hands to take in the circling suns intelligence it is nothing it is unimportant a freak thrown up by a chance combination of components why is intelligence so esteemed there is no need for it it cannot change the structure of the universeit can only meddle and spoil it awarenessnow thats different nature is aware of itself but that is allit is content are we content no when i go to earth and try to convey what i know to the people i am conscious of entering a dream world they cannot understand me because they are unaware all i do sadly is awaken archetypal responses in them which throws them further out so they run around like randy pigs destroying destroying building both acts are equally unimportant we are at the center of the galaxy here things exist they are beautiful but their beauty has no purpose it is beautyit is enough they are full of natural force but the force has no expression it is force alone and that is all it needs to be why ascribe meaning to all this the further away from the fundamentals of life we go the more we quest for their meaning there is no meaning it is here it has always been here in some state it will always be here that is all we can ever truly know it is all we should want to know alan shook his head speaking vaguely at first a short time ago he said i was struck by the pettiness of political disputes horrified by the ends to which people would go to get poweror responsibility as they call itfeeling that the politicians in the solar house were expending breath on meaningless words so they were the fireclown bellowed back at him approvingly no alan plugged on certain he was near the truth if you wished to convince me of this when you took us on this voyage you have achieved the opposite admittedly as one observes them at the time the politicians seem to be getting nowhere society detaches itself further and further from the kind of life its ancestors lived yet seeing these suns entering the heart of our own sun has shown me that this stumbling progressunaware gropings in the dark immensity of the universe if you likeis as much a natural function as any other gustily the fireclown sighed i felt i could help you alan powys i see you have fled further back into your fortress of prejudice he closed the port covers sit downsleep if you wish i am returning to the monastery they berthed and entered the monastery in silence the fireclown seemed depressed even worried had he seen that for all his discoveries for all his vision and vitality he was not necessarily right alan wondered there was no knowing the fireclown remained still the enigmatic intellectual madmanthe naive ingenuous endearing figure he had been when alan first saw him auditor kurt greeted them we are looking at our weekly lasercast would you like to come and watch it might interest you he took them to a small room where several monks were already seated corso was there too and cornelia fisher at the door the fireclown seemed to rouse himself from his mood i have things to consider he told them walking away down the corridor they went in and sat down the laserscreen was blank evidently the amount of laserviewing allowed the monks was limited corso came and sat next to them alan was getting used to his apparently skinless face well he said goodnaturedly did your voyage enlighten you in a way alan admitted but not in the way intended i think helen smiled a trifle wistfully as if she wished the fireclown had convinced them how did he hit on the discovery that enables him to travel so easily and to such dangerous parts alan said call it inspiration corso answered im not up to understanding him either you know we were copilots on an experimental ship years ago something went wrong with the shipthe steering devices locked and pushed us towards the sun we managed narrowly to avoid plunging into the suns heart and went into orbit but we were fried refrigeration collapsed slowly i suffered worse in some ways it took my skin off as you can see my fellow pilotthe fireclown to you these daysdidnt suffer so badly physically but something happened to his mind youd say he was mad id say he was sane in a different way from you and me whatever happened he worked out the principle for the pimeson in the martian hospitalwe were rescued quite by chance by a very brave crew of a freighter which had gone slightly off course itself if that hadnt happened wed both be dead now we were in hospital for years the clown pretended amnesia and i did the same for some reason we were never contacted by spaceflight research how did you get the money to build the pimeson we got it from bias the man you accused of being an arms dealer he thinks the ship is a superfast vessel but otherwise ordinary enough he supplied us with computer parts this time where is bias now the last i heard he had a suite at the london dorchester the dorchester thats reasonablea man could hide in the mayfair slums and nobody would know i think you dont do bias justice hes an idealist he wants progress more than anyone he wouldnt have any part in blowing the world up at least corso paused hes a funny character but i dont think so alan was quiet for a while then he said after that trip i think i do believe you when you say youre not implicated in the arms dealers plansnot knowingly anyway at least the fireclown has satisfied me on that score even if he didnt achieve his main object he turned to helen what about you i agree she nodded but id give a lot to know biass motives in helping you she looked at corso are you telling us everything everything i can he said ambiguously the laserscreen came to life a news broadcast the newscaster bent eagerly towards the camera its fairly sure who the next president will be folks simon powys the one man to recognize the peril that the world is in from the infamous fireclowns insane plot to destroy the world is top of this stations public opinion poll his niece the only strong opponent in the elections which begin next week has dropped right down her violent support of the fireclown hasnt helped a bit rumor circulates that miss curtis and minister powys grandson alan powys have disappeared together strange that two people who were seen publicly fighting in the recent riots should have teamed up shot of simon powys in his home a smug expression on his powerful old face reporter minister powys you were the first to discover the bomb plot how did it happen powys i suspected the fireclown from the start i dont blame people for being duped by his talkwere all human after allbut a responsible politician has to look below the surface reporter and were all very grateful i made sure that a constant check was kept on his activities simon powys continued and thus was able to avert what might have been a terrible crimethe ultimate crime one might say even now the threat of this man still trying to bombard the earth from some secret hiding place is enormous we must be wary we must take steps to ensure his capture or failing that ensure our own defense quite so thank you minister powys everythings calm again in swiss city announced the newscaster as he faded in and were back to normal after the riots and subsequent fire which swept sixteen levels yesterday the fireclowns victims number over three hundred men womenand little children we were all duped folks as minister powys has pointed out but well know better next time wont we the freak hysteria has died as swiftly as it blew up but now were watching the skiesfor the search for the fireclown seems to prove that he has left earth and may now be hiding out on mars or ganymede if hes got bombs up there toowe must be ready for him although angered alan was also amused by the lasercasters doublethinking ability he like the rest had done a quick aboutface and now simon powys exvillain and victimizer was the hero of the hour but the hysteria he realized had not in fact died down it had taken a different turn now there was a bomb scare though he hadnt planned it that way alan thought simon powys could easily be falling into the arms syndicates plot for this scare was just what they needed to start trouble as soon as he got the chance he was going to tell the police about bias and the dorchesteror else go there himself and confront the arms dealer he didnt bother to watch the lasercast but turned to helen wed better try to get the fireclown to let us go as soon as possible he said worriedly therere things to be done on earth apart from anything else she pointed out ive got an election to fight a chuckle behind her fullthroated and full of humor made her turn and look up at the fireclowns gaudy bulk filling the doorway you are persistent miss curtis even a journey into the heart of the sun does nothing to change your mind youll be pleased to hear that we are leaving very soon and youll be able to return to earth but first he looked directly at alan stared into his eyes so that alan felt a strange thrill run through him partly fear partly joy there was no doubt that the fireclowns magnetism was something apart from his strange ideas i must talk with you alan powys alone will you follow me alan followed they entered a room decorated with marvelous oil paintings all of them depicting the sun seen in different ways did you do these alan was impressed as the fireclown nodded you could have put more across to the public by displaying them than with all that talking you did he said i didnt think of it these are private the fireclown indicated a metal bench for alan to sit on no one comes here but me you are the first i feel honored alan said ironically but why me the fireclowns huge chest heaved as he took an enormous breath because you and i have something in common he said alan smiled but kindly i should say that extremely unlikely judging by our earlier conversations i dont mean ideas the fireclown moved aboutlike a caged lion there was no other analogy to describe his restless pacing alan thought i regret that ive been unable to convince you i regret it deeply for i am not normally given to regretting anything you know what happens happensthat is all i should have said we have someone in common who alan was half dazed already for he thought he knew what the fireclown was going to say your mother grunted the fireclown the words took time coming out of this man normally so verbose you are my son alan chapter twelve my father alan groped for words failed became silent the fireclown spread his large hands his painted fools face incongruous now i was in spite of anything you may have heard much in love with your mother we planned to marry though simon powys wouldnt hear of it i was a common spacepilot and she was miriam powys that was before we could find the courage to tell him you were going to be born we never did tell himnot together anyway what happened alan spoke harshly his heart thumping with almost overwhelming emotion i got sent on a secret project i couldnt avoid it i thought it would only last a couple of months but it kept me away for nearly two years when i got back simon powys wouldnt let me near youand your mother was dead powys said shed died of shame i sometimes think he shamed her into dying the fireclown broke into a laugh but unlike his earlier laughter this was bitter and full of melancholy alan stood up his body taut whats your real name what did you do what did my grandfather say the fireclown ceased his laughter and shrugged his great shoulders my real nameemmanuel blumenthalmanny bloom to my friends and fans alan said softly remembering a book hed had confiscated as a child his grandfather had meaninglessly hed thought taken it from him with no explanation the book had been called heroes of space manny bloom test pilot of the tearaway captain of the saturn expedition that was the secret project wasnt it savior of venus satellite seven copilot of the solstar the fireclown added thats rightthe solstar an experimental ship it was supposed to have gone off course and crashed into the sun you were reported dead but a martian freighter carrying contraband so that it dare not notify the authorities or land in an official port rescued us corso told me that was ten years ago as i remember why have you never contacted me why didnt you get custody of me when you came back from saturn and found my mother was dead simon powys threatened to ruin me if i went near you i washeartbroken heartbrokenyesbut i reckoned youd have a better chance than any i could give you i wonder alan said gloomily a kid would have been happy just knowing his father was manny bloomcommander manny bloom frontiersman of space the last phrase held a hint of irony i wasnt like the stories though i thought i was when younger i loved my own legend then had it in mind nearly all the time i wasnt naturally brave but people behave as other people expect them toi acted brave and now youre the fireclown shouting and raving against intelligencechampioning mindless consciousnesswith your fingerprints burned off i suppose and no records of who you really are thats part of the general mystery solved anyway and part of my ownthe main part and now you know im your father what will you do what can the knowledge possibly affect alan said sadly your subconscious the fireclown grinned half enjoying a private joke against his son yes that i suppose he sighed what are you going to do i have work that holds me soon corso cornelia and i will journey out beyond the solar system in the pimeson there i shall conduct certain experiments on my own mind and on theirs we shall see what good intelligence serves and what great good i suspect pure consciousness achieves do you want to come alan alan deliberated he had no place with the fireclown there were things to sort out on earth he shook his head it grieves me to see you reject a giftmaybe the greatest gift in the universe f it is not a gift that suits my tastefather so be it the fireclown sighed the solar bird soared down into earths atmosphere and streaked across oceans and continents before helen switched on its braking jets and plunged into hamburg spaceport the berth was ready for her and she steered into it the water drained from the interior chamber alan preceded her out of the airlock as he stepped into the chamber a man entered through the other door my god powys whereve you been it was denholm curtis a mixture of worry and anger on his face alan didnt answer immediately but turned to help helen out of the ship he didnt need the pause since he had already worked out his answer weve been to see my father your father i didnt know you i only found out who he was recently i see well curtis was nonplussed i wish you and helen had told me sorry we had to leave in a hurry your ships perfectly all right the ships not importantit was you and helen curtis pursed his lips anyway im glad thats all it was what with the threat of the fireclown making an attack and everything i thought you might have been kidnapped or killed he smiled at his sister who didnt respond helen had been silent for most of the trip but rumors about the pair of you are rife scandal wont do either of you any goodleast of all helen uncle simons popularity is rising incredibly overnight hes become the dominant man in solar politics youve got a tough fight onif you still intend to fight more than ever helen said quietly ive got a car upstairs want to come back with me thanks they said as her brother lifted his car into the pale hamburg sky helen said to him what do you think of this fireclown scare denholm its more than a scare he said its a reality how can we be sure he hasnt planted bombs all over the world bombs he can detonate from space alan felt depressed if denholm curtis who rebelled habitually against any accepted theory or dogma was convinced of the fireclowns guilt then there was little chance of convincing anyone else to the contrary but do you realize denholm he said that we have only the word of one mansimon powysand circumstantial evidence to go on what if the fireclown isnt guilty the concepts too remote for me im afraid denholm said with a curious glance at alan i didnt think anyone doubted the fireclown had planned to detonate his cache there were enough bombs there to blow the world apart i doubt if he planned anything helen said so do i alan nodded denholm looked surprised i can understand you being uncertain helen after your support of the fireclown it must be hard to find out youve been wrong all the way down the line but you alanwhat makes you think there could be a mistake theres the one big reasonthat all the evidence against the fireclown is circumstantial he might not have known about the bombs he might not have been responsible for the holocaust that swept the levels he might not in fact have had any plan to destroy anything at all we havent captured him yet we havent brought him to trialbut weve all automatically judged him guilty i want to see my grandfatherhes the man who has convinced the world that the fireclown is a criminal curtis was thoughtful i never thought id get caught up in hysteria he said but although im fairly sure the fireclown is guilty i admit theres a possibility of his being innocent if we could prove him innocent alan the war scare would be over im already perturbed about that you know the government has been approached by the arms syndicate this last remark to helen its logical helen nodded and weve also considered the chance that this whole thing has been engineered by the dealersnot the clown that crossed my mind too at first denholm agreed but it seems too fantastic lets go and have this out with the man of the moment alan suggested can you take us to grandfathers apartment denholm take you ill come with you as the trio entered simon powys apartment they were greeted by junnar glad to see youre both all right he said to alan and helen minister powys is in conference with the president chief sandai minister petrovich and others whats it about asked alan unwilling to be put off the fireclown situation so thats what theyre calling it now alan said with a faint smile youd better disturb them junnar tell them weve got some fresh information for them is it important sir yes helen and alan said in unison junnar took them into the sitting room where they waited impatiently for a few moments before he came back nodding affirmatively they entered simon powys study the most powerful politicians in the solar system sat therepowys benjosef gloomyfaced petrovich minister in the event of defense hardfeatured gregorius minister of justice smoothskinned redcheeked falkoner minister of martian affairs and tiny delicate madame chu minister of ganymedian affairs beside the mantelpiece standing relaxed and looking bored was a man alan didnt recognize his eyes were at once amiable and deadly simon powys said harshly well alan i hope youve got an explanation for your disappearance where have you been to see the fireclown alans voice was calm but you said denholm curtis broke in i had to tell you something denholm that was before i decided to come here the fireclown you know his whereabouts powys glanced at the tall man by the mantelpiece why didnt you tell us as soon as you knew i didnt know for certain until i found him where is he powys turned to address the tall man iopedes be ready to get after him i met him in space alan said carefully we went aboard his spaceship he wont be in the region of space now he wouldnt let us go until hed moved on damn simon powys got up weve got every ship of the three planets combing space for him and you discovered him by chance did you learn anything yes somewhere in the last few actionfilled days alan had found strength he was in perfect control of himself he addressed the entire group ignoring his fuming grandfather i believe the fireclown to be innocent of any deliberate act of violence he announced calmly youll have to substantiate that mr powys purred madame chu looking at him quizzically how do you know simon powys strode over to his grandson and gripped his arm painfully i know because i spent some hours in the fireclowns company and he told me he had nothing to do with the bomb plot or the burning of the levels thats all powyss fingers tightened on alans arm thats all i needed alan said and then in a voice which only his grandfather could hear let go of my arm grandfather it hurts simon powys glared at him and released his grip dont tell me youre still being gulled by this monster helen you saw him toowhat did you think i agree with alan he says the policemen tampered with his delicate flamemachines and thats what caused the holocaust he says he knew nothing of the bombs i suspect they were planted on him by the arms syndicatein order to start the scare which youre now helping to foster in short alan said i think this whole business has been engineered by the syndicate the room was silent alan pressed his point i think youve all been blinded by the apparent discovery that the fireclown wasnt what he at first seemed now youve turned completely against himyou believe him capable of any crime mr powyspetrovich spoke with an air of assumed patiencewe are the government of the solar system we are not in the habit of jumping to illconsidered and emotional conclusions then youre not humans alan said sharply everyone can make mistakes minister petrovichespecially in a heated atmosphere like this petrovich smiled patronizingly we have considered the place of the arms syndicate in this business we are sure they are taking advantage of the situationbut we are convinced that they did not engineer it as you say simon powys roared my grandsons an immature fool he has no understanding of politics or anything else when the fireclown lisps his innocence he believes him without question helen curtis is just as bad both of them to my own knowledge were on the fireclowns side from the start now they refuse to see the facts the tall man iopedes began to walk towards the door simon powys called after him iopedeswhere are you going the young people said the fireclown had left the area of space he was originally occupying that could indicate hes gone to mars or ganymede its a better lead than we held at any rate iopedes left whos he alan said nick iopedes the arps top agent hes been commissioned to bring the fireclown to justiceby any means he has to employ youre turning the system into a police state helen said angrily theres a state ofemergency existing simon powys said coldly the worldperhaps the solar systemis threatened with destruction in your mind and in the minds of those youve managed to convince alan retaliated have any bombs exploded has any threat been made no this was benjosef who had hitherto seemed detached from the argument taking place around him and the arms syndicate has approached you with a bargain i hear alan laughed sharply that is true benjosef agreed quite obviously hewas no longer in control of his cabinet simon powys dominated it now as if he had already superseded benjosef the old man seemed to accept the situation fatalistically so theres your answerthe syndicate plants the bombs and starts the scare then they sell you more bombs to defend yourselves against a nonexistent menace then what another scareanother move by the syndicateuntil the seeds of war have been thoroughly planted everybodys armed to the teeth and the possibility of conflict between the planets is increased oh thats very pat simon powys sneered but it doesnt fit the evidence you know what youve done youve been to see the fireclown and instead of gaining information which could help us capture him youve listened to his sweet protestations of innocence and thrown away a chance to help save the world really alan said in mock surprise well i disagree it seems to me that you are taking the world to the brink of destruction grandfather by your blind hatred of the fireclown leave alan simonpowys voice shook with anger the assembled ministers looked disturbed and embarrassed by what was in the main a family row alan turned and walked out of the door helen following him denholm curtis remained in the room a frown on his face outside helen smiled faintly well we seem to have antagonized everyone dont we im sure were right alan said im certain of it helen that trip the fireclown took us on convinced me hes too interested in his weird philosophizing to be capable of any plots against the system helen took his arm its our opinion against theirs im afraid weve got to do something about convincing the ordinary people alan said as they descended the steps to the ground floor this is still a democracy and if enough people protest they can be ousted from power and a more sane and rational party can solve the situation better theyre sane and reasonable enough she pointed out they just dont happen to believe in the fireclowns innocence then what are we going to do about it she looked up at him what do you expect im still in the running for president alan im still leader of my party were going to try and win the election chapter thirteen director carson head of city administration looked hard at alan and nodded understandingly it would be best if you resigned he agreed though as far as it goes youre the ablest assistant ive ever had alan but with things as they are and with you outspoken against simon powys and for the fireclown i doubt if city council would want you to stay on anyway then were both in agreement alan said ill leave right away if thats all right with you sir well manage your leave is due soon anyway well settle up your backpay and send it to you they shook hands they liked one another and it was obvious that carson regretted alans leaving ca but hed been right what are you going to do now carson said as alan picked up his briefcase ive got another job im helen curtis personal assistant for the presidential campaign youre going to need a great deal of luck then a great deal alan agreed goodbye sir the radical liberal movement campaign committee met at its headquarters they sat round a long table in the large welllighted room one of the walls comprised a huge laser screena usual feature of the windowless apartments in the city of switzerland helen sat at the head of the table with alan on her right jordan kalpis her campaign organizer on her left the two heads of the rlms press and information department sat near herhorace wallace handsome and blankfaced andy curry small freckled and shiftyeyedboth scots who had hardly seen scotland and were yet anachronisms in their pride for their country national feeling hardly existed these days also at the table were publicity chief mildred brecht an angular woman vernikoff head of publications and pamphlets sabah director of research both fat men with unremarkable faces helen said although youve all advised me against it i intend to conduct my campaign on these lines one she read off a sheet of paper before heran insistence that other steps be taken to apprehend whoever was responsible for storing those bombs on the first level although well agree its possible that the fireclown was responsible we must also pursue different lines of investigation in case he was not that covers usthe present policy of concentrating on the prejudged fireclown does not thats reasonable sabah murmured unless someone reveals that you personally believe the fireclown innocent two helen ignored himthat more money must be spent on interstellar spaceflight researchwe are becoming unadventurous in our outlook thats a good one mildred brecht nodded it fits our forwardlooking image curry nodded too three tax concessions to mars and ganymede settlers this will act as an incentive to colonizers fourth price control on seafarm produce fifth steps must be taken to relocate certain spaceports now occupying parts of the seabed suitable for cultivation the list was long and contained many other reforms of a minor nature there were several short discussions on the exact terms to use for publicizing her proposed policy then the means of presenting them mildred brecht had some suggestions i suggest we can stick to oldfashioned handbills for the main policy outline worldwide distribution to every home on earth large size talkie posters for display purposes newspaper displays for earth and the colonies she outlined several more means of publicizing the campaign jordan kalpis a swarthy blackhaired man with prominent facial bones and pale blue eyes interrupted mildred brecht i think on the whole were agreed already on the main points of miss curtis policy as well as the means of publicizing them we have a sound image on the whole and some nice clear publicity material the only troublesome issue is that of the fireclown i would like to suggest again that we drop itignore it already we have lost a lot of headway by the swing in public opinion from support to condemnation of the fireclown we cant afford to lose more no helen said firmly i intend to make the fireclown situation one of my main platform points i am certain we shall soon find evidence of the fireclowns innocence if that happens i shall be proved right powys proved the hysteric he seems to be and public faith in me should be restored its too much of a gamble weve got to gamble now helen said we havent a chance of winning otherwise kalpis sighed very well and lapsed into silence alan said whens the first public speech due to be made tomorrow helen fidgeted with the papers before her its at the city hall and should be wellattended the huge area of city hall was packed every seat was occupied every inch of standing space crammed to capacity on the wide platform sat alan helen wallace and curry staring out at the rows of heads that gaped at them from three sides behind them on a great screen pictures were flashedpictures of helen talking to members of the public pictures of helen with her parents pictures of helen visiting hospitals old peoples homes orphanages a commentary accompanied the pictures glowingly praising her virtues as it finished alan got up and addressed the crowd fellow citizens of the solar system in just a few weeks from now you will have voted for the person you want to be president what will you look for in your president intelligence warmth of heart capability these are the basic essentials but you will want moreyou will want someone who is going to lead the solar nation towards greater freedom greater prosperityand a more adventurous life such a woman is helen curtis unused to this sort of speechmaking alan found he was quite enjoying himself enough of the powys blood flowed in him he decided after all he continued in this vein for a quarter of an hour and then presented helen to the crowd the applause was not as great as it might have been but it was satisfactory helens platform manner was superb at once alert and confident she combined femininity with firmness speaking calmly and with utmost assurance she outlined her policy at this stage she ignored the fireclown issue entirely concentrating her attack on the sterile solrefs and their presidential candidate simon powys she ignored hecklers and spoke with wit and zest when she finished she was applauded and alan powys got up raising his arms for silence now that you have heard miss curtis precise and farthinking policy he said are there any questions which you would like to ask her dotted around the auditorium were special stands where the questioner could go and be heard through the hall each stand had a large red beacon on it beacons began to flash everywhere alan selected the nearest number seven he said giving the number of the stand i should like to ask miss curtis how she intends to work out the controlled price of seafarm produce said a woman helen went back to the center of the platform we shall decide to price by assessing cost of production a fair profit margin and so on this will result in lower prices will it the woman asked certainly the red light went out alan called another number what steps does miss curtis intend to take towards the present ban on tobacco production none helen said firmly there are two reasons for keeping the ban the first is that nicotine is harmful to health the second is that land previously used for tobacco is now producing cereals and other food produce marijuana on the other hand is not nearly so habitforming has fewer smokers and can be produced with less wastage of land there were several more questions of the same nature a little heckling and then alan called out again number sevennine miss curtis was an ardent supporter of the fireclown before it was discovered that he was a criminal now its feared that the fireclown intends to bombard earth from space or else detonate already planted bombs what does she intend to do about this helen glanced at alan he smiled at her encouragingly we are not certain that the fireclown is guilty of the crimes he has been accused of she said hes guilty all right someone shouted a hundred voices agreed we cannot condemn him out of hand she went on firmly we have no evidence of a plot to attack or destroy the planet what would you do if he was guilty shouted the original speakersit back and wait helen had to shout to be heard over the rising noise of the crowd i think that the fireclown was framed by unscrupulous men who want a war scare she insisted i believe we should follow other lines of investigation catch the fireclown by all means and bring him to trial if necessary but meanwhile we should be considering other possibilities as to how the bombs got on the first level my parents were killed on the eleventh level this was someone shouting from another speaking box i dont want the same thing to happen to my kids its sure to unless we look at the situation logically helen retaliated fireclownlover someone screamed the phrase was taken up in other parts of the hall this is madness alan she looked at him as if asking for his advice i didnt expect quite so much hysteria keep plugging he said its all you can do answer them back powys for president powys for president this from the very back of the hall powys for insanity she cried the insanity which some of you are exhibiting tonight blind fear of this kind will get you nowhere i offer you sanity madness more likely if you listened to me like sensible adults instead of shouting and screaming id tell you what i mean helen stood her arms folded waiting for the noise to die down alan went and placed himself beside her give her a chance he roared give miss curds a chance when finally the noise had abated somewhat helen continued i have seen the fireclown since the holocaust he told me that policemen tampered with his machines and caused the fire he had nothing to do with it then he was lying calm down she begged listen to me we listened to the fireclowns lies for too long why listen to yours the fireclown told you no lies you interpreted what he said so that it meant what you wanted it to mean now youre doing the same to me the fireclown is innocent alan whispered dont go too far helen youve said enough she must have realized that she had overshot her mark she had been carried away by the heat of the argument had admitted she thought the fireclown innocent alan could imagine what the lasercasts and newssheets would say in the morning are there any other questions he called but his voice was drowned by the angry roar of the crowd not exactly a successful evening he said as he took her home they had had to wait for hours before the crowd dispersed she was depressed she said nothing whats the next stage in the campaign he asked next stage is it worth it alan im getting nowhere ive never known such wild hysteria i thought we got rid of all that a century ago it takes longer than a hundred years to educate people to listen to reason when someone tells them their lives are liable to be snuffed out in an instant i suppose so but what are we going to do i didnt expect such a strong reaction i didnt intend to say that i thought the fireclown was innocent i knew that was going too far that they couldnt take direct opposition to what they now believe but i got so angry its just unfortunate he said comfortingly though inwardly he was slightly annoyed that she had lost her selfcontrol at the last minute and its early days yet maybe by the time the campaigns over well have more people on our side maybe theyll just ignore us she said tiredly as they entered her apartment no i dont think that were nothing if not controversial next day the rlm political headquarters received a deputation two men and two women the men were both thin and of medium height one of them the first to advance into the front office and confront alan who had elected to deal with them was sandyhaired with a prominent adams apple and a nervous tic the other was less remarkable with brown hair and a mild face in which two fanatical eyes gleamed the women might have been pretty if they had dressed less dowdily and paid more attention to their hair and makeup in a word they were frumps the taller woman carried a neat banner which read the end of the world draws slowly nigh latterday adventists say no to false gods stop the fireclown alan knew what they represented and he knew of the leader had seen his face in innumerable broadcasts good morning elder smod he said brightly what can we do for you we have come as the voice of the latterday adventists to denounce you elder smod said sonorously the latterday adventists were now the strongest and only influential religious body in existence today and their ranks were comprised so obviously of bewildered halfwits and pious paranoiacs that public and politicians alike did not pay them the attention that such a large movement would otherwise merit in a democracy however they could be a nuisance and the main nuisance was elder smod secondincommand to senile chief elder bevis who was often observed to have fallen asleep during one of his own speeches and why should you wish to denounce me alan raised his eyebrows weve come to denounce the radical liberal movement for its outrageous support of this spawn of satan the fireclown said one of the frumps in a surprisingly clear and musical voice but what have the latterday adventists to do with the fireclown alan asked in surprise young man we oppose the supporters of satan im sure you do but i still dont see what connection satan seeks to destroy the world by fire before the good lord has his chance we cannot tolerate that alan remembered now that the original twentiethcentury sect had announced that they were the only ones who would be saved when the world was destroyed by fire they had been a little chary of announcing the date but egged on by slightly disenchanted supporters they had finally given an exact date for the end of the world ad claiming the third millennium would contain only the faithful sadly when the third millennium dawned it contained fewer of the faithful than before since many had not wholly accepted the fact pointed out to them by the movements elders that the bible had earlier been misread as to the date of christs birth a speedy and splendid juggling with the christian jewish and moslem calendars had taken place on january st ad but in spite of the discredit the movement had grown again with the invention of a slightly altered interpretationie that the world would not perish in a sudden holocaust but that it would beginand had begunto perish from the year giving an almost infinite amount of time for the process to take place however the coming of the fireclown scare with its talk of destruction had evidently thrown them out again but why exactly have you come to us alan demanded to ask you to side with the righteous against the fireclown we were astonished to see that there were still foolish sinners on earth who could believe him innocent so we cameto show you the true way thank you said alan but all i sayand i cannot speak for the rlm as a wholeis that the fireclown is not likely to destroy the world by fire we have no argument elder smod seemed a trifle nonplussed evidently he considered the fireclown a sort of johnnycomelately worlddestroyer whereas his movement had had for some time a monopolistic concession on the idea alan decided to humor him and said gently the fireclown could be an agent for your side couldnt he no he is satans spawn satan said smod with a morose satisfaction has come among us in the shape of the fireclown satan yet the clown predicted a return of fire to the world unless in your terms the world turned its back on mammon and one cannot worship both a devils trick the fireclown is satans answer to the true wordour word it was no good alan couldnt grasp his logicif logic there was he had to admit defeat what if we dont cease our support of the fireclown he asked then you will be destroyed in the flames from heaven we cant win can we alan said you are like the rest of your kind elder smod sneered they paid us no attention either who do you mean you profess not to know ha are you not one of that band who call themselves the secret sons of the fireclown i didnt know there was such a group where are they we have already tried to dissuade them from their false worship a deputation of our english brothers went to them yesterday but to no avail theyre in england where in the stinking slums of mayfair where they belong of course elder smod turned to his followers comewe have tried to save them but they heed us not let us leave this gateway to hell they marched primly out mayfair wasnt that where bias had his hideout perhaps the two were connected perhaps this was the lead that would prove once and for all whether the fireclown planned mammoth arson or whether the syndicate had framed him alan hurriedly made his way into the back room where helen and jordan kalpis were planning her tour helen i think ive got a lead im not sure what it is but if im lucky ill be able to get evidence to prove that were right about the fireclown hes still got some supporters i just learned in london im going there shall i come with you no youve got a lot of ground to make up if youre going to get near to winning this election stick at itand dont lose your selfcontrol over the fireclown issue ill get back as soon as ive got some definite information alan its probably dangerous bias and his like take pains to protect themselves ill do the same dont worry he said he turned to kalpis could we have a moment jordan jordan walked tactfully out of the room alan took helen in his arms staring down at her face she had a halfstartled look halfworried alan yes she shook her head smiling look after yourself ive got to he said and kissed her chapter fourteen mayfair moldered nowhere on the three planets was there a slum like it and riches not poverty had indirectly created it as alan walked up the festering streets of park lane a light drizzle falling from the overcast afternoon sky he remembered the story of how it had got like this mayfair was the property of one mana man whose ambition had been to own it who had achieved his ambition and was now nearsenileronald lowry the british financier who refused to let the government buy him out and refused also to improve his property the original residents and business houses had moved out long since unable to stand lowrys weird dictatorship the homeless and especially the criminal homeless had moved in like lowry they werent interested in improving the property either for them it was fine as it wasa warren of huge disused hotels office blocks and apartment buildings lowry was richperhaps the richest man in the worldand lowry in spite of his senility had power he would not let a single government official set foot on his property and backed up his wishes by threatening to withdraw his capital from industries which without it would flounder and give the government unemployment problems relocation problems and the like until a less cautious party came to power mayfair would continue to molder at least for as long as lowry lived the scruffy oldworld architecture of the hilton the dorchester and the millennium grande towered above alan as he passed between them and the jungle that grew alongside hyde park hyde park itself was public property neat and orderly well maintained by londons city council but roots had spread and shrubs had flowered making an almost impenetrable hedge along the borders of the park wisely he did not head immediately for the dorchester where bias was supposed to be but went instead to a cafe that still bore the name of the darlington grill the specialite de la maison these days however was fish and chipsfrom the smell the majority of the men were gaudily dressed in the latest styles but some were down at heelnot necessarily criminals but pridies people who refused to accept the citizens grant which the government allowed to all who were unable to work whether because of physical or emotional reasons these were extreme emotional cases who if they had not come to the officialfree area of mayfair would have been cured by this time and rehabilitated mayfair alan thought was indeed a strange anachronismand a blot on the three planets ronald lowrys vast financial resources had produced the only skid row now in existence alan had taken the precaution of getting himself a green luminous suit and a flowing scarlet cravat which made him feel sick whenever he saw himself in a mirror on his head was perched at a jaunty angle a conical cap of bright and hideous blue edged with gold sateen he saw by the list chalked on a board at the end of the cafe that his nose hadnt lied the only food was turbot and chips the liquor it seemed was a product of a local firma choice between wheat parsnip or nettle wine he ordered a wheat wine and found it clear and good like a fullbodied sauterne it was only spoiled by the disgusting aroma of illicit cigarettes smoked by several of the nicotine addicts who lounged in what was evidently a druginduced euphoria at the greasy tables before he had left the city of switzerland alan had procured one of the badges previously worn by the fireclowns supportersa small metal sun emblem which the disillusioned sons of the sun had rid themselves of when public sympathy for the fireclown had changed to anger he wore it inside his cap he looked around over the rim of his glass hoping to see a similar emblem but he was disappointed a sharpfaced little man came in and sat at alans table he ordered a parsnip wine a few drops spilled on the table as the proprietor brought it alan decided that he would have to chance the possibility that the cafe fraternity were sufficiently angered against the fireclown to cause trouble he took off his hat lining upward so that the sun emblem was visible the sharpfaced man was also sharpeyed alan saw him stare at the badge for a moment then he looked at alan frowning in the spilled liquor on the table he drew with a surprisingly clean finger a similar design youre one of us eh he grunted yes fresh to mayfair yes youd better come to the meeting its a masked meeting naturally weve got to protect ourselves where do i go south audley streeta cellar the man told him the number and the time to be there then he ignored alan who finished his drink and ordered another a little later he got up and left alan could understand the need for secrecy the police would be searching for any clue to the fireclowns whereabouts he wondered if this group knew or did they have any real contact with the fireclown at all perhaps in an hours time at six oclock he would know at six he entered the brokendown doorway in south audley street and found himself in a long room that had evidently been a restaurant through the gloom he could make out chairs still stacked on tables he walked over rotting carpets through the piled furniture to the back of the place a door led him through a filthy dilapidated kitchen at the end of a row of rusted stoves he saw another door opening it he saw that it closed off a flight of concrete steps leading downwards he advanced into a cellar about five or six masked figures were already there one of them stocky and languid in his movements alan thought he recognized one of the others a woman in a red and yellow hood that covered her whole face came up to him welcome newcomer sit there she pointed to a padded chair in a shadowed corner from a brazier at the end of the cellar flames danced huge grotesque shadows were spread along the floor and up the walls as the men and women began to come down the cellar steps and sit on the dampsmelling chairs thirtynine plus the newcomerforty in all the stocky man said close the door and bar it the stocky man went and stood by the brazier alan wished he could place him but couldnt for the moment we are come here he intoned as the last loyal sons of the fireclown to honor our leader and prepare for his return we are pledged to carry out his work even if we risk death in so doing p alan realized suddenly that these people were using the fireclowns name just as the majority had done earlier to support some creed or obsession of their own the whole tone of the meeting did not fit with what he knew of the fireclown his father probably he thought he understood the fireclown better than anyoneparticularly since he could recognize certain traits in the fireclown that had a milder expression in himself certainly he decided this group was worth observing for it might help clarify the rest of the questions that needed clarifying before he could act in an objective way what if the arms syndicate were operating this group for their own purposes it was possible that they had got hold of these people who seriously wished to put the fireclowns outre philosophy into practice and were making them act against the fireclowns interests then he had it the identify of the intoning manbias now he felt there was substance for his theory that the arms syndicate was using the fireclown as a patsya fallguy to carry the can for their devious plans for the world conflict he bent forward as bias came to the important point you have each been given incendiary bombs to plant in some of the major buildings around the globe the burning buildings will act as beacons heralding the return of the fireclown with his bolts of fire for the unclean and his gift of a new world for you the true believers are you all sure of what you must do yes each man and woman responded now biass masked face was cocked to one side as he suddenly regarded alan the newcomer is not yet a full son of the fireclown he must prove himself to us alan suddenly realized the menace in the words he sensed from the atmosphere in the room that this was not normal procedure come here my friend bias said quietly you must be initiated there was a strong chance that bias recognized him but what could he do for the moment he would have to go through with it he got up slowly and walked towards the fiery heat of the brazier do you worship the flame of the sun bias asked theatrically yes he said trying to keep his voice level do you see the fire as the fire of life he nodded would you bring forth the fires of life in yourself yes thenbias pointed at the brazierplunge your hand into the flames as proof that you are a brother to the flame of the sun ritual if alan needed confirmation that these people had nothing to do with the fireclown in any real sense he had it now the fireclown scorned ritual no bias he said scornfully and turned to the masked gathering dont listen to this man i know the fireclownhe is my fatherhe would not want this he would hate you to debase yourselves as you are doing now the fireclown only uses fire as a symbol he speaks of the human spirit not he gestured at the brazier natural fire silence bias commanded you seek to disrupt our gathering do not listen to him brothers the sons of the fireclown were glancing at one another uncertainly biass voice spoke almost goodhumoredly in alans ear really powys this is nothing to you why do you interfere admit to these fools that you lied and ill let you go otherwise i can probably convince them anyway and youll be roasted on that thing there alan glanced at the blazing brazier spouting flames he shuddered then he leapt at it and kicked it over in biass direction bias jumped away from the burning coals shouting something incoherent alan pushed through the confused crowd and reached the door wrenched the bar away and fled up the stairs he ran through the darkened restaurant and out into the crumbling street a few seconds ahead of his closest pursuer he dashed down towards grosvenor square an overgrown tangle of trees and shrubs in the last of the evening light he saw the monolithic tower of the old american embassy fallen into decay long since a flight of steps led up to the broken glass doors he climbed them hurriedly squeezed through an aperture and saw another flight of steps leading upwards by the time he had reached the second floor let his feet lead him into a maze of corridors he no longer heard the sounds of pursuit and realized thankfully that he had lost them he cursed himself for not wearing a mask he should have guessed that bias and the suspicious sons of the fireclown had some connection and now it was almost certain that bias unknown to the fireclown was playing both ends against the middle but hed still have to find out more before he could prove the fireclowns innocence he had only one course of action to go to the dorchester where bias had his hideout he knew he wasnt far from park lane since he had studied a map thoroughly before he left he waited for two hours before groping his way down to a different exit from the one hed left and stumbled through the jungle of grosvenor square climbing over fallen masonry and keeping in the shadows as he walked down grosvenor street and into park lane he threw away his hat and reversed his jacket as an afterthought so that the reversible side showed mauve shot with yellow hunched his shoulders to disguise his outline and hid his face as much as possible then continued down towards the dorchester luckily the street was almost deserted and he passed only a couple of drunks sitting against the wall of a bank and a pretty young girl who hailed him with pretty old words she reviled him softly in language even older when he ignored her reaching the side entrance of the dorchester he found the door firmly locked he continued round to the front lights were on in the lobby and two toughlooking men lounged outside he couldnt get past them without them seeing him so he walked boldly and said ive come to see mr biashes expecting me which suite first floor said the guard unsuspiciously alan found the lobby in surprisingly good repair even the elevators looked in working order although there was a good deal of litter about he took the stairs reached the first floor which was in semidarkness and saw a light coming from under a pair of big double doors he paused outside and strained his ear to catch the mumble of voices from within he was sure he recognized both of themone was probably biass anyway the other he realized after a moment was the voice of junnar his grandfathers secretary he took from his pocket the squat laser pistol he had brought with him at helens request and walked into the room the plot he said with forced lightness thickens good evening gentlemen bias took the cigarette out of his mouth with an expression of surprise good evening powys he said amiably i didnt think wed seen the last of you if youre not going to be impetuous we can explain everything i think mr powys junnar said sadly you should have stayed out of this from the start whats the gun for selfprotection alan said curtly and i dont need much explanation ive had an inkling of this for some time grandfather put you up to planting the bombs on the fireclownam i right junnars silence was answer enough alan nodded hed use any means to prove the fireclown a criminal even if it meant supplying the proof himself in a very simple way you got the bombs from bias and planted them but you bit off more than you could chew when you started this war scare what are you up to now doing another deal with bias over the arms he wants to supply the government with as a defense against a nonexistent plot thats about it bias admitted alan felt physically sick his own grandfather head of the house of powys descendant of a line of strong honest and fervently dedicated politicians had descended to faking evidence to prove his own theory about the fireclown and in consequence he had started a wave of hysteria which he was virtually unable to control he wondered if simon powys now regretted his infamy he probably did but it was too late and this was the man the public was almost bound to elect president you bloody treacherous pigs he said youd have to prove all this bias said softly his selfassurance still apparently maintained alan was still in a quandary all his life the concept of clan loyalty to the powyss had been drummed into him it was hard to shake it off could he betray his own grandfather who in a peculiar way he still loved at the expense of the father responsible for his bastardy slowly standing there with the laser gun in his hand its unfamiliar grip sticky with sweat he came unwillingly to a decision he waved the gun towards the door after you he said where are we going junnar asked nervously the city of switzerland alan told them and just remember what a laser can do i could slice you both in two in a moment its going in my pocket and my hands going to be on it all the way youre rather a melodramatic young man bias said resignedly as he walked towards the door chapter fifteen under alans direction junnar brought the car down on the roof of the powys apartment block climb out both of you alan ordered they obeyed him they descended to simon powys apartment and junnar made the door open they went through is that you junnar powys called from his study alan herded them in he saw a terrible expression of sheer fear cloud his grandfathers face as they entered hollowly alan said i know everything grandfather simon powys remained seated at his desk slowly he put down his stylus and pushed the papers from him what are you going to do then alan denounce us i expect bias said cheerfully may i sit down powys he turned to alan both of you sit alan ordered his hand still on his pocketed gun youd have to prove it simon powys said slowly in an old mans voice its the word of an emotional young man against that of a respected minister i could say you were raving neither junnar nor bias would testify against me why alan demanded why grandfather there are a number of reasons alan it was my last chance to become president a powys of every generation has been president at least once i couldnt let family tradition dieit would have been a disgrace isnt what you did a disgrace isnt it a crime you dont understand politicians cant always use clean methods i was right the fireclowns no good alan it was the only way to show the public that was only a matter of opinion the fact is you framed the fireclown in order to prove your own theory about himand because helen was bound to win the election if you didnt do something desperate it was the only way to change public opinion radically because of that sandais police tampered with the fireclowns flame machinesand three hundred people were killed i didnt want that to happen but it happenedyou were responsible for their deaths i feel guilty you are guilty and you fell neatly into biass plan didnt you he supplied you with the bombs with which you framed the fireclown and now because you dare not admit the whole thing was manufactured by you hes holding the government up to blackmail there is a possibility of mass destruction if this hysteria builds upbut even if that doesnt happen the money that bias will demand will impoverish sol for years and hes got you neatly in his traphe can dictate any terms he wants if you were elected president you would be his puppet bias would run sol and he nearly succeeded didnt he as your grandfather pointed out bias said equably you still have to prove all this young man i intend to bias grandfatheryoure going to confess before its too late youre a powys you must simon powys wet his lips and stared down at the desk are you going to confess grandfather no said simon powys no i am not it had been alans only chance and it had failed as his grandfather and bias had said it was his word against theirs already he had the reputation as a diehard supporter of the fireclown who would believe him now that simon powys had turned the solar system against the fireclown what could he do now his idealism his belief that his grandfather would act in accordance with the principles he had so plainly shed was shattered he was drained of emotion and could only stand staring down at the old man stalemate powys bias cross his legs there must be proof alan thought there must be proof somewhere he knew that if he could prove his grandfathers guilt he could stop biass plan for controlling the solar system avert the threat of a war almost bound to come about with so much hysteria in the air prove the fireclown innocent and allow helen to become president everything hinged on what was in fact a means of betraying his grandfather he gave bias a disgusted glare yes stalemate but if i walk out of here now you dare not do anything for fear that ill say too much you cant rig evidence against me the same way as you did to the fireclown as an afterthought he added you could kill me of course no simon powys rose from his chair alan come in with us in a few weeks the world will be ours alan went towards the door you accused me once of having none of the noble powys blood remember if thats what flows in your veins thank god i havent got any he flung down the gun and left outside he walked slowly towards the elevator cone brooding and unable to think coherently all he had was definite knowledge of his grandfathers perfidy knowledge that he was unable yet to prove still the knowledge itself was something he went down to the thirtieth level and made his way to the rlm headquarters he entered the front office still stacked with posters jordan kalpis was there his bony face full of worry powys what did you find out wheres helen ill tell you later at a meeting in the divisional hall on forty theres some pretty bad heckling going on the crowd has turned nasty right im going over there alan went out into the corridor and took the fastway to the elevator rose ten levels and took the fastway again to the divisional hall every ten levels had a divisional hall comprising a meeting hall and the offices of the local subcouncil officials outside the posters of helen had been torn down there was a fantastic noise coming from inside alan entered the crowded hall and glimpsed helen at the far end on the platform a man beside him threw back an arm alan saw it held a piece of raw meat as the mans hand came up to hurl the meat alan grabbed it and wrenched it savagely back he didnt give the man time to see who had stopped him but pushed his way down the aisle all kinds of refuse was flying on to the platform as he hauled himself up helens face was bleeding and her clothes were torn she stood rigidly defiantly shouting at the mob helen she saw him alan what get out of heretheyre not listening to you she seemed to pull herself together now the mob surged forward faces twisted hands grasping he heard someone shout she wants us burned to death shewantsusburnedtodeath a gem of a phrase alan thought as he kicked the first man who tried to climb the stage it fed the hysteria which spawned it he found himself hating humanity and his kicks were savage andy currys freckled face appeared from the side exit quick here they ran in and curry ordered the door locked i can only say i told you so curry said dourly you shouldnt have made the speech in the first place miss curtis i avoided all mention of the fireclown she said furiously and they didnt give me a chance curry picked up the phone in the passage he pressed two studs the word police flashed on the screen and an operators face followed it im speaking from divisional hall level ten curry said swiftly theres a riot going on down here were besieged we need help the operator looked at him helen curtis meetingis that right thats right well have a squad there right away the operator told him in a voice that indicated he should have known better than to start trouble the police dispersed the crowd and the captain told alan helen and curry that an escort was ready to see them home he sounded unsympathetic as if he was helping them unwillingly when they reached helens door the leader of the escort said if i were you miss curtis i should stay inside youre liable to be attacked otherwise ive got an election to fight she pointed out youll have people to fight if tonights troubles repeatedand i dont doubt it will be if you insist on setting yourself up to resist the whole climate of public opinion weve got enough on our hands with the fireclown investigationcrowds demanding to know when were going to catch him rabblerousers shouting thatwe must prepare for war and all the rest of it the escort leader shrugged we cant be held responsible if you deliberately risk being mobbed thank you officer alan followed helen into the apartment the door closed so im supposed to stay boxed in here am i she said bitterly meanwhile ive got to try and convince people that theyre wrong its useless he said hollowly going into the sittingroom and slumping down in a chair what did you find out in london everything even what bias is up to he told her slowly and wearily all that had happened so we were right she said thoughtfully but uncle simonthats incredible yes isnt it he smiled cynically and our hands are virtually tied weve got to do some cool thinking helen she was calmer now she seemed to notice for the first time that he was exhausted wed better sleep on it she said we may feel more optimistic in the morning as they breakfasted alan switched on the laser lets see whats happened in the world this morning he said petition urging the government to speed up its defense plans mouthed the newscaster then he leaned forward urgently for those who missed our early edition the first attacks by the fireclown have begun two nuclear bomb explosions have been observedone in the atlantic and one in the gobi desert so far nobody has been reported hurt but it will be impossible to know for certain for some time yet where will the fireclowns next bomb strike swiss city new york berlin we dont know emergency shelters are being erected and bomb detector teams are covering the areas around the main cities to try and discover hidden bombs meanwhile in britain mystery fires have devastated important public buildings the national gallery is smoldering wreckagethe marvelous architectural beauty of gateshead theatre is no more precautions are being taken to protect other such buildings throughout the planet there is little doubt that the fireclownor his diehard supporters herewas responsible thats all biass work alan said angrily how are we going to prove it look helen pointed at the screen simon powys had appeared looking dignified and grave my fellow citizens of the solar system i am speaking to you in troubled times as i predicted a short while ago the fireclown has attacked the globe he has been offered no hostility we have intended him no harm but nevertheless he has attacked we must defend ourselves if we had to manufacture bombs and other weapons for defense we should be wiped out before we had any chance luckily the solar government has been offered arms powys paused as if saddened by the task he had to perform a group of mencriminals we should have called them but a few hours ago but now we are more than thankful to them have offered us a supply of arms we are going to purchase them on your behalf and set them up around the planet this will have to be done swiftly and already bodies of volunteers are working on emergency installations let us hope we shall be in time to avert our peril when i next speak to you perhaps we shall know the devil helen swore hes obviously completely in biass power he knows that bias will use him to control earththat were threatened with a military dictatorship and yet in his pride he still refuses to stop doesnt he know what hes doing hes gone so far now that he cant go back his hate for the fireclown and love for his own political ambitions have combined and in a sense im sure turned him insane maybe he cant even see the extent of his treachery weve got to do something to stop him alan helen spoke quietly like what first well try to convince sandai then if that fails well have to kill him helen killing him wont do any good what could we do set up another dictatorship to control the people dont you see that if we continue this violence well breed more violence ad infinitum weve got to use legal means against him otherwise society as we know it is finished then what other alternative is there first well see sandai he said then well decide chapter sixteen it took time to get to see sandai it took over a day by the time they walked into his office they were looking very tired indeed so was sandai if youve come to tell me that the fireclowns innocent of these outrages he said wiping his olive forehead im not interested alan stood over the seated police chief his hands resting on the mans desk thats part of it chief sandai but thats not all i have heard the man responsible confess his guilt to me youve what sandai looked up astonished the man responsible for framing the fireclown for setting off the bombs and causing the fires in britain is a man named bias bias francois bias hes suspected head of the arms syndicate sandai looked thoughtful its a possibility mr powys but what proof have you how did you find out i heard that bias had his headquarters in mayfair i went there and discovered he was running an organization calling itself the sons of the fireclown so bias is working for the fireclown no the thing was definitely spurious bias was using it for his own ends later i broke into biass apartment and confronted him with what i knew and what i suspected he denied nothing he told me to prove itwhich i couldnt do i then brought him and another man back to the capital who was the other man junnar my grandfathers secretary you mean you suspect hes been working against minister powys thats fantasticif its true hes been working with powys alan said firmly bias and my grandfather are handinglovethey plan to use the war scare theyve created and the fear of the fireclown to hold the earth to ransom you heard yesterdays announcementabout powys having to buy bombs from the syndicate its a setup chief sandai young man youre evidently deranged sandai stood up and patted alans arm sympathetically listen to him helen said urgently listen chief sandai it sounds impossible but its a fact and the proof sandai said gently as circumstantial as that against the fireclown alan pointed out but the fireclown is a renegadeyour grandfather is virtually the leader of the solar system thats the difference mr powys im sorry but your defense of the fireclown doesnt hold up why dont you admit that and work with the rest of us to avert the menace its the truth alan said he felt the energy go out of his body his shoulders slump im very busy sandai said youd better leave now as they crossed the sunny gardens of the top helen said to him that didnt work what do we do now alan watch the world die he said hopelessly the whole lot of them deserve death for what theyre doing she said cautiously maybe but the law banished the death sentence over a hundred years ago we want to preserve the law helen not demolish it further if only we could contact the fireclown maybe he could help us hes journeying off somewhere in that ship of his conducting his experiment theres no hope there anyway hes not interested in earths problems you know that they reached the elevator cone and entered it with a dozen others as they descended a man stared hard at helen arent you helen curtis he said roughly i am the man spat in her face alan jumped at him punching savagely the attendant shouted for them to stop hands grabbed alan the man punched him in the stomach and then in the head stinking firebug alan felt bile in his throat then he passed out he came to in a few seconds the lift was still going down helen was bending over him the lift stopped youd better get out both of you the attendant said alan got to his feet why he grunted youre making trouble thats why we didnt start it come on alan helen said taking his arm well walk he was weak with pain as they stumbled into the corridor also he was insensately angry she helped him on to the fastway and supported his weight until his strength returned that shows you how much anything we say is worth she said quietly hatred and violence are everywhere what harm would a little more do the good would outweigh the bad alan no he gasped no helen simon powys sold his principles im not selling mine so she said when they were back in her apartment what do we do just wait here and watch the world collapse switch on the set so weve got a good view he said she went over and turned on the laservid they watched glumly as the announcer reported another explosion in the pacific two more in central africa killing a large number of people who lived in small communities in the blast area work was under way on the defense project simon powys was directing the preparations they dont need to bother with the farce of electing him helen said hes as good as president now you mean bias is alan told her hes the one pulling the strings helen reached over to the laser and pressed out a number who are you calling my brother she said denholms about the only person who can help us now her brothers face came on the screen hello helen im rather busyis it important very important denholm could you come over if ifs another defense of the fireclown it is not her brothers expression changed as he stared at her image very well give me an hourall right okay she said how can denholm help us alan said whats the point well tell him all we know the more people of importance who are told about it the better chance we have denholm came in placed his gaudy hat on a chair arm and sat down alan helen said tell denholm everythingfrom the time we went to see the fireclown until our interview with sandai he told denholm curtis everything when he had finished curtis frowned at him alan he said i think i believe you uncle simons been behaving a trifle mysteriously in some ways the alacrity with which he managed to contact the dealers when the government finally decided to buy the arms was astonishing it could mean that hes abused his position as chairman of the one hundred committee f what do you mean supposing in some way he had got hold of a list of the dealers and the location of their caches supposing he held on to it without letting the other committee members know contacted bias and concocted this scheme suppose then they worked out a plan to take advantage of the fireclown get simon powys elected as president and then run the world as they wanted to run it powys might have got in touch with bias originally with a view to smashing the syndicate but bias might have proposed the whole idea we all know how much uncle simon hates the fireclown it would have been the perfect means of getting rid of him maybe he intended to capture the fireclown maybe the original deal was simply over a few bombs but bias has provided the fireclown with the means of producing a supership and he was fairly certain that the fireclown would escape when the chips were down he did the war scare started aided by the police tampering with the flamemachines simon powys couldnt back outand bias had him where he wanted him that sounds logical alan agreed but all this needs proof to back it up denholm curtis pursed his lips thoughtfully it comes back to that every time helen sighed thered be only one way to find the man who was powys original contact with bias and get him to confess but how alan asked where do we look we check the files of the one hundred committeethat was probably how powys found his contact youre still secretary helen where are the files right here in the safe get them she got themdozens of spools of microfilm they fitted them into the projector it was more than six hours before they found what they were looking for a reference to one nils benedict suspected of trying to sell arms to a superreactionary crespignite splinter group they had turned him over to the police the police had been unable to find any evidence against him simon powys had interviewed him while in custody and reported that in his opinion the man was innocent simon powys had been apart from the police the only man to question benedict benedict had a brussels address do you think thats him alan said rubbing his eyes its the only one it could possibly be what do we do now pay nils benedict a visit i suppose helen suggested a smaller less complex version of the city of switzerland brussels had an altogether different character every inch of stonework wasembellished with red lacquer and over this bright designs had been laid gilt predominated the structure rose fourteen levels above the ground five below covering an area of five square miles the roof landing space was limited so that they were forced to land outside the city and take a monorocket which let them off on the tenth level benedict lived on level eight they reached his apartment they had already decided that denholm would do the talking since he was less likely to be suspect than the other two nils benedict he said to the blank door this is denholm curtis ive got some good news for you the door opened a tall rangy man in a dressing gown of green silk stared curiously at curtis are you from powys he asked as the door closed behind them alan took the lead we want to contact bias in a hurry can you arrange it sure but why i thought he was in direct contact nowadays that was enough now they knew for certain oh he is alan said but we thought it would be nice for you and simon powys to meet again after all this time benedict had been uncommonly slow he thought for a man who was supposed to live by his wits the man seemed gradually to realize that something was wrong he backed into his living room they followed the answer was there benedict was an addict the stink of mescaline was in the room nightmarish murals covered the walls he was a mescamas who got his kicks from descending into his own psychological hell helen said in a strained voice ill wait outside come on benedict denholm said roughly i have rights you know benedict said thickly why does powys want to see me are you scared of powys he told me id be killed if i ever got in touch with him again theres not a chance of that i promise alan said benedict was still wary alan suddenly hit him under the jaw he collapsed lets get him dressed denholm said it wouldnt be proper for him to go out without his correct clothes on they had surprisingly little difficulty getting benedict to helens apartment organization of the usual kind seemed to have gone to pieces during the fake emergency while helen tried to revive benedict and denholm tied his hands the laser began to flash alan answered it chief sandai looked out at him youre not the only madman in the system it seems he said i thought about what you told me and thought i couldnt do any harm to assign a few men to go undercover to mayfair and check your story it held up we found bias and junnar there were holding them under the emergency laws which simon powys insisted we make as suspects in an arson plot we got one of the sons of the fireclown too but were going to need more proofand im still not convinced that your tale about simon powys is true alan stepped aside so sandai could see benedict recognize this man chief ive got a feeling i do but i cant place him who is he hes simon powys original contact with bias hes a mescamas if we withhold his supply for a short time he should tell us everything he knows if its true youve had a big stroke of luck young man itll be the first weve had alan said dryly can you come over and pick us up it might be wise to have an escort sandai nodded the screen blanked bias alone remained seemingly at ease benedict was slumped hopelessly in his chair perhaps even enjoying the experience of defeat junnar had his back to them staring out of the window over the mountains the police prison had a wonderful view bias said chief sandai what evidence do you have for these fantastic charges confront simon powys with them he will laugh at you sandai turned to denholm curtis wheres powys now youve convinced me hes at a special meeting in the solar house members are asking him questions on his war policy hes bound to answer since we still retain a vestige of democracy what are you going to do chief alan asked something spectacular sandai said its probably the only thing we can do now to break powys power in front of the assembly otherwise it may be too late after what ive been through in the last day or so helen said grimly im beginning to doubt that anyone can topple uncle simon standing nobly before the mighty assembly of solar representatives simon powys answered their questions in a grave and sonorous voice he was the image of the visionary and man of action the weight of responsibility seemed to rest heavily upon his broad shoulders but he bore it manfully not to say hypocritically alan watched him on the screen outside the main entrance to the assembly chamber itself he denholm and helen stood in a group to one side chief sandai four policemen and the fettered trio of junnar bias and the slobbering benedict stood to the other they choose their moment well when a member for afghanistan asked simon powys what the police were doing in the fireclown investigation sandai pushed the button operating the double doors the doors swept open and the party pushed forward the police sandai called have caught most of the men responsible for the present situation he gestured dramatically towards the shackled men here they are there is only one man missing p alan saw that simon powys face bore an expression similar to the look hed had on the night hed accused him but he held up well alan decided considering everything what does this interruption mean chief sandai sandai spoke laconically using the emergency powers vested in me by the government of the solar system i am holding under arrest the three men you see therefrancois bias suspected arms dealer nils benedict a contact for the arms syndicateand eugene junnar personal assistant to minister simon powys all the men admit to being implicated in a plot instigated by minister powys to frame the fireclown start a war scare by means of nuclear bomb explosions and incendiaries and thus assure minister powys of full political power as president of the solar system bias said hes lying minister powys but nils benedict not of biass caliber continued the theme we didnt admit anything sir i havent said a word about the deal simon powys thundered be quiet you have abused your powers sandai i demand that you leave the hall immediately but the hubbub from the rest of the representatives drowned out anything else he might have wished to say alan walked swiftly down to the central platform and mounted it we have witnesses now grandfather we have the proof you told us to get benjosef rose from his seat whats the meaning of this mr powys my grandfather sir has betrayed every trust you and the system have ever put in him briefly alan outlined the facts benjosef turned to simon powys who stood rigidly as if petrified in his place is this true powys no powys came alive his face desperatewretched no cant you see this is the work of the fireclowns supporters an attempt to disgrace me and confuse us in our hour of peril my grandson is lying but simon powys had lost all selfcontrol his wild denial had convinced the assembly of his guilt he knew it he stared around him his breathing irregular his eyes wide he advanced toward benjosef i run the solar system now benjosefnot you you cant do anything the people are with me possibly benjosef said mildly with a slight air of triumph but evidently this assembly is not benjosef seemed pleased at his wouldbe successors downfall i was aware minister that you wished to oust me as president but i did not expect you to take quite so much trouble he gestured to the police chief sandaiim afraid you had better arrest minister powys simon powys leapt from the dais stumbled and fell he got up evidently in pain and stood there panting as sandai stepped cautiously towards him you fool i could have made the world a better place i knew it was going soft i could have stopped the rot you are under my orders sandaidont listen to benjosef sandai slipped a pair of electrogyves from his belt no simon powys was sobbing now the fireclown will destroy us he will destroy you allas he destroyed my daughter alan looked up in surprise so his grandfather had known all along that the fireclown was his father that explained even further his insensate hatred of the fireclown he went up to the old man pitying him now grandfather i know you have suffered but old simon powys turned his great head and looked into alans eyes his expression was that of a bewildered tearful child it was for her sake he said brokenly for hers and yours alan the gyves hummed and curled about powys wrists his head bowed his seamed face now tearstreaked he allowed sandai to lead him out of the assembly hall benjosef stepped from the platform and touched alans arm im sorry you had to do what you did my boy i must admit i never liked your grandfatheralways thought him well somewhat weak i suppose that was why i and many members of the party never promoted him to a more prominent position why he had never until now been nominated as a presidential candidate evidently i was right at least he turned to helen curtis the world is going to be grateful to you both i suspect the climate of opinion is going to take yet another reversal before the elections are finally held i hope you make a good president miss curtis thank you sir said helen looking worriedly at alan alan ran a hand across his face he swallowed with difficulty and glowered at the ground then he shook benjosef s hand off his arm im glad youre all proved right he said bitterly im bloody glad about the happy ending and he walked straight up the aisle and out of the solar hall his pace fast as he crossed the lawns his heart pounding his eyes warm his fists clenched and his mind in a mess chapter seventeen two days later alan emerged from the cavern on the first level where he had been avoiding everyone and ascended to the top passing a great many talkieposters proclaiming helen curtis for president listening to the conversation his faith in the stupidity of human nature was fully restored in the swift movement of events the public had changed their loyalty from the fireclown to simon powys and now to helen curtis why did they need heroes he wondered what was wrong in people that they could not find what they needed within themselves how did they know helen was any better than the rest newssheets announced the complete rounding up of the members of the arms syndicate and the discovery of every nuclear cache left in existence that was one good thing the newsheets also said that order had been completely restored alan wondered on the surface perhaps it was true but what of the disorder that must still exist in the hearts and minds of most members of the public he reached the top and entered police headquarters after a few moments he was shown into chief sandais office mr powys there has been a general search out for you you and miss curtis are the heroes of the hour every laservid station and newssheet in the solar system has been after you in that case alan said coolly im glad they couldnt find me i want to see my grandfather chiefif thats possible of course he made a full confession you know hes been very subdued since his arresthasnt given us any trouble good well can i see him now not exactly every home comfort had been provided for simon powys but his room hardly looked like a prison cell with its pleasant view of the clear summer sky the cloudwreathed mountain peaks in the distance it was well furnished there were books writing materials and newssheets on the small desk by the window his grandfather was staring out at the mountains his chair pushed back from his desk when alan entered grandfather the old man turned and it was an old man who stared gauntly up at his grandson all the vitality had left him he seemed completely enervated hello alan glad to see you do sit down he gestured vaguely towards the only other chair in the room how do you feel alan asked inanely simon powys smiled thinly as well as can be expected he said how are you alan seated himself on the edge of the chair im sorry i had to do it grandfather but you know why it was necessary yes im glad in a way that you didthough i can hardly bear the shame i dont know if youll understand alan but i was insane in a way i was caught up in a nightmaremy ambition my hatred my schemes ran away with me do you know that when my fortunes turned after the fireclown business i seemed to be living in a dream thereafter i feel as if ive just woken up i remember i accused you of having none of the good powys blood i shouldnt have done that and im sorry but it seems you had better stuff in you than i ive always been conscious of my inherent weakness that i wasnt of the same breed as our ancestors but i always fought it alan i tried not to let it get the better of me it did of course but in a different way you didnt really hate the fireclown for anything he was doing did you alan spoke softly you hated him for loving my mother and giving her a sonme you knew he was manny bloom all the time yes simon powys sighed and stared out of the window again i knew he was manny bloom i was responsible for sending him on the saturn mission that was my first major mistake i suppose but i couldnt see my daughter marrying an ordinary spaceman however much of a hero he was in the public eye i didnt realize you were going to be born he was away for two years when he came back you were hereand your mother had killed herself killed herself i didnt know id told her manny bloom was deadkilled in a space accident i didnt expect those consequences of course that was the first death i was responsible for indirectly as minister for space transport i was in the perfect position to send manny bloom wherever i chose i bided my timethen i really did try to kill him what you mean the rocket that went too near the sun yes i bribed the technician responsible for the final checkhad him fix the steering rockets so that the ship would plunge into the sun i heard the ship had gone off course and i thought i was rid of him but somehow he survivedand he came back to haunt me as it were as the fireclown so you really created your own nemesis you caused my father to drift towards the sun and that experience resulted in his strange mental state ultimately he appeared as the fireclown and because of your hatred against him brought about your ruin without ever consciously wishing for vengeance against you simon powys nodded i appreciate the irony of it all he said if s one of the things ive been thinking about sitting here and waiting for my trial when is it to be they havent fixed it yet its going to be a big onewill probably take place after the presidential elections helen will be able to influence the judges then alan said shell probably try to get you the lightest possible sentence the lightest sentence would be death alan and that im afraid is outside even the presidents powers to exact alan remembered helens proposal to assassinate simon powys in many ways he thought everyone would have welcomed it it was painful to see this once respected and powerful man in such a wretched state no matter how much he deserved it simon powys got up extending his hand it was good of you to come alan i wonder if you would mind leaving now thisthis is somewhat hard to he broke off unable to express his shame yes of course alan went forward and shook simon powys hand the old man tried to make the grip firm but failed feeling considerably more affection for his grandfather than he had ever felt in the past alan left the cell left police headquarters and stood for a long time by a splashing fountain staring into the clear water and watching the darting goldfish swimming in the narrow confines of the pool did they understand just how narrow their little universe was he wondered they seemed happy enough if fish could be happy but if they werent happy he reflected neither were they sad they had no tradition but instinct no ritual but the quest for food and a mate he didnt envy them much chapter eighteen in the following weeks alan led a fairly solitary life taking little interest in the elections scarcely aware of the fact that helen was almost certain to win since there were no candidates in the field with her popularity denholm curtis who had played some part in the denunciation of powys was now the solrefs candidate for the office but he didnt stand much of a chance helen was busy but she had tried to contact him from time to time he would see her when he was ready the election date came the votes were counted helen was president the day after her election she came to see him and he let her in i thought you were angry with me she said as she accepted a drink i thought perhaps youd decided not to see me again i know youve had a bad series of emotional shocks alanbut i could have helped you i could have been some comfort surely i didnt need comfort helen i needed to be alone with myself and anyway you couldnt have afforded to waste time on meyou had problems of your own what do you propose to do now she couldnt disguise the fact that she was anxious ask you to marry me helen i accept she said thankfully i thought we all tend to see other peoples emotions as reflecting on ourselves its a mistake peoples emotions are rarely created by anyone else i think we might be happy dont you in spite of my work in spite of that yes i dont expect to see much of you for some time but maybe thats for the best a buzz began to sound on her wrist im sorry she smiled i get issued with this thingim on call as it were all the time i didnt expect it to start so soon she went to his laservid and pressed a number president curtis she said to the slightly perturbed looking man on the screen she put the drink down on the set madamethere is probably no danger but i have just received news that a strange spaceship has landed somewhere near algiers its believed to be the fireclowns no need for declaring a state of emergency now she smiled it will be good to see him again she switched out and turned to alan hes your fatherwant to be part of a deputation if its just the two of us yes come on then lets see what his experiments have proved before helen could go she was forced to leave notification of her whereabouts her presidential duties had not really begun as yet but from now on her time would never be her own in his new state of mind alan decided he could bear it so long as she only served one term the pimeson rested on its belly its pitted hull gleaming in the african sun as yet nothing had been heard from the ship it was as if it were empty bereft of life as their car settled beside it the huge airlock began to open but nothing else happened what now helen looked to alan for guidance lets go in he said leading the way over to the ship and clambering into the airlock on the big landing deck alan touched the stud operating the sliding wall it opened and they climbed into the control deck it was darkened no light passed the closed ports father alan spoke into the silence certain someone was here fireclown alan the voice was rumbling enigmatic thoughtful yesand helen curtis weve got something to tell you he was slightly amused at his decision to announce his engagement formally to his strange father a single light shone now from the corner alan could just make out the slumped bulk of the fireclown a short distance away cornelia fisher stirred corso seemed prone but alan thought he heard him mumble under his breath is anything wrong father no the fireclown raised his huge body up from the couch his gaudy tatters curled about him his conical hat still bobbed on his head and his face was still painted he chuckled i thought youd come here first i wouldnt have admitted anyone else helen and i are getting married father ah really the fireclown didnt sound very interested his manner had become if anything more detached and alien a lots been happening on earth sir helen put in since we last met youre no longer an outcast the fireclowns body shook with laughter which he at first suppressed and then let roll from his mouth in roaring gusts nolongeranoutcast ha ha ha good nonplussed alan glanced at helen who frowned back at him it is not i who am the outcast young ladynot in the cosmic sense it is the human race with their futile worthless intelligence i still dont understand helen said bewilderedly i took you to the heart of the suni took you even to the heart of the galaxy and you still failed to understand consciousness is not the same as intelligence consciousness is content to exist as it exists to be what it is and nothing more but intelligencethat is a blot on the cosmos in short i intend to wipe out that blot i intend to destroy intelligence destroy intelligence you mean destroy life in the solar system alan was horrified no my son nothing so unsubtle for one thing human life is the only culpritthe only thing that offends against the law of the universe i have journeyed throughout the galaxy and have found nothing like it anywhere else intelligence therefore is a weed in the garden of infinity a destroying weed that must be dealt with at once you are mad alan said desperately its impossible to destroy intelligence without destroying those who have it according to human logic that is true but according to my logicthe fireclowns logicthat is false i have perfected a kind of firetime fire call itwhich will burn away the minds of those it strikes without consuming them in body my time fire will destroy the ability to think because thought takes time the fireclown reached out his hand towards a stud and depressed it the wall hummed down he went over to the controls and began to operate them i waited for you to arrive because i still retain some human sentiment i did not want to make my son go with the rest i will convince you anon that i speak truth and you will agree with me you will want only consciousness alan strode towards his father and grasped his huge arm it cant workand even if it could who are you to take such a task upon yourself i am the fireclown the screen in front of them showed that the ship had once again set up its own peculiar field the spheres began to flash past see those the fireclown pointed they are chrononsatoms of time just as there are atoms of matter the same is true of time and i control those atoms as ably as the physicists control their electrons and protons they are the stuff of my time fire astounded alan could only believe his father he turned to corso who was opening his eyes a dazed look on his red face corso do you want any part of this stop him corneliathe woman stared at him blanklytell him to cease the fireclown put his painted bellowing face close to alans they cannot understand you they hear youbut they hear sound alone they are the first to gain from the time fire they are fully aware but they have no intelligence to mar their awareness oh god helen looked aghast at the blankfaced pair where are we going alan yelled at his insane father i intend to put the ship into a timefreeze then as the globe passes beneath me i will unleash the time fire covering the world with its healing flames p no father dont try to tamper with the controls alan if you do you will disrupt the time field and we might well perish the spheresthe chrononsflashed past alan stared at them fascinated in spite of the danger atoms of time he had heard the chronon theory before but had never believed it had any reality in fact but there was no other explanation he could think of for the fireclowns ability to ignore the laws of matter and venture into the suns heart travel swiftly through the galaxy to its center and remain unharmed unharmed bodily at least his mind had obviously been unable to stand up against the impressions it had seen faster and faster the chronons rolled past on the screen concentrating on his controls the fireclown ignored them what are we going to do alan helen said do you think hes right about this time fire yes look at corso and cornelia for proof he is a geniusbut hes an idiot as well weve got to stop him helen heaven knows what destruction he can workeven if it isnt as bad as he boasts how theres only one way destroy the controls we could be killedor frozen forever in this time freeze of his weve got to take the risk but what can you do weve no weapons nothing to destroy them with theres one thing we can do im going to grapple with him hes incredibly strong so i wont be able to hold him for long while i keep him occupied go to the control panel and press all the studs change the position of all the levers twist all the dials that should do something ready conscious that this might be the last time he saw her before they perished he gave her a long eloquent look she smiled he leaped at the fireclowns back and got his arm around his fathers thick neck the great arms went up and the hands closed over his wrists the fireclown shook him off ive spawned a fool you could cause us to slip into a time vortex we could never get out of alan grabbed the fireclowns legs and surprisingly though the clown was still a trifle offbalance pulled him down helen dashed towards the controls and began depressing studs and pulling levers no the fireclown raised himself on one elbow his other hand outstretched in a warning gesture the light began to fizz to change color rapidly the ship shuddered he was blinded by the glare his head ached he felt the fireclown move and flung himself at his father with a movement of his arm and body the fireclown shook him off again then the deck seemed to vanish and they seemed to hang in space all around him now alan saw the spheres whirling the great chronons each the size of the moon spun in a dazzling and random course the fireclown bellowed like a baleful bull from somewhere he heard helens voice shouting he could make no sense of their words he tried to move but his body was rigid would answer none of his commands then the chronons changed color and began to expand they burst a chaotic display of colored streamers smeared themselves all around him and dissipated swiftly alan tried to breathe but couldnt instead he sucked in water it took seconds for him to realize that he was under the sea he struggled upwards and at last reached the surface drew air into his lungs he was in the middle of an ocean no land in sight there was no evidence that a ship had crashed had it entered the water so smoothly that it hadnt made a ripple butanother thought camehe should have been in the ship how had he gotten out another head broke the surface he swam towards it the fireclown the paint streaked his face he was panting and cursing then helens head came up what happened alan gasped fatherwhat happened damn you you broke the time fieldive lost my ship overhead alan heard the drone of an aircar he looked up waving frantically it was an amphibian and it seemed to be looking for them it came down low and landed puzzled faces stared out of the cabin someone emerged on to the small flat deck and a line flashed out over the water alan caught it swam towards helen and handed it to her she was pulled swiftly in and once aboard the line was sent back alan handed it to the fireclown the man refused to take it automatically he kept himself afloat but his face had an expression of melancholic suffering take it father why should i what purpose do i fulfill by continuing to live i have failed impatiently alan tied the rope around the passive fireclown and watched the great bulk being towed in the fireclown made no move to release himself or help himself on to the deck alan took the line as it came out once again how did you know we were here he asked the vessels captain we saw a peculiar kind of explosion in this area we thought wed better investigate sorry it took us so long weve been circling over this area for three hours cant think how we missed you the first time three hours but alan stopped what time is it now the captain glanced at his chronometer fourteen hundred almost alan was about to ask the date but he decided against it it seemed that they had been deposited in the ocean exactly half an hour before they had entered the fireclowns ship but what had happened to the ship he asked the morose fireclown who had slumped himself moodily in a corner of the cabin i told youyou broke the time field what happened was simplewe existed in a different time location the ship in another the ship should make its appearance between now and the next million years p thereafter his father refused to answer further questions chapter nineteen the trial of simon powys and the trial of the fireclown were held at the same time but in different courts the laservid stations and the newssheets were torn between which should have most prominence the pimeson had been found intact in wyoming scientists had already stripped it of its time mechanisms and were investigating them the fireclown offered them no help when asked the relationship between the late protagonists came out and scandal blended with sensation to feed the newssheets and laservid networks simon powys was not very entertaining however he admitted all charges and was found guilty on all charges even the judge did not exercise that strange prerogative which judges seem to think themselves entitled tohis summing up contained no list of his personal biases it was quick and clean simon powys was banished to a confined bunk in one of the pressure domes in the asteroid belt the fireclown was more verbose his case harder to try since it had no precedent he could not be tried for his philosophical beliefs or even for his unique intentions to destroy intelligence the charge when it was finally decided read plotting to disrupt human society to a point where it could no longer function his long speeches in his defenseor rather in defense of his creedagreed with the charge i am the victim of crude intelligence he told the bewildered jury intelligence which has no business to exist in the universe i have been pulled down by it as it will pull down the human race in time i tried to help you but for all your vaunted minds you could not understand perish then in spirit set yourselves against the law of the universe your punishment will come soon enough and be well merited though still puzzled the jury decided the fireclowns own punishment soon enough they found him guilty but insane he would be sent to a mental hospital on ganymede meanwhile the scientists continued to puzzle over his bizarre equations and could arrive at no conclusion in time perhaps they would for once on the track they would never leave it for the time being public hysteria died down and society once again settled into an ordered existence helen curtis began to put her reforms to the assembly and they were accepted or rejected after discussion progress would be slow and would always follow behind the demands of the reformers but at least in this manner it might retain its dynamism helen was comparatively satisfied their wedding date was fixed and then came the final drama alan once more looking for a job scanned the list of specialist agencies and sipped coffee the laservid buzzed and he switched it to receive helens face appeared on the screen alanthe fireclowns escaped he put down his cup with a clatter what how you know how strong he was he overpowered a guard got hold of his gun and held up the entire police headquarters he made them release uncle simon and they left in a stolen police car together where have they gone we dont know im coming over are you at the house yes when he reached the presidential apartments helen and some of her advisers were staring at the huge wallscreen a commentary boomed our cameras have succeeded in tracking the escaping spaceship pimeson containing convicts manny bloom better known as the fireclown and simon powys deep space the ship in clear focus the ship degutted of its weird time devices but retaining its ordinary drive has so far outdistanced all pursuers that answers my question alan said from behind helen where are they going they seem to be heading for venus they could just about survive there and certainly escape the police the revitalization project is twothirds complete a strange pair to be traveling together helen reflected theyve got things in common alan pointed out in their different ways they were both reactionary idealists they wanted things simpler than they in fact are the ship passed venus where in the universe are they heading for helen said baffled alan thought he knew he watched helplessly as the ship carrying his father and grandfather plunged on perhaps its for the bestfor them and for us he whispered the pimeson passed the orbit of mercury they watched as it wheeled and sailed in towards the sun it vanished consumed almost immediately as it followed its unveering course into the heart of sol the watchers were silent helen turned her face up towards alan and studied his expression she glanced back at the screen in a few short weeks a new age had come to earth and gone as swiftly it had left a strange mood behind itand perhaps a new science sociologists and psychologists attempted to explain the sudden ebb of hysteria that had seized the people there were a dozen theories all complex all with their merits one attempted to explain it as the result of the transition period between natural living and artificial living it concluded that until the artificial became the natural and human psychology altered accordingly we should experience many such disturbances it was a likely explanation but there might have been another far simpler explanation perhaps the world had just beenbored the end
