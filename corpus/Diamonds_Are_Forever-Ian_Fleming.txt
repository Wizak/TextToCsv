 chapter one the beginning of the pipeline the large bush stood in the moonlight at the meeting place of three african countries the man from the diamond mines had waited under the bush for nearly two hours suddenly he heard the noise of a helicopter he looked up and saw it coming towards him from the east he waited when the helicopter was just above the ground an arm came out a torch switched on and off dotdash the morse code for the letter a the diamond smuggler flashed back b and c and the helicopter came down safely after a few moments its engine was silent the pilot opened the door and climbed down to the ground the other man walked across to him youre late again he said i had engine problems said the pilot well if youve got it lets have it the man from the diamond mines reached into his shirt and took out a packet he gave it to the pilot the pilot dropped the packet into the pocket of his shirt things are getting difficult at the mines said the diamond smuggler a man has come from london his names sillitoe the diamond corporation has sent him some of my men are afraid one day one of them is going to talk do you want me to tell this to abc asked the pilot yes said the other man they must know about sillitoe our mines are losing more than two million pounds a year because of smuggling the corporation wants the government to stop it and that means stop me what do you want asked the pilot more money yes answered the diamond smuggler twenty per cent more ill pass the message on to dakar said the pilot if theyre interested theyll send it on to london but dont push them too hard already three men have died in the last twelve months in accidents two were stealing diamonds from the packets the other man tried to run away for a moment the two men looked silently at each other in the moonlight then the pilot climbed up into the helicopter ill see you in a month he said the diamond smuggler watched the helicopter fly away to the east with it went the diamonds which would be sold for one hundred thousand pounds his men had stolen them from the mines during the past month the diamond smuggler got on his motorcycle and rode off towards sierra leone he rode fast towards the hills away from the great bush where the pipeline for the richest diamond smuggling operation in the world began and the end five thousand miles away around the necks of rich women chapter two james bond secret agent commander james bond of the british secret service picked up the diamond from the desk and held it in front of the desk lamp he was a tall handsome man with blue eyes and dark hair he wore an expensive dark blue suit and a white shirt bond looked carefully at the diamond it was a carat and its many colours shone brightly in the light its beautiful bond said m head of the british secret service moved his hand towards a pile of paper packets on the desk in front of him he opened a packet and pushed it across to bond what youre looking at is the best a fine bluewhite he said for the next fifteen minutes m showed bond many different kinds of diamonds finally he sat back in his chair he looked worried ninety per cent of all diamond sales happen here in london he said its big business fifty million pounds a year but two million pounds worth of diamonds are being smuggled out of africa every year we think theyre going to america to american gangs of criminals why dont the mining companies stop it theyve tried but they cant and the government thinks that the problem is too big for a lot of separate mining companies said m theres a big packet of smuggled stones in london at the moment theyre waiting to go to america special branch know the name of the carrier whos going to take them there they also know whos going to be watching him why dont special branch or mis stop them asked bond because that wont stop the smuggling replied m the carriers never talk and they probably know nothing important they get the diamonds from a man here then hand them to another man when they get to the other side we need to follow the pipeline to america and see where it goes over there and the fbi wont be much help to us its a very small part of their fight with the big gangs have you heard of the house of diamonds yes said bond the big american jewellers theyre on west th street in new york and the rue de rivoli in paris theyve got a small place in london too said m in hatton garden they were once very big buyers at the monthly sales of the diamond corporation now theyre buying less and less but theyre selling more and more so where are they getting their diamonds their main man in london is rufus b saye what do we know about him asked bond not much said m he has lunch every day at the american club in piccadilly doesnt drink or smoke lives at the savoy hotel so what do you want me to do asked bond m looked at his watch you have a meeting with ronnie vallance at scotland yard in an hour hes going to put you into the pipeline in the place of the carrier and then said bond and then youre going to smuggle those diamonds into america said m youre going to be facing the mafia and their american gangs james and youll be on your own chapter three the house of diamonds at two oclock bond was looking at two photographs in the office of assistant commissioner vallance of scotland yard they showed a darkhaired handsome young man hes peter franks said vallance you look a bit like him similar enough to fool someone whos only got his description he stupidly talked about this job to a girl in a soho club the girl was secretly working for us she immediately told us about it franks had been contacted by a friend of a friend and agreed to do a smuggling job to america for five thousand dollars my girl asked him if he had the diamonds he said no but that his next job was to contact the guard when asked bond five oclock tomorrow evening in her room at the trafalgar palace hotel a girl called case she was going to tell him what to do and go to america with him do these smugglers usually go in pairs asked bond yes the person carrying the diamonds is never fully trusted said vallance he got up from his desk and started to walk up and down the room the diamonds certainly come from africa probably from sierra leone where our friend sillitoe is investigating then the stones may get out through liberia or french guinea then into france and because this packet has arrived in london we think that london is part of the pipeline too vallance stopped walking and turned to bond we know that this packet is on its way to america but what happens there we dont know how was this five thousand dollars to be paid to peter franks who by we need answers to these questions you need to get past the man who pays you you need to go further up the pipeline towards the big men ok said bond were going to get franks this evening said vallance then you can make contact with miss case does she know anything about franks only his description and his name said vallance she probably wont even know the man who contacted him everybody does just one job its safer that way if something goes wrong what do you know about the woman asked bond age twentyseven she was born in san francisco shes not married shes been over here twelve times in the last three years maybe more often using a different name she always stays at the trafalgar palace the hotel detective says that she doesnt go out much she never stays more than two weeks youll need to have a good story about why youre doing this job bond thought for a moment what about this house of diamonds i checked on saye said vallance american age fortyfive diamond merchant he goes to paris a lot once a month for the last three years hes probably got a girl there go and have a look at the place and at him he picked up one of the phones on his desk send up dankwaerts he said into it and lobiniere then get me the house of diamonds on the telephone vallance walked across to the window and looked out after a moment there was a knock at the door a small man came in he had a pale face and he was wearing glasses good afternoon sergeant said vallance this is commander bond of the ministry of defence i want you to take him to the house of diamonds in hatton garden hell be sergeant james youll see mr saye the top man there youll say that you think the diamonds from that ascot robbery are on their way to argentina through america youll ask saye if hes heard anything about them from his new york office any questions no sir said sergeant dankwaerts a moment later another man came into the room he was carrying a small case good afternoon sergeant lobiniere said vallance come and look at my friend the sergeant stood close to bond and looked very carefully at his face for a minute who is he going to be sir he asked vallance sergeant james one of sergeant dankwaerts men only for three hours all right lobiniere took bond to a chair by the window and opened his case for the next ten minutes he worked on bonds face and hair bond listened to vallance speak to the house of diamonds on the telephone two of my men will be calling at pm vallance was saying theyll need no more than ten minutes of mr sayes time yes thank you goodbye lobiniere held up a pocket mirror in front of bond bond looked into it and he saw someone who certainly didnt look like james bond the waiting room at the house of diamonds was quiet except for the sound of a wall clock there was a thick red carpet on the floor in the centre was a round table and six armchairs bond guessed that they had cost at least a thousand pounds bond and sergeant dankwaerts sat in armchairs and waited silently dankwaerts was reading a copy of the diamond news suddenly the door opened and a big dark man stepped in and looked quickly at each of them my name is saye he said in a cold voice what do you want dankwaerts walked round saye and closed the door behind him im sergeant dankwaerts of the special branch of scotland yard he said calmly this is sergeant james were looking for information on the theft of some diamonds you may be able to help us while dankwaerts told his story bond looked carefully at mr saye he was a large man with a square face and short black hair his lips were a thin straight line he wore a black suit white shirt and a thin black tie bond decided that saye was a hard coldhearted man and these are the stones were interested in dankwaerts was finishing his story have any of them come through your company here or in new york no they havent said saye he turned and opened the door behind him now good afternoon gentlemen and he walked out of the room some minutes later dankwaerts was driving towards bonds flat near the kings road did you get what you wanted sir he asked bond im not sure exactly what i wanted said bond but i was glad to have a look at rufus b saye he doesnt look like a diamond merchant hes not a diamond merchant sir said dankwaerts smiling i read out a list of missing stones i mentioned a yellow premier and two cape unions yes there are no diamonds with those names and saye didnt know that chapter four tiffany case bond knocked on the door of room of the trafalgar palace hotel come in said a womans voice he walked into the small living room and shut the door behind him lock it said the voice it came from the bedroom bond locked the door and walked across to the middle of the room past the bedroom door sit down said the voice bond smiled and sat in an armchair next to a desk he could just see her through the open door she was getting dressed after a few minutes tiffany case came out of the bedroom she was very beautiful with blonde hair and blue eyes she was dressed in a black suit and a green shirt she wore an expensive gold watch on her arm and a large diamond ring on the third finger of her right hand so youre peter franks she said im tiffany case why did you decide to do this job they told me that you were a burglar i am said bond something went wrong on a job there was an argument and a person died and now you want to leave the country she said thats right and i need the money where are you going to carry the stones she asked do you have any ideas i thought perhaps the handles of a suitcase would be a good place said bond yes no because the customs men think the same thing she said do you play golf yes said bond which golf balls do you use she took a piece of paper and a pen from the desk theyre called dunlop s said bond ok have you got a passport she asked i have said bond but it uses my real name james bond she looked at him for a moment then said its not important now listen youre going over to america to see a man called michael tree his friends call him shady tree now this is your story hes an american friend of yours and you met him in europe ok ok said bond youll stay at the astor hotel in new york she walked to the desk and opened a drawer she took out a small packet and gave it to bond theres about five hundred pounds in there she said get a room here in london at the ritz hotel buy a good used suitcase and pack your golfing holiday clothes get your golf clubs then buy a ticket for the thursday evening monarch flight to new york a car will come for you at on thursday evening the driver will give you the golf balls all right said bond dont think you can trick us and take the diamonds the driver will stay with you until your bags go on the plane and ill be at london airport what happens in new york asked bond another driver will meet you and tell you what to do next if anything goes wrong at customs you know nothing could we meet in new york said bond smiling he liked this girl and she could help him to get further up the pipeline she looked at him then looked away well i suppose we could have dinner friday night if the job goes ok meet me at eight oclock at the twentyone club on nd street now ive got things to do she walked towards the door bond followed her youll be all right she said just stay away from me on the plane she opened the door and bond walked out of the room see you at the twentyone club he said she closed the door behind him and waited to hear his footsteps go away twenty minutes later tiffany case walked into charing cross railway station she went to one of the telephone boxes and dialled a number after the usual two rings she heard the click of the automatic recorder taking the call for twenty seconds she heard nothing then the voice of her boss who she did not know said speak she spoke quickly case to abc the carriers real name is james bond hell use that name on his passport he plays golf and will carry golf clubs i suggest we use golf balls he uses dunlop s ill call again later this evening she put down the phone in a rented room somewhere in london the recorder stopped a door opened and closed footsteps went softly down some stairs and out into an unknown street and away chapter five a bad traveller it was six oclock on thursday evening bond was packing his suitcase in his bedroom at the ritz his tickets and passport went into a smaller case which had been prepared for him by special branch there was a narrow secret space at the back of the case this held a silencer for his gun and thirty rounds of ammunition the telephone rang it was the girl at the hotel desk she said a man from universal export has a letter for you mr bond a few minutes later bond opened the door to a man from headquarters he gave a large envelope to bond i have to wait and take this back after you read the note inside sir he said bond sat at the writing desk and began to read the note was from m washington reports that rufus b saye is jack spang a possible gangster he is twin brother to seraffimo spang together they control the spangled mob a group working in america the spang brothers bought the house of diamonds five years ago they also own the tiara hotel in las vegas this hotel is the headquarters of seraffimo spang washington also reports that spangled mob buy and sell drugs this business is looked after by michael shady tree a criminal known to the police the gang has other headquarters in miami detroit and chicago the spangled mob is one of the biggest gangs in the united states if your job takes you into a dangerous meeting with the gang report at once to headquarters we will then give the job to the fbi this is an order bond finished reading then put the note into one of the ritz envelopes he gave it to the man from headquarters after the man had left bond walked across to the window and looked out across green park give the job to the fbi m would hate to ask the fbi to finish a job a dangerous meeting would be something for bond to decide about he remembered some of his enemies from the past he was sure that these gangsters could not be as dangerous as them or could they he remembered the hard cold eyes of rufus b saye well he would have a look at the brother seraffimo bond looked at his watch pm he put his right hand under his coat and took out the beretta automatic gun he checked the gun carefully then put it back in the holster under his coat the telephone rang your cars here sir the voice told him the large black car was standing outside the ritz hotel the driver put bonds two cases and golf clubs in the back of the car he told bond to sit in the front passenger seat as they drove through piccadilly he looked at his driver the mans eyes were hidden behind black sunglasses and he was cold and professional after a time the car stopped at the side of the road the driver reached under his seat and took out a box of new golf balls he got out of the car and opened the back door he opened the pocket on bonds golf bag carefully he put the six new golf balls into the pocket with the old ones already there then he climbed back into the front seat and they drove on at london airport bonds bags went through customs without problems tiffany case came into the departure lounge a few minutes after bond there were about forty other passengers but there was nobody that bond recognized except tiffany case he looked round were two of the passengers watching him they looked like american businessmen one of them was a young man with white hair the other was fat and had a pale face bond heard them ask for double brandies at the bar the fat man took some pills from his pocket and put one into his mouth then he drank some brandy he had a small case with some writing printed on it it said mr w winter my blood group is p a bad traveller thought bond he slept through most of the flight chapter six shady tree bond and his bags went through customs easily at new yorks idlewild airport a porter took his suitcase and golf clubs and followed him through the airport bond was near the exit doors when he heard his name mr bond i have a car for you bond turned to see a tall man with a narrow face and mean looking eyes they walked outside into the hot earlymorning sun bond saw something square in the mans trouser pocket it was about the size and shape of a small gun the car was a black oldsmobile sedan bond climbed into the front seat he did not wait to be told where to sit the porter put his suitcase and golf bag in the back they drove through the traffic to manhattan the car stopped in west th street the diamond district of new york they were outside a smartlooking shop with the name house of diamonds above the door bond took his small case and reached for the golf clubs ill take those said the driver you take the suitcase bond followed the driver to a small door at the side of the shop inside was a man in a porters room can we leave the bags with you the driver asked him sure said the man theyll be ok here the driver waited for bond to get into the lift the driver carried the golf bag over his shoulder and they went up to the fourth floor in silence the driver knocked on a door opposite the lift and opened it bond followed him inside a man with bright red hair and a big moonshaped face was sitting at a desk he stood up as they came in he was a hunchback he walked slowly round bond then stood in front of him and looked up into his face bond looked calmly back at the hunchback seeing the big ears the halfopen mouth and the short strong arms the hunchbacks voice was sharp and high london tells me that you have killed a man mr bond i believe them would you like to do more work for us perhaps answered bond how much do you pay the hunchback laughed then turned to the driver rocky get those balls out of the bag and cut them open he quickly shook his arm and a knife appeared from the arm of his coat and dropped into his hand a throwing knife thought bond and hes fast the hunchback sat down behind his desk again rocky took the knife and put the six new golf balls on the desk he cut one of them open and put it on the desk the hunchback took out three uncut diamonds the driver went on with his work until bond had counted eighteen stones on the desk if the stones were good quality they could be sold for about one hundred thousand pounds after cutting ok rocky said the hunchback take the golf clubs and this mans bags to the astor hotel hes staying there send them up to his room after the driver had left bond sat in a chair opposite the hunchback he lit a cigarette now if you are happy id like my five thousand dollars bond said the hunchback slowly moved the diamonds in front of him into a circle he looked up at bond you will be paid he said and you may get more than five thousand dollars but youll get the money yourself because its safer it is very dangerous for a man to suddenly have a lot of money he talks about it and spends it without being careful then the police catch him and ask him where it all came from he hasnt got an answer right ok said bond how do i get the five thousand dollars ill tell you a story said the hunchback today you met your friend mr tree thats me you knew me in england in just after the war ok ok said bond i owed you money for a card game that we had at the savoy hotel in london right when we met today i paid you so now you have one thousand dollars heres the money the hunchback took ten one hundreddollar notes from his pocket and pushed them across the desk bond put them in his coat pocket you decide to go and see some horse racing in saratoga continued the hunchback you put a bet on a horse and win another four thousand dollars now you have five thousand dollars now if anybody asks where did it come from you have answers maybe the horse will lose the race said bond it wont the hunchback smiled good said bond id like to stay away from england for a while do you need any extra help the hunchback looked silently at bond maybe he said after a few moments phone me after the race this is my number write it down wisconsin and write this down too fourth race on tuesday the perpetuities stakes put your bet on shy smile to win hes a big horse with a white face and white feet chapter seven felix leiter bond went down in the lift and out into the street he walked towards times square after a few minutes bond became sure that someone was following him he looked back but there was nobody suddenly moving into a shop nobody quickly putting up a newspaper to hide their face bond turned right into the avenue of americas and stopped inside the entrance of the first shop he saw suddenly he felt something hard holding his right arm and a voice said relax mr bond dont move or youll have bullets for lunch he felt something hard push into his side had he heard this voice before he looked down to see a metal hook holding his right arm moving fast bond tried to hit the man behind him but the man caught his arm and stopped him then came a laugh and a voice said sorry james youre caught bond turned to see the smiling face of felix leiter you were in front of me said bond he smiled back at the american secret agent the last time bond had seen him felix had been lying on a bed in a pool of blood in a florida hotel what are you doing here said bond come on you can buy me lunch and tell me ok said leiter he put his metal hook into the righthand pocket of his coat and took bonds arm with his left hand lets go to sardis its across the street they went upstairs in the famous actors and writers restaurant leiter walked slowly and with some difficulty bond saw that his right arm and left leg were false and there were small marks above his right eye the waiter came and leiter ordered a dry martini for bond bond smiled leiter had remembered his favourite drink leiters smile was warm but his eyes were watching bond carefully tell me whats your business with shady tree bond drank his martini and lit a cigarette you tell me something first felix he said are you still working for the cia no said leiter when i lost my gun hand they could only give me desk work so i work for pinkertons detective agency now im a private

each other ill tell you why i was near shady trees offices i think i know said bond youre interested in someone with a white face and four white feet hes called shy smile thats right said leiter hes racing at saratoga on tuesday im going to bet one thousand dollars on him and hes going to win said bond its my pay for another job i brought a big packet of uncut diamonds in by plane this morning for mr spang and his friends why are you interested in the horse because the horse that looks like shy smile is really a fast horse called pickapepper the real shy smile was a slow horse and didnt win races they shot him dont tell me said bond pickapeppers also got a white face and four white feet right said leiter and theyve done a good job with any other small differences they started planning this more than a year ago theyre going to make a lot of money its a very big race what are you going to do about it asked bond i dont know i need to think about it said leiter lets drive to saratoga together on sunday we can both stay at a quiet place i know the sagamore motel and meet in the evenings good idea said bond now lets order some lunch and ill tell you my story he finished the story when they were drinking coffee and we think that the spangs are smuggling the diamonds and that the house of diamonds is selling them i dont know much about jack spang said leiter but ive heard about tiffany case her mother owned a cheap hotel in san francisco one day she decided not to pay money to the local gangsters some nights later they arrived and broke doors furniture and everything else in the place then they attacked tiffany it was bad she was only sixteen years old thats terrible said bond angrily next day she ran away she had several jobs dancer waitress until she was about twenty then she moved to florida and started drinking too much alcohol one day a boy fell into the sea and tiffany jumped in and saved him her name was in the newspapers some rich woman gave her somewhere to live and helped her to stop drinking she took tiffany around the world but tiffany left her when they got to san francisco she went to live with her mother for a short time then moved down to reno she met seraffimo there and he gave her a job at the tiara casino in las vegas shes been there for the last year or two she goes to europe in between i suppose i like her said bond he looked at his watch i need some sleep im staying at the astor hotel where shall we meet on sunday morning outside the plaza hotel at nine oclock said leiter youve got a dangerous job james be careful all american gangsters are bad but these spangled boys are some of the worst chapter eight a warning from tiffany the waiter at the twentyone club brought the martinis with pieces of lemon peel as bond had ordered tiffany put a cigarette in her mouth and bond lit it for her for a moment their eyes met and bond could read a message i like you her eyes seemed to say but be kind i dont want to be hurt any more another waiter came to their table with caviar and champagne im going to las vegas tomorrow said tiffany im taking the train to chicago then to los angeles what about you im going up to saratoga said bond to bet on a horse and make some money i suppose its a fixed race said tiffany there was no smile in her eyes now you seem to be popular with shady he wants you to work with the mob bond hated lying to this girl but it was necessary good he said but who is the mob he lit a cigarette and felt her watching him closely after a moment she said its called the spangled mob two brothers called spang i work for one of them in las vegas nobody seems to know where the other one is some say that hes in europe and then theres somebody called abc when im working with diamonds all the orders come from him the brother i work for is seraffimo spang hes more interested in gambling and racehorses then theres shady he looks after the drug business and other things there are other men gangsters theyre tough youll meet them then she added unkindly im sure youll like them its just another job said bond angrily ive got to earn some money there are lots of other ways she said just think very carefully before you work for our little gang this diamond game looks easy said bond why dont we just go on doing it together two or three jobs a year will give us good money these people arent fools said tiffany she was angry with him ive never had the same carrier twice and im not the only guard also i think that they had someone watching us on the plane they check and double check everything they do ive never even seen abc i just phone a number in london to get my orders you have no idea do you some time later they went out into the hot night and got a taxi im staying at the astor too said tiffany bond said nothing he looked out of the taxi window he wanted to say to her come with me i like you dont be frightened but bond couldnt he had a job to do at the astor hotel they took the lift to the fifth floor bond followed her to the door of her room she turned angrily and started to say listen you bond person but she stopped and looked into his eyes he saw that she was crying suddenly she put her arms round him and her face next to his look after yourself james she said i dont want to lose you she kissed him long and hard on the lips then she turned quickly and went into her room and shut the door behind her chapter nine a fast horse on saturday bond stayed in his hotel room for most of the day and wrote a report to send to london the diamond pipeline began somewhere near jack spang also known as rufus b saye it ended with seraffimo spang the stones came to shady tree then they went into the house of diamonds for cutting and selling someone known as abc seemed to be the big boss he was probably in london bond would try to get further up the pipeline using tiffany case he wrote the report in code at nine oclock on sunday morning a black studebaker car stopped outside the plaza hotel bond was waiting there with his suitcase he threw it onto the back seat and climbed in next to leiter its about two hundred miles said leiter as they drove out of the city there was a straight empty road in front of them leiter pushed his right foot down to the floor suddenly bond was thrown back into his seat he looked at the speedometer eighty ninety ninetyfive miles an hour not bad for a studebaker said bond leiter looked at bond and smiled this isnt a normal studebaker at they found a place to stop for lunch leiter told bond about saratoga its a spa town he said for eleven months of the year its very quiet people sometimes come to go in the waters or to have mudbaths but thats all then for one month august it goes crazy its probably the best race meeting in america and the place is full of rich people a lot of the racehorse owners are gangsters like the spangs sometimes they fix a race the spangs hope to get fifty thousand dollars from the shy smile race they finished their lunch and drove on bond slept for a short time when he opened his eyes they were entering saratoga there seemed to be horses everywhere crossing the streets walking along the sides of the roads coming out of lorries horse trainers and jockeys talked on street corners leiter left bond at the sagamore motel just outside town they agreed to meet only at night or by accident at the races well visit the racetrack early tomorrow if shy smile is there leiter told bond ill know about this and a lot more after an evening at the tether its an allnight restaurant and bar most of the criminals of the racing world go there at the motel bond paid thirty dollars for three days and got a key to room he had a shower dressed then walked down the road there was a restaurant on the corner and he ate a chicken dinner afterwards he bought a saratogian newspaper he saw that t bell would be riding shy smile in the perpetuities race soon after ten oclock felix leiter knocked softly on the door of bonds room and came in bond was lying on the bed leiter sat down in an armchair and took out a cigarette we get up at five oclock tomorrow morning said leiter theyll be timing shy smile at am i want to see whos there the owner of the horse is pissaro hes one of the directors of the tiara casino in las vegas the jockey is tingaling bell hes a good rider but hes not always honest when hes

two men drove to the racetrack they walked through the trees to the white fence round the track the earlymorning air was wonderfully cool and the sun was beginning to come out three men came through the trees one of them was leading a large horse the animal had a white face and white feet dont look too interested in them warned leiter turn round and watch the line of other horses coming up the track ill watch our friends bond turned and looked away a man is leading out shy smile said leiter and theres budd and pissaro its a nicelooking horse the man is getting on him now the gangsters have got their watches out theyve seen us but dont worry when the horse starts moving they wont be interested in us ok you can turn round now james shy smile is on the other side of the track theyre watching him through their binoculars bond saw the two men with binoculars they had watches in their hands hes started leiter said faraway bond could see a brown horse moving fast round the top of the track they watched him turn and come towards them horse and rider came quickly round the corner in front of bond and leiter and on towards the watching men then the horse was past them and bonds eyes moved to the two men he saw them look at their watches to check the time that the horse had taken leiter touched bond on the arm and they walked back to their car he ran well said leiter faster than the real shy smile could run if he moves like that hell win lets get some breakfast james then im going to see tingaling bell after breakfast bond spent some time at the racetrack later he had lunch then he watched and put bets on the afternoon races it was a beautiful day and by the end of the afternoon he had won fifteen dollars he walked back to the motel and had a shower then he found a restaurant and had dinner afterwards he walked over to the sales ring and watched racehorses bought and sold after a time bond heard a small noise from the seat behind him it was leiter he sat forward and spoke quietly in bonds ear its done he said its cost three thousand dollars but tingaling will do it see you in the morning james bond didnt look round but went on watching the sales after a while he walked slowly back to the motel he thought about shy smile who wasnt the real shy smile and about tingaling bell who was being paid to lose the race hes playing a very dangerous game thought bond chapter ten the race bond sat high up in the grandstand and watched shy smiles owner through binoculars pissaro was at a table in the grandstand restaurant not far below bond rosy budd sat opposite him there was half an hour to wait before the perpetuities race started shy smile was horse number ten he was the bottom horse in the betting the two favourites to win were come again and pray action bond put down his binoculars and remembered what leiter had told him earlier that day leiter had gone to see bell and had told him that he was a private detective i know about shy smile who is really pickapepper leiter had said to bell if you win ill tell everyone what really happened youll never ride a racehorse again tingaling or you can win the race but be disqualified knock into the horse nearest to you and stop him winning do that and ill give you one thousand dollars now and another two thousand after the race a frightened bell had agreed but he wanted the two thousand dollars to be given to him at the acme mud and sulphur baths he went there every evening after the races at six oclock bond had the two thousand dollars in his pocket if shy smile got disqualified and lost the race he would go to the acme baths at six oclock and meet bell when it was time the fiorses came down to the starting place first came number one come again a big black horse then came pray action a fastlooking grey horse the big brown horse with a white face and white feet was behind all the other horses a nervouslooking tingaling bell sat on his back the horses came to the starting gate and bond watched the race through binoculars a bell sounded and they moved quickly away shy smile number ten was close to the fence horse number five was just in front come again and pray action came along next to him shy smile was behind them round the corner and now come again was at the front and shy smile was fourth down the long straight part of the racecourse and shy smile and pray action rushed past number five shy smile was almost next to the front horse now pray action and shy smile were side by side together moving quickly away from the others coming to the last corner racing towards the finish there was a camera filming the race bond stopped breathing now now he thought do it now pray action was nearest the white fence tingaling bell moved shy smile nearer to him tingaling looked away so that he could not see the grey horse next to him suddenly shy smiles head hit pray actions head he pushed pray action towards the fence pray actions jockey stood up and had to slow his horse down angry shouts came from the crowd now shy smile was in front going faster faster moments later tingaling bell took him past the finishing post he had won or had he very clever riding tingaling thought bond some minutes after the end of the race a voice came over the loudspeaker attention please number ten shy smile has been disqualified number three pray action is the winner bond smiled and walked towards the bar chapter eleven mud baths the small red bus had the words acme mud and sulphur baths on its side it went down a short hill towards a group of dirty grey buildings a tall yellow chimney stood up from the centre black smoke came from the chimney the bus stopped by the baths there was a seat near the entrance under some deadlooking trees bond sat there for a few minutes trying to prepare himself he was not happy he did not like the look of the place and he did not like what was going to happen to him inside but after a few more moments he went inside the bad smell of sulphur was strong a woman sat behind a desk reading a paperback book she looked up yes id like a bath said bond mud or sulphur asked the woman mud said bond he paid for a ticket at the back of the room were two doors one said mud the other sulphur bond went through the mud door he found himself in a long room with a window in the roof and changing rooms along the walls it was hot and steamy in the room two men sat at a table playing cards they were naked except for towels around their waists they looked up at bond ticket one of the men asked bond gave him his ticket and the man gave him a key for one of the changing rooms he pointed at the door at the end of the room the baths are through there the man said there was nothing in the changing room except a thin towel bond took off his clothes and put the towel round his waist he pushed the money into his coat pocket then he walked out and locked the changing room door behind him he went through the door at the end of the room a large black man with no hair met him on the other side follow me said the black man the room was square and grey and there were long tables against the walls on each table was a heavy wooden box like a coffin it had a wooden top that covered most of the box mens hot wet faces showed above the sides of most coffins bond followed the black man to a wooden seat next to two shower rooms bond sat on the seat and the man went across to an empty coffin he put a sheet into it next he went to the middle of the room and got two buckets they were filled with hot brown mud he poured mud into the empty coffin until the bottom was full he left it to cool and went to a bath full of ice from this he took several wet towels then walked round the room at each coffin he stopped to put a cold towel around the head of the redfaced man inside when he had finished he walked across to the empty coffin ok he said to bond the man took bonds towel and key bond climbed into the coffin and lay down in the hot mud the man put a cold towel under bonds head then took one of the buckets of hot mud he put the mud all over bonds body when he had finished only bonds face and a very small part of his body round his heart was white the man then pulled the sheet round bond until bond could only move his fingers and his head he felt like a trapped animal twenty minutes the man said to bond he closed the lid it was six oclock bond was uncomfortable and hot at three minutes past six the door opened and tingaling bell came into the room the black man came across and put a towel around bonds head it felt wonderfully cold the jockey climbed into a coffin in front of bond the black man covered him in mud and put the sheet round him then he shut the lid over tingalings body bond closed his eyes how was he going to give tingaling the money in the changing room after the bath on the way out in the bus ok nobody move it was a hard frightening voice and came from the doorway bond opened his eyes the door to the room was open and a man stood by it another man walked quickly into the middle of the room they both carried guns and had black hoods over their heads there were holes cut in the hoods for their eyes and mouths wheres the jockey the man in the middle of the room asked he moved across the room and hit the black man with his gun the black man afraid pointed the man with the gun walked towards tingaling when he went past bond he stopped and looked for a few seconds then he moved over to the jockey hello tingaling he said coldly whats wrong the jockeys voice was high and frightened wrong said the man with the gun maybe youve never heard of a horse called shy smile maybe you werent there when he was disqualified this afternoon the jockey started to cry softly it it wasnt my fault boss it was an accident my friends think that it wasnt an accident the man put the gun to the jockeys head they found a thousand dollars hidden in your room where did it come from ive saved it cried tingaling its all the money ive got the man took the gun away youve been riding too much tingaling you need a rest in a hospital maybe he walked across and picked up one of the buckets of hot mud and walked back the jockey started shouting no no as the hot brown mud came out of the bucket and onto his head when it was empty the man threw the bucket across the room dont call the police he said as he walked to the door he laughed and pointed at tingalings coffin youd better get him out before he begins to cook still laughing the two men went out of the room sometime later felix leiter was sitting in bonds room at the motel what happened next he asked the two ticket men came running in said bond they took the lid off tingalings box and pulled off the sheet then they carried him to the shower he was half dead and all of his face was burned describe the two gunmen said leiter the man by the door was small and thin said bond the other man was big and fat he had a

building at las vegas a voice said are you going to the tiara bond turned and saw a short heavy man with large brown eyes yes said bond ok lets go bond followed him to his car it was a taxi he threw his suitcase onto the back seat and climbed in after it they drove out of the airport im ernie cureo said the driver im a friend of felix leiter he told me to look after you are you staying long maybe for a few days said bond after driving for some time the wide road went on through lines of coloured lights and signs until they were in downtown las vegas the sun was uncomfortably hot were coming into the famous strip now said cureo after a minute or two here are all the big hotels and casinos thats the flamingo and thats the sands and heres the desert inn and the sahara over there is the thunderbird and across the road is the tiara he slowed down and stopped outside the spang hotel i guess you know all about mr spang said cureo i know a little said bond you can tell me the rest another time ok said cureo i am sure youll be safe on your first night bond had lunch next to the tiaras big swimming pool then went to his room it was very comfortable with expensive furniture a radio and a television he slept for four hours during this time a secret wirerecorder under the table next to the bed recorded complete silence when bond woke up it was seven oclock the wirerecorder heard him phone the hotel desk i want to speak to miss tiffany case a pause then all right please tell her that mr james bond called the recorder heard him move about the room it heard the noise of the shower and at pm it heard the noise of the key in the lock when he went out and shut the door half an hour later the recorder heard a knock on the door a man wearing a waiters uniform came into the room with a bowl of fruit there was a note with it from the hotel manager the man walked quickly to the table by the bed and removed the wire from the recorder he put a new wire in the machine then he put the fruit on the table and went out and closed the door for several hours after that the wirerecorder heard nothing bond sat in the tiara bar and slowly drank a martini has mr spang been in tonight he asked the barman i havent seen him said the barman he usually comes in about eleven oclock bond walked across to the blackjack tables he stopped at the centre table the table where he was going to sit at ten oclock it was now eight players sat round the table opposite the dealer the dealer was about forty years old he dealt two cards into the eight numbered spaces on the table in front of the bets the bets were mostly five or ten silver dollars or counters worth twenty dollars nobody spoke the waitresses moved around in the space inside the circle of tables from this space two toughlooking men with guns at their waists watched the tables and players carefully bond watched the game for a short time then walked to the opal room restaurant he sat at a corner table and ordered a steak and a martini then he ate his dinner and thought about the rest of the evening he was becoming bored with this job and he did not like taking orders from a cheap gangster or trying to please mr spang just before ten oclock he walked into the casino there are two ways of doing this job he thought sit and wait for something to happen or make something happen chapter thirteen an interesting evening the dealer now at the centre blackjack table was tiffany case so thats her job at the tiara thought bond all the blackjack dealers at the tables were pretty women they all wore the same smart western clothes short grey skirt with a wide black belt a grey shirt and a black handkerchief round the neck a grey cowboy hat and black boots so tiffany is going to help me to win five thousand dollars bond thought he sat down opposite her hi she said smiling politely bond put ten one hundreddollar notes across the betting line on the table one of the two toughlooking men walked across and stood next to tiffany he was called a pitboss maybe this man would like new cards the man said looking at bond he gave tiffany a new pack of cards then he moved away tiffany shuffled the new cards quickly then cut them divided them into two parts and put them flat on the table but bond saw that the two halves were not quite the same when she shuffled them again she was going to put the cards back into the same place she put them in front of bond to cut he watched her shuffle them again cleverly moving the cards just where she needed them and so the new pack of cards was fixed she dealt him two cards then gave two to herself bond looked at his two cards a jack and a ten he looked up at the girl and shook his head he didnt want another card she turned her cards over they added up to sixteen she took another card a king now the three cards added up to more than twentyone she had busted she had silver dollars and counters for twenty dollars next to her but the pitboss moved quickly to her side with a thin thousanddollar plaque she pushed it across to bond bond bet again she dealt him two more cards seventeen again he shook his head she had twelve and took two more cards a three and a nine busted again and the pitboss was there with another thousanddollar plaque with his next bet bond got cards that added up to nineteen she turned over a ten and a seven and had to stand another thousanddollar plaque came to bond more people were coming into the gambling room now soon they were going to be round the tables this was his last bet after this he was supposed to get up from the table and leave her she dealt him two cards and he picked them up twenty and she picked up two tens bond smiled both took another card and busted she quickly dealt him two more cards just as three more players came to the table he had nineteen and she had sixteen and that was the end bond took his last thousanddollar plaque he got up from the table and looked across at the girl thank you he said you deal beautifully tiffany case looked hard at bond youre welcome she said bond turned and walked away to the bar so now he had his five thousand dollars he remembered what shady tree had told him dont bet any more bond smiled then finished his drink and walked across the room to the nearest roulette table five thousand dollars on red he told the croupier the croupier looked closely at him then put the five thousanddollar plaques onto the red bond saw him push a button under the table with his knee a moment later the pitboss walked across to the table at the same time the croupier turned the wheel bond lit a cigarette he had a wonderful feeling of freedom nobody was going to tell him what to do any more and he knew that he was going to win the wheel turned more slowly and the little ball fell into its red place thirtysix red said the croupier he pulled in some losing counters and pushed some money across to the winning players then he took a large thin five thousanddollar plaque and put it next to bond put it on black said bond now several more people came to watch bond felt their eyes on him but he looked across the table to the pitboss the man looked a little nervous bond smiled at him as the wheel turned seventeen black said the croupier there were noises of excitement from the watching crowd they watched the croupier push the big plaque in front of bond now there was another man standing next to the pitboss he was a big squareshaped man and he was looking at bond with hard bright eyes it was seraffimo spang he looked a little like his brother in london now for the last throw thought bond and then im leaving here with twenty thousand dollars of spang money he looked across at his employer spangs eyes were still watching him red said bond he gave the five thousanddollar plaque to the croupier the wheel turned the little ball fell into its place five red said the croupier and there were more noises of excitement from the people around the table ill take my money said bond thanks bond put the four plaques in his pocket and moved through the crowd he walked across to the cashiers desk three notes of five thousand and five of ones he said to the man the cashier took bonds four plaques and gave him the money bond went to the hotel desk and asked for an air mail envelope then he moved to a writingdesk next to the wall he put the three large notes in the envelope and wrote on the front the managing director universal export regents park london nw england then he bought stamps at the desk and put the envelope into the us mailbox he hoped it would be safe he looked at his watch five minutes to midnight he looked round the room for the last time there was a new dealer at tiffany cases table and mr spang was not there anymore bond walked back to his room and locked the door it had been an interesting evening chapter fourteen gunfights for most of the next day bond waited at the hotel for something to happen when he got tired of waiting he phoned ernie cureo lets meet for a talk he said cureo came to get him that evening and they drove away from the strip what happened last night asked ernie cureo did you win anything i won some money at roulette said bond it wont worry spang hes rich how does he spend his money hes crazy about the old west said cureo he bought himself a ghost town out on highway its called spectreville it has a western saloon bar a hotel and even an old railway station and spang bought one of the old trains he keeps it in the station at spectreville at weekends he takes his friends for a ride to rhyolite its another ghost town about fifty miles away it gets lots of visitors thats why i havent heard from spang or his friends all day thought bond its friday so theyll be out playing trains after some minutes cureo said were being followed front and back do you see that black chevrolet in front with the two men theyve got two driving mirrors and theyre watching us behind us is a little red jaguar two more men with golf clubs on the back seat they belong to the detroit purple gang and they dont play golf ill try and lose them bond took a thousanddollar note from his pocket and pushed it into cureos shirt pocket thats for any damage to your car ok ernie lets see what you can do he took his beretta out of its holster and held it in his hand this is what ive been waiting for he thought it was a straight road with not much traffic ahead the tops of the mountains were yellow in the evening sun they were riding easily along with the jaguar behind them and the black chevrolet in front without warning cureo pushed his foot down hard and stopped the car suddenly the jaguar hit them from behind and there was a crash of metal and glass cureo then drove away fast down the road bond looked out of the back window theyre out of the car he said the windscreen is broken theres glass everywhere theyre trying to pull the front part of the car off the wheels good work ernie its stopped them for a little while get down said cureo the chevrolet has stopped at the side of the road they may try some shooting bond felt the car move forward fast cureo was half lying on the front seat driving with one hand there were two loud cracks as they went past the chevrolet glass fell around bond the car almost went off the road before cureo got it straight again bond pushed out the broken glass in the back window the chevrolet was coming after them im going to turn suddenly and stop in the next side road said cureo itll give you a clear shot when they come round the corner after us now the car went round the corner on two wheels and bond held on to his seat the car stopped suddenly bond jumped out his gun in his hand the chevrolet came round the corner fast bond fired his gun crack crack crack crack all four bullets hit the car the chevrolet went across the road hit a tree turned completely round and went slowly over onto its side and stopped bond watched fire come from the front of it someone was trying to get out of a window soon the flames were going to find petrol on the ground and the whole car was going to explode it was going to be too late for the man inside bond heard a sound behind him he turned to see ernie cureo fall from the drivers seat of the taxi and across the passenger seat bond forgot the burning chevrolet and pulled open the car door there was blood all over cureos arm bond pulled him carefully onto the passenger seat and his eyes opened get me out of here he said and drive fast that jaguar will soon be coming to find us then get me to a doctor ok ernie said bond he got into the driving seat and started the car he moved fast down the road away from the burning chevrolet can you see anything in the mirror asked cureo theres a car coming fast after us said bond its the jaguar we have to find somewhere to hide said cureo theres a drivein cinema near here there turn right see those lights get in there quick thats right between those cars turn off your lights stop the taxi stopped in the back line of six rows of cars they looked towards a large cinema screen a man was saying something to a woman on the screen two more cars drove in and stopped neither of them was the jaguar a girl came up to the taxi thats a dollar please she said she connected a loudspeaker to a metal post next to the car then she hung the speaker inside the window next to bond the voices of the man and woman on the screen filled the car the girl moved away to the next car turn the sound off said cureo he spoke with difficulty watch the entrance well wait a little while then you can get me to a doctor bond found a switch and the voices stopped he looked out into the darkness towards the entrance but could see nothing suddenly a dark shape came up from the ground and a gun was pointing at bonds face then a voice from outside ernie cureos side of the car whispered ok boys dont do anything stupid bond looked at the face next to him get out or well shoot your friend the man told him you and the two of us are going for a drive bond turned and saw the gun pushed into cureos neck ill go with them ernie he said ill soon be back to get you to a doctor sorry friend said cureo in a tired voice i think there was a soft noise as the gun hit him behind the ear he fell forward and was silent bond stepped slowly out of the car and the three men walked towards the entrance chapter fifteen spectreville the red jaguar was outside the entrance its windscreen broken they took bonds gun before he climbed in next to the driver where are we going he asked youll see said the driver he was a thin man with an unkind face they were soon driving along a moonlit road towards the mountains there was a big sign which said bond remembered that spectreville was on highway so these men were taking him to mr spang bond suddenly felt that he did not know enough of the answers did they know who he really was he could say that he had not understood his orders about the gambling but how to explain all the shooting he could say that he thought the four men were from another gang well now im about to get to the end of the pipeline he thought after two hours of driving they stopped outside some high gates there was a sign outside it said spectreville do not enter dangerous dogs on the gate was a button and a speaking box a small sign next to it said ring and say who you are the driver pushed the button and a voice said yes from inside the box frasso and mcgonigle said the driver loudly ok mcgonigle said the voice there was a click and the gates slowly opened they drove through them and down a narrow road the gates closed behind them the road went on for about a mile then there were lights in front of them they went down a hill and suddenly there were brightly lit buildings past them the moon shone down on a single straight railway line it went on as far as bond could see the car stopped in front of grey houses and shops one bigger building had a sign outside it said pink garter saloon bar from behind the western swing halfdoors yellow light came out onto the street the sound of a piano playing came from inside it was all like something out of a western film get out mcgonigle told bond the three men climbed out of the car and onto the wooden pavement bond stopped come on said mcgonigle bond slowly followed him to the door of the saloon he stopped for a moment as the swing halfdoors came back towards his face he felt frassos gun pushing into his back now thought bond he jumped through the doors and threw mcgonigle round and into frasso the two men crashed back onto the pavement mcgonigle was up on his feet first with a gun in his hand bonds hand came down on the gun and knocked it to the ground frasso fired two shots at bond but the secret agent dropped to the ground and picked up the gun at mcgonigles feet he fired two quick shots at frasso from the ground then mcgonigle stepped on his hand and fell on top of him bond went down but he saw and heard frasso crash down onto the pavement outside then mcgonigles hands were on him for several seconds the two men fought silently like animals bond got up on one knee and pushed the other man off him as he did this mcgonigles knee came up and hit bonds face bond fell back but then stood up mcgonigle came towards him with his head down bond turned away quickly but the gangsters head hit him in the chest and two fists crashed into his body the gangsters head came up and bond hit him hard in the face mcgonigle fell back but bond went after him he reached for the gangsters foot and pulled it away from the floor then he turned and threw the man into the room mcgonigles flying body crashed down on top of the piano the piano fell to the floor with mcgonigle flat on the top of it stop a girls voice came across the room from the bar slowly bond turned round there were four people standing with their backs to the bar mr spang stood in front of the other three he was dressed like a cowboy with shiny black boots and two guns in holsters at his sides tiffany case stood next to him she wore a western dress of white and gold she stood and watched bond her eyes were shining and she looked nervous then there were the two men in black hoods the two from the acme baths at saratoga each of them pointed a gun at bond bring him this way said mr spang he left the room tiffany case gave bond a warning look as she followed him the two men came close to bond the big one said move bond walked slowly after the girl and the two hooded men walked behind him bond pushed through a door behind the bar he looked around and saw that he was now in a railway station waiting room turn right said one of them bond turned and went through a door in front of him was probably the most beautiful steam train in the world there were three metal shining lights on the front of the big old engine the name the cannonball was painted along the side in black and gold behind the engine was a dark blue carriage bond looked at the train but then he felt a gun in his back bond climbed up into the carriage first there was a small but beautiful dining room then a narrow room with three doors at the sides with the two men still behind him bond walked to the end and pushed open the door into a big room it was a sitting room with bookshelves on each side and expensive curtains a thick red carpet covered the floor mr spang stood at the far end of the room in the middle sat tiffany case she was nervously smoking a cigarette bond walked to a comfortable chair he turned it towards spang and tiffany and sat down he crossed one knee slowly over the other then lit a cigarette stay here wint said mr spang kidd go and phone detroit tell them to send more men he turned towards bond and his eyes shone angrily now who are you and whats happening bond did not like spangs question ill need a drink if were going to talk said bond bourbon get it wint mr spang said coldly the big man walked out of the room minutes later he came back and pushed a glass into bonds hand thanks wint said bond he drank some of the bourbon then put the glass down on the floor next to him he looked up at mr spang i did my job and got paid said bond it was my money and i decided to gamble with it then a lot of your men came after me if you wanted to talk to me why didnt you just telephone me when they started shooting it was time for me to shoot back so i did without taking his eyes off bond mr spang slowly pulled a piece of paper from his shirt pocket bond knew that the piece of paper was bad news for him really bad news this is a message from a good friend in london it says peter franks is held by the police find out if the job is in any danger then kill the new carrier and send a report there was silence in the room mr spang looked hard at bond well mr whoeveryouare he said at last this looks like a good year for something horrible to happen to you bond tried to stay calm he knew that they were going to hurt him badly but how he reached down for his drink now he knew that the two spangs were the beginning and the end of the diamond pipeline he had completed his job he knew the answers now in some way he must get the answers back to m i took the job from peter franks he said he decided that he didnt like it and i needed money youre lying said mr spang youre with the police or youre some kind of private detective im going to find out who you are who you work for and what you know he turned angrily to tiffany case how did he trick you are you stupid no said tiffany abc sent this man to me and he seemed ok was i supposed to tell abc to try again and maybe this man is telling the truth her angry eyes turned towards bond and he saw fear in them fear for him well were going to find out said mr spang wint get kidd and the boots the boots bond sat silently he had to be strong now he must tell them nothing he had to think of ernie cureo and felix leiter and maybe tiffany case he heard the two men come up behind him take him out onto the station said mr spang ok boss said wint the two hooded men sat down they put football boots down on the thick carpet next to them then they started to take off their shoes chapter sixteen the cannonball james said tiffany case wake up j after some moments bonds blackened eyes opened with difficulty he looked up at her from the wooden floor she shook his bloodcovered arm afraid that he might fall asleep again he seemed to understand and slowly pulled himself up onto his hands and knees can you walk she asked wait he said he could feel his feet and hands he could move his head from side to side he could see the moonlight he could hear her it should be all right he thought but he just wanted to sleep or to die anything to stop the pain that was in him and all over him anything to kill the memory of those four boots kicking him were in the waiting room she whispered we must get to the end of the station she opened the door and bond got up on his feet with tiffanys arm round him he walked slowly out and to the end of the station and there was a railroad handcar bond looked at it petrol he whispered tiffany pointed to some petrol cans by the station wall ive just filled it she whispered back they use it to check the railway line get on it she smiled next stop rhyolite youre a great girl whispered bond but therell be a lot of noise when we start that thing he turned and looked at the buildings behind him ive got an idea have you got some matches or a cigarette lighter she took a lighter out of her pocket and gave it to him whats the idea she said we need to get moving bond went across to the cans of petrol and started opening them he threw petrol over the wooden walls when several cans were empty he went back to her start the handcar he whispered he picked up an old newspaper from next to the railway track tiffany started the handcar engine bond lit the newspaper with the lighter then threw it towards the petrol cans boom flames shot into the sky james cried tiffany bond got onto the handcar as it started to move away soon they were speeding along the track and bond felt the cool night air are you ok asked tiffany you look terrible nothings broken said bond i had to sit and listen to them kicking you she said spang stayed and listened and watched me after they put ropes round you and threw you into the waiting room everyone went to bed i waited an hour before i came down to you youre going to be in trouble if they catch us said bond dont worry about me she said first we have to get this thing to rhyolite then well have to find a car and get to california ive got money we need to get you to a doctor and buy you a new shirt ive got your gun i got it after spang went to bed she opened her shirt and took it from her belt bond took it from her and pushed it into the top of his trousers his shirt was covered in blood the miles went by every few minutes bond turned and looked behind them they had been travelling nearly an hour when they heard a new sound its the cannonball said tiffany they looked back along the railway line was that a small light far away how far is it to rhyolite asked bond about thirty miles how fast can this thing go about thirty miles an hour after fifteen minutes bond could see the lights on the front of the big engine are we ok for petrol he asked yes she said i put in a whole can almost before she finished speaking the little engine went put putput oh no said tiffany and again put putput then putput hissss and suddenly they were moving down the track in silence the engine dead minutes later the handcar stopped no more petrol said bond he looked round there was flat open land for two miles on the left and mountains half a mile away on the right come on tiffany he said weve got to go he looked round and saw her running down the track in front of the handcar after a moment she turned and ran back theres a side line in front she said if you can move the points on the track we can push this thing down the side line then the train will miss us bond smiled ive got a better idea come on start pushing once it started moving the handcar moved down the track easily they came to the points by the side line and bond went on pushing until they were past them what are you doing asked tiffany bond ran back to the points were going to send the cannonball down the side line help me move the points switch they both pulled hard on the switch the pain in bonds arms was terrible but slowly the old metal moved for the first time in fifty years then it was done and tiffany helped bond back to the handcar suddenly the night air was full of the noise of the great metal train as it rushed towards them get down and dont move shouted bond he pushed tiffany down behind the handcar then he went across to the side of the railway line and took out his gun crack a bullet hit the ground next to him crack crack crack now he could hear the gun above the sound of the engine and then the big engine flew into the side line with a scream of metal bond saw spang in the cab of the engine he was almost falling out holding the side of the cab with one hand and driving the engine with the other bond lifted his gun and fired four shots he saw spangs white face suddenly turn up to the sky then the great black andgold engine was past him and rushing towards the spectre mountains its lights cut through the darkness and a warning bell began to ring but nothing could stop it now bond put the gun into his trousers as tiffany case ran across to him they watched the engine go behind a large rock and suddenly there was a terrible crash and a great burst of fire and then silence and thats the end of one of the spangs thought bond lets get away from here said tiffany it took them an hour and a half to walk the two miles to the main road tiffany halfcarried bond when they reached the road he fell down full of pain the girl sat and held him against her she cleaned his face with the corner of her shirt an hour later a low black car stopped next to them a head came out of the drivers window a friendly texan voice said felix leiter miss what can i do for you on this beautiful morning and when i got into town i called my friend ernie cureo said leiter his wife told me that he was in hospital so i went and saw ernie and he told me the whole story so i drove through the night to spectreville and saw that the place was on fire the gates were open so i went inside the only person there was a man on his hands and knees trying to get away he had a broken leg and his name was frasso i made frasso tell me everything then i left him for the fire department to find when they arrived next i drove towards rhyolite i found a pretty girl in the middle of the road and here we are now tell me your story so im not dreaming thought bond i am in the back of the studebaker and this is tiffanys arm

drive away on the plane bond sat in his seat and thought about the beautiful tiffany sitting next to him he knew that he was very near to being in love with her but what about her would she ever be able to trust and perhaps love a man again he thought too about the diamond smuggling pipeline one part of it was finished but seraffimo was only the end of the pipeline jack spang and the mysteryman abc were the real bosses did jack spang and abc know about his and tiffanys escape so now they had to find jack spang and then abc the secret service could only find the man at the beginning of the pipeline in africa through abc he planned to send a report to m when they were on the queen elizabeth vallances men could then do the rest there would not be much for bond to do in london only write reports at about four oclock on sunday afternoon bond and tiffany went to their cabins on the queen elizabeth a man watched them go onto the ship he then walked quickly to a telephone three hours later two american businessmen got out of a black car and walked onto the ship one was a young man with white hair the name on his small case was b kitteridge the other man was big and fat he looked

somebody who can make good sauce bearnaise said bond smiling he looked closely at her and shes got to have gold hair and blue eyes and she must know how to play cards the usual things she laughed and would you marry this person im almost married already to a man his names m later bond took her back to her cabin then went to his cabin and had a shower soon after there was a knock on the door a waiter came in carrying a small tray whats that asked bond it has just come up from the kitchen said the man he went out and closed the door bond looked at the tray on it was a bottle of champagne a plate with four small pieces of steak and a small bowl of sauce next to this was a note it said miss t case made this sance bearnaise without my help the chef bond smiled and filled a glass with champagne he put a lot of the sauce on a piece of steak he ate it then he went to the telephone tiffany he heard a little laugh at the other end then he said well you can certainly make wonderful sauce bearnaise he put the phone down carefully chapter eighteen dead men cant speak it was eleven oclock the next evening there were only a few people left in the veranda grill it was quiet with only the soft sound of the sea outside bond and tiffany had finished their dinner they were holding hands and looking silently into each others eyes after a time they got up and walked to the smoking room they found a small table in a corner and ordered coffee bond suddenly saw that two men were looking at him they were sitting at a table across the room and they looked away quickly one man had white hair and the other was big and fat bond looked carefully at the fat man had he seen this man before he turned back to tiffany those two men across the room seem interested in us he said she looked past his shoulder theyre not looking at us now the fat mans sucking his thumb the whitehaired man just looks stupid sucking his thumb said bond he was trying to remember something forget it james said tiffany lets go they finished their coffee and went down the stairs to the deck below bond put his arm round her and tiffany put her head on his shoulder they walked in silence until they were inside bonds cabin then bond put his arms around her and said softly my darling bond woke up to the sound of the telephone the last thing he remembered was the door closing after tiffany had left sometime during the night the telephone bell rang again bond picked the telephone up a voice said there is a message for you sir shall i send it down to you yes thanks said bond he looked at his watch three oclock in the morning he climbed out of bed and went into the shower afterwards he pulled on a shirt and trousers there was a knock on the door bond opened it and took the message from the man outside

you will fly to sierra leone tomorrow night bond sat quite still in his chair so somebody from the spangled gang was on the ship who where he quickly picked up the telephone and phoned tiffany he heard it ring once twice three times bond dropped the phone and ran to her cabin it was empty bond tried to think would the man question her before he killed her would he try to find out what she knew about bond would he take her to his cabin but which cabin bond ran to his cabin and found the passenger list winter cabin a suddenly he remembered everything winter wint and kidd the two men in hoods the two men on the plane from london bond got his gun and pushed it into the top of his trousers a was below his cabin that helps he thought he opened one of the two round windows in his cabin and looked down how far down was a more than two metres the sea was calm and there was no wind its a hot night bond thought will one of their windows be open he took the sheets from his bed and began to tie them together he tied one end of the rope round part of the window then he threw the tied sheets down the side of the ship dont look up and dont look down he told himself dont even think about it his mouth was dry and he could feel his heart beating fast some minutes later he felt the metal window of a beneath his feet it was open his foot told him that the curtains inside the window were closed he climbed on down there were voices inside the room suddenly a girls voice cried no there was a moments silence then the sound of a slap it was as loud as a gun firing a shot bond pushed himself through the curtains and into the cabin he crashed to the floor rolled over and came up with his gun in his hand it pointed at a place between two men who sent for you said the fat man calmly he was sitting in a chair opposite tiffany she was sitting on another chair she was naked except for a pair of pants she looked at bond and her eyes were wild and frightened the whitehaired man was sitting on the bed he smiled at bond tiffany said bond go into the bathroom and close the door then get into the bath and lie down she moved quickly to the bathroom and shut the door behind her now shes safe from bullets bond thought and she wont see what i have to do fortyeight sixtyfive eightysix the fat man said the words fast were the words an american football signal the fat man suddenly threw himself onto the floor the white haired man started to roll of if the bed and away from bond bond fired his gun a hole opened up just below the mans white hair his body fell the fat man on the floor had his gun halfout of his trousers drop it and get up ordered bond the fat man dropped the gun and stood up he looked into bonds eyes he was afraid sit down said bond the fat man turned and walked back towards his chair he sat down suddenly his right hand reached down the side of his leg and came up with a throwing knife crack the bullet from bonds gun and the knife went past each other in the air the eyes of the two men showed sudden pain but the fat mans eyes closed a moment later he fell backwards with his hand on the hole in his chest bonds eyes looked down at the blood on the front of his shirt the handle of the knife was hanging down from his shirt he turned and looked out of the open window very slowly his body started to relax after a moment or two he pulled the knife from his shirt and threw it out of the window into the darkness he walked across to the bathroom tiffany its me he said and opened the door she was lying face down in the bath with her hands over her ears he helped her out of the bath and stood with his arms round her youre hurt she said she took off his shirt and washed the cut on his chest with soap and water bond collected her clothes from the cabin and brought them back to the bathroom get dressed he said then clean everything that youve touched we dont want to leave any fingerprints he went back into the cabin for the next half hour he did everything very carefully he held the gun over the hole in the fat mans shirt and fired a second bullet through the hole now there were smoke marks around the hole next he put the gun in the fat mans right hand you shot yourself he told the dead man he went across to the whitehaired man and picked him up he carried him to the window and pushed him through it he looked back at the fat man you and your friend had a fight he said you shot yourself after you threw your friend out of the window thats the story i hope the police like it when we get to southampton he cleaned his fingerprints off everything that he had touched pulled the sheets off one of the beds then went to get tiffany he had to get her back to his cabin without anyone seeing them and then sleep with her body close to his and his arms round her forever forever he looked at the dead eyes of the body on the floor they seemed to speak to him saying nothing is forever only death is forever chapter nineteen the end of the pipeline it was hot under the large bush at the meeting place of three african countries the smuggler listened the helicopter was coming the smuggler walked out into the moonlight to get the packet of diamonds from his motorcycle a mile away an army truck was behind a low bush three men stood next to it two soldiers and bond near them was a large gun pointing at the sky they could hear the noise of the helicopter get ready said bond is the loudspeaker switched on yes sir said one of the soldiers bond looked up into the sky he thought about tiffany safe at his home in london he wanted this job to be finished so that he could go back and see her again the smuggler from the mines was also looking up the helicopter came down and flew above his head an arm came out and a torch flashed the code for a the man on the ground flashed back b and c then the helicopter landed the pilot started to climb out he was wearing a flying helmet thats unusual thought the smuggler and he looks taller than the usual pilot have you got the stuff asked the pilot it was an american voice yes said the man from the mines wheres the usual pilot he wont be coming again i am abc i am closing the pipeline oh said the smuggler nervously he gave the pilot the packet suddenly the pilot took a gun from his coat and shot the smuggler three times the smugglers eyes opened wide with shock then he fell to the ground and lay still dont move or we shoot the voice from the loudspeaker came across the open ground the pilot ran towards the helicopter and climbed in the door crashed shut behind him moments later the helicopter began to move up into the sky bond shouted now he was sitting on the seat behind the gun the two soldiers turned the gun towards the sky and bond shot at the helicopter bang bang bang bang bang bang bang red fire filled the sky and then there was a much louder bang the helicopter began to come down crazily to the ground inside it jack spang who was also rufus b saye of the house of diamonds and also the big boss abc came down with it before the sound of the crash died flames shot up into the sky bond lit a cigarette and sat watching the orange flames from the helicopter thats the end of the diamond pipeline he said softly the end of the spangled mob but not the end of the diamonds that are in the centre of the fire diamonds dont die diamonds are forever and bond suddenly remembered the eyes of the dead wint they had been wrong death is forever but so are diamonds he jumped down from the truck and started to walk towards the fire all these thoughts about death and diamonds were too serious for bond it was just the end of another adventure he thought about the beautiful woman waiting for him in london and he smiled the end
