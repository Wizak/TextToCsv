magician having mesmerised the caged tiger pulled the tasselled cord that released a dozen swords upon its head was the subject of heated argument both in the bar of the theatre and later when swanns performance was over on the sidewalk of st street some claimed to have glimpsed the bottom of the cage opening in the split second that all other eyes were on the descending blades and seen the tiger swiftly spirited away as the woman in the red dress took its place behind the lacquered bars others were just as adamant that the animal had never been in the cage to begin with its presence merely a projection which had been extinguished as a mechanism propelled the woman from beneath the stage this of course at such a speed that it deceived the eye of all but those swift and suspicious enough to catch it and the swords the nature of the trick which had transformed them in the mere seconds of their gleaming descent from steel to rosepetals was yet further fuel for debate the explanations ranged from the prosaic to the elaborate but few of the throng that left the theatre lacked some theory nor did the arguments finish there on the sidewalk they raged on no doubt in the apartments and restaurants of new york the pleasure to be had from swanns illusions was it seemed twofold first the spectacle of the trick itself in the breathless moment when disbelief was if not suspended at least taken on tiptoe and second when the moment was over and logic restored in the debate as to how the trick had been achieved how do you do it mr swann barbara bernstein was eager to know its magic swann replied he had invited her backstage to examine the tigers cage for any sign of fakery in its construction she had found none she had examined the swords they were lethal and the petals fragrant still she insisted yes but really she leaned close to him you can tell me she said i promise i wont breathe a word to a soul he returned her a slow smile in place of a reply oh i knowshe saidyoure going to tell me that youve signed some kind of oath thats right swann said and youre forbidden to give away any trade secrets the intention is to give you pleasure he told her have i failed in that oh no she replied without a moments hesitation everybodys talking about the show youre the toast of new york no he protested truly she said i know people who would give their eyeteeth to get into this theatre and to have a guided tour backstage well ill be the envy of everybody im pleased he said and touched her face she had clearly been anticipating such a move on his part it would be something else for her to boast of her seduction by the man critics had dubbed the magus of manhattan id like to make love to you he whispered to her here she said no he told her not within earshot of the tigers she laughed she preferred her lovers twenty years swanns junior he looked someone had observed like a man in mourning for his profile but his touch promised wit no boy could offer she liked the tang of dissolution she sensed beneath his gentlemanly fagade swann was a dangerous man if she turned him down she might never find another we could go to a hotel she suggested a hotel he said is a good idea a look of doubt had crossed her face what about your wife she said we might be seen he took her hand shall we be invisible then tm serious so am i he insisted take it from me seeing is not believing i should know its the cornerstone of my profession she did not look much reassured if anyone recognises us he told her til simply tell them their eyes are playing tricks she smiled at this and he kissed her she returned the kiss with unquestionable fervour miraculous he said when their mouths parted shall we go before the tigers gossip he led her across the stage the cleaners had not yet got about their business and there lying on the boards was a litter of rosebuds some had been trampled a few had not swann took his hand from hers and walked across to where the flowers lay she watched him stoop to pluck a rose from the ground enchanted by the gesture but before he could stand upright again something in the air above him caught her eye she looked up and her gaze met a slice of silver that was even now plunging towards him she made to warn him but the sword was quicker than her tongue at the last possible moment he seemed to sense the danger he was in and looked round the bud in his hand as the point met his back the swords momentum carried it through his body to the hilt blood fled from his chest and splashed the floor he made no sound but fell forward forcing twothirds of the swords length out of his body again as he hit the stage she would have screamed but that her attention was claimed by a sound from the clutter of magical apparatus arrayed in the wings behind her a muttered growl which was indisputably the voice of the tiger she froze there were probably instructions on how best to stare down rogue tigers but as a manhattanite born and bred they were techniques she wasnt acquainted with swann she said hoping this yet might be some baroque illusion staged purely for her benefit swann please get up but the magician only lay where he had fallen the pool spreading from beneath him if this is a joke she said testily im not amused when he didnt rise to her remark she tried a sweeter tactic swann my sweet id like to go now if you dont mind the growl came again she didnt want to turn and seek out its source but equally she didnt want to be sprung upon from behind cautiously she looked round the wings were in dark ness the clutter of properties kept her from working out the precise location of the beast she could hear it still however its tread its growl step by step she retreated towards the apron of the stage the closed curtains sealed her off from the auditorium but she hoped she might scramble under them before the tiger reached her as she backed against the heavy fabric one of the shadows in the wings forsook its ambiguity and the animal appeared it was not beautiful as she had thought it when behind bars it was vast and lethal and hungry she went down on her haunches and reached for the hem of the curtain the fabric was heavily weighted and she had more difficulty lifting it than shed expected but she had managed to slide halfway under the drape when head and hands pressed to the boards she sensed the thump of the tigers advance an instant later she felt the splash of its breath on her bare back and screamed as it hooked its talons into her body and hauled her from the sight of safety towards its steaming jaws even then she refused to give up her life she kicked at it and tore out its fur in handfuls and delivered a hail of punches to its snout but her resistance was negligible in the face of such authority her assault for all its ferocity did not slow the beast a jot it ripped open her body with one casual clout mercifully with that first wound her senses gave up all claim to verisimilitude and took instead to preposterous invention it seemed to her that she heard applause from somewhere and the roar of an approving audience and that in place of the blood that was surely springing from her body there came fountains of sparkling light the agony her nerveendings were suffering didnt touch her at all even when the animal had divided her into three or four parts her head lay on its side at the edge of the stage and watched as her torso was mauled and her limbs devoured and all the while when she wondered how all this could be possible that her eyes could live to witness this last supper the only reply she could think of was swanns its magic hed said indeed she was thinking that very thing that this must be magic when the tiger ambled across to her head and swallowed it down in one bite amongst a certain set harry damour liked to believe he had some small reputation a coterie which did not alas include his exwife his creditors or those anonymous critics who regularly posted dogs excrement through his office letterbox but the woman who was on the phone now her voice so full of grief she might have been crying for half a year and was about to begin again she knew him for the paragon he was need your help mr damour very badly im busy on several cases at the moment he told her maybe you could come to the office i cant leave the house the woman informed him til explain everything please come he was sorely tempted but there were several out standing cases one of which if not solved soon might end in fratricide he suggested she try elsewhere i cant go to just anybody the woman insisted why me i read about you about what happened in brooklyn making mention of his most conspicuous failure was not the surest method of securing his services harry thought but it certainly got his attention what had happened in wyckoff street had begun innocently enough with a husband whod employed him to spy on his adulterous wife and had ended on the top storey of the lomax house with the world he thought hed known turning inside out when the bodycount was done and the surviving priests dispatched he was left with a fear of stairs and more questions than hed ever answer this side of the family plot he took no pleasure in being reminded of those terrors i dont like to talk about brooklyn he said forgive me the woman replied but i need somebody who has experience with with the occult she stopped speaking for a moment he could still hear her breath down the line soft but erratic i need you she said he had already decided in that pause when only her fear had been audible what reply he would make til come im grateful to you she said the house is on east st street he scribbled down the details her last words were please hurry then she put down the phone he made some calls in the vain hope of placating two of his more excitable clients then pulled on his jacket locked the office and started downstairs the landing and the lobby smelt pungent as he reached the front door he caught chaplin the janitor emerging from the basement this place stinks he told the man its disinfectant its cats piss harry said get something done about it will you ive got a reputation to protect he left the man laughing the brownstone on east st street was in pristine condition he stood on the scrubbed step sweaty and sourbreathed and felt like a slob the expression on the face that met him when the door opened did nothing to dissuade him of that opinion yes it wanted to know im harry damour he said i got a call the man nodded youd better come in he said without enthusiasm it was cooler in than out and sweeter the place reeked of perfume harry followed the disapproving face down the hallway and into a large room on the other side of which across an oriental carpet that had everything woven into its pattern but the price sat a widow she didnt suit black nor tears she stood up and offered her hand mr damour yes valentin will get you something to drink if youd like please milk if you have it his belly had been jittering for the last hour since her talk of wyckoff street in fact valentin retired from the room not taking his beady eyes off harry until the last possible moment somebody died said harry once the man had gone thats right the widow said sitting down again at her invitation he sat opposite her amongst enough cushions to furnish a harem my husband tm sorry theres no time to be sorry she said her every look and gesture betraying her words he was glad of her grief the tearstains and the fatigue blemished a beauty which had he seen it unimpaired might have rendered him dumb with admiration they say that my husbands death was an accident she was saying i know it wasnt may i ask your name im sorry my name is swann mr damour dorothea swann you may have heard of my husband the magician illusionist she said i read about it tragic did you ever see his performance harry shook his head i cant afford broadway mrs swann we were only over for three months while his show ran we were going back in september back to hamburg she said i dont like this city its too hot and too cruel dont blame new york he said it cant help itself maybe she replied nodding perhaps what hap pened to swann would have happened anyway wherever wed been people keep telling me it was an accident thats all just an accident but you dont believe it valentin had appeared with a glass of milk he set it down on the table in front of harry as he made to leave she said valentin the letter he looked at her strangely almost as though shed said something obscene the letter she repeated he exited you were saying she frowned what about it being an accident oh yes i lived with swann seven and a half years and i got to understand him as well as anybody ever could i learned to sense when he wanted me around and when he didnt when he didnt id take myself off somewhere and let him have his privacy genius needs privacy and he was a genius you know the greatest illusionist since houdini is that so id think sometimes it was a kind of miracle that he let me into his life harry wanted to say swann would have been mad not to have done so but the comment was inappropriate she didnt want blandishments didnt need them didnt need anything perhaps but her husband alive again now i think i didnt know him at all she went on didnt understand him i think maybe it was another trick another part of his magic i called him a magician a while back harry said you corrected me so i did she said conceding his point with an apologetic look forgive me that was swann talking he hated to be called a magician he said that was a word that had to be kept for miracleworkers and he was no miracleworker he used to call himself the great pretender she said the thought made her smile valentin had reappeared his lugubrious features rife with suspicion he carried an envelope which he clearly had no desire to give up dorothea had to cross the carpet and take it from his hands is this wise he said yes she told him he turned on his heel and made a smart withdrawal hes griefstricken she said forgive him his behaviour he was with swann from the beginning of his career i think he loved my husband as much as i did she ran her linger down into the envelope and pulled the letter out the paper was pale yellow and gossamer thin a few hours after he died this letter was delivered here by hand she said it was addressed to him i opened it i think you ought to read it she passed it to him the hand it was written in was solid and unaffected dorothea he had written if you are reading this then i am dead you know how little store i set by dreams and premonitions and such but for the last few days strange thoughts have just crept into my head and i have the suspicion that death is very close to me if so so theres no help for it dont waste time trying to puzzle out the whys and wherefores theyre old news now just know that i love you and that i have always loved you in my way im sorry for whatever unhappiness ive caused or am causing now but it was out of my hands i have some instructions regarding the disposal of my body please adhere to them to the letter dont let anybody try to persuade you out of doing as i ask i want you to have my body watched night and day until im cremated dont try and take my remains back to europe have me cremated here as soon as possible then throw the ashes in the east river my sweet darling im afraid not of bad dreams or of what might happen to me in this life but of what my enemies may try to do once im dead you know how critics can be they wait until you cant fight them back then they start the character assassinations its too long a business to try and explain all of this so i must simply trust you to do as i say again i love you and i hope you never have to read this letter your adoring swann some farewell note harry commented when hed read it through twice he folded it up and passed it back to the widow id like you to stay with him she said corpsesit if you will just until all the legal formalities are dealt with and i can make arrangements for his cremation it shouldnt take them long ive got a lawyer working on it now again why me she avoided his gaze as he says in the letter he was never superstitious but i am i believe in omens and there was an odd atmosphere about the place in the days before he died as if we were watched you think he was murdered she mused on this then said i dont believe it was an accident these enemies he talks about he was a great man much envied professional jealousy is that a motive for murder anything can be a motive cant it she said people get killed for the colour of their eyes dont they harry was impressed it had taken him twenty years to learn how arbitrary things were she spoke it as conventional wisdom where is your husband he asked her upstairs she said i had the body brought back here where i could look after him i cant pretend i understand whats going on but im not going to risk ignoring his instructions harry nodded swann was my life she added softly apropos of nothing and everything she took him upstairs the perfume that had met him at the door intensified the master bedroom had been turned into a chapel of rest kneedeep in sprays and wreaths of every shape and variety their mingled scents verged on the hallucinogenic in the midst of this abundance the casket an elaborate affair in black and silver was mounted on trestles the upper half of the lid stood open the plush overlay folded back at dorotheas invitation he waded through the tributes to view the deceased he liked swanns face it had humour and a certain guile it was even handsome in its weary way more it had inspired the love of dorothea a face could have few better recommendations harry stood waisthigh in flowers and absurd as it was felt a twinge of envy for the love this man must have enjoyed will you help me mr damour what could he say but yes of course ill help that and call me harry he would be missed at wings pavilion tonight he had occupied the best table there every friday night for the past six and a half years eating at one sitting enough to compensate for what his diet lacked in excellence and variety the other six days of the week this feast the best chinese cuisine to be had south of canal street came gratis thanks to services he had once rendered the owner tonight the table would go empty not that his stomach suffered he had only been sitting with swann an hour or so when valentin came up and said how do you like your steak just shy of burned harry replied valentin was none too pleased by the response i hate to overcook good steak he said and i hate the sight of blood harry said even if it isnt my own the chef clearly despaired of his guests palate and turned to go valentin the man looked round is that your christian name harry asked christian names are for christians came the reply harry nodded you dont like my being here am i right valentin made no reply his eyes had drifted past harry to the open coffin im not going to be here for long harry said but while i am cant we be friends valentins gaze found him once more i dont have any friends he said without enmity or selfpity not now ok im sorry whats to be sorry for valentin wanted to know swanns dead its all over bar the shouting the doleful face stoically refused tears a stone would weep sooner harry guessed but there was grief there and all the more acute for being dumb one question only one why didnt you want me to read his letter valentin raised his eyebrows slightly they were fine enough to have been pencilled on he wasnt insane he said i didnt want you thinking he was a crazy man because of what he wrote what you read you keep to yourself swann was a legend i dont want his memory besmirched you should write a book harry said tell the whole story once and for all you were with him a long time i hear oh yes said valentin long enough to know better than to tell the truth so saying he made an exit leaving the flowers to wilt and harry with more puzzles on his hands than hed begun with twenty minutes later valentin brought up a tray of food a large salad bread wine and the steak it was one degree short of charcoal just the way i like it harry said and set to guzzling he didnt see dorothea swann though god knows he thought about her often enough every time he heard a whisper on the stairs or footsteps along the carpetted landing he hoped her face would appear at the door an invitation on her lips not perhaps the most appropriate of thoughts given the proximity of her husbands corpse but what would the illusionist care now he was dead and gone if he had any generosity of spirit he wouldnt want to see his widow drown in her grief harry drank the halfcarafe of wine valentin had brought and when threequarters of an hour later the man reappeared with coffee and calvados he told him to leave the bottle nightfall was near the traffic was noisy on lexington and third out of boredom he took to watching the street from the window two lovers feuded loudly on the sidewalk and only stopped when a brunette with a harelip and a pekinese stood watching them shamelessly there were preparations for a party in the brownstone opposite he watched a table lovingly laid and candles lit after a time the spying began to depress him so he called valentin and asked if there was a portable television he could have access to no sooner said than provided and for the next two hours he sat with the small black and white monitor on the floor amongst the orchids and the lilies watching whatever mindless entertainment it offered the silver luminescence flickering on the blooms like excitable moonlight a quarter after midnight with the party across the street in full swing valentin came up you want a nightcap he asked sure milk or something stronger something stronger he produced a bottle of fine cognac and two glasses together they toasted the dead man mr swann mr swann if you need anything more tonight valentin said im in the room directly above mrs swann is down stairs so if you hear somebody moving about dont worry she doesnt sleep well these nights who does harry replied valentin left him to his vigil harry heard the mans tread on the stairs and then the creaking of floorboards on the level above he returned his attention to the television but hed lost the thread of the movie hed been watching it was a long stretch til dawn meanwhile new york would be having itself a fine friday night dancing fighting fooling around the picture on the television set began to flicker he stood up and started to walk across to the set but he never got there two steps from the chair where hed been sitting the picture folded up and went out altogether plunging the room into total darkness harry briefly had time to register that no light was finding its way through the windows from the street then the insanity began something moved in the blackness vague forms rose and fell it took him a moment to recognise them the flowers invisible hands were tearing the wreaths and tributes apart and tossing the blossoms up into the air he followed their descent but they didnt hit the ground it seemed the floorboards had lost all faith in themselves and disappeared so the blossoms just kept falling down down through the floor of the room below and through the basement floor away to god alone knew what destination fear gripped harry like some old dopepusher promising a terrible high even those few boards that remained beneath his feet were becoming insubstantial in seconds he would go the way of the blossoms he reeled around to locate the chair hed got up from some fixed point in this vertiginous nightmare the chair was still there he could just discern its form in the gloom with torn blossoms raining down upon him he reached for it but even as his hand took hold of the arm the floor beneath the chair gave up the ghost and now by a ghastly light that was thrown up from the pit that yawned beneath his feet harry saw it tumble away into hell turning over and over til it was pinprick small then it was gone and the flowers were gone and the walls and the windows and every damn thing was gone but him not quite everything swanns casket remained its lid still standing open its overlay neatly turned back like the sheet on a childs bed the trestle had gone as had the floor beneath the trestle but the casket floated in the dark air for all the world like some morbid illusion while from the depths a rumbling sound accompanied the trick like the roll of a snare drum harry felt the last solidity failing beneath him felt the pit call even as his feet left the ground that ground faded to nothing and for a terrifying moment he hung over the gulfs his hands seeking the lip of the casket his right hand caught hold of one of the handles and closed thankfully around it his arm was almost jerked from its socket as it took his bodyweight but he flung his other arm up and found the casketedge using it as purchase he hauled himself up like a halfdrowned sailor it was a strange lifeboat but then this was a strange sea infinitely deep infinitely terrible even as he laboured to secure himself a better hand hold the casket shook and harry looked up to discover that the dead man was sitting upright swanns eyes opened wide he turned them on harry they were far from benign the next moment the dead illusionist was scrambling to his feet the floating casket rocking ever more violently with each movement once vertical swann proceeded to dislodge his guest by grinding his heel in harrys knuckles harry looked up at swann begging for him to stop the great pretender was a sight to see his eyes were starting from his sockets his shirt was torn open to display the exitwound in his chest it was bleeding afresh a rain of cold blood fell upon harrys upturned face and still the heel ground at his hands harry felt his grip slipping swann sensing his approaching triumph began to smile fall boy he said fall harry could take no more in a frenzied effort to save himself he let go of the handle in his right hand and reached up to snatch at swanns trouserleg his fingers found the hem and he pulled the smile vanished from the illusionists face as he felt his balance go he reached behind him to take hold of the casket lid for support but the gesture only tipped the casket further over the plush cushion tumbled past harrys head blossoms followed swann howled in his fury and delivered a vicious kick to harrys hand it was an error the casket tipped over entirely and pitched the man out harry had time to glimpse swanns appalled face as the illusionist fell past him then he too lost his grip and tumbled after him the dark air whined past his ears beneath him the gulfs spread their empty arms and then behind the rushing in his head another sound a human voice is he dead it inquired no another voice replied no i dont think so whats his name dorothea damour mr damour mr damour harrys descent slowed somewhat beneath him the gulfs roared their rage the voice came again cultivated but unmelodious mr damour harry said dorothea at that word from that voice he stopped falling felt himself borne up he opened his eyes he was lying on a solid floor his head inches from the blank television screen the flowers were all in place around the room swann in his casket and god if the rumours were to be believed in his heaven im alive he said he had quite an audience for his resurrection dorothea of course and two strangers one the owner of the voice hed first heard stood close to the door his features were unremarkable except for his brows and lashes which were pale to the point of invisibility his female companion stood nearby she shared with him this distressing banality stripped bare of any feature that offered a clue to their natures help him up angel the man said and the woman bent to comply she was stronger than she looked readily hauling harry to his feet he had vomited in his strange sleep he felt dirty and ridiculous what the hell happened he asked as the woman escorted him to the chair he sat down he tried to poison you the man said who did valentin of course valentin hes gone dorothea said just disappeared she was shaking i heard you call out and came in here to find you on the floor i thought you were going to choke its all right said the man everything is in order now yes said dorothea clearly reassured by his bland smile this is the lawyer i was telling you about harry mr butterfield harry wiped his mouth please to meet you he said why dont we all go downstairs butterfield said and i can pay mr damour what hes due its all right harry said i never take my fee until the jobs done but it is done butterfield said your services are no longer required here harry threw a glance at dorothea she was plucking a withered anthurium from an otherwise healthy spray i was contracted to stay with the body the arrangements for the disposal of swanns body have been made butterfield returned his courtesy was only just intact isnt that right dorothea its the middle of the night harry protested you wont get a cremation until tomorrow morning at the earliest thank you for your help dorothea said but im sure everything will be fine now that mr butterfield has arrived just fine butterfield turned to his companion why dont you go out and find a cab for mr damour he said then looking at harry we dont want you walking the streets do we all the way downstairs and in the hallway as butterfield paid him off harry was willing dorothea to contradict the lawyer and tell him she wanted harry to stay but she didnt even offer him a word of farewell as he was ushered out of the house the two hundred dollars hed been given were of course more than adequate recompense for the few hours of idleness hed spent there but he would happily have burned all the bills for one sign that dorothea gave a damn that they were parting quite clearly she did not on past experience it would take his bruised ego a full twentyfour hours to recover from such indifference he got out of the cab on rd around rd street and walked through to a bar on lexington where he knew he could put half a bottle of bourbon between himself and the dreams hed had it was well after one the street was deserted except for him and for the echo his footsteps had recently acquired he turned the corner into lexington and waited a few beats later valentin rounded the same corner harry took hold of him by his tie not a bad noose he said hauling the man off his heels valentin made no attempt to free himself thank god youre alive he said no thanks to you harry said what did you put in the drink nothing valentin insisted why should i so how come i found myself on the floor how come the bad dreams butterfield valentin said whatever you dreamt he brought with him believe me i panicked as soon as i heard him in the house i admit it i know i should have warned you but i knew if i didnt get out quickly i wouldnt get out at all are you telling me he would have killed you not personally but yes harry looked incredulous we go way back him and me hes welcome to you harry said letting go of the tie im too damn tired to take any more of this shit he turned from valentin and began to walk away wait said the other man i know i wasnt too sweet with you back at the house but youve got to understand things are going to get bad for both of us i thought you said it was all over bar the shouting i thought it was i thought we had it all sewn up then butterfield arrived and i realised how naive i was being theyre not going to let swann rest in peace not now not ever we have to save him damour harry stopped walking and studied the mans face to pass him in the street he mused you wouldnt have taken him for a lunatic did butterfield go upstairs valentin enquired yes he did why do you remember if he approached the casket harry shook his head good said valentin then the defences are holding which gives us a little time swann was a fine tactician you know but he could be careless that was how they caught him sheer carelessness he knew they were coming for him i told him outright i said we should cancel the remaining performances and go home at least he had some sanctuary there you think he was murdered jesus christ said valentin almost despairing of harry of course he was murdered so hes past saving right the mans dead dead yes past saving no do you talk gibberish to everyone valentin put his hand on harrys shoulder oh no he said with unfeigned sincerity i dont trust anyone the way i trust you this is very sudden said harry may i ask why because youre in this up to your neck the way i am valentin replied no im not said harry but valentin ignored the denial and went on with his talk at the moment we dont know how many of them there are of course they might simply have sent butterfield but i think thats unlikely whos butterfield with the mafia we should be so lucky said valentin he reached in his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper this is the woman swann was with he said the night at the theatre its possible she knows something of their strength there was a witness she didnt come forward but yes there was i was his procurer you see i helped arrange his several adulteries so that none ever embarrassed him see if you can get to her he stopped abruptly somewhere close by music was being played it sounded like a drunken jazz band extemporising on bagpipes a wheezing rambling cacophony valentins face instantly became a portrait of distress god help us he said softly and began to back away from harry whats the problem do you know how to pray valentin asked him as he retreated down rd street the volume of the music was rising with every interval i havent prayed in twenty years harry replied then learn came the response and valentin turned to run as he did so a ripple of darkness moved down the street from the north dimming the lustre of barsigns and streetlamps as it came neon announcements suddenly guttered and died there were protests out of upstairs windows as the lights failed and as if encouraged by the curses the music took on a fresh and yet more hectic rhythm above his head harry heard a wailing sound and looked up to see a ragged silhouette against the clouds which trailed tendrils like a man o war as it descended upon the street leaving the stench of rotting fish in its wake its target was clearly valentin he shouted above the wail and the music and the panic from the blackout but no sooner had he yelled than he heard valentin shout out from the darkness a pleading cry that was rudely cut short he stood in the murk his feet unwilling to carry him a step nearer the place from which the plea had come the smell still stung his nostrils nosing it his nausea returned and then so did the lights a wave of power igniting the lamps and the barsigns as it washed back down the street it reached harry and moved on to the spot where he had last seen valentin it was deserted indeed the sidewalk was empty all the way down to the next intersection the drivelling jazz had stopped eyes peeled for man beast or the remnants of either harry wandered down the sidewalk twenty yards from where he had been standing the concrete was wet not with blood he was pleased to see the fluid was the colour of bile and stank to high heaven amongst the splashes were several slivers of what might have been human tissue evidently valentin had fought and succeeded in opening a wound in his attacker there were more traces of the blood further down the sidewalk as if the injured thing had crawled some way before taking flight again with valentin presumably in the face of such strength harry knew his meagre powers would have availed him not at all but he felt guilty nevertheless hed heard the cry seen the assailant swoop and yet fear had sealed his soles to the ground hed last felt fear the equal of this in wyckoff street when mimi lomaxs demonlover had finally thrown off any pretence to humanity the room had filled with the stink of ether and human dirt and the demon had stood there in its appalling nakedness and shown him scenes that had turned his bowels to water they were with him now those scenes they would be with him forever he looked down at die scrap of paper valentin had given him the name and address had been rapidly scrawled but they were just decipherable a wise man harry reminded himself would screw this note up and throw it down into the gutter but if the events in wyckoff street had taught him anything it was that once touched by such malignancy as he had seen and dreamt in the last few hours there could be no casual disposal of it he had to follow it to its source however repugnant that thought was and make with it whatever bargains the strength of his hand allowed there was no good time to do business like this the present would have to suffice he walked back to lexington and caught a cab to the address on the paper he got no response from the bell marked bernstein but roused the doorman and engaged in a frustrating debate with him through the glass door the man was angry to have been raised at such an hour miss bernstein was not in her apartment he insisted and remained untouched even when harry intimated that there might be some lifeordeath urgency in the matter it was only when he produced his wallet that the fellow displayed the least flicker of concern finally he let harry in shes not up there he said pocketing the bills shes not been in for days harry took the elevator his shins were aching and his back too he wanted sleep bourbon then sleep there was no reply at the apartment as the doorman had predicted but he kept knocking and calling her miss bernstein are you there there was no sign of life from within not at least until he said i want to talk about swann he heard an intake of breath close to the door is somebody there he asked please answer theres nothing to be afraid of after several seconds a slurred and melancholy voice murmured swanns dead at least she wasnt harry thought whatever forces had snatched valentin away they had not yet reached this corner of manhattan may i talk to you he requested no she replied her voice was a candle flame on the verge of extinction just a few questions barbara im in the tigers belly the slow reply came and it doesnt want me to let you in perhaps they had got here before him cant you reach the door he coaxed her its not so far but its eaten me she said try barbara the tiger wont mind reach there was silence from the other side of the door then a shuffling sound was she doing as he had requested it seemed so he heard her fingers fumbling with the catch thats it he encouraged her can you turn it try to turn it at the last instant he thought suppose shes telling the truth and there is a tiger in there with her it was too late for retreat the door was opening there was no animal in the hallway just a woman and the smell of dirt she had clearly neither washed nor changed her clothes since fleeing from the theatre the evening gown she wore was soiled and torn her skin was grey with grime he stepped into the apartment she moved down the hallway away from him desperate to avoid his touch its all right he said theres no tiger here her wide eyes were almost empty what presence roved there was lost to sanity oh there is she said tm in the tiger im in it forever as he had neither the time nor the skill required to dissuade her from this madness he decided it was wiser to go with it how did you get there he asked her into the tiger was it when you were with swann she nodded you remember that do you oh yes what do you remember there was a sword it fell he was picking up she stopped and frowned picking up what she seemed suddenly more distracted than ever how can you hear me she wondered when im in the tiger are you in the tiger too maybe i am he said not wanting to analyse the metaphor too closely were here forever you know she informed him well never be let out who told you that she didnt reply but cocked her head a little can you hear she said hear she took another step back down the hallway harry listened but he could hear nothing the growing agitation on barbaras face was sufficient to send him back to the front door and open it however the elevator was in operation he could hear its soft hum across the landing worse the lights in the hallway and on the stairs were deteriorating the bulbs losing power with every foot the elevator ascended he turned back into the apartment and went to take hold of barbaras wrist she made no protest her eyes were fixed on the doorway through which she seemed to know her judgement would come well take the stairs he told her and led her out on to the landing the lights were within an ace of failing he glanced up at the floor numbers being ticked off above the elevator doors was this the top floor they were on or one shy of it he couldnt remember and there was no time to think before the lights went out entirely he stumbled across the unfamiliar territory of the landing with the girl in tow hoping to god hed find the stairs before the elevator reached this floor barbara wanted to loiter but he bullied her to pick up her pace as his foot found the top stair the elevator finished its ascent the doors hissed open and a cold fluorescence washed the landing he couldnt see its source nor did he wish to but its effect was to reveal to the naked eye every stain and blemish every sign of decay and creeping rot that the paintwork sought to camouflage the show stole harrys attention for a moment only then he took a firmer hold of the womans hand and they began their descent barbara was not interested in escape however but in events on the landing thus occupied she tripped and fell heavily against harry the two would have toppled but that he caught hold of the banister angered he turned to her they were out of sight of the landing but the light crept down the stairs and washed over barbaras face beneath its uncharitable scrutiny harry saw decay busy in her saw rot in her teeth and the death in her skin and hair and nails no doubt he would have appeared much the same to her were she to have looked but she was still staring back over her shoulder and up the stairs the lightsource was on the move voices accompanied it the doors open a woman said what are you waiting for a voice replied it was butterfield harry held both breath and wrist as the light source moved again towards the door presumably and then was partially eclipsed as it disappeared into the apartment we have to be quick he told barbara she went with him down three or four steps and then without warning her hand leapt for his face nails opening his cheek he let go of her hand to protect himself and in that instant she was away back up the stairs he cursed and stumbled in pursuit of her but her former sluggishness had lifted she was startlingly nimble by the dregs of light from the landing he watched her reach the top of the stairs and disappear from sight here i am she called out as she went he stood immobile on the stairway unable to decide whether to go or stay and so unable to move at all ever since wyckoff street hed hated stairs momentarily the light from above flared up throwing the shadows of the banisters across him then it died again he put his hand to his face she had raised weals but there was little blood what could he hope from her if he went to her aid only more of the same she was a lost cause even as he despaired of her he heard a sound from round the corner at the head of the stairs a soft sound that might have been either a footstep or a sigh had she escaped their influence after all or perhaps not even reached the apartment door but thought better of it and aboutturned even as he was weighing up the odds he heard her say help me the voice was a ghost of a ghost but it was indisputably her and she was in terror he reached for his and started up the stairs again even before he had turned the corner he felt the nape of his neck itch as his hackles rose she was there but so was the tiger it stood on the landing mere feet from harry its body humming with latent power its eyes were molten its open maw impossibly large and there already in its vast throat was barbara he met her eyes out of the tigers mouth and saw a flicker of comprehension in them that was worse than any madness then the beast threw its head back and forth to settle its prey in its gut she had been swallowed whole apparently there was no blood on the landing nor about the tigers muzzle only the appalling sight of the girls face disappearing down the tunnel of the animals throat she loosed a final cry from the belly of the thing and as it rose it seemed to harry that the beast attempted a grin its face crinkled up grotesquely the eyes narrowing like those of a laughing buddha the lips peeling back to expose a sickle of brilliant teeth behind this display the cry was finally hushed in that instant the tiger leapt harry fired into its devouring bulk and as the shot met its flesh the leer and the maw and the whole striped mass of it unwove in a single beat suddenly it was gone and there was only a drizzle of pastel confetti spiralling down around him the shot had aroused interest there were raised voices in one or two of the apartments and the light that had accompanied butterfield from the elevator was brightening through the open door of the bernstein residence he was almost tempted to stay and see the lightbringer but discretion bettered his curiosity and he turned and made his descent taking the stairs two and three at a time the confetti tumbled after him as if it had a life of its own barbaras life perhaps transformed into paper pieces and tossed away he reached the lobby breathless the doorman was standing there staring up the stairs vacantly somebody get shot he enquired no said harry eaten as he headed for the door he heard the elevator start to hum as it descended perhaps merely a tenant coming down for a predawn stroll perhaps not he left the doorman as he had found him sullen and confused and made his escape into the street putting two block lengths between him and the apartment building before he stopped running they did not bother to come after him he was beneath their concern most likely so what was he to do now valentin was dead barbara bernstein too he was none the wiser now than hed been at the outset except that hed learned again the lesson hed been taught in wyckoff street that when dealing with the gulfs it was wiser never to believe your eyes the moment you trusted your senses the moment you believed a tiger to be a tiger you were half theirs not a complicated lesson but it seemed he had forgotten it like a fool and it had taken two deaths to teach it to him afresh maybe it would be simpler to have the rule tattooed on the back of his hand so that he couldnt check the time without being reminded never believe your eyes the principle was still fresh in his mind as he walked back towards his apartment and a man stepped out of the doorway and said harry it looked like valentin a wounded valentin a valentin whod been dismembered and sewn together again by a committee of blind surgeons but the same man in essence but then the tiger had looked like a tiger hadnt it its me he said oh no harry said not this time what are you talking about its valentin so prove it the other man looked puzzled this is no time for games he said were in desperate straits harry took his from his pocket and pointed at valentins chest prove it or i shoot you he said are you out of your mind i saw you torn apart not quite said valentin his left arm was swathed in makeshift bandaging from fingertip to midbicep it was touch and gohe said but everything has its achilles heel its just a question of finding the right spot harry peered at the man he wanted to believe that this was indeed valentin but it was too incredible to believe that the frail form in front of him could have survived the monstrosity hed seen on rd street no this was another illusion like the tiger paper and malice the man broke harrys train of thought your steakhe said my steak you like it almost burned valentin said i pro tested remember harry remembered go on he said and you said you hated the sight of blood even if it wasnt your own yes said harry his doubts were lifting thats right you asked me to prove im valentin thats the best i can do harry was almost persuaded in gods name valentin said do we have to debate this standing on the street youd better come in the apartment was small but tonight it felt more stifling than ever valentin sat himself down with a good view of the door he refused spirits or firstaid harry helped himself to bourbon he was on his third shot when valentin finally said we have to go back to the house harry what we have to claim swanns body before butterfield i did my best already its not my business any more so you leave swann to the pit valentin said she doesnt care why should i you mean dorothea she doesnt know what swann was involved with thats why shes so trusting she has suspicions maybe but insofar as it is possible to be guiltless in all of this she is he paused to adjust the position of his injured arm she was a prostitute you know i dont suppose she told you that swann once said to me he married her because only prostitutes know the value of love harry let this apparent paradox go why did she stay with him he asked he wasnt exactly faithful was he she loved him valentin replied its not unheard of and you oh i loved him too in spite of his stupidities thats why we have to help him if butterfield and his associates get their hands on swanns mortal remains therell be all hell to pay i know i got a glimpse at the bernstein place what did you see something and nothing said harry a tiger i thought only it wasnt the old paraphernalia valentin commented and there was something else with butterfield some thing that shed light i didnt see what the castrate valentin muttered to himself clearly discomfited well have to be careful he stood up the movement causing him to wince i think we should be on our way harry are you paying me for this harry inquired or am i doing it all for love youre doing it because of what happened at wyckoff street came the softlyspoken reply because you lost poor mimi lomax to the gulfs and you dont want to lose swann that is if youve not already done so they caught a cab on madison avenue and headed back uptown to st street keeping their silence as they rode harry had half a hundred questions to ask of valentin who was butterfield for one and what was swanns crime was that he be pursued to death and beyond so many puzzles but valentin looked sick and unfit for plying with questions besides harry sensed that the more he knew the less enthusiastic he would be about the journey they were now taking we have perhaps one advantage valentin said as they approached st street they cant be expecting this frontal attack butterfield presumes im dead and probably thinks youre hiding your head in mortal terror im working on it youre not in danger valentin replied at least not the way swann is if they were to take you apart limb by limb it would be nothing beside the torments they have waiting for the magician illusionist harry corrected him but valentin shook his head magician he was magician he will always be the driver interrupted before harry could quote dorothea on the subject what number you people want he said just drop us here on the right valentin instructed him and wait for us understand sure valentin turned to harry give the man fifty dollars fifty do you want him to wait or not harry counted four tens and ten singles into the drivers hand youd better keep the engine running he said anything to oblige the driver grinned harry joined valentin on the sidewalk and they walked the twentyfive yards to the house the street was still noisy despite the hour the party that harry had seen in preparation half a night ago was at its height there was no sign of life at the swann residence however perhaps they dont expect us harry thought certainly this headon assault was about the most foolhardy tactic imaginable and as such might catch the enemy off guard but were such forces ever offguard was there ever a minute in their maggoty lives when their eyelids drooped and sleep tamed them for a space no in harrys experience it was only the good who needed sleep iniquity and its practitioners were awake every eager moment planning fresh felonies how do we get in he asked as they stood outside the house i have the key valentin replied and went to the door there was no retreat now the key was turned the door was open and they were stepping out of the comparative safety of the street the house was as dark within as it had appeared from without there was no sound of human presence on any of the floors was it possible that the defences swann had laid around his corpse had indeed rebuffed butterfield and that he and his cohorts had retreated valentin quashed such misplaced optimism almost immediately taking hold of harrys arm and leaning close to whisper theyre here this was not the time to ask valentin how he knew but harry made a mental note to enquire when or rather if they got out of the house with their tongues still in their heads valentin was already on the stairs harry his eyes still accustoming themselves to the vestigial light that crept in from the street crossed the hallway after him the other man moved confidently in the gloom and harry was glad of it without valentin plucking at his sleeve and guiding him around the halflanding he might well have crippled himself despite what valentin had said there was no more sound or sight of occupancy up here than there had been below but as they advanced towards the master bedroom where swann lay a rotten tooth in harrys lower jaw that had lately been quiescent began to throb afresh and his bowels ached to break wind the anticipation was crucifying he felt a barely suppressible urge to yell out and to oblige the enemy to show its hand if indeed it had hands to show valentin had reached the door he turned his head in harrys direction and even in the murk it was apparent that fear was taking its toll on him too his skin glistened he stank of fresh sweat he pointed towards the door harry nodded he was as ready as he was ever going to be valentin reached for the door handle the sound of the lockmechanism seemed deafeningly loud but it brought no response from anywhere in the house the door swung open and the heady scent of flowers met them they had begun to decay in the forced heat of the house there was a rankness beneath the perfume more welcome than the scent was the light the curtains in the room had not been entirely drawn and the streetlamps described the interior the flowers massed like clouds around the casket the chair where harry had sat the calvados bottle beside it the mirror above the fireplace showing the room its secret self valentin was already moving across to the casket and harry heard him sigh as he set eyes on his old master he wasted little time but immediately set to lifting the lower half of the casket lid it defeated his single arm however and harry went to his assistance eager to get the job done and be away touching the solid wood of the casket brought his nightmare back with breathsnatching force the pit opening beneath him the illusionist rising from his bed like a sleeper unwillingly woken there was no such spectacle now however indeed a little life in the corpse might have made the job easier swann was a big man and his limp body was uncooperative to a fault the simple act of lifting him from his casket took all their breath and attention he came at last though reluctantly his long limbs flopping about now said valentin downstairs as they moved to the door something in the street ignited or so it seemed for the interior suddenly brightened the light was not kind to their burden it revealed the crudity of the cosmetics applied to swanns face and the burgeoning putrescence beneath harry had an instant only to appreciate these felicities and then the light brightened again and he realised that it wasnt outside but in he looked up at valentin and almost despaired the luminescence was even less charitable to servant than to master it seemed to strip the flesh from valentins face harry caught only a glimpse of what it revealed beneath events stole his attention an instant later but he saw enough to know that had valentin not been his accomplice in this venture he might well have run from him get him out of here valentin yelled he let go of swanns legs leaving harry to steer swann singlehanded the corpse proved recalcitrant however harry had only made two cursing steps towards the exit when things took a turn for the cataclysmic he heard valentin unloose an oath and looked up to see that the mirror had given up all pretence to reflection and that something was moving up from its liquid depths bringing the light with it what is it harry breathed the castrate came the reply will you go there was no time to obey valentins panicked instruction however before the hidden thing broke the plane of the mirror and invaded the room harry had been wrong it did not carry the light with it as it came it was the light or rather some holocaust blazed in its bowels the glare of which escaped through the creatures body by whatever route it could it had once been human a mountain of a man with the belly and the breasts of a neolithic venus but the fire in its body had twisted it out of true breaking out through its palms and its navel burning its mouth and nostrils into one ragged hole it had as its name implied been unsexed from that hole too light spilled by it the decay of the flowers speeded into seconds the blossoms withered and died the room was filled in moments with the stench of rotting vegetable matter harry heard valentin call his name once and again only then did he remember the body in his arms he dragged his eyes from the hovering castrato and carried swann another yard the door was at his back and open he dragged his burden out into the landing as the castrato kicked over the casket he heard the din and then shouts from valentin there followed another terrible commotion and the highpitched voice of the castrate talking through that hole in its face die and be happy it said and a hail of furniture was flung against the wall with such force chairs embedded themselves in the plaster valentin had escaped the assault however or so it seemed for an instant later harry heard the castrato shriek it was an appalling sound pitiful and revolting he would have stopped his ears but he had his hands full he had almost reached the top of the stairs dragging swann a few steps further he laid the body down the castrates light was not dimmed despite its complaints it still flickered on the bedroom wall like a midsummer thunderstorm for the third time tonight once on rd street and again on the stairs of the bernstein place harry hesitated if he went back to help valentin perhaps there would be worse sights to see than ever wyckoff street had offered but there could be no retreat this time without valentin he was lost he raced back down the landing and flung open the door the air was thick the lamps rocking in the middle oi the room hung the castrato still defying gravity it had hold of valentin by his hair its other hand was poised first and middle fingers spread like twin horns about to stab out its captives eyes harry pulled his from his pocket aimed and fired he had always been a bad shot when given more than a moment to take aim but in extremis when instinct governed rational thought he was not half bad this was such an occasion the bullet found the castrates neck and opened another wound more in surprise than pain perhaps it let valentin go there was a leakage of light from the hole in its neck and it put its hand to the place valentin was quickly on his feet again he called to harry fire again harry obeyed the instruction his second bullet pierced the creatures chest his third its belly this last wound seemed particularly traumatic the distended flesh ripe for bursting broke and the trickle of light that spilled from the wound rapidly became a flood as the abdomen split again the castrate howled this time in panic and lost all control of its flight it reeled like a pricked balloon towards the ceiling its fat hands desperately attempting to stem the mutiny in its substance but it had reached critical mass there was no making good the damage done lumps of its flesh began to break from it valentin either too stunned or too fascinated stood staring up at the disintegration while rains of cooked meat fell around him harry took hold of him and hauled him back towards the door the castrate was finally earning its name unloosing a desolate earpiercing note harry didnt wait to watch its demise but slammed the bedroom door as the voice reached an awesome pitch and the windows smashed valentin was grinning do you know what we did he said never mind lets just get the fuck out of here the sight of swanns corpse at the top of the stairs seemed to chasten valentin harry instructed him to assist and he did so as efficiently as his dazed condition allowed together they began to escort the illusionist down the stairs as they reached the front door there was a final shriek from above as the castrate came apart at the seams then silence the commotion had not gone unnoticed revellers had appeared from the house opposite a crowd of latenight pedestrians had assembled on the sidewalk some party one of them said as the trio emerged harry had half expected the cab to have deserted them but he had reckoned without the drivers curiosity the man was out of his vehicle and staring up at the first floor window does he need a hospital he asked as they bundled swann into the back of the cab no harry returned hes about as good as hes going to get will you drive said valentin sure just tell me where to anywhere came the weary reply just get out of here hold it a minute the driver said i dont want any trouble then youd better move said valentin the driver met his passengers gaze whatever he saw there his next words were im driving and they took off along east st like the proverbial bat out of hell we did it harry valentin said when theyd been travelling for a few minutes we got him back and that thing tell me about it the castrato whats to tell butterfield must have left it as a watchdog until he could bring in a technician to decode swanns defence mechanisms we were lucky it was in need of milking that makes them unstable how do you know so much about all of this its a long story said valentin and not for a cab ride so what now we cant drive round in circles all night valentin looked across at the body that sat between them prey to every whim of the cabs suspension and roadmenders craft gently he put swanns hands on his lap youre right of course he said we have to make arrangements for the cremation as swiftly as possible the cab bounced across a pothole valentins face tightened are you in pain harry asked him ive been in worse we could go back to my apartment and rest there valentin shook his head not very clever he said its the first place theyll look my offices then the second place well jesus this cabs going to run out of gas eventually at this point the driver intervened say did you people mention cremation maybe valentin replied only my brotherinlaws got a funeral business out in queens is that so said harry very reasonable rates i can recommend him no shit could you contact him now valentin said its two in the morning were in a hurry the driver reached up and adjusted his mirror he was looking at swann you dont mind me asking do you he said but is that a body you got back there it is said harry and hes getting impatient the driver made a whooping sound shit he said ive had a woman drop twins in that seat ive had whores do business i even had an alligator back there one time but this beats them all he pondered for a moment then said you kill him did you no said harry guess wed be heading for the east river if you had eh thats right we just want a decent cremation and quickly thats understandable whats your name harry asked him winston jowitt but everybody calls me byron im a poet see leastways i am at weekends byron see any other driver would be freaked out right finding two guys with a body in the back seat but the way i see it its all material for the poems right said byron the muse is a fickle mistress you have to take it where you find it you know speaking of which you gentlemen got any idea where you want to go make it your offices valentin told harry and he can call his brotherinlaw good said harry then to byron head west along th street to th you got it said byron and the cabs speed doubled in the space of twenty yards say he said you fellows fancy a poem now said harry i like to improvise byron replied pick a subject any subject valentin hugged his wounded arm close quietly he said how about the end of the world good subject the poet replied just give me a minute or two so soon said valentin they took a circuitous route to the offices while byron jowitt tried a selection of rhymes for apocalypse the sleepwalkers were out on th street in search of one high or another some sat in the doorways one lay sprawled across the sidewalk none of them gave the cab or its occupants more than the briefest perusal harry unlocked the front door and he and byron carried swann up to the third floor the office was home from home cramped and chaotic they put swann in the swivel chair behind the furred coffee cups and the alimony demands heaped on the desk he looked easily the healthiest of the quartet byron was sweating like a bull after the climb harry felt and surely looked as though he hadnt slept in sixty days valentin sat slumped in the clients chair so drained of vitality he might have been at deaths door you look terrible harry told him no matter he said itll all be done soon harry turned to byron how about calling this brotherinlaw of yours while byron set to doing so harry returned his attention to valentin ive got a firstaid box somewhere about he said shall i bandage up that arm thank you but no like you i hate the sight of blood especially my own byron was on the phone chastising his brotherin law for his ingratitude whats your beef i got you a client i know the time for christs sake but business is business tell him well pay double his normal rate valenun said you hear that mel twice your usual fee so get over here will you he gave the address to his brotherin law and put down the receiver hes coming over he announced now said harry now byron glanced at his watch my belly thinks my throats cut how about we eat you got an all night place near here theres one a block down from here you want food byron asked valentin i dont think so he said he was looking worse by the moment ok byron said to harry just you and me then you got ten i could borrow harry gave him a bill the keys to the street door and an order for doughnuts and coffee and byron went on his way only when hed gone did harry wish hed convinced the poet to stave off his hunger pangs a while the office was distressingly quiet without him swann in residence behind the desk valentin succumbing to sleep in the other chair the hush brought to mind another such silence during that last awesome night at the lomax house when mimis demonlover wounded by father hesse had slipped away into the walls for a while and left them waiting and waiting knowing it would come back but not certain of when or how six hours theyd sat mimi occasionally breaking the silence with laughter or gibberish and the first harry had known of its return was the smell of cooking excrement and mimis cry of sodomite as hesse surrendered to an act his faith had too long forbidden him there had been no more silence then not for a long space only hesses cries and harrys pleas for forgetfulness they had all gone unanswered it seemed he could hear the demons voice now its demands its invitations but no it was only valentin the man was tossing his head back and forth in sleep his face knotted up suddenly he started from his chair one word on his lips swannl his eyes opened and as they alighted on the illusionists body which was propped in the chair opposite tears came uncontrollably wracking him hes dead he said as though in his dream he had forgotten that bitter fact i failed him damour thats why hes dead because of my negligence youre doing your best for him now harry said though he knew the words were poor compensation nobody could ask for a better friend i was never his friend valentin said staring at the corpse with brimming eyes i always hoped hed one day trust me entirely but he never did why not he couldnt afford to trust anybody not in his situation he wiped his cheeks with the back of his hand maybe harry said its about time you told me what all this is about if you want to hear i want to hear very well said valentin thirtytwo years ago swann made a bargain with the gulfs he agreed to be an ambassador for them if they in return gave him magic magicr the ability to perform miracles to transform matter to bewitch souls even to drive out god thats a miracle its more difficult than you think valentin replied so swann was a genuine magician indeed he was then why didnt he use his powers he did valentin replied he used them every night at every performance harry was baffled i dont follow nothing the prince of lies offers to humankind is of the least value valentin said or it wouldnt be offered swann didnt know that when he first made his covenant but he soon learned miracles are useless magic is a distraction from the real concerns its rhetoric melodrama so what exactly are the real concerns you should know better than i valentin replied fellowship maybe curiosity certainly it matters not in the least if water can be made into wine or lazarus to live another year harry saw the wisdom of this but not how it had brought the magician to broadway as it was he didnt need to ask valentin had taken up the story afresh his tears had cleared with the telling some trace of animation had crept back into his features it didnt take swann long to realise hed sold his soul for a mess of pottage he explained and when he did he was inconsolable at least he was for a while then he began to contrive a revenge how by taking hells name in vain by using the magic which it boasted of as a trivial entertainment degrading the power of the gulfs by passing off their wonder working as mere illusion it was you see an act of heroic perversity every time a trick of swanns was explained away as sleightofhand the gulfs squirmed why didnt they kill him harry said oh they tried many times but he had allies agents in their camp who warned him of their plots against him he escaped their retribution for years that way until now until now valentin sighed he was careless and so was i now hes dead and the gulfs are itching for him i see but we were not entirely unprepared for this event uality he had made his apologies to heaven and i dare to hope hes been forgiven his trespasses pray that he has theres more than his salvation at stake tonight yours too all of us who loved him are tainted valentin replied but if we can destroy his physical remains before the gulfs claim them we may yet avoid the consequences of his covenant why did you wait so long why didnt you just cremate him die day he died their lawyers are not fools the covenant specifically proscribes a period of lyinginstate if we had attempted to ignore that clause his soul would have been forfeited automatically so when is this period up three hours ago at midnight valentin replied thats why theyre so desperate you see and so dangerous another poem came to byron jowitt as he ambled back up th avenue working his way through a tuna salad sandwich his muse was not to be rushed poems could take as long as five minutes to be finalised longer if they involved a double rhyme he didnt hurry on his journey back to the offices therefore but wandered in a dreamy sort of mood turning the lines every which way to make them fit that way he hoped to arrive back with another finished poem two in one night was damn good going he had not perfected the final couplet however by the time he reached the door operating on automatic pilot he fumbled in his pocket for the keys damour had loaned him and let himself in he was about to close the door again when a woman stepped through the gap smiling at him she was a beauty and byron being a poet was a fool for beauty please she said to him i need your help what can i do for you said byron through a mouthful of food do you know a man by the name of damour harry damour indeed i do im going up to his place right now perhaps you could show me the way the woman asked him as byron closed the door be my pleasure he replied and led her across the lobby to the bottom of the stairs you know youre very sweet she told him and byron melted valentin stood at the window something wrong harry asked just a feeling valentin commented i have a suspicion maybe the devils in manhattan so whats new that maybe hes coming for us as if on cue there was a knock at the door harry jumped its all right valentin said he never knocks harry went to the door feeling like a fool is that you byron he asked before unlocking it please said a voice he thought hed never hear again helpme he opened the door it was dorothea of course she was colourless as water and as unpredictable even before harry had invited her across the office threshold a dozen expressions or hints of such had crossed her face anguish suspicion terror and now as her eyes alighted upon the body of her beloved swann relief and gratitude you do have him she said stepping into the office harry closed the door there was a chill from up the stairs thank god thank god she took harrys face in her hands and kissed him lightly on the lips only then did she notice valentin she dropped her hands whats he doing here she asked hes with me with us she looked doubtful no she said we can trust him i said no get him out harry there was a cold fury in her she shook with it get him outl valentin stared at her glassyeyed the lady doth protest too much he murmured dorothea put her fingers to her lips as if to stifle any further outburst im sorry she said turning back to harry but you must be told what this man is capable of without him your husband would still be at the house mrs swann harry pointed out hes the one you should be grateful to not me at this dorotheas expression softened through bafflement to a new gentility oh she said now she looked back at valentin im sorry when you ran from the house i assumed some complicity with whom valentin inquired she made a tiny shake of her head then said your arm are you hurt a minor injury he returned ive already tried to get it rebandaged harry said but the bastards too stubborn stubborn i am valentin replied without inflection but well be finished here soon said harry valentin broke in dont tell her anything he snapped im just going to explain about the brotherinlaw harry said the brotherinlaw dorothea said sitting down the sigh of her legs crossing was the most enchanting sound harry had heard in twentyfour hours oh please tell me about the brotherinlaw before harry could open his mouth to speak valentin said its not her harry the words spoken without a trace of drama took a few seconds to make sense even when they did their lunacy was selfevident here she was in the flesh perfect in every detail what are you talking about harry said how much more plainly can i say it valentin replied its not her its a trick an illusion they know where we are and they sent this up to spy out our defences harry would have laughed but that these accusations were bringing tears to dorotheas eyes stop it he told valentin no harry you think for a moment all the traps theyve laid all the beasts theyve mustered you suppose she could have escaped that he moved away from the window towards dorothea wheres butterfield he spat down the hall waiting for your signal shut up said harry hes scared to come up here himself isnt he valentin went on scared of swann scared of us probably after what we did to his gelding dorothea looked at harry make him stop she said harry halted valentins advance with a hand on his bony chest you heard the lady he said thats no lady valentin replied his eyes blazing i dont know what it is but its no lady dorothea stood up i came here because i hoped id be safe she said you are safe harry said not with him around im not she replied looking back at valentin i think id be wiser going harry touched her arm no he told her mr damour she said sweetly youve already earned your fee ten times over now i think its time took responsibility for my husband harry scanned that mercurial face there wasnt a trace of deception in it i have a car downstairs she said i wonder could you carry him downstairs for me harry heard a noise like a cornered dog behind him and turned to see valentin standing beside swanns corpse he had picked up the heavyduty cigarette lighter from the desk and was flicking it sparks came but no flame what the hell are you doing harry demanded valentin didnt look at the speaker but at dorothea she knows he said he had got the knack of the lighter the flame flared up dorothea made a small desperate sound please dont she said well all burn with him if necessary valentin said hes insane dorotheas tears had suddenly gone shes right harry told valentin youre acting like a madman and youre a fool to fall for a few tears came the reply cant you see that if she takes him weve lost everything weve fought for dont listen she murmured you know me harry you trust me whats under that face of yours valentin said what are you a coprolite homunculus the names meant nothing to harry all he knew was the proximity of the woman at her side her hand laid upon his arm and what about you she said to valentin then more softly why dont you show us your wound she forsook the shelter of harrys side and crossed to the desk the lighter flame guttered at her approach go on she said her voice no louder than a breath i dare you she glanced round at harry ask him damour she said ask him to show you what hes got hidden under the bandages whats she talking about harry asked the glimmer of trepidation in valentins eyes was enough to convince harry there was merit in dorotheas request explain he said valentin didnt get the chance however distracted by harrys demand he was easy prey when dorothea reached across the desk and knocked the lighter from his hand he bent to retrieve it but she seized on the ad hoc bundle of bandaging and pulled it tore and fell away she stepped back see she said valentin stood revealed the creature on rd street had torn the sham of humanity from his arm the limb beneath was a mass of blueblack scales each digit of the blistered hand ended in a nail that opened and closed like a parrots beak he made no attempt to conceal the truth shame eclipsed every other response i warned you she said i warned you he wasnt to be trusted valentin stared at harry i have no excuses he said i only ask you to believe that i want whats best for swann how can you dorothea said youre a demon more than that valentin replied im swanns tempter his familiar his creature but i belong to him more than i ever belonged to the gulfs and i will defy them he looked at dorothea and their agents she turned to harry you have a gun she said shoot the filth you mustnt suffer a thing like that to live harry looked at the pustulent arm at the clacking fingernails what further repugnance was there in wait behind the flesh facade shoot it the woman said he took his gun from his pocket valentin seemed to have shrunk in the moments since the revelation of his true nature now he leaned against the wall his face slimy with despair kill me then he said to harry kill me if i revolt you so much but harry i beg you dont give swann to her promise me that wait for the driver to come back and dispose of the body by whatever means you can just dont give it to her dont listen dorothea said he doesnt care about swann the way i do harry raised the gun even looking straight at death valentin did not flinch youve failed judas she said to valentin the magicians mine what magician said harry why swann of course she replied lightly how many magicians have you got up here harry dropped his bead on valentin hes an illusionist he said you told me that at the very beginning never call him a magician you said dont be pedantic she replied trying to laugh off her faux pas he levelled the gun at her she threw back her head suddenly her face contracting and unloosed a sound of which had harry not heard it from a human throat he would not have believed the larynx capable it rang down the corridor and the stairs in search of some waiting ear butterfield is here said valentin flatly harry nodded in the same moment she came towards him her features grotesquely contorted she was strong and quick a blur of venom that took him offguard he heard valentin tell him to kill her before she transformed it took him a moment to grasp the significance of this by which time she had her teeth at his throat one of her hands was a cold vice around his wrist he sensed strength in her sufficient to powder his bones his fingers were already numbed by her grip he had no time to do more than depress the trigger the gun went off her breath on his throat seemed to gush from her then she loosed her hold on him and staggered back the shot had blown open her abdomen he shook to see what he had done the creature for all its shriek still resembled a woman he might have loved good said valentin as the blood hit the office floor in gouts now it must show itself hearing him she shook her head this is all there is to show she said harry threw the gun down my god he said softly its her dorothea grimaced the blood continued to come some part of her she replied have you always been with them then valentin asked of course not why then nowhere to go she said her voice fading by the syllable nothing to believe in all lies everything lies so you sided with butterfield better hell she said than a false heaven who taught you that harry murmured who do you think she replied turning her gaze on him though her strength was going out of her with the blood her eyes still blazed youre finished damour she said you and the demon and swann theres nobody left to help you now despite the contempt in her words he couldnt stand and watch her bleed to death ignoring valentins imperative that he keep clear he went across to her as he stepped within range she lashed out at him with astonishing force the blow blinded him a moment he fell against the tall filing cabinet which toppled sideways he and it hit the ground together it spilled papers he curses he was vaguely aware that the woman was moving past him to escape but he was too busy keeping his head from spinning to prevent her when equilibrium returned she had gone leaving her bloody handprints on wall and door chaplin the janitor was protective of his territory the basement of the building was a private domain in which he sorted through office trash and fed his beloved furnace and read aloud his favourite passages from the good book all without fear of interruption his bowels which were far from healthy allowed him little slumber a couple of hours a night no more which he supplemented with dozing through the day it was not so bad he had the seclusion of the basement to retire to whenever life upstairs became too demanding and the forced heat would sometimes bring strange waking dreams was this such a dream this insipid fellow in his fine suit if not how had he gained access to the basement when the door was locked and bolted he asked no questions of the intruder something about the way the man stared at him baffled his tongue chaplin the fellow said his thin lips barely moving id like you to open the furnace in other circumstances he might well have picked up his shovel and clouted the stranger across the head the furnace was his baby he knew as noone else knew its quirks and occasional petulance he loved as noone else loved the roar it gave when it was content he did not take kindly to the proprietorial tone the man used but hed lost the will to resist he picked up a rag and opened the peeling door offering its hot heart to this man as lot had offered his daughters to the stranger in sodom butterfield smiled at the smell of heat from the furnace from three floors above he heard the woman crying out for help and then a few moments later a shot she had failed he had thought she would but her life was forfeit anyway there was no loss in sending her into the breach in the slim chance that she might have coaxed the body from its keepers it would have saved the inconvenience of a fullscale attack but no matter to have swanns soul was worth any effort he had defiled the good name of the prince of lies for that he would suffer as no other miscreant magician ever had beside swanns punishment fausts would be an inconvenience and napoleons a pleasure cruise as the echoes of the shot died above he took the black lacquer box from his jacket pocket the janitors eyes were turned heavenward he too had heard the shot it was nothing butterfield told him stoke the fire chaplin obeyed the heat in the cramped basement rapidly grew the janitor began to sweat his visitor did not he stood mere feet from the open furnace door and gazed into the brightness with impassive features at last he seemed satisfied enough he said and opened the lacquer box chaplin thought he glimpsed movement in the box as though it were full to the lid with maggots but before he had a chance to look more closely both the box and contents were pitched into the flames close the door butterfield said chaplin obeyed you may watch over them awhile if it pleases you they need the heat it makes them mighty he left the janitor to keep his vigil beside the furnace and went back up to the hallway he had left the street door open and a pusher had come in out of the cold to do business with a client they bartered in the shadows until the pusher caught sight of the lawyer dont mind me butterfield said and started up the stairs he found the widow swann on the first landing she was not quite dead but he quickly finished the job damour had started were in trouble said valentin i hear noises down stairs is there any other way out of here harry sat on the floor leaning against the toppled cabinet and tried not to think of dorotheas face as the bullet found her or of the creature he was now reduced to needing theres a fire escape he said it runs down to the back of the building show me said valentin attempting to haul him to his feet keep your hands off me valentin withdrew bruised by the rebuffal im sorry he said maybe i shouldnt hope for your acceptance but i do harry said nothing just got to his feet amongst the litter of reports and photographs hed had a dirty life spying on adulteries for vengeful spouses dredging gutters for lost children keeping company with scum because it rose to the top and the rest just drowned could valentins soul be much grimier the fire escapes down the hall he said we can still get swann out valentin said still give him a decent cremation the demons obsession with his masters dignity was chastening in its way but you have to help me harry til help you he said avoiding sight of the creature just dont expect love and affection if it were possible to hear a smile thats what he heard they want this over and done with before dawn the demon said it cant be far from that now an hour maybe valentin replied but its enough either way its enough the sound of the furnace soothed chaplin its rumbles and rattlings were as familiar as the complaint of his own intestines but there was another sound growing behind the door the like of which hed never heard before his mind made foolish pictures to go with it of pigs laughing of glass and barbed wire being ground between the teeth of hoofed feet dancing on the door as the noises grew so did his trepidation but when he went to the basement door to summon help it was locked the key had gone and now as if matters werent bad enough the light went out he began to fumble for a prayer holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour but he stopped when a voice addressed him quite clearly michelmas it said it was unmistakably his mother and there could be no doubt of its source either it came from the furnace michelmas she demanded are you going to let me cook in here it wasnt possible of course that she was there in the flesh shed been dead thirteen long years but some phantom perhaps he believed in phantoms indeed hed seen them on occasion coming and going from the cinemas on nd street arm in arm open up michelmas his mother told him in that special voice she used when she had some treat for him like a good child he approached the door he had never felt such heat off the furnace as he felt now he could smell the hairs on his arms wither open the door mother said again there was no denying her despite the searing air he reached to comply that fucking janitor said harry giving the sealed fire escape door a vengeful kick this doors supposed to be left unlocked at all times he pulled at the chains that were wrapped around the handles well have to take the stairs there was a noise from back down the corridor a roar in the heating system which made the antiquated radiators rattle at that moment down in the basement michelmas chaplin was obeying his mother and opening the furnace door a scream climbed from below as his face was blasted off then the sound of the basement door being smashed open harry looked at valentin his repugnance moment arily forgotten we shant be taking the stairs the demon said bellowings and chatterings and screechings were already on the rise whatever had found birth in the basement it was precocious we have to find something to break down the door valentin said anything harry tried to think his way through the adjacent offices his minds eye peeled for some tool that would make an impression on either the fire door or the substantial chains which kept it closed but there was nothing useful only typewriters and filing cabinets think man said valentin he ransacked his memory some heavyduty instru ment was required a crowbar a hammer an axe there was an agent called shapiro on the floor below who exclusively represented porno performers one of whom had attempted to blow his balls off the month before shed failed but hed boasted one day on the stairs that he had now purchased the biggest axe he could find and would happily take the head off any client who attempted an attack upon his person the commotion from below was simmering down the hush was in its way more distressing than the din that had preceded it we havent got much time the demon said harry left him at the chained door can you get swann he said as he ran til do my best by the time harry reached the top of the stairs the last chatterings were dying away as he began down the flight they ceased altogether there was no way now to judge how close the enemy were on the next floor round the next corner he tried not to think of them but his feverish imagination populated every dirty shadow he reached the bottom of the flight without incident however and slunk along the darkened secondfloor corridor to shapiros office halfway to his destination he heard a low hiss behind him he looked over his shoulder his body itching to run one of the radiators heated beyond its limits had sprung a leak steam was escaping from its pipes and hissing as it went he let his heart climb down out of his mouth and then hurried on to the door of shapiros office praying that the man hadnt simply been shooting the breeze with his talk of axes if so they were done for the office was locked of course but he elbowed the frosted glass out and reached through to let himself in fumbling for the light switch the walls were plastered with photographs of sexgoddesses they scarcely claimed harrys attention his panic fed upon itself with every heartbeat he spent here clumsily he scoured the office turning furniture over in his impatience but there was no sign of shapiros axe now another noise from below it crept up the staircase and along the corridor in search of him an unearthly cacophony like the one hed heard on rd street it set his teeth on edge the nerve of his rotting molar began to throb afresh what did the music signal their advance in desperation he crossed to shapiros desk to see if the man had any other item that might be pressed into service and there tucked out of sight between desk and wall he found the axe he pulled it from hiding as shapiro had boasted it was hefty its weight the first reassurance harry had felt in too long he returned to the corridor the steam from the fractured pipe had thickened through its veils it was apparent that the concert had taken on new fervour the doleful wailing rose and fell punctuated by some flaccid percussion he braved the cloud of steam and hurried to the stairs as he put his foot on the bottom step the music seemed to catch him by the back of the neck and whisper listen in his ear he had no desire to listen the music was vile but somehow while he was distracted by finding the axe it had wormed its way into his skull it drained his limbs of strength in moments the axe began to seem an impossible burden come on down the music coaxed him come on down and join the band though he tried to form the simple word no the music was gaining influence upon him with every note played he began to hear melodies in the caterwauling long circuitous themes that made his blood sluggish and his thoughts idiot he knew there was no pleasure to be had at the musics source that it tempted him only to pain and desolation yet he could not shake its delirium off his feet began to move to the call of the pipers he forgot valentin swann and all ambition for escape and instead began to descend the stairs the melody became more intricate he could hear voices now singing some charmless accompaniment in a language he didnt comprehend from somewhere above he heard his name called but he ignored the summons the music clutched him close and now as he descended the next flight of stairs the musicians came into view they were brighter than he had anticipated and more various more baroque in their configurations more particular in their decoration and his drugged eyes now stung to see more atrocious in their choice of instruments such instruments byron was there his bones sucked clean and drilled with stops his bladder and lungs teased through slashes in his body as reservoirs for the pipers breath he was draped inverted across the musicians lap and even now was played upon the sacs ballooning the tongueless head giving out a wheezing note dorothea was slumped beside him no less transformed the strings of her gut made taut between her splinted legs like an obscene lyre her breasts drummed upon there were other instruments too men who had come off the street and fallen prey to the band even chaplin was there much of his flesh burned away his ribcage played upon indifferently well i didnt take you for a music lover butterfield said drawing upon a cigarette and smiling in welcome put down your axe and join us the word axe reminded harry of the weight in his hands though he couldnt find his way through the bars of music to remember what it signified dont be afraid butterfield said youre an innocent in this we hold no grudge against you dorothea he said she was an innocent too said the lawyer until we showed her some sights harry looked at the womans body at the terrible changes that they had wrought upon her seeing them a tremor began in him and something came between him and the music the imminence of tears blotted it out put down the axe butterfield told him but the sound of the concert could not compete with the grief that was mounting in him butterfield seemed to see the change in his eyes the disgust and anger growing there he dropped his halfsmoked cigarette and signalled for the musicmaking to stop must it be death then butterfield said but the enquiry was scarcely voiced before harry started down the last few stairs towards him he raised the axe and swung it at the lawyer but the blow was misplaced the blade ploughed the plaster of the wall missing its target by a foot at this eruption of violence the musicians threw down their instruments and began across the lobby trailing their coats and tails in blood and grease harry caught their advance from the corner of his eye behind the horde still rooted in the shadows was another form larger than the largest of the mustered demons from which there now came a thump that might have been that of a vast jackhammer he tried to make sense of sound or sight but could do neither there was no time for curiosity the demons were almost upon him butterfield glanced round to encourage their advance and harry catching the moment swung the axe a second time the blow caught butterfields shoulder the arm was instantly severed the lawyer shrieked blood sprayed the wall there was no time for a third blow however the demons were reaching for him smiles lethal he turned on the stairs and began up them taking the steps two three and four at a time butterfield was still shrieking below from the flight above he heard valentin calling his name he had neither time nor breath to answer they were on his heels their ascent a din of grunts and shouts and beating wings and behind it all the jack hammer thumped its way to the bottom of the flight its noise more intimidating by far than the chatterings of the berserkers at his back it was in his belly that thump in his bowels like deaths heartbeat steady and irrevocable on the second landing he heard a whirring sound behind him and half turned to see a humanheaded moth the size of a vulture climbing the air towards him he met it with the axe blade and hacked it down there was a cry of excitement from below as the body flapped down the stairs its wings working like paddles harry sped up the remaining flight to where valentin was standing listening it wasnt the chatter he was attending to nor the cries of the lawyer it was the jackhammer they brought the raparee he said i wounded butterfield i heard but that wont stop them we can still try the door i think were too late my friend wo said harry pushing past valentin the demon had given up trying to drag swanns body to the door and had laid the magician out in the middle of the corridor his hands crossed on his chest in some last mysterious act of reverence he had set folded paper bowls at swanns head and feet and laid a tiny origami flower at his lips harry lingered only long enough to reacquaint himself with the sweetness of swanns expression and then ran to the door and proceeded to hack at the chains it would be a long job the assault did more damage to the axe than to the steel links he didnt dare give up however this was their only escape route now other than flinging themselves to their deaths from one of the windows that he would do he decided if the worst came to the worst jump and die rather than be their plaything his arms soon became numb with the repeated blows it was a lost cause the chain was unimpaired his despair was further fuelled by a cry from valentin a high weeping call that he could not leave unanswered he left the fire door and returned past the body of swann to the head of the stairs the demons had valentin they swarmed on him like wasps on a sugar stick tearing him apart for the briefest of moments he struggled free of their rage and harry saw the mask of humanity in rags and the truth glistening bloodily beneath he was as vile as those besetting him but harry went to his aid anyway as much to wound the demons as to save their prey the wielded axe did damage this way and that sending valentins tormentors reeling back down the stairs limbs lopped faces opened they did not all bleed one sliced belly spilled eggs in thousands one wounded head gave birth to tiny eels which fled to the ceiling and hung there by their lips in the melјe he lost sight of valentin forgot about him indeed until he heard the jackhammer again and remembered the broken look on valentins face when hed named the thing hed called it the raparee or something like and now as his memory shaped the word it came into sight it shared no trait with its fellows it had neither wings nor mane nor vanity it seemed scarcely even to be flesh but forged an engine that needed only malice to keep its wheels turning at its appearance the rest retreated leaving harry at the top of the stairs in a litter of spawn its progress was slow its half dozen limbs moving in oiled and elaborate configurations to pierce the walls of the staircase and so haul itself up it brought to mind a man on crutches throwing the sticks ahead of him and levering his weight after but there was nothing invalid in the thunder of its body no pain in the white eye that burned in his sicklehead harry thought he had known despair but he had not only now did he taste its ash in his throat there was only the window left for him that and the welcoming ground he backed away from the top of the stairs forsaking the axe valentin was in the corridor he was not dead as harry had presumed but kneeling beside the corpse of swann his own body drooling from a hundred wounds now he bent close to the magician offering his apologies to his dead master no doubt but no there was more to it than that he had the cigarette lighter in his hand and was lighting a taper then murmuring some prayer to himself as he went he lowered the taper to the mouth of the magician the origami flower caught and flared up its flame was oddly bright and spread with supernatural efficiency across swanns face and down his body valentin hauled himself to his feet the firelight burnishing his scales he found enough strength to incline his head to the body as its cremation began and then his wounds overcame him he fell backwards and lay still harry watched as the flames mounted clearly the body had been sprinkled with gasoline or something similar for the fire raged up in moments gold and green suddenly something took hold of his leg he looked down to see that a demon with flesh like ripe raspberries still had an appetite for him its tongue was coiled around harrys shin its claws reached for his groin the assault made him forget the cremation or the raparee he bent to tear at the tongue with his bare hands but its slickness confounded his attempts he staggered back as the demon climbed his body its limbs embracing him the struggle took them to the ground and they rolled away from the stairs along the other arm of the corridor the struggle was far from uneven harrys repugnance was at least the match of the demons ardour his torso pressed to the ground he suddenly remembered the raparee its advance reverberated in every board and wall now it came into sight at the top of the stairs and turned its slow head towards swanns funeral pyre even from this distance harry could see that valentins last ditch attempts to destroy his masters body had failed the fire had scarcely begun to devour the magician they would have him still eyes on the raparee harry neglected his more intimate enemy and it thrust a piece of flesh into his mouth his throat filled up with pungent fluid he felt himself choking opening his mouth he bit down hard upon the organ severing it the demon did not cry out but released sprays of scalding excrement from pores along its back and disengaged itself harry spat its muscle out as the demon crawled away then he looked back towards the fire all other concerns were forgotten in the face of what he saw swann had stood up he was burning from head to foot his hair his clothes his skin there was no part of him that was not alight but he was standing nevertheless and raising his hands to his audience in welcome the raparee had ceased its advance it stood a yard or two from swann its limbs absolutely still as if it were mesmerised by this astonishing trick harry saw another figure emerge from the head of the stairs it was butterfield his stump was roughly tied off a demon supported his lopsided body tut out the fire demanded the lawyer of the raparee its not so difficult the creature did not move go on said butterfield its just a trick of his hes dead damn you its just conjuring no said harry butterfield looked his way the lawyer had always been insipid now he was so pale his existence was surely in question what do you know he said its not conjuring said harry its magic swann seemed to hear the word his eyelids fluttered open and he slowly reached into his jacket and with a flourish produced a handkerchief it too was on fire it too was unconsumed as he shook it out tiny bright birds leapt from its folds on humming wings the raparee was entranced by this sleightofhand its gaze followed the illusory birds as they rose and were dispersed and in that moment the magician stepped forward and embraced the engine it caught swanns fire immediately the flames spreading over its flailing limbs though it fought to work itself free of the magicians hold swann was not to be denied he clasped it closer than a longlost brother and would not leave it be until the creature began to wither in the heat once the decay began it seemed the raparee was devoured in seconds but it was difficult to be certain the moment as in the best performances was held suspended did it last a minute two minutes five harry would never know nor did he care to analyse disbelief was for cowards and doubt a fashion that crippled the spine he was content to watch not knowing if swann lived or died if birds fire corridor or if he himself harry damour were real or illusory finally the raparee was gone harry got to his feet swann was also standing but his farewell performance was clearly over the defeat of the raparee had bested the courage of the horde they had fled leaving butterfield alone at the top of the stairs this wont be forgotten or forgiven he said to harry theres no rest for you ever i am your enemy i hope so said harry he looked back towards swann leaving butterfield to his retreat the magician had laid himself down again his eyes were closed his hands replaced on his chest it was as if he had never moved but now the fire was showing its true teeth swanns flesh began to bubble his clothes to peel off in smuts and smoke it took a long while to do the job but eventually the fire reduced the man to ash by that time it was after dawn but today was sunday and harry knew there would be no visitors to interrupt his labours he would have time to gather up the remains to pound the boneshards and put them with the ashes in a carrier bag then he would go out and find himself a bridge or a dock and put swann into the river there was precious little of the magician left once the fire had done its work and nothing that vaguely resembled a man things came and went away that was a kind of magic and in between pursuits and conjurings horrors guises the occasional joy that there was room for joy ah that was magic too the life of death the newspaper was the first edition of the day and elaine devoured it from cover to cover as she sat in the hospital waiting room an animal thought to be a panther which had terrorised the neighbourhood of epping forest for two months had been shot and found to be a wild dog archaeologists in the sudan had discovered bone fragments which they opined might lead to a complete reappraisal of mans origins a young woman who had once danced with minor royalty had been found murdered near clapham a solo roundthe world yachtsman was missing recently excited hopes of a cure for the common cold had been dashed she read the global bulletins and the trivia with equal fervour anything to keep her mind off the examination ahead but todays news seemed very like yesterdays only the names had been changed doctor sennett informed her that she was healing well both inside and out and was quite fit to return to her full responsibilities whenever she felt psychologically resilient enough she should make another appointment for the first week of the new year he told her and come back for a final examination then she left him washing his hands of her the thought of getting straight onto the bus and heading back to her rooms was repugnant after so much time sitting and waiting she would walk a stop or two along the route she decided the exercise would be good for her and the december day though far from warm was bright her plans proved overambitious however after only a few minutes of walking her lower abdomen began to ache and she started to feel nauseous so she turned off the main road to seek out a place where she could rest and drink some tea she should eat too she knew though she had never had much appetite and had less still since the operation her wanderings were rewarded she found a small restaurant which though it was twelve fiftyfive was not enjoying a roaring lunchtime trade a small woman with unashamedly artificial red hair served her tea and a mushroom omelette she did her best to eat but didnt get very far the waitress was plainly concerned something wrong with the food she said somewhat testily oh no elaine reassured her its just me the waitress looked offended nevertheless td like some more tea though if i may elaine said she pushed the plate away from her hoping the waitress would claim it soon the sight of the meal congealing on the patternless plate was doing nothing for her mood she hated this unwelcome sensitivity in herself it was absurd that a plate of uneaten eggs should bring these doldrums on but she couldnt help herself she found everywhere little echoes of her own loss in the death by a benign november and then the sudden frosts of the bulbs in her windowsill box in the thought of the wild dog shed read of that morning shot in epping forest the waitress returned with fresh tea but failed to take the plate elaine called her back requesting that she do so grudgingly she obliged there were no customers left in the place now other than elaine and the waitress busied herself with removing the lunchtime menus from the tables and replacing them with those for the evening elaine sat staring out of the window veils of bluegrey smoke had crept down the street in recent minutes solidifying the sunlight theyre burning again the waitress said damn smell gets everywhere what are they burning used to be the community centre theyre knocking it down and building a new one its a waste of tax payers money the smoke was indeed creeping into the restaurant elaine did not find it offensive it was sweetly redolent of autumn her favourite season intrigued she finished her tea paid for her meal and then elected to wander along and find the source of the smoke she didnt have far to walk at the end of the street was a small square the demolition site dominated it there was one surprise however the building that the waitress had described as a community centre was in fact a church or had been the lead and slates had already been stripped off the roof leaving the joists bare to the sky the windows had been denuded of glass the turf had gone from the lawn at the side of the building and two trees had been felled there it was their pyre which provided the tantalising scent she doubted if the building had ever been beautiful but there was enough of its structure remaining for her to suppose it might have had charm its weathered stone was now completely at variance with the brick and concrete that surrounded it but its besieged situation the workmen labouring to undo it the bulldozer on hand hungry for rubble gave it a certain glamour one or two of the workmen noticed her standing watching them but none made any move to stop her as she walked across the square to the front porch of the church and peered inside the interior stripped of its decorative stonework of pulpit pews font and the rest was simply a stone room completely lacking in atmosphere or authority somebody however had found a source of interest here at the far end of the church a man stood with his back to elaine staring intently at the ground hearing footsteps behind him he looked round guiltily oh he said i wont be a moment its all right elaine said i think were probably both trespassing the man nodded he was dressed soberly even drearily but for his green bowtie his features despite the garb and the grey hairs of a man in middleage were curiously unlined as though neither smile nor frown much ruffled their perfect indifference sad isnt it he said seeing a place like this did you know the church as it used to be i came in on occasion he said but it was never very popular whats it called all saints it was built in the late seventeenth century i believe are you fond of churches not particularly it was just that i saw the smoke and everybody likes a demolition scene he said yes she replied i suppose thats true its like watching a funeral better them than us eh she murmured something in agreement her mind flitting elsewhere back to the hospital to her pain and her present healing to her life saved only by losing the capacity for further life better them than us my names kavanagh he said covering the short distance between them his hand extended how do you do she said tm elaine rider elaine he said charming are you just taking a final look at the place before it comes down thats right ive been looking at the inscriptions on the floor stones some of them are most eloquent he brushed a fragment of timber off one of the tablets with his foot it seems such a loss im sure theyll just smash the stones to smithereens when they start to pull the floor up she looked down at the patchwork of tablets beneath her feet not all were marked and of those that were many simply carried names and dates there were some inscriptions however one to the left of where kavanagh was standing carried an all but eroded relief of crossed shinbones like drumsticks and the abrupt motto redeem the time i think there must have been a crypt under here at some time kavanagh said oh i see and these are the people who were buried there well i cant think of any other reason for the inscriptions can you i was thinking of asking the work men he paused in midsentence youll probably think this positively morbid of me what well just to preserve one or two of the finer stones from being destroyed i dont think thats morbid she said theyre very beautiful he was evidently encouraged by her response maybe i should speak with them now he said would you excuse me for a moment he left her standing in the nave like a forsaken bride while he went out to quiz one of the workmen she wandered down to where the altar had been reading the names as she went who knew or cared about these peoples resting places now dead two hundred years and more and gone away not into loving posterity but into oblivion and suddenly the unarticulated hopes for an afterlife she had nursed through her thirtyfour years slipped away she was no longer weighed down by some vague ambition for heaven ont day perhaps this day she would die just as these people had died and it wouldnt matter a jot there was nothing to come nothing to aspire to nothing to dream of she stood in a patch of smokethickened sun thinking of this and was almost happy kavanagh returned from his exchanges with the foreman there is indeed a crypt he said but it hasnt been emptied yet oh they were still underfoot she thought dust and bones apparently theyre having some difficulty getting into it all the entrances have been sealed up thats why theyre digging around the foundations to find another way in are crypts normally sealed up not as thoroughly as this one maybe there was no more room she said kavanagh took the comment quite seriously maybe he said will they give you one of the stones he shook his head its not up to them to say these are just council lackeys apparently they have a firm of professional excavators to come in and shift the bodies to new burial sites it all has to be done with due decorum much they care elaine said looking down at the stones again i must agree kavanagh replied it all seems in excess of the facts but then perhaps were not god fearing enough probably anyhow they told me to come back in a day or twos time and ask the removal men she laughed at the thought of the dead moving house packing up their goods and chattels kavanagh was pleased to have made a joke even if it had been unintentional riding on the crest of this success he said i wonder may i take you for a drink i wouldnt be very good company im afraid she said im really very tired we could perhaps meet later he said she looked away from his eager face he was pleasant enough in his uneventful way she liked his green bowtie surely a joke at the expense of his own drabness she liked his seriousness too but she couldnt face the idea of drinking with him at least not tonight she made her apologies and explained that shed been ill recently and hadnt recovered her stamina another night perhaps he enquired gently the lack of aggression in his courtship was persuasive and she said that would be nice thank you before they parted they exchanged telephone num bers he seemed charmingly excited by the thought of their meeting again it made her feel despite all that had been taken from her that she still had her sex she returned to the flat to find both a parcel from mitch and a hungry cat on the doorstep she fed the demanding animal then made herself some coffee and opened the parcel in it cocooned in several layers of tissue paper she found a silk scarf chosen with mitchs uncanny eye for her taste the note along with it simply said its your colour i love you mitch she wanted to pick up the telephone on the spot and talk to him but somehow the thought of hearing his voice seemed dangerous too close to the hurt perhaps he would ask her how she felt and she would reply that she was well and he would insist yes but really and she would say im empty they took out half my innards damn you and ill never have your children or anybody elses so thats the end of that isnt it even thinking about their talking she felt tears threaten and in a fit of inexplicable rage she wrapped the scarf up in the desiccated paper and buried it at the back of her deepest drawer damn him for trying to make things better now when at the time shed most needed him all hed talked of was fatherhood and how her tumours would deny it him it was a clear evening the skys cold skin stretched to breaking point she did not want to draw the curtains in the front room even though passersby would stare in because the deepening blue was too fine to miss so she sat at the window and watched the dark come only when the last change had been wrought did she close off the chill she had no appetite but she made herself some food nevertheless and sat down to watch television as she ate the food unfinished she laid down her tray and dozed the programmes filtering through to her intermittently some witless comedian whose merest cough sent his audience into paroxysms a natural history programme on life in the serengeti the news she had read all that she needed to know that morning the headlines hadnt changed one item however did pique her curiosity an interview with the solo yachtsman michael may bury who had been picked up that day after two weeks adrift in the pacific the interview was being beamed from australia and the contact was bad the image of mayburys bearded and sunscorched face was constantly threatened with being snowed out the picture mattered little the account he gave of his failed voyage was riveting in sound alone and in particular an event that seemed to distress him afresh even as he told it he had been becalmed and as his vessel lacked a motor had been obliged to wait for wind it had not come a week had gone by with his hardly moving a kilometre from the same spot of listless ocean no bird or passing ship broke the monotony with every hour that passed his claustrophobia grew and on the eighth day it reached panic proportions so he let himself over the side of the yacht and swam away from the vessel a lifeline tied about his middle in order to escape the same few yards of deck but once away from the yacht and treading the still warm water he had no desire to go back why not untie the knot hed thought to himself and float away what made you change your mind the interviewer asked here may bury frowned he had clearly reached the crux of his story but didnt want to finish it the interviewer repeated the question at last hesitantly the sailor responded i looked back at the yacht he said and i saw somebody on the deck the interviewer not certain that hed heard correctly said somebody on the deck thats right maybury replied somebody was there i saw a figure quite clearly moving around did you did you recognise this stowaway the question came mayburys face closed down sensing that his story was being treated with mild sarcasm who was it the interviewer pressed i dont know maybury said death i suppose the questioner was momentarily lost for words but of course you returned to the boat eventually of course and there was no sign of anybody maybury glanced up at the interviewer and a look of contempt crossed his face ive survived havent i he said the interviewer mumbled something about not understanding his point i didnt drown maybury said i could have died then if id wanted to slipped off the rope and drowned but you didnt and the next day the next day the wind picked up its an extraordinary story the interviewer said con tent that the stickiest part of the exchange was now safely bypassed you must be looking forward to seeing your family again for christmas elaine didnt hear the final exchange of pleasantries her imagination was tied by a fine rope to the room she was sitting in her fingers toyed with the knot if death could find a boat in the wastes of the pacific how much easier it must be to find her to sit with her perhaps as she slept to watch her as she went about her mourning she stood up and turned the television off the flat was suddenly silent she questioned the hush impatiently but it held no sign of guests welcome or unwelcome as she listened she could taste saltwater ocean no doubt she had been offered several refuges in which to convalesce when she came out of hospital her father had invited her up to aberdeen her sister rachel had made several appeals for her to spend a few weeks in buckinghamshire there had even been a pitiful telephone call from mitch in which he had talked of their holidaying together she had rejected them all telling them that she wanted to reestablish the rhythm of her previous life as soon as possible to return to her job to her working colleagues and friends in fact her reasons had gone deeper than that she had feared their sympathies feared that she would be held too close in their affections and quickly come to rely upon them her streak of independence which had first brought her to this unfriendly city was in studied defiance of her smothering appetite for security if she gave in to those loving appeals she knew she would take root in domestic soil and not look up and out again for another year in which time what adventures might have passed her by instead she had returned to work as soon as she felt able hoping that although she had not taken on all her former responsibilities the familiar routines would help her to reestablish a normal life but the sleightofhand was not entirely successful every few days something would happen she would overhear some remark or catch a look that she was not intended to see that made her realise she was being treated with a rehearsed caution that her colleagues viewed her as being fundamentally changed by her illness it had made her angry shed wanted to spit her suspicions in their faces tell them that she and her uterus were not synonymous and that the removal of one did not imply the eclipse of the other but today returning to the office she was not so certain they werent correct she felt as though she hadnt slept in weeks though in fact she was sleeping long and deeply every night her eyesight was blurred and there was a curious remoteness about her experiences that day that she associated with extreme fatigue as if she were drifting further and further from the work on her desk from her sensations from her very thoughts twice that morning she caught herself speaking and then wondered who it was who was conceiving of these words it certainly wasnt her she was too busy listening and then an hour after lunch things had suddenly taken a turn for the worse she had been called into her supervisors office and asked to sit down are you all right elaine mr chimes had asked yes shed told him im fine theres been some concern about what chimes looked slightly embarrassed your beha viour he finally said please dont think im prying elaine its just that if you need some further time to recuperate theres nothing wrong with me but your weeping what the way youve been crying today it concerns us cry shed said i dont cry the supervisor seemed baffled but youve been crying all day youre crying now elaine put a tentative hand to her cheek and yes yes she was crying her cheek was wet shed stood up shocked at her own conduct i didnt i didnt know she said though the words sounded preposterous they were true she hadnt known only now with the fact pointed out did she taste tears in her throat and sinuses and with that taste came a memory of when this eccentricity had begun in front of the television the night before why dont you take the rest of the day off yes take the rest of the week if youd like chimes said youre a valued member of staff elaine i dont have to tell you that we dont want you coming to any harm this last remark struck home with stinging force did they think she was verging on suicide was that why she was treated with kid gloves they were only tears she was shedding for gods sake and she was so indifferent to them she had not even known they were falling ill go home she said thank you for your concern the supervisor looked at her with some dismay it must have been a very traumatic experience he said we all understand we really do if you feel you want to talk about it at any time she declined but thanked him again and left the office face to face with herself in the mirror of the womens toilets she realised just how bad she looked her skin was flushed her eyes swollen she did what she could to conceal the signs of this painless grief then picked up her coat and started home as she reached the underground station she knew that returning to the empty flat would not be a wise idea she would brood she would sleep so much sleep of late and so perfectly dreamless but she would not improve her mental condition by either route it was the bell of holy innocents tolling in the clear afternoon that reminded her of the smoke and the square and mr kavanagh there she decided was a fit place for her to walk she could enjoy the sunlight and think maybe she would meet her admirer again she found her way back to all saints easily enough but there was disappointment awaiting her the demo lition site had been cordoned off the boundary marked by a row of posts a red fluorescent ribbon looped between them the site was guarded by no less than four policemen who were ushering pedestrians towards a detour around the square the workers and their hammers had been exiled from the shadows of all saints and now a very different selection of people suited and academic occupied the zone beyond the ribbon some in furrowed conversation others standing on the muddy ground and staring up quizzically at the derelict church the south transept and much of the area around it had been curtained off from public view by an arrangement of tarpaulins and black plastic sheeting occasionally somebody would emerge from behind this veil and consult with others on the site all who did so she noted were wearing gloves one or two were also masked it was as though they were performing some ad hoc surgery in the shelter of the screen a tumour perhaps in the bowels of all saints she approached one of the officers whats going on the foundations are unstable he told her appar ently the place could fall down at any moment why are they wearing masks its just a precaution against the dust she didnt argue though this explanation struck her as unlikely if you want to get through to temple street youll have to go round the back the officer said what she really wanted to do was to stand and watch proceedings but the proximity of the uniformed quartet intimidated her and she decided to give up and go home as she began to make her way back to the main road she caught sight of a familiar figure crossing the end of an adjacent street it was unmistakably kavanagh she called after him though he had already disappeared and was pleased to see him step back into view and return a nod to her well well he said as he came down to meet her i didnt expect to see you again so soon i came to watch the rest of the demolition she said his face was ruddy with the cold and his eyes were shining tm so pleased he said do you want to have some afternoon tea theres a place just around the corner td like that as they walked she asked him if he knew what was going on at all saints its the crypt he said confirming her suspicions they opened it they certainly found a way in i was here this morning about your stones thats right they were already putting up the tarpaulins then some of them were wearing masks it wont smell very fresh down there not after so long thinking of the curtain of tarpaulin drawn between her and the mystery within she said i wonder what its like a wonderland kavanagh replied it was an odd response and she didnt query it at least not on the spot but later when theyd sat and talked together for an hour and she felt easier with him she returned to the comment what you said about the crypt yes about it being a wonderland did i say that he replied somewhat sheepishly what must you think of me i was just puzzled wondered what you meant i like places where the dead are he said i always have cemeteries can be very beautiful dont you think mausoleums and tombs all the fine craftsmanship that goes into those places even the dead may sometimes reward closer scrutiny he looked at her to see if he had strayed beyond her taste threshold but seeing that she only looked at him with quiet fascination continued they can be very beautiful on occasion its a sort of a glamour they have its a shame its wasted on morticians and funeral directors he made a small mischievous grin im sure theres much to be seen in that crypt strange sights wonderful sights i only ever saw one dead person my grandmother i was very young at the time i trust it was a pivotal experience i dont think so in fact i scarcely remember it at all i only remember how everybody cried ah he nodded sagely so selfish he said dont you think spoiling a farewell with snot and sobs again he looked at her to gauge the response again he was satisfied that she would not take offence we cry for ourselves dont we not for the dead the dead are past caring she made a small soft yes and then more loudly my god yes thats right always for ourselves you see how much the dead can teach just by lying there twiddling their thumbbones she laughed he joined her in laughter she had mis judged him on that initial meeting thinking his face unused to smiles it was not but his features when the laughter died swiftly regained that eerie quiescence she had first noticed when after a further half hour of his laconic remarks he told her he had appointments to keep and had to be on his way she thanked him for his company and said nobodys made me laugh so much in weeks im grateful you should laugh he told her it suits you then added you have beautiful teeth she thought of this odd remark when hed gone as she did of a dozen others he had made through the afternoon he was undoubtedly one of the most offbeat individuals shed ever encountered but he had come into her life with his eagerness to talk of crypts and the dead and the beauty of her teeth at just the right moment he was the perfect distraction from her buried sorrows making her present aberrations seem minor stuff beside his own when she started home she was in high spirits if she had not known herself better she might have thought herself half in love with him on the journey back and later that evening she thought particularly of the joke he had made about the dead twiddling their thumbbones and that thought led inevitably to the mysteries that lay out of sight in the crypt her curiosity once aroused was not easily silenced it grew on her steadily that she badly wanted to slip through that cordon of ribbon and see the burial chamber with her own eyes it was a desire she would never previously have admitted to herself how many times had she walked from the site of an accident telling herself to control the shameful inquisitiveness she felt but kavanagh had legitimised her appetite with his flagrant enthusiasm for things funereal now with the taboo shed she wanted to go back to all saints and look death in its face then next time she saw kavanagh she would have some stories to tell of her own the idea no sooner budded came to full flower and in the middle of the evening she dressed for the street again and headed back towards the square she didnt reach all saints until well after eleven thirty but there were still signs of activity at the site lights mounted on stands and on the wall of the church itself poured illumination on the scene a trio of technicians kavanaghs socalled removal men stood outside the tarpaulin shelter their faces drawn with fatigue their breath clouding the frosty air she stayed out of sight and watched the scene she was growing steadily colder and her scars had begun to ache but it was apparent that the nights work on the crypt was more or less over after some brief exchange with the police the technicians departed they had extinguished all but one of the floodlights leaving the site church tarpaulin and rimy mud in grim chiaroscuro the two officers who had been left on guard were not overconscientious in their duties what idiot they apparently reasoned would come graverobbing at this hour and in such temperatures after a few minutes keeping a footstamping vigil they withdrew to the relative comfort of the workmens hut when they did not reemerge elaine crept out of hiding and moved as cautiously as possible to the ribbon that divided one zone from the other a radio had been turned on in the hut its noise music for lovers from dusk to dawn the distant voice purred covered her crackling advance across the frozen earth once beyond the cordon and into the forbidden territory beyond she was not so hesitant she swiftly crossed the hard ground its wheelploughed furrows like concrete into the lee of the church the floodlight was dazzling by it her breath appeared as solid as yesterdays smoke had seemed behind her the music for lovers murmured on no one emerged from the hut to summon her from her trespassing no alarmbells rang she reached the edge of the tarpaulin curtain without incident and peered at the scene concealed behind it the demolition men under very specific instructions to judge by the care they had taken in their labours had dug fully eight feet down the side of all saints exposing the foundations in so doing they had uncovered an entrance to the burialchamber which previous hands had been at pains to conceal not only had earth been piled up against the flank of the church to hide the entrance but the crypt door had also been removed and stone masons sealed the entire aperture up this had clearly been done at some speed their handiwork was far from ordered they had simply filled the entrance up with any stone or brick that had come to hand and plastered coarse mortar over their endeavours into this mortar though the design had been spoiled by the excavations some artisan had scrawled a sixfoot cross all their efforts in securing the crypt and marking the mortar to keep the godless out had gone for nothing however the seal had been broken the mortar hacked at the stones torn away there was now a small hole in the middle of the doorway large enough for one person to gain access to the interior elaine had no hesitation in climbing down the slope to the breached wall and then squirming through she had predicted the darkness she met on the other side and had brought with her a cigarette lighter mitch had given her three years ago she flicked it on the flame was small she turned up the wick and by the swelling light investigated the space ahead of her it was not the crypt itself she had stepped into but a narrow vestibule of some kind a yard or so in front of her was another wall and another door this one had not been replaced with bricks though into its solid timbers a second cross had been gouged she approached the door the lock had been removed by the investigators presumably and the door then held shut again with a rope binding this had been done quickly by tired fingers she did not find the rope difficult to untie though it required both hands and so had to be effected in the dark as she worked the knot free she heard voices the policemen damn them had left the seclusion of their hut and come out into the bitter night to do their rounds she let the rope be and pressed herself against the inside wall of the vestibule the officers voices were becoming louder talking of their children and the escalating cost of christmas joy now they were within yards of the crypt entrance standing or so she guessed in the shelter of the tarpaulin they made no attempt to descend the slope however but finished their cursory inspection on the lip of the earthworks then turned back their voices faded satisfied that they were out of sight and hearing of her she reignited the flame and returned to the door it was large and brutally heavy her first attempt at hauling it open met with little success she tried again and this time it moved grating across the grit on the vestibule floor once it was open the vital inches required for her to squeeze through she eased her straining the lighter guttered as though a breath had blown from within the flame briefly burned not yellow but electric blue she didnt pause to admire it but slid into the promised wonderland now the flame fed became livid and for an instant its sudden brightness took her sight away she pressed the corners of her eyes to clear them and looked again so this was death there was none of the art or the glamour kavanagh had talked of no calm laying out of shrouded beauties on cool marble sheets no elaborate reliquaries nor aphorisms on the nature of human frailty not even names and dates in most cases the corpses lacked even coffins the crypt was a charnelhouse bodies had been thrown in heaps on every side entire families pressed into niches that were designed to hold a single casket dozens more left where hasty and careless hands had tossed them the scene though absolutely still was rife with panic it was there in the faces that stared from the piles of dead mouths wide in silent protest sockets in which eyes had withered gaping in shock at such treatment it was there too in the way the system of burial had degenerated from the ordered arrangement of caskets at the far end of the crypt to the haphazard piling of crudely made coffins their wood unplaned their lids unmarked but for a scrawled cross and thence finally to this hurried heaping of unhoused carcasses all concern for dignity perhaps even for the rites of passage forgotten in the rising hysteria there had been a disaster of that she could have no doubt a sudden influx of bodies men women children there was a baby at her feet who could not have lived a day who had died in such escalating numbers that there was not even time to close their eyelids before they were shunted away into this pit perhaps the coffinmakers had also died and were thrown here amongst their clients the shroudsewers too and the priests all gone in one apocalyptic month their surviving relatives too shocked or too frightened to consider the niceties but only eager to have the dead thrust out of sight where they would never have to look on their flesh again there was much of that flesh still in evidence the sealing of the crypt closing it off from the decaying air had kept the occupants intact now with the violation of this secret chamber the heat of decay had been rekindled and the tissues were deteriorating afresh everywhere she saw rot at work making sores and suppurations blisters and pustules she raised the flame to see better though the stench of spoilage was beginning to crowd upon her and make her dizzy everywhere her eyes travelled she seemed to alight upon some pitiful sight two children laid together as if sleeping in each others arms a woman whose last act it appeared had been to paint her sickened face so as to die more fit for the marriagebed than the grave she could not help but stare though her fascination cheated them of privacy there was so much to see and remember she could never be the same could she having viewed these scenes one corpse lying halfhidden beneath another drew her particular attention a woman whose long chestnutcoloured hair flowed from her scalp so copiously elaine envied it she moved closer to get a better look and then putting the last of her squeamishness to flight took hold of the body thrown across the woman and hauled it away the flesh of the corpse was greasy to the touch and left her lingers stained but she was not distressed the uncovered corpse lay with her legs wide but the constant weight of her companion had bent them into an impossible configuration the wound that had killed her had bloodied her thighs and glued her skirt to her abdomen and groin had she miscarried elaine wondered or had some disease devoured her there she stared and stared bending close to study the faraway look on the womans rotted face such a place to lie she thought with your blood still shaming you she would tell kavanagh when next she saw him how wrong he had been with his sentimental tales of calm beneath the sod she had seen enough more than enough she wiped her hands upon her coat and made her way back to the door closing it behind her and knotting up the rope again as she had found it then she climbed the slope into the clean air the policemen were nowhere in sight and she slipped away unseen like a shadows shadow there was nothing for her to feel once she had mastered her initial disgust and that twinge of pity shed felt seeing the children and the woman with the chestnut hair and even those responses even the pity and the repugnance were quite manageable she had felt both more acutely seeing a dog run down by a car than she had standing in the crypt of all saints despite the horrid displays on every side when she laid her head down to sleep that night and realised that she was neither trembling nor nauseous she felt strong what was there to fear in all the world if the spectacle of mortality she had just witnessed could be borne so readily she slept deeply and woke refreshed she went back to work that morning apologising to chimes for her behaviour of the previous day and reassuring him that she was now feeling happier than shed felt in months in order to prove her rehabilitation she was as gregarious as she could be striking up conversations with neglected acquaintances and giving her smile a ready airing this met with some initial resistance she could sense her colleagues doubting that this bout of sunshine actually meant a summer but when the mood was sustained throughout the day and through the day following they began to respond more readily by thursday it was as though the tears of earlier in the week had never been shed people told her how well she was looking it was true her mirror confirmed the rumours her eyes shone her skin shone she was a picture of vitality on thursday afternoon she was sitting at her desk working through a backlog of inquiries when one of the secretaries appeared from the corridor and began to babble somebody went to the womans aid through the sobs it was apparent she was talking about bernice a woman elaine knew well enough to exchange smiles with on the stairs but no better there had been an accident it seemed the woman was talking about blood on the floor elaine got up and joined those who were making their way out to see what the fuss was about the supervisor was already standing outside the womens lavatories vainly instructing the curious to keep clear somebody else another witness it seemed was offering her account of events she was just standing there and suddenly she started to shake i thought she was having a fit blood started to come from her nose then from her mouth pouring out theres nothing to see chimes insisted please keep back but he was substantially ignored blankets were being brought to wrap around the woman and as soon as the toilet door was opened again the sightseers pressed forward elaine caught sight of a form moving about on the toilet floor as if convulsed by cramps she had no wish to see any more leaving the others to throng the corridor talking loudly of bernice as if she were already dead elaine returned to her desk she had so much to do so many wasted grieving days to catch up on an apt phrase flitted into her head redeem the time she wrote the three words on her notebook as a reminder where did they come from she couldnt recall it didnt matter sometimes there was wisdom in forgetting kavanagh rang her that evening and invited her out to dinner the following night she had to decline however eager as she was to discuss her recent exploits because a small party was being thrown by several of her friends to celebrate her return to health would he care to join them she asked he thanked her for the invitation but replied that large numbers of people had always intimidated him she told him not to be foolish that her circle would be pleased to meet him and she to show him off but he replied he would only put in an appearance if his ego felt the equal of it and that if he didnt show up he hoped she wouldnt offended she soothed such fears before the conversation came to an end she slyly mentioned that next time they met she had a tale to tell the following day brought unhappy news bernice had died in the early hours of friday morning without ever regaining consciousness the cause of death was as yet unverified but the office gossips concurred that she had never been a strong woman always the first amongst the secretaries to catch a cold and the last to shake it off there was also some talk though traded less loudly about her personal behaviour she had been generous with her favours it appeared and injudicious in her choice of partners with venereal diseases reaching epidemic proportions was that not the likeliest explanation for the death the news though it kept the rumourmongers in business was not good for general morale two girls went sick that morning and at lunchtime it seemed that elaine was the only member of staff with an appetite she compensated for the lack in her colleagues however she had a fierce hunger in her her body almost seemed to ache for sustenance it was a good feeling after so many months of lassitude when she looked around at the worn faces at the table she felt utterly apart from them from their tittletattle and their trivial opinions from the way their talk circled on the suddenness of bernices death as though they had not given the subject a moments thought in years and were amazed that their neglect had not rendered it extinct elaine knew better she had come close to death so often in the recent past during the months leading up to her hysterectomy when the tumours had suddenly doubled in size as though sensing that they were plotted against on the operating table when twice the surgeons thought theyd lost her and most recently in the crypt face to face with those gawping carcasses death was everywhere that they should be so startled by its entrance into their charmless circle struck her as almost comical she ate lustily and let them talk in whispers they gathered for her party at reubens house elaine hermione sam and nellwyn josh and sonja it was a good night a chance to pick up on how mutual friends were faring how statuses and ambitions were on the change everyone got drunk very quickly tongues already loosened by familiarity became progressively looser nellwyn led a tearful toast to elaine josh and sonja had a short but acrimonious exchange on the subject of evangelism reuben did his impersonations of fellow barristers it was like old times except that memory had yet to improve it kavanagh did not put in an appearance and elaine was glad of it despite her protestations when speaking to him she knew he would have felt out of place in such closeknit company about half past midnight when the room had settled into a number of quiet exchanges hermione mentioned the yachtsman though she was almost across the room elaine heard the sailors name mentioned quite distinctly she broke off her conversation with nellwyn and picked her way through the sprawling limbs to join hermione and sam i heard you talking about maybury she said yes said hermione sam and i were just saying how strange it all was i saw him on the news elaine said sad story isnt it sam commented the way it happened why sad him saying that about death being on the boat with him and then dying hermione said dying said elaine when was this it was in all the papers i havent been concentrating that much elaine replied what happened he was killed sam said they were taking him to the airport to fly him home and there was an accident he was killed just like that he snapped his middle finger and thumb out like a light so sad said hermione she glanced at elaine and a frown crept across her face the look baffled elaine until with that same shock of recognition shed felt in chimes office discovering her tears she realized that she was smiling so the sailor was dead when the party broke up in the early hours of saturday morning when the embraces and the kisses were over and she was home again she thought over the maybury interview shed heard summoning a face scorched by the sun and eyes peeled by the wastes hed almost been lost to thinking of his mixture of detachment and faint embarrassment as hed told the tale of his stowaway and of course those final words of his when pressed to identify the stranger death i suppose hed said hed been right she woke up late on saturday morning without the anticipated hangover there was a letter from mi ten she didnt open it but left it on the mantelpiece for an idle moment later in the day the first snow of winter was in the wind though it was too wet to make any serious impression on the streets the chill was biting enough however to judge by the scowls on the faces of passersby she felt oddly immune from it however though she had no heating on in the flat she walked around in her bathrobe and barefoot as though she had a fire stoked in her belly after coffee she went through to wash there was a spider clot of hair in the plug hole she fished it out and dropped it down the lavatory then returned to the sink since the removal of the dressings she had studiously avoided any close scrutiny of her body but today her qualms and her vanity seemed to have disappeared she stripped off her robe and looked herself over critically she was pleased with what she saw her breasts were full and dark her skin had a pleasing sheen to it her pubic hair had regrown more lushly than ever the scars themselves still looked and felt tender but her eyes read their lividness as a sign of her cunts ambition as though any day now her sex would grow from anus to navel and beyond perhaps opening her up making her terrible it was paradoxical surely that it was only now when the surgeons had emptied her out that she should feel so ripe so resplendent she stood for fully half an hour in front of the mirror admiring herself her thoughts drifting off eventually she returned to the chore of washing that done she went back into the front room still naked she had no desire to conceal herself quite the other way about it was all she could do to prevent herself from stepping out into the snow and giving the whole street something to remember her by she crossed to the window thinking a dozen such foolish thoughts the snow had thickened through the flurries she caught a movement in the alley between the houses opposite somebody was there watching her though she couldnt see who she didnt mind she stood peeping at the peeper wondering if he would have the courage to show himself but he did not she watched for several minutes before she realised that her brazenness had frightened him away disap pointed she wandered back to the bedroom and got dressed it was time she found herself something to eat she had that familiar fierce hunger upon her the fridge was practically empty she would have to go out and stock up for the weekend supermarkets were circuses especially on a saturday but her mood was far too buoyant to be depressed by having to make her way through the crowds today she even found some pleasure in these scenes of conspicuous consumption in the trolleys and the baskets heaped high with foodstuffs and the children greedyeyed as they approached the confectionery and tearful if denied it and the wives weighing up the merits of a leg of mutton while their husbands watched the girls on the staff with eyes no less calculating she purchased twice as much food for the weekend as she would normally have done in a full week her appetite driven to distraction by the smells from the delicatessen and fresh meat counters by the time she reached the house she was almost shaking with the anticipation of sustenance as she put the bags down on the front step and fumbled for her keys she heard a car door slam behind her elaine it was hermione the red wine shed consumed the previous night had left her looking blotchy and stale are you feeling all right elaine asked the point is are you hermione wanted to know yes im fine why shouldnt i be hermione returned a harried look sonjas gone down with some kind of food poisoning and sos reuben i just came round to see that you were all right as i say fine i dont understand it what about nellwyn and dick i couldnt get an answer at their place but reubens in a bad way theyve taken him into hospital for tests do you want to come in and have a cup of coffee no thanks ive got to get back to see sonja i just didnt like to think of your being on your own if youd gone down with it too elaine smiled youre an angel she said and kissed hermione on the cheek the gesture seemed to startle the other woman for some reason she stepped back the kiss exchanged staring at elaine with a vague puzzlement in her eyes i must i must go she said fixing her face as though it would betray her til call you later in the day elaine said and find out how theyre doing fine hermione turned away and crossed the pavement to her car though she made a cursory attempt to conceal the gesture elaine caught sight of her putting her fingers to the spot on her cheek where she had been kissed and scratching at it as if to eradicate the contact it was not the season for flies but those that had survived the recent cold buzzed around in the kitchen as elaine selected some bread smoked ham and garlic sausage from her purchases and sat down to eat she was ravenous in five minutes or less she had devoured the meats and made substantial inroads into the loaf and her hunger was scarcely tamed settling to a dessert of figs and cheese she thought of the paltry omelette shed been unable to finish that day after the visit to the hospital one thought led to another from omelette to smoke to the square to kavanagh to her most recent visit to the church and thinking of the place she was suddenly seized by an enthusiasm to see it one final time before it was entirely levelled she was probably too late already the bodies would have been parcelled up and removed the crypt decontaminated and scoured the walls would be rubble but she knew she would not be satisfied until she had seen it for herself even after a meal which would have sickened her with its excess a few days before she felt lightheaded as she set out for all saints almost as though she were drunk not the maudlin drunkenness she had been prone to when with mitch but a euphoria which made her feel wellnigh invulnerable as if she had at last located some bright and incorruptible part of herself and no harm would ever befall her again she had prepared herself for finding all saints in ruins but she did not the building still stood its walls untouched its beams still dividing the sky perhaps it too could not be toppled she mused perhaps she and it were twin immortals the suspicion was reinforced by the gaggle of fresh worshippers the church had attracted the police guard had trebled since the day shed been here and the tarpaulin that had shielded the crypt entrance from sight was now a vast tent supported by scaffolding which entirely encompassed the flank of the building the altarservers standing in close proximity to the tent wore masks and gloves the high priests the chosen few who were actually allowed into the holy of holies were entirely garbed in protective suits she watched from the cordon the signs and genu flections between the devotees the sluicing down of the suited men as they emerged from behind the veil the fine spray of fumigants which filled the air like bitter incense another onlooker was quizzing one of the officers why the suits in case its contagious the reply came after all these years they dont know what theyve got in there diseases dont last do they its a plaguepit the officer said theyre just being cautious elaine listened to the exchange and her tongue itched to speak she could save them their investigations with a few words after all she was living proof that whatever pestilence had destroyed the families in the crypt it was no longer virulent she had breathed that air she had touched that mouldy flesh and she felt healthier now than she had in years but they would not thank her for her revelations would they they were too engrossed in their rituals perhaps even excited by the discovery of such horrors their turmoil fuelled and fired by the possibility that this death was still living she would not be so unsporting as to sour their enthusiasm with a confession of her own rare good health instead she turned her back on the priests and their rites on the drizzle of incense in the air and began to walk away from the square as she looked up from her thoughts she glimpsed a familiar figure watching her from the corner of the adjacent street he turned away as she glanced up but it was undoubtedly kavanagh she called to him and went to the corner but he was walking smartly away from her head bowed again she called after him and now he turned a patently false look of surprise pasted onto his face and retrod his escaperoute to greet her have you heard what theyve found she asked him oh yes he replied despite the familiarity theyd last enjoyed she was reminded now of her first impression of him that he was not a man much conversant with feeling now youll never get your stones she said i suppose not he replied not overtly concerned at the loss she wanted to tell him that shed seen the plaguepit with her own eyes hoping the news would bring a gleam to his face but the corner of this sunlit street was an inappropriate spot for such talk besides it was almost as if he knew he looked at her so oddly the warmth of their previous meeting entirely gone why did you come back he asked her just to see she replied im flattered flattered that my enthusiasm for mausoleums is infectious still he watched her and she returning his look was conscious of how cold his eyes were and how perfectly shiny they might have been glass she thought and his skin suedeglued like a hood over the subtle architecture of his skull i should go she said business or pleasure neither she told him one or two of my friends are ill ah she had the impression that he wanted to be away that it was only fear of foolishness that kept him from running from her perhaps ill see you again she said sometime im sure he replied gratefully taking his cue and retreating along the street and to your friends my best regards even if she wanted to pass kavanaghs good wishes along to reuben and sonja she could not have done so hermione did not answer the telephone nor did any of the others the closest she came was to leave a message with reubens answering service the lightheadedness shed felt earlier in the day developed into a strange dreaminess as the afternoon inched towards evening she ate again but the feast did nothing to keep the fuguestate from deepening she felt quite well that sense of inviolability that had came upon her was still intact but time and again as the day wore on she found herself standing on the threshold of a room not knowing why she had come there or watching the light dwindle in the street outside without being quite certain if she was the viewer or the thing viewed she was happy with her company though as the flies were happy they kept buzzing attendance even though the dark fell about seven in the evening she heard a car draw up outside and the bell rang she went to the door of her flat but couldnt muster the inquisitiveness to open it step out into the hallway and admit callers it would be hermione again most probably and she didnt have any appetite for gloomy talk didnt want anybodys company in fact but that of the flies the callers insisted on the bell the more they insisted the more determined she became not to reply she slid down the wall beside the flat door and listened to the muted debate that now began on the step it wasnt hermione it was nobody she recognized now they systematically rang the bells of the flats above until mr prudhoe came down from the top flat talking to himself as he went and opened the door to them of the conversation that followed she caught sufficient only to grasp the urgency of their mission but her dishevelled mind hadnt the persistence to attend to the details they persuaded prudhoe to allow them into the hallway they approached the door of her flat and rapped upon it calling her name she didnt reply they rapped again exchanging words of frustration she wondered if they could hear her smiling in the darkness at last after a further exchange with prudhoe they left her to herself she didnt know how long she sat on her haunches beside the door but when she stood up again her lower limbs were entirely numb and she was hungry she ate voraciously more or less finishing off all the purchases of that morning the flies seemed to have procreated in the intervening hours they crawled on the table and picked at her slops she let them eat they too had their lives to live finally she decided to take some air no sooner had she stepped out of her flat however than the vigilant prudhoe was at the top of the stairs and calling down to her miss rider wait a moment i have a message for you she contemplated closing the door on him but she knew he would not rest until he had delivered his communique he hurried down the stairs a cassandra in shabby slippers there were policemen here he announced before he had even reached the bottom step they were looking for you oh she said did they say what they wanted to talk to you urgently two of your friends what about them they died he said this afternoon they have some kind of disease he had a sheet of notepaper in his hand this he now passed over to her relinquishing his hold an instant before she took it they left that number for you to call he said youve to contact them as soon as possible his message delivered he was already retiring up the stairs again elaine looked down at the sheet of paper with its scrawled figures by the time shed read the seven digits prudhoe had disappeared she went back into the flat for some reason she wasnt thinking of reuben or sonja who it seemed she would not see again but of the sailor maybury whod seen death and escaped it only to have it follow him like a loyal dog waiting its moment to leap and lick his face she sat beside the phone and stared at the numbers on the sheet and then at the fingers that held the sheet and at the hands that held the fingers was the touch that hung so innocently at the end of her arms now lethal was that what the detectives had come to tell her that her friends were dead by her good offices if so how many others had she brushed against and breathed upon in the days since her pestilential education at the crypt in the street in the bus in the supermarket at work at play she thought of bernice lying on the toilet floor and of hermione rubbing the spot where she had been kissed as if knowing some scourge had been passed along to her and suddenly she knew knew in her marrow that her pursuers were right in their suspicions and that all these dreamy days she had been nurturing a fatal child hence her hunger hence the glow of fulfilment she felt she put down the note and sat in the semidarkness trying to work out precisely the plagues location was it her fingertips in her belly in her eyes none and yet all of these her first assumption had been wrong it wasnt a child at all she didnt carry it in some particular cell it was everywhere she and it were synonymous that being so there could be no slicing out of the offending part as they had sliced out her tumours and all that had been devoured by them not that she would escape their attentions for that fact they had come looking for her hadnt they to take her back into the custody of sterile rooms to deprive her of her opinions and dignity to make her fit only for their loveless investigations the thought revolted her she would rather die as the chestnuthaired woman in the crypt had died sprawled in agonies than submit to them again she tore up the sheet of paper and let the litter drop it was too late for solutions anyway the removal men had opened the door and found death waiting on the other side eager for daylight she was its agent and it in its wisdom had granted her immunity had given her strength and a dreamy rapture had taken her fear away she in return had spread its word and there was no undoing those labours not now all the dozens maybe hundreds of people whom shed contaminated in the last few days would have gone back to their families and friends to their work places and their places of recreation and spread the word yet further they would have passed its fatal promise to their children as they tucked them into bed and to their mates in the act of love priests had no doubt given it with communion shopkeepers with change of a fivepound note while she was thinking of this of the disease spreading like fire in tinder the doorbell rang again they had come back for her and as before they were ringing the other bells in the house she could hear prudhoe coming downstairs this time he would know she was in he would tell them so they would hammer at the door and when she refused to answer as prudhoe opened the front door she unlocked the back as she slipped into the yard she heard voices at the flat door and then their rapping and their demands she unbolted the yard gate and fled into the darkness of the alleyway she already out of hearing range by the time they had beaten down the door she wanted most of all to go back to all saints but she knew that such a tactic would only invite arrest they would expect her to follow that route counting upon her adherence to the first cause but she wanted to see deaths face again now more than ever to speak with it to debate its strategies their strategies to ask why it had chosen her she emerged from the alleyway and watched the goingson at the front of the house from the corner of the street this time there were more than two men she counted four at least moving in and out of the house what were they doing peeking through her underwear and her loveletters most probably examining the sheets on her bed for stray hairs and the mirror for traces of her reflection but even if they turned the flat upsidedown if they examined every print and pronoun they wouldnt find the clues they sought let them search the lover had escaped only her tear stains remained and flies at the light bulb to sing her praises the night was starry but as she walked down to the centre of the city the brightness of the christmas illuminations festooning trees and buildings cancelled out their light most of the stores were well closed by this hour but a good number of windowshoppers still idled along the pavements she soon tired of the displays however of the baubles and the dummies and made her way off the main road and into the side streets it was darker here which suited her abstracted state of mind the sound of music and laughter escaped through open bar doors an argument erupted in an upstairs gamingroom blows were exchanged in one doorway two lovers defied discretion in another a man pissed with the gusto of a horse it was only now in the relative hush of these backwaters that she realised she was not alone footsteps followed her keeping a cautious distance but never straying far had the trackers followed her were they hemming her in even now preparing to snatch her into their closed order if so flight would only delay the inevitable better to confront them now and dare them to come within range of her pollution she slid into hiding and listened as the footsteps approached then stepped into view it was not the law but kavanagh her initial shock was almost immediately superseded by a sudden comprehension of why he had pursued her she studied him his skin was pulled so tight over his skull she could see the bone gleam in the dismal light how her whirling thoughts demanded had she not recognised him sooner not realised at that first meeting when hed talked of the dead and their glamour that he spoke as their maker i followed you he said all the way from the house he nodded what did they tell you he asked her the policemen what did they say nothing i hadnt already guessed she replied you knew in a manner of speaking i must have done in my heart of hearts remember our first conversation he murmured that he did all you said about death such egotism he grinned suddenly showing more bone yes he said what must you think of me it made a kind of sense to me even then i didnt know why at the time didnt know what the future would bring what does it bring he inquired of her softly she shrugged deaths been waiting for me all this time am i right oh yes he said pleased by her understanding of the situation between them he took a step towards her and reached to touch her face you are remarkable he said not really but to be so unmoved by it all so cold whats to be afraid of she said he stroked her cheek she almost expected his hood of skin to come unbuttoned then and the marbles that played in his sockets to tumble out and smash but he kept his disguise intact for appearances sake i want you he told her yes she said of course he did it had been in his every word from the beginning but she hadnt had the wit to comprehend it every love story was at the last a story of death this was what the poets insisted why should it be any less true the other way about they could not go back to his house the officers would be there too he told her for they must know of the romance between them nor of course could they return to her flat so they found a small hotel in the vicinity and took a room there even in the dingy lift he took the liberty of stroking her hair and then finding her compliant put his hand upon her breast the room was sparsely furnished but was lent some measure of charm by a splash of coloured lights from a christmas tree in the street below her lover didnt take his eyes off her for a single moment as if even now he expected her to turn tail and run at the merest flaw in his behaviour he neednt have concerned himself his treatment of her left little cause for complaint his kisses were insistent but not overpowering his undressing of her except for the fumbling a nice human touch she thought was a model of finesse and sweet solemnity she was surprised that he had not known about her scar only because she had become to believe this intimacy had begun on the operating table when twice she had gone into his arms and twice been denied them by the surgeons bullying but perhaps being no sentimentalist he had forgotten that first meeting whatever the reason he looked to be upset when he slipped off her dress and there was a trembling interval when she thought he would reject her but the moment passed and now he reached down to her abdomen and ran his fingers along the scar its beautiful he said she was happy i almost died under the anaesthetic she told him that would have been a waste he said reaching up her body and working at her breast it seemed to arouse him for his voice was more guttural when next he spoke what did they tell you he asked her moving his hands up the soft channel behind her clavicle and stroking her there she had not been touched in months except by disinfected hands his delicacy woke shivers in her she was so engrossed in pleasure that she failed to reply to his question he asked again as he moved between her legs what did they tell you through a haze of anticipation she said they left a number for me to ring so that i could be helped but you didnt want help no she breathed why should i she halfsaw his smile though her eyes wanted to flicker closed entirely his appearance failed to stir any passion in her indeed there was much about his disguise which she thought ridiculous with her eyes closed however she could forget such petty details she could strip the hood off and imagine him pure when she thought of him that way her mind pirouetted he took his hands from her she opened her eyes he was fumbling with his belt as he did so somebody shouted in the street outside his head jerked in the direction of the window his body tensed she was surprised at his sudden concern its all right she said he leaned forward and put his hand to her throat be quiet he instructed she looked up into his face he had begun to sweat the exchanges in the street went on for a few minutes longer it was simply two latenight gamblers parting he realized his error now i thought i heard what i thought i heard them calling my name who would do that she inquired fondly nobody knows were here he looked away from the window all purposefulness had abruptly drained from him after the instant of fear his features had slackened he looked almost stupid they came close he said but they never found me close coming to you he laid his head on her breasts so very close he murmured she could hear her pulse in her head but im swift he said and invisible his hand strayed back down to her scar and further and always neat he added she sighed as he stroked her they admire me for that im sure dont you think they must admire me for being so neat she remembered the chaos of the crypt its indignities its disorders not always she said he stopped stroking her oh yes he said oh yes i never spill blood thats a rule of mine never spill blood she smiled at his boasts she would tell him now though surely he already knew about her visit to all saints and the handiwork of his that shed seen there sometimes you cant help blood being spilt she said i dont hold it against you at these words he began to tremble what did they tell you about me what lies nothing she said mystified by his response what could they know im a professional he said to her his hand moving back up to her face she felt intentionality in him again a seriousness in his weight as he pressed closer upon her i wont have them lie about me he said i wont have it he lifted his head from her chest and looked at her all i do is stop the drummer he said the drummer i have to stop him cleanly in his tracks the wash of colours from the lights below painted his face one moment red the next green the next yellow unadulterated hues as in a childs paintbox i wont have them tell lies about me he said again to say i spill blood they told me nothing she assured him he had given up his pillow entirely and now moved to straddle her his hands were done with tender touches shall i show you how clean i am he said how easily i stop the drummer before she could reply his hands closed around her neck she had no time even to gasp let alone shout his thumbs were expert they found her windpipe and pressed she heard the drummer quicken its rhythm in her ears its quick and clean he was telling her the colours still coming in predictable sequence red yellow green red yellow green there was an error here she knew a terrible misunderstanding which she couldnt quite fathom she struggled to make some sense of it i dont understand she tried to tell him but her bruised larynx could produce no more than a gargling sound too late for excuses he said shaking his head you came to me remember you want the drummer stopped why else did you come his grip tightened yet further she had the sensation of her face swelling of the blood throbbing to jump from her eyes dont you see that they came to warn you about me frowning as he laboured they came to seduce you away from me by telling you i spilt blood no she squeezed the syllable out on her last breath but he only pressed harder to cancel her denial the drummer was deafeningly loud now though kavanaghs mouth still opened and closed she could no longer hear what he was telling her it mattered little she realised now that he was not death not the cleanboned guardian shed waited for in her eagerness she had given herself into the hands of a common killer a streetcorner cain she wanted to spit contempt at him but her consciousness was slipping the room the lights the face all throbbing to the drummers beat and then it all stopped she looked down on the bed her body lay sprawled across it one desperate hand had clutched at the sheet and clutched still though there was no life left in it her tongue protruded there was spittle on her blue lips but there was no blood she hovered her presence failing even to bring a breeze to the cobwebs in this corner of the ceiling and watched while kavanagh observed the rituals of hi crime he was bending over the body whispering in its ear as he rearranged it on the tangled sheets then he unbuttoned himself and unveiled that bone whose inflammation was the sincerest form of flattery what followed was comical in its gracelessness as her body was comical with its scars and its places where age puckered and plucked at it she watched his ungainly attempts at congress quite remotely his buttocks were pale and imprinted with the marks his underwear had left their motion put her in mind of a mechanical toy he kissed her as he worked and swallowed the pestilence with her spittle his hands came off her body gritty with her contagious cells he knew none of this of course he was perfectly innocent of what corruption he embraced and took into himself with every uninspired thrust at last he finished there was no gasp no cry he simply stopped his clockwork motion and climbed off her wiping himself with the edge of the sheet and buttoning himself up again guides were calling her she had journeys to make reunions to look forward to but she did not want to go at least not yet she steered the vehicle of her spirit to a fresh vantagepoint where she could better see kavanaghs face her sight or whatever sense this condition granted her saw clearly how his features were painted over a groundwork of muscle and how beneath that intricate scheme the bones sheened ah the bone he was not death of course and yet he was he had the face hadnt he and one day given decays blessing hed show it such a pity that a scraping of flesh came between it and the naked eye come away the voices insisted she knew they could not be fobbed off very much longer indeed there were some amongst them she thought she knew a moment she pleaded only a moment more kavanagh had finished his business at the murder scene he checked his appearance in the wardrobe mirror then went to the door she went with him intrigued by the utter banality of his expression he slipped out onto the silent landing and then down the stairs waiting for a moment when the nightporter was otherwise engaged before stepping out into the street and liberty was it dawn that washed the sky or the illuminations perhaps she had watched him from the corner of the room longer than shed thought hours passing as moments in the state she had so recently achieved only at the last was she rewarded for her vigil as a look she recognised crossed kavanaghs face hunger the man was hungry he would not die of the plague any more than she had its presence shone in him gave a fresh lustre to his skin and a new insistence to his belly he had come to her a minor murderer and was going from her as death writ large she laughed seeing the selffulfilling prophecy she had unwittingly engineered for an instant his pace slowed as if he might have heard her but no it was the drummer he was listening for beating louder than ever in his ear and demanding as he went a new and deadly vigour in his every step how spoilers bleed locke raised his eyes to the trees the wind was moving in them and the commotion of their laden branches sounded like the river in full spate one imper sonation of many when he had first come to the jungle he had been awed by the sheer multiplicity of beast and blossom the relentless parade of life here but he had learned better this burgeoning diversity was a sham the jungle pretending itself an artless garden it was not where the untutored trespasser saw only a brilliant show of natural splendours locke now recognised a subtle conspiracy at work in which each thing mirrored some other thing the trees the river a blossom a bird in a moths wing a monkeys eye on a lizards back sunlight on stones round and round in a dizzying circle of impersonations a hall of mirrors which confounded the senses and would given time rot reason altogether see us now he thought drunkenly as they stood around cherricks grave look at how we play the game too were living but we impersonate the dead better than the dead themselves the corpse had been one scab by the time theyd hoisted it into a sack and carried it outside to this miserable plot behind tetelmans house to bury there were half a dozen other graves here all europeans to judge by the names crudely burned into the wooden crosses killed by snakes or heat or longing tetelman attempted to say a brief prayer in spanish but the roar of the trees and the din of birds making their way home to their roosts before night came down all but drowned him out he gave up eventually and they made their way back into the cooler interior of the house where stumpf was sitting drinking brandy and staring inanely at the darkening stain on the floorboards outside two of tetelmans tamed indians were shovelling the rank jungle earth on top of cherricks sack eager to be done with the work and away before nightfall locke watched from the window tiie gravediggers didnt talk as they laboured but filled the shallow grave up then flattened the earth as best they could with the leathertough soles of their feet as they did so the stamping of the ground took on a rhythm it occurred to locke that the men were probably the worse for bad whisky he knew few indians who didnt drink like fishes now staggering a little they began to dance on cherricks grave locke locke woke in the darkness a cigarette glowed as the smoker drew on it and the tip burned more intensely stumpf s wasted features swam up out of the night locke are you awake what do you want i cant sleep the mask replied ive been thinking the supply plane comes in from santarem the day after tomorrow we could be back there in a few hours out of all this sure i mean permanently stumpf said away permanently stumpf lit another cigarette from the embers of his last before saying i dont believe in curses dont think i do who said anything about curses you saw cherricks body what happened to him theres a disease said locke whats it called when the blood doesnt set properly haemophilia stumpf replied he didnt have haemophilia and we both know it ive seen him scratched and cut dozens of times he mended like you or i locke snatched at a mosquito that had alighted on his chest and ground it out between thumb and forefinger all right then what killed him you saw the wounds better than i did but it seemed to me his skin just broke open as soon as he was touched locke nodded thats the way it looked maybe its something he caught off the indians locke took the point didnt touch any of them he said neither did i but he did remember locke remembered scenes like that werent easy to forget try as he might christ he said his voice hushed what a fucking situation im going back to santarem i dont want them coming looking for me theyre not going to how do you know we screwed up back there we could have bribed them got them off the land some other way i doubt it you heard what tetelman said ancestral territories you can have my share of the land stumpf said i want no part of it you mean it then youre getting out i feel dirty were spoilers locke its your funeral i mean it im not like you never really had the stomach for this kind of thing will you buy my third off me depends on your price whatever you want to give its yours confessional over stumpf returned to his bed and lay down in the darkness to finish off his cigarette it would soon be light another jungle dawn a precious interval all too short before the world began to sweat how he hated the place at least he hadnt touched any of the indians hadnt even been within breathing distance of them whatever infection theyd passed on to cherrick he could surely not be tainted in less than fortyeight hours he would be away to santarem and then on to some city any city where the tribe could never follow hed already done his penance hadnt he paid for his greed and his arrogance with the rot in his abdomen and the terrors he knew he would never quite shake off again let that be punishment enough he prayed and slipped before the monkeys began to call up the day into a spoilers sleep a gembacked beetle trapped beneath stumpfs mosquito net hummed around in diminishing circles looking for some way out it could find none eventually exhausted by the search it hovered over the sleeping man then landed on his forehead there it wandered drinking at the pores beneath its imperceptible tread stumpf s skin opened and broke into a trail of tiny wounds they had come into the indian hamlet at noon the sun a basilisks eye at first they had thought the place deserted locke and cherrick had advanced into the compound leaving the dysenteryridden stumpf in the jeep out of the worst of the heat it was cherrick who first noticed the child a potbellied boy of perhaps four or five his face painted with thick bands of the scarlet vegetable dye urucu had slipped out from his hiding place and come to peer at the trespassers fearless in his curiosity cherrick stood still locke did the same one by one from the huts and from the shelter of the trees around the compound the tribe appeared and stared like the boy at the newcomers if there was a flicker of feeling on their broad flatnosed faces locke could not read it these people he thought of every indian as part of one wretched tribe were impossible to decipher deceit was their only skill what are you doing here he said the sun was baking the back of his neck this is our land the boy still looked up at him his almond eyes refused to fear they dont understand you cherrick said get the kraut out here let him explain it to them he cant move get him out here locke said i dont care if hes shat his pants cherrick backed away down the track leaving locke standing in the ring of huts he looked from doorway to doorway from tree to tree trying to estimate the numbers there were at most three dozen indians two thirds of them women and children descendants of the great peoples that had once roamed the amazon basin in their tens of thousands now those tribes were all but decimated the forest in which they had prospered for generations was being levelled and burned eightlane highways were speeding through their hunting grounds all they held sacred the wilderness and their place in its system was being trampled and trespassed they were exiles in their own land but still they declined to pay homage to their new masters despite the rifles they brought only death would convince them of defeat locke mused cherrick found stumpf slumped in the front seat of the jeep his pasty features more wretched than ever locke wants you he said shaking the german out of his doze the village is still occupied youll have to speak to them stumpf groaned i cant move he said tm dying locke wants you dead or alive cherrick said their fear of locke which went unspoken was perhaps one of the two things they had in common that and greed i feel awful stumpf said if i dont bring you hell only come himself cherrick pointed out this was indisputable stumpf threw the other man a despairing glance then nodded his jowly head all right he said help me cherrick had no wish to lay a hand on stumpf the man stank of his sickness he seemed to be oozing the contents of his gut through his pores his skin had the lustre of rank meat he took the outstretched hand nevertheless without aid stumpf would never make the hundred yards from jeep to compound ahead locke was shouting get moving said cherrick hauling stumpf down from the front seat and towards the bawling voice lets get it over and done with when the two men returned into the circle of huts the scene had scarcely changed locke glanced around at stumpf we got trespassers he said so i see stumpf returned wearily tell them to get the fuck off our land locke said tell them this is our territory we bought it without sitting tenants stumpf nodded not meeting lockes rabid eyes sometimes he hated the man almost as much as he hated himself go on locke said and gestured for cherrick to relinquish his support of stumpf this he did the german stumbled forward head bowed he took several seconds to work out his patter then raised his head and spoke a few wilting words in bad portuguese the pronouncement was met with the same blank looks as lockes performance stumpf tried again rearranging his inadequate vocabulary to try and awake a flicker of understanding amongst these savages the boy who had been so entertained by lockes cavortings now stood staring up at this third demon his face wiped of smiles this one was nowhere near as comical as the first he was sick and haggard he smelt of death the boy held his nose to keep from inhaling the badness off the man stumpf peered through greasy eyes at his audience if they did understand and were faking their blank incomprehension it was a flawless performance his limited skills defeated he turned giddily to locke they dont understand me he said tell them again i dont think they speak portuguese tell them anyway cherrick cocked his rifle we dont have to talk with them he said under his breath theyre on our land were within our rights no said locke theres no need for shooting not if we can persuade them to go peacefully they dont understand plain common sense cher rick said look at them theyre animals living in filth stumpf had begun to try and communicate again this time accompanying his hesitant words with a pitiful mime tell them weve got work to do here locke prompted him im trying my best stumpf replied testily weve got papers i dont think theyd be much impressed stumpf returned with a cautious sarcasm that was lost on the other man just tell them to move on find some other piece of land to squat on watching stumpf put these sentiments into word and signlanguage locke was already running through the alternative options available either the indians the txukahamei or the achual or whatever damn family it was accepted their demands and moved on or else they would have to enforce the edict as cherrick had said they were within their rights they had papers from the development authorities they had maps marking the division between one territory and the next they had every sanction from signature to bullet he had no active desire to shed blood the world was still too full of bleeding heart liberals and doeeyed sentimentalists to make genocide the most convenient solution but the gun had been used before and would be used again until every unwashed indian had put on a pair of trousers and given up eating monkeys indeed the din of liberals notwithstanding the gun had its appeal it was swift and absolute once it had had its short sharp say there was no danger of further debate no chance that in ten years time some mercenary indian whod found a copy of marx in the gutter could come back claiming his tribal lands oil minerals and all once gone they were gone forever at the thought of these scarletfaced savages laid low locke felt his triggerfinger itch physically itch stumpf had finished his encore it had met with no response now he groaned and turned to locke tm going to be sick he said his face was bright white the glamour of his skin made his small teeth look dingy be my guest locke replied please i have to lie down i dont want them watching me locke shook his head you dont move til they listen if we dont get any joy from them youre going to see something to be sick about locke toyed with the stock of his rifle as he spoke running a broken thumbnail along the nicks in it there were perhaps a dozen each one a human grave the jungle concealed murder so easily it almost seemed in its cryptic fashion to condone the crime stumpf turned away from locke and scanned the mute assembly there were so many indians here he thought and though he carried a pistol he was an inept marksman suppose they rushed locke cherrick and himself he would not survive and yet looking at the indians he could see no sign of aggression amongst them once they had been warriors now like beaten children sullen and wilfully stupid there was some trace of beauty in one or two of the younger women their skins though grimy were fine their eyes black had he felt more healthy he might have been aroused by their nakedness tempted to press his hands upon their shiny bodies as it was their feigned incomprehension merely irritated him they seemed in their silence like another species as mysterious and unfathomable as mules or birds hadnt somebody in uxituba told him that many of these people didnt even give their children proper names that each was like a limb of the tribe anonymous and therefore unfixable he could believe that now meeting the same dark stare in each pair of eyes could believe that what they faced here was not three dozen individuals but a fluid system of hatred made flesh it made him shudder to think of it now for the first time since their appearance one of the assembly moved he was an ancient fully thirty years older than most of the tribe he like the rest was all but naked the sagging flesh of his limbs and breasts resembled tanned hide his step though the pale eyes suggested blindness was perfectly confident once standing in front of the interlopers he opened his mouth there were no teeth set in his rotted gums and spoke what emerged from his scraggy throat was not a language made of words but only of sound a potpourri of jungle noises there was no discernible pattern to the outpouring it was simply a display awesome in its way of impersonations the man could murmur like a jaguar screech like a parrot he could find in his throat the splash of rain on orchids the howl of monkeys the sounds made stumpf s gorge rise the jungle had diseased him dehydrated him and left him wrung out now this rheumyeyed stickman was vomiting the whole odious place up at him the raw heat in the circle of huts made stumpf s head beat and he was sure as he stood listening to the sages din that the old man was measuring the rhythm of his nonsense to the thud at his temples and wrists whats he saying locke demanded what does it sound like stumpf replied irritated by lockes idiot questions its all noises the fuckers cursing us cherrick said stumpf looked round at the third man cherricks eyes were starting from his head its a curse he said to stumpf locke laughed unmoved by cherricks apprehen sion he pushed stumpf out of the way so as to face the old man whose songspeech had now lowered in pitch it was almost lilting he was singing twilight stumpf thought that brief ambiguity between the fierce day and the suffocating night yes that was it he could hear in the song the purr and the coo of a drowsy kingdom it was so persuasive he wanted to lie down on the spot where he stood and sleep locke broke the spell what are you saying he spat in the tribesmans rnazy face talk sense but the nightnoises only whispered on an unbroken stream this is our village another voice now broke in the man spoke as if translating the elders words locke snapped round to locate the speaker he was a thin youth whose skin might once have been golden our village our land you speak english locke said some the youth replied why didnt you answer me earlier locke demanded his fury exacerbated by the disinterest on the indians face not my place to speak the man replied he is the elder the chief you mean the chief is dead all his family is dead this is the wisest of us then you tell him no need to tell the young man broke in he under stands you he speaks english too no the other replied but he understands you you are transparent locke halfgrasped that the youth was implying an insult here but wasnt quite certain he gave stumpf a puzzled look the german shook his head locke returned his attention to the youth tell him anyway he said tell all of them this is our land we bought it the tribe has always lived here the reply came not any longer cherrick said weve got papers stumpf said mildly still hoping that the confrontation might end peacefully from the government we were here before the government the tribesman replied the old man had stopped talking the forest perhaps stumpf thought hes coming to the beginning of another day and stopped he was turning away now indifferent to the presence of these unwelcome guests call him back locke demanded stabbing his rifle towards the young tribesman the gesture was unam biguous make him tell the rest of them theyve got to go the young man seemed unimpressed by the threat of lockes rifle however and clearly unwilling to give orders to his elder whatever the imperative he simply watched the old man walk back towards the hut from which he had emerged around the compound others were also turning away the old mans withdrawal apparently signalled that the show was over no said cherrick youre not listening the colour in his cheeks had risen a tone his voice an octave he pushed forward rifle raised you fucking scum despite his hysteria he was rapidly losing his audience the old man had reached the doorway of his hut and now bent his back and disappeared into its recesses the few members of the tribe who were still showing some interest in proceedings were viewing the europeans with a hint of pity for their lunacy it only enraged cherrick further listen to me he shrieked sweat flicking off his brow as he jerked his head at one retreating figure and then at another listen you bastards easy said stumpf the appeal triggered cherrick without warning he raised his rifle to his shoulder aimed at the open door of the hut into which the old man had vanished and fired birds rose from the crowns of adjacent trees dogs took to their heels from within the hut came a tiny shriek not like the old mans voice at all as it sounded stumpf fell to his knees hugging his belly his gut in spasm face to the ground he did not see the diminutive figure emerge from the hut and totter into the sunlight even when he did look up and saw how the child with the scarlet face clutched his belly he hoped his eyes lied but they did not it was blood that came from between the childs tiny fingers and death that had stricken his face he fell forward on to the impacted earth of the huts threshold twitched and died somewhere amongst the huts a woman began to sob quietly for a moment the world spun on a pinhead balanced exquisitely between silence and the cry that must break it between a truce held and the coming atrocity you stupid bastard locke murmured to cherrick under his condemnation his voice trembled back off he said get up stumpf were not waiting get up and come now or dont come at all stumpf was still looking at the body of the child suppressing his moans he got to his feet help me he said locke lent him an arm cover us he said to cherrick the man nodded deathlypale some of the tribe had turned their gaze on the europeans retreat their expressions despite this tragedy as inscrutable as ever only the sobbing woman presumably the dead childs mother wove between the silent figures keening her grief cherricks rifle shook as he kept the bridgehead hed done the mathematics if it came to a headon collision they had little chance of survival but even now with the enemy making a getaway there was no sign of movement amongst the indians just the accusing facts the dead boy the warm rifle cherrick chanced a look over his shoulder locke and stumpf were already within twenty yards of the jeep and there was still no move from the savages then as he looked back towards the compound it seemed as though the tribe breathed together one solid breath and hearing that sound cherrick felt death wedge itself like a fishbone in his throat too deep to be plucked out by his fingers too big to be shat it was just waiting there lodged in his anatomy beyond argument or appeal he was distracted from its presence by a movement at the door of the hut quite ready to make the same mistake again he took firmer hold of his rifle the old man had reappeared at the door he stepped over the corpse of the boy which was lying where it had toppled again cherrick glanced behind him surely they were at the jeep but stumpf had stumbled locke was even now dragging him to his feet cherrick seeing the old man advancing towards him took one cautious step backwards followed by another but the old man was fearless he walked swiftly across the compound coming to stand so close to cherrick his body as vulnerable as ever that the barrel of the rifle prodded his shrunken belly there was blood on both his hands fresh enough to run down the mans arms when he displayed the palms for cherricks benefit had he touched the boy cherrick wondered as he stepped out of the hut if so it had been an astonishing sleightofhand for cherrick had seen nothing trick or no trick the significance of the display was perfectly apparent he was being accused of murder cherrick wasnt about to be cowed however he stared back at the old man matching defiance with defiance but the old bastard did nothing except show his bloody palms his eyes full of tears cherrick could feel his anger growing again he poked the mans flesh with his finger you dont frighten me he said you understand im not a fool as he spoke he seemed to see a shifting in the old mans features it was a trick of the sun of course or of birdshadow but there was beneath the corruption of age a hint of the child now dead at the hut door the tiny mouth even seemed to smile then as subtly as it had appeared the illusion faded again cherrick withdrew his hand from the old mans chest narrowing his eyes against further mirages he then renewed his retreat he had taken three steps only when something broke cover to his left he swung round raised his rifle and fired a piebald pig one of several that had been grazing around the huts was checked in its flight by the bullet which struck it in the neck it seemed to trip over itself and collapsed headlong in the dust cherrick swung his rifle back towards the old man but he hadnt moved except to open his mouth his palate was making the sound of the dying pig a choking squeal pitiful and ridiculous which followed cherrick back up the path to the jeep locke had the engine running get in he said cherrick needed no encouragement but flung himself into the front seat the interior of the vehicle was filthy hot and stank of stumpf s bodily functions but it was as near safety as theyd been in the last hour it was a pig he said i shot a pig i saw said locke that old bastard he didnt finish he was looking down at the two fingers with which he had prodded the elder i touched him he muttered perplexed by what he saw the fingertips were bloody though the flesh he had laid his fingers upon had been clean locke ignored cherricks confusion and backed the jeep up to turn it around then drove away from the hamlet down a track that seemed to have become choked with foliage in the hour since theyd come up it there was no discernible pursuit the tiny trading post to the south of averio was scant of civilisation but it sufficed there were white faces here and clean water stumpf whose condition had deteriorated on the return journey was treated by dancy an englishman who had the manner of a disenfranchised earl and a face like hammered steak he claimed to have been a doctor once upon a sober time and though he had no evidence of his qualifications nobody contested his right to deal with stumpf the german was delirious and on occasion violent but dancy his small hands heavy with gold rings seemed to take a positive delight in nursing his thrashing patient while stumpf raved beneath his mosquito net locke and cherrick sat in the lamplit gloom and drank then told the story of their encounter with the tribe it was tetelman the owner of the trading posts stores who had most to say when the report was finished he knew the indians well ive been here years he said feeding nuts to the mangy monkey that scampered on his lap i know the way these people think they may act as though theyre stupid cowards even take it from me theyre neither cherrick grunted the quicksilver monkey fixed him with vacant eyes they didnt make a move on us cherrick said even though they outnumbered us ten to one if that isnt cowardice what is it tetelman settled back in his creaking chair throwing the animal off his lap his face was raddled and used only his lips constantly rewetted from his glass had any colour he looked thought locke like an old whore thirty years ago tetelman said this whole territory was their homeland nobody wanted it they went where they liked did what they liked as far as we whites were concerned the jungle was filthy and diseaseinfected we wanted no part of it and of course in some ways we were right it is filthy and diseaseinfected but its also got reserves we now want badly minerals oil maybe power we paid for that land said locke his fingers jittery on the cracked rim of his glass its all weve got now tetelman sneered paid he said the monkey chat tered at his feet apparently as amused by this claim as its master no you just paid for a blind eye so you could take it by force you paid for the right to fuck up the indians in any way you could thats what your dollars bought mr locke the government of this country is counting off the months until every tribe on the subcontinent is wiped out by you or your like its no use to play the outraged innocents ive been here too long cherrick spat on to the bare floor tetelmans speech had heated his blood and so whyd you come here if youre so fucking clever he asked the trader same reason as you tetelman replied plainly staring off into the trees beyond the plot of land behind the store their silhouettes shook against the sky wind or nightbirds what reasons that cherrick said barely keeping his hostility in check greed tetelman replied mildly still watching the trees something scampered across the low wooden roof the monkey at tetelmans feet listened head cocked i thought i could make my fortune out here the same way you do i gave myself two years three at the most that was the best part of two decades ago he frowned whatever thoughts passed behind his eyes they were bitter the jungle eats you up and spits you out sooner or later not me said locke tetelman turned his eyes on the man they were wet oh yes he said politely extinctions in the air mr locke i can smell it then he turned back to looking at the window whatever was on the roof now had companions they wont come here will they said cherrick they wont follow us the question spoken almost in a whisper begged for a reply in the negative try as he might cherrick couldnt dislodge the sights of the previous day it wasnt the boys corpse that so haunted him that he could soon learn to forget but the elder with his shifting sunlit face and the palms raised as if to display some stigmata he was not so forgettable dont fret tetelman said with a trace of conde scension sometimes one or two of them will drift in here with a parrot to sell or a few pots but ive never seen them come here in any numbers they dont like it this is civilisation as far as theyre concerned and it intimidates them besides they wouldnt harm my guests they need me need you said locke who could need this wreck of a man they use our medicines dancy supplies them and blankets once in a while as i said theyre not so stupid next door stumpf had begun to howl dancys con soling voice could be heard attempting to talk down the panic he was plainly failing your friends gone bad said tetelman no friend cherrick replied it rots tetelman murmured half to himself what does the soul the word was utterly out of place from tetelmans whiskyglossed lips its like fruit you see it rots somehow stumpf s cries gave force to the observation it was not the voice of a wholesome creature there was putrescence in it more to direct his attention away from the germans din than out of any real interest cherrick said what do they give you for the medicine and the blankets women the possibility clearly entertained tetelman he laughed his gold teeth gleaming ive no use for women he said ive had the syph for too many years he clicked his fingers and the monkey clambered back up on to his lap the soul he said isnt the only thing that rots well what do you get from them then locke said for your supplies artifacts tetelman replied bowls jugs mats the americans buy them off me and sell them again in manhattan everybody wants something made by an extinct tribe these days memento mori extinct said locke the word had a seductive ring it sounded like life to him oh certainly said tetelman theyre as good as gone if you dont wipe them out theyll do it themselves suicide locke said in their fashion they just lose heart ive seen it happen half a dozen times a tribe loses its land and its appetite for life goes with it they stop taking care of themselves the women dont get pregnant any more the young men take to drink the old men just starve themselves to death in a year or two its like they never existed locke swallowed the rest of his drink silently saluting the fatal wisdom of these people they knew when to die which was more than could be said for some hed met the thought of their deathwish absolved him of any last vestiges of guilt what was the gun in his hand except an instrument of evolution on the fourth day after their arrival at the post stumpf s fever abated much to dancys disappointment the worst of its over he announced give him two more days rest and you can get back to your labours what are your plans tetelrnan wanted to know locke was watching the rain from the verandah sheets of water pouring from clouds so low they brushed the treetops then just as suddenly as it had arrived the downpour was gone as though a tap had been turned off sun broke through the jungle newwashed was steaming and sprouting and thriving again i dont know what well do said locke maybe get ourselves some help and go back in there there are ways tetelman said cherrick sitting beside the door to get the benefit of what little breeze was available picked up the glass that had scarcely been out of his hand in recent days and filled it up again no more guns he said he hadnt touched his rifle since theyd arrived at the post in fact he kept from contact with anything but a bottle and his bed his skin seemed to crawl and creep perpetually no need for guns tetelman murmured the statement hung on the air like an unfulfilled promise get rid of them without guns said locke if you mean waiting for them to die out naturally im not that patient no said tetelman we can be swifter than that how tetelman gave the man a lazy look theyre my livelihood he said or part of it youre asking me to help you make myself bankrupt he not only looks like an old whore locke thought he thinks like one whats it worth your wisdom he asked a cut of whatever you find on your land tetelman replied locke nodded what have we got to lose cherrick you agree to cut him in cherricks consent was a shrug all right locke said talk they need medicines tetelman explained because theyre so susceptible to our diseases a decent plague can wipe them out practically overnight locke thought about this not looking at tetelman one fell swoop tetelman continued theyve got practically no defences against certain bacteria never had to build up any resistance the clap smallpox even measles how said locke another silence down the steps of the verandah where civilization finished the jungle was swelling to meet the sun in the liquid heat plants blossomed and rotted and blossomed again i asked how locke said blankets tetelman replied dead mens blankets a little before the dawn of the night after stumpf s recovery cherrick woke suddenly startled from his rest by bad dreams outside it was pitchdark neither moon nor stars relieved the depth of the night but his bodyclock which his life as a mercenary had trained to impressive accuracy told him that first light was not far off and he had no wish to lay his head down again and sleep not with the old man waiting to be dreamt it wasnt just the raised palms the blood glistening that so distressed cherrick it was the words hed dreamt coming from the old mans toothless mouth which had brought on the cold sweat that now encased his body what were the words he couldnt recall them now but wanted to wanted the sentiments dragged into wakefulness where they could be dissected and dismissed as ridiculous they wouldnt come though he lay on his wretched cot the dark wrapping him up too tightly for him to move and suddenly the bloody hands were there in front of him suspended in the pitch there was no face no sky no tribe just the hands dreaming cherrick told himself but he knew better and now the voice he was getting his wish here were the words he had dreamt spoken few of them made sense cherrick lay like a newborn baby listening to its parents talk but unable to make any significance of their exchanges he was ignorant wasnt he he tasted the sourness of his stupidity for the first time since childhood the voice made him fearful of ambiguities he had ridden roughshod over of whispers his shouting life had rendered inaudible he fumbled for comprehension and was not entirely frustrated the man was speaking of the world and of exile from the world of being broken always by what one seeks to possess cherrick struggled wishing he could stop the voice and ask for explanation but it was already fading ushered away by the wild address of parrots in the trees raucous and gaudy voices erupting suddenly on every side through the mesh of cherricks mosquito net he could see the sky flaring through the branches he sat up hands and voice had gone and with them all but an irritating murmur of what he had almost understood he had thrown off in sleep his single sheet now he looked down at his body with distaste his back and buttocks and the underside of his thighs felt sore too much sweating on coarse sheets he thought not for the first time in recent days he remembered a small house in bristol which he had once known as home the noise of birds was filling his head he hauled himself to the edge of the bed and pulled back the mosquito net the crude weave of the net seemed to scour the palm of his hand as he gripped it he disengaged his hold and cursed to himself there was again today an itch of tenderness in his skin that hed suffered since coming to the post even the soles of his feet pressed on to the floor by the weight of his body seemed to suffer each knot and splinter he wanted to be away from this place and badly warm trickle across his wrist caught his attention and he was startled to see a rivulet of blood moving down his arm from his hand there was a cut in the cushion of his thumb where the mosquito net had apparently nicked his flesh it was bleeding though not copiously he sucked at the cut feeling again that peculiar sensitivity to touch that only drink and that in abundance dulled spitting out blood he began to dress the clothes he put on were a scourge to his back his sweatstiffened shirt rubbed against his shoulders and neck he seemed to feel every thread chafing his nerveendings the shirt might have been sackcloth the way it abraded him next door he heard locke moving around gingerly finishing his dressing cherrick went through to join him locke was sitting at the table by the window he was poring over a map of tetelmans and drinking a cup of the bitter coffee dancy was so fond of brewing which he drank with a dollop of condensed milk the two men had little to say to each other since the incident in the village all pretence to respect or friendship had disappeared locke now showed undisguised contempt for his sometime companion the only fact that kept them together was the contract they and stumpf had signed rather than breakfast on whisky which he knew locke would take as a further sign of his decay cherrick poured himself a slug of dancys emetic and went out to look at the morning he felt strange there was something about this dawning day which made him profoundly uneasy he knew the dangers of courting unfounded fears and he tried to forbid them but they were incontestable was it simply exhaustion that made him so painfully conscious of his many discomforts this morning why else did he feel the pressure of his stinking clothes so acutely the rasp of his boot collar against the jutting bone of his ankle the rhythmical chafing of his trousers against his inside leg as he walked even the grazing air that eddied around his exposed face and arms the world was pressing on him at least that was the sensation pressing as though it wanted him out a large dragonfly whining towards him on iridescent wings collided with his arm the pain of the collision caused him to drop his mug it didnt break but rolled off the verandah and was lost in the undergrowth angered cherrick slapped the insect off leaving a smear of blood on his tattooed forearm to mark the dragonflys demise he wiped it off it welled up again on the same spot full and dark it wasnt the blood of the insect he realised but his own the dragonfly had cut him somehow though he had felt nothing irritated he peered more closely at his punctured skin the wound was not significant but it was painful from inside he could hear locke talking he was loudly describing the inadequacy of his fellow adventures to tetelman stumpf s not fit for this kind of work he was saying and cherrick what about me cherrick stepped into the shabby interior wiping a new flow of blood from his arm locke didnt even bother to look up at him youre paranoid he said plainly paranoid and unreliable cherrick was in no mood for taking lockes foul mouthing just because i killed some indian brat he said the more he brushed blood from his bitten arm the more the place stung you just didnt have the balls to do it yourself locke still didnt bother to look up from his perusal of the map cherrick moved across to the table are you listening to me he demanded and added force to his question by slamming his fist down on to the table on impact his hand simply burst open blood spurted out in every direction spattering the map cherrick howled and reeled backwards from the table with blood pouring from a yawning split in the side of his hand the bone showed through the din of pain in his head he could hear a quiet voice the words were inaudible but he knew whose they were i wont hear he said shaking his head like a dog with a flea in its ear he staggered back against the wall but the briefest of contacts was another agony wont hear damn you what the hells he talking about dancy had appeared in the doorway woken by the cries still clutching the complete works of shelley tetelman had said he could not sleep without locke readdressed the question to cherrick who was standing wildeyed in the corner of the room blood spitting from between his fingers as he attempted to staunch his wounded hand what are you saying he spoke to me cherrick replied the old man what old man tetelman asked he means at the village locke said then to cherrick is that what you mean he wants us out exiles like them like them cherricks panic was rapidly rising out of anyones control least of all his own the mans got heatstroke dancy said ever the diagnostician locke knew better your hand needs bandaging he said slowly approaching cherrick i heard him cherrick muttered i believe you just slow down we can sort it out no the other man replied its pushing us out everything we touch everything we touch he looked as though he was about to topple over and locke reached for him as his hands made contact with cherricks shoulders the flesh beneath the shirt split and lockes hands were instantly soaked in scarlet he withdrew them appalled cherrick fell to his knees which in their turn became new wounds he stared down as his shirt and trousers darkened whats happening to me he wept dancy moved towards him let me help no dont touch me cherrick pleaded but dancy wasnt to be denied his nursing its all right he said in his best bedside manner it wasnt dancys grip intended only to lift the man from his bleeding knees opened new cuts wherever he took hold dancy felt the blood sprout beneath his hand felt the flesh slip away from the bone the sensation bested even his taste for agony like locke he forsook the lost man hes rotting he murmured cherricks body had split now in a dozen or more places he tried to stand half staggering to his feet only to collapse again his flesh breaking open whenever he touched wall or chair or floor there was no help for him all the others could do was stand around like spectators at an execution awaiting the final throes even stumpf had roused himself from his bed and come through to see what all the shouting was about he stood leaning against the doorlintel his diseasethinned face all disbelief another minute and bloodloss defeated cherrick he keeled over and sprawled face down across the floor dancy crossed back to him and crouched on his haunches beside his head is he dead locke asked almost dancy replied rotted said tetelman as though the word explained the atrocity they had just witnessed he had a crucifix in his hand large and crudely carved it looked like indian handiwork locke thought the messiah impaled on the tree was sloeeyed and indecently naked he smiled despite nail and thorn dancy touched cherricks body letting the blood come with his touch and turned the man over then leaned in towards cherricks jittering face the dying mans lips were moving oh so slightly what are you saying dancy asked he leaned closer still to catch the mans words cherricks mouth trailed bloody spittle but no sound came locke stepped in pushing dancy aside flies were already flitting around cherricks face locke thrust his bullnecked head into cherricks view you hear me he said the body grunted you know me again a grunt you want to give me your share of the land the grunt was lighter this time almost a sigh theres witnesses here locke said just say yes theyll hear you just say yes the body was trying its best it opened its mourh a little wider dancy said locke you hear what he said dancy could not disguise his horror at lockes insistence but he nodded youre a witness if you must said the englishman deep in his body cherrick felt the fishbone hed first choked on in the village twist itself about one final time and extinguish him did he say yes dancy tetelman asked dancy felt the physical proximity of the brute kneeling beside him he didnt know what the dead man had said but what did it matter locke would have the land anyway wouldnt he he said yes locke stood up and went in search of a fresh cup of coffee without thinking dancy put his fingers on cherricks lids to seal his empty gaze under that lightest of touches the lids broke open and blood tainted the tears that had swelled where cherricks sight had been they had buried him towards evening the corpse though it had lain through the noonheat in the coolest part of the store amongst the dried goods had begun to putrefy by the time it was sewn up in canvas for the burial the night following stumpf had come to locke and offered him the last third of the territory to add to cherricks share and locke ever the realist had accepted the terms which were punitive had been worked out the next day in the evening of that day as stumpf had hoped the supply plane came in locke bored with tetelmans contemptuous looks had also elected to fly back to santarem there to drink the jungle out of his system for a few days and return refreshed he intended to buy up fresh supplies and if possible hire a reliable driver and gunman the flight was noisy cramped and tedious the two men exchanged no words for its full duration stumpf just kept his eyes on the tracts of unfelled wilderness they passed over though from one hour to the next the scene scarcely changed a panorama of sable green broken on occasion by a glint of water perhaps a column of blue smoke rising here and there where land was being cleared little else at santarem they parted with a single handshake which left every nerve in stumpf s hand scourged and an open cut in the tender flesh between index finger and thumb santarem wasnt rio locke mused as he made his way down to a bar at the south end of the town run by a veteran of vietnam who had a taste for ad hoc animal shows it was one of lockes few certain pleasures and one he never tired of to watch a local woman face dead as a cold manioc cake submit to a dog or a donkey fora few grubby dollar bills the women of santarem were on the whole as unpalatable as the beer but locke had no eye for beauty in the opposite sex it mattered only that their bodies be in reasonable working order and not diseased he found the bar and settled down for an evening exchanging dirt with the american when he tired of that some time after midnight he bought a bottle of whisky and went out looking for a face to press his heat upon the woman with the squint was about to accede to a particular peccadillo of lockes one which she had resolutely refused until drunkenness persuaded ner to abandon what little hope of dignity she had when there came a rap on the door fuck said locke si said the woman fook fook it seemed to be the only word she knew in anything resembling english locke ignored her and crawled drunkenly to the edge of the stained mattress again the rap on the door who is it he said senhor locke the voice from the hallway was that of a young boy yes said locke his trousers had become lost in the tangle of sheets yes what do you want mensagem the boy said urgente urgente for me he had found his trousers and was pulling them on the woman not at all disgruntled by this desertion watched him from the head of the bed toying with an empty bottle buttoning up locke crossed from bed to door a matter of three steps he unlocked it the boy in the darkened hallway was of indian extraction to judge by the blackness of his eyes and that peculiar lustre his skin owned he was dressed in a tshirt bearing the cocacola motif mensagem senhor locke he said again do hospital the boy was staring past locke at the woman on the bed he grinned from ear to ear at her cavortings hospital said locke sim hospital sacrado coraqa de maria it could only be stumpf locke thought who else did he know in this corner of hell whod call upon him nobody he looked down at the leering child vem comigo the boy said vem comigo urgente no said locke im not coming not now you understand later later the boy shrugged ta morrendo he said dying said locke sim ta morrendo well let him understand me you go back and tell him i wont come until im ready again the boy shrugged e meu dinheiro he said as locke went to close the door you go to hell locke replied and slammed it in the childs face when two hours and one ungainly act of passionless sex later locke unlocked the door he discovered that the child by way of revenge had defecated on the threshold the hospital sacrado coraqa de maria was no place to fall ill better thought locke as he made his way down the dingy corridors to die in your own bed with your own sweat for company than come here the stench of disinfectant could not entirely mask the odour of human pain the walls were ingrained with it it formed a grease on the lamps it slickened the unwashed floors what had happened to stumpf to bring him here a barroom brawl an argument with a pimp about the price of a woman the german was just damn fool enough to get himself stuck in the gut over something so petty senhor stumpf he asked of a woman in white he accosted in the corridor im looking for senhor stumpf the woman shook her head and pointed towards a harriedlooking man further down the corridor who was taking a moment to light a small cigar he let go the nurses arm and approached the fellow he was enveloped in a stinking cloud of smoke im looking for senhor stumpf he said the man peered at him quizzically you are locke he asked yes ah he drew on the cigar the pungency of the expelled smoke would surely have brought on a relapse in the hardiest patient tm doctor edson costa the man said offering his clammy hand to locke your friend has been waiting for you to come all night whats wrong with him hes hurt his eye edson costa replied clearly indif ferent to stumpf s condition and he has some minor abrasions on his hands and face but he wont have anyone go near him he doctored himself why locke asked the doctor looked flummoxed he pays to go in a clean room pays plenty so i put him in you want to see him maybe take him away maybe said locke unenthusiastically his head said the doctor he has delusions without offering further explanation the man led off at a considerable rate trailing tobaccosmoke as he went the route that wound out of the main building and across a small internal courtyard ended at a room with a glass partition in the door here said the doctor your friend you tell him he said as a parting snipe he pay more or tomorrow he leaves locke peered through the glass partition the grubby white room was empty but for a bed and a small table lit by the same dingy light that cursed every wretched inch of this establishment stumpf was not on the bed but squatting on the floor in the corner of the room his left eye was covered with a bulbous padding held in place by a bandage ineptly wrapped around his head locke was looking at the man for a good time before stumpf sensed that he was watched he looked up slowly his good eye as if in compensation for the loss of its companion seemed to have swelled to twice its natural size it held enough fear for both it and its twin indeed enough for a dozen eyes cautiously like a man whose bones are so brittle he fears an injudicious breath will shatter them stumpf edged up the wall and crossed to the door he did not open it but addressed locke through the glass why didnt you come he said tm here but sooner said stumpf his face was raw as if hed been beaten sooner i had business locke returned what happened to you its true locke the german said everything is true what are you talking about tetelman told me cherricks babblings about being exiles its true they mean to drive us out were not in the jungle now locke said youve got nothing to be afraid of here oh yes said stumpf that wide eye wider than ever oh yes i saw him who the elder from the village he was here ridiculous he was here damn you stumpf replied he was standing where youre standing looking at me through the glass youve been drinking too much it happened to cherrick and now its happening to me theyre making it impossible to live locke snorted tm not having any problem he said they wont let you escape stumpf said none of usll escape not unless we make amends youve got to vacate the room locke said unwilling to countenance any more of this drivel ive been told youve got to get out by morning no said stumpf i cant leave i cant leave theres nothing to fear the dust said the german the dust in the air itll cut me up i got a speck in my eye just a speck and the next thing my eyes bleeding as though itll never stop i cant hardly lie down the sheets like a bed of nails the soles of my feet feel as if theyre going to split youve got to help me how said locke pay them for the room pay them so i can stay til you can get a specialist from sao luis then go back to the village locke go back and tell them i dont want the land tell them i dont own it any longer til go back said locke but in my good time you must go quickly said stumpf tell them to let me be suddenly the expression on the partiallymasked face changed and stumpf looked past locke at some spectacle down the corridor from his mouth slack with fear came the small word please locke mystified by the mans expression turned the corridor was empty except for the fat moths that were besetting the bulb theres nothing there he said turning back to the door of stumpf s room the wiremesh glass of the window bore the distinct imprint of two bloody palms hes here the german was saying staring fixedly at the miracle of the bleeding glass locke didnt need to ask who he raised his hand to touch the marks the handprints still wet were on his side of the glass not on stumpf s my god he breathed how could anyone have slipped between him and the door and laid the prints there sliding away again in the brief moment it had taken him to glance behind him it defied reason again he looked back down the corridor it was still bereft of visitors just the bulb swinging slightly as if a breeze of passage had caught it and the moths wings whispering whats happening locke breathed stumpf entranced by the handprints touched his fingertips lightly to the glass on contact his fingers blossomed blood trails of which idled down the glass he didnt remove his fingers but stared through at locke with despair in his eye see he said very quietly what are you playing at locke said his voice similarly hushed this is some kind of trick no you havent got cherricks disease you cant have you didnt touch them we agreed damn you he said more heatedly cherrick touched them we didnt stumpf looked back at locke with something close to pity on his face we were wrong he said gently his fingers which he had now removed from the glass continued to bleed dribbling across the backs of his hands and down his arms this isnt something you can beat into submission locke its out of our hands he raised his bloody fingers smiling at his own wordplay see he said the germans sudden fatalistic calm frightened locke he reached for the handle of the door and jiggled it the room was locked the key was on the inside where stumpf had paid for it to be keep out stumpf said keep away from me his smile had vanished locke put his shoulder to the door keep out i said stumpf shouted his voice shrill he backed away from the door as locke took another lunge at it then seeing that the lock must soon give he raised a cry of alarm locke took no notice but continued to throw himself at the door there came the sound of wood beginning to splinter somewhere nearby locke heard a womans voice raised in response to stumpf s calls no matter hed have his hands on the german before help could come and then by christ hed wipe every last vestige of a smile from the bastards lips he threw himself against the door with increased fervour again and again the door gave in the antiseptic cocoon of his room stumpf felt the first blast of unclean air from the outside world it was no more than a light breeze that invaded his makeshift sanctuary but it bore upon its back the debris of the world soot and seeds flakes of skin itched off a thousand scalps fluff and sand and twists of hair the bright dust from a moths wing motes so small the human eye only glimpsed them in a shaft of white sunlight each a tiny whirling speck quite harmless to most living organisms but this cloud was lethal to stumpf in seconds his body became a field of tiny seeping wounds he screeched and ran towards the door to slam it closed again flinging himself into a hail of minute razors each lacerating him pressing against the door to prevent locke from entering his wounded hands erupted he was too late to keep locke out anyhow the man had pushed the door wide and was now stepping through his every movement setting up further currents of air to cut stumpf down he snatched hold of the germans wrist at his grip the skin opened as if beneath a knife behind him a woman loosed a cry of horror locke realizing that stumpf was past recanting his laughter let the man go adorned with cuts on every exposed part of his body and gaining more by the moment stumpf stumbled back blind and fell beside the bed the killing air still sliced him as he sank down with each agonised shudder he woke new eddies and whirlpools to open him up ashen locke retreated from where the body lay and staggered out into the corridor a gaggle of onlookers blocked it they parted however at his approach too intimidated by his bulk and by the wild look on his face to challenge him he retraced his steps through the sicknessperfumed maze crossing the small courtyard and returning into the main building he briefly caught sight of edson costa hurrying in pursuit but did not linger for explanations in the vestibule which despite the late hour was busy with victims of one kind or another his harried gaze alighted on a small boy perched on his mothers lap he had injured his belly apparently his shirt which was too large for him was stained with blood his face with tears the mother did not look up as locke moved through the throng the child did however he raised his head as if knowing that locke was about to pass by and smiled radiantly there was nobody locke knew at tetelmans store and all the information he could bully from the hired hands most of whom were drunk to the point of being unable to stand was that their masters had gone off into the jungle the previous day locke chased the most sober of them and persuaded him with threats to accompany him back to the village as translator he had no real idea of how he would make his peace with the tribe he was only certain that he had to argue his innocence after all he would plead it hadnt been he who had fired the killing shot there had been misunderstandings to be certain but he had not harmed the people in any way how could they in all conscience conspire to hurt him if they should require some penance of him he was not above acceding to their demands indeed might there not be some satisfaction in the act he had seen so much suffering of late he wanted to be cleansed of it anything they asked within reason he would comply with anything to avoid dying like the others hed even give back the land it was a rough ride and his morose companion com plained often and incoherently locke turned a deaf ear there was no time for loitering their noisy progress the jeep engine complaining at every new acrobatic required of it brought the jungle alive on every side a repertoire of wails whoops and screeches it was an urgent hungry place locke thought and for the first time since setting foot on this subcontinent he loathed it with all his heart there was no room here to make sense of events the best that could be hoped was that one be allowed a niche to breathe awhile between one squalid flowering and the next half an hour before nightfall exhausted by the journey they came to the outskirts of the village the place had altered not at all in the meagre days since hed last been here but the ring of huts was clearly deserted the doors gaped the communal fires always alight were ashes there was neither child nor pig to turn an eye towards him as he moved across the compound when he reached the centre of the ring he stood still looking about him for some clue as to what had happened there he found none however fatigue irade him foolhardy mustering his fractured strength he shouted into the hush where are you two brilliant red macaws fingerwinged rose screech ing from the trees on the far side of the village a few moments after a figure emerged from the thicket of balsa and jacaranda it was not one of the tribe but dancy he paused before stepping fully into sight then recognising locke a broad smile broke his face and he advanced into the compound behind him the foliage shook as others made their way through it tetelman was there as were several norwegians led by a man called bjrnstrm whom locke had encountered briefly at the trading post his face beneath a shock of sunbleached hair was like cooked lobster my god said tetelman what are you doing here i might ask you the same question locke replied testily bjrnstrm waved down the raised rifles of his three companions and strode forward bearing a placatory smile mr locke the norwegian said extending a leather gloved hand it is good we meet locke looked down at the stained glove with disgust and bjrnstrm flashing a selfadmonishing look pulled it off the hand beneath was pristine my apologies he said weve been working at what locke asked the acid in his stomach edging its way up into the back of his throat tetelman spat indians he said wheres the tribe locke said again tetelman bjrnstrm claims hes got rights to this territory the tribe locke insisted where are they the norwegian toyed with his glove did you buy them out or what locke asked not exactly bjrnstrm replied his english like his profile was impeccable bring him along dancy suggested with some enthusiasm let him see for himself bjrnstrm nodded why not he said dont touch anything mr locke and tell your carrier to stay where he is dancy had already about turned and was heading into the thicket now bjrnstrm did the same escorting locke across the compound towards a corridor hacked through the heavy foliage locke could scarcely keep pace his limbs were more reluctant with every step he took the ground had been heavily trodden along this track a litter of leaves and orchid blossoms had been mashed into the sodden soil they had dug a pit in a small clearing no more than a hundred yards from the compound it was not deep this pit nor was it very large the mingled smells of lime and petrol cancelled out any other scent tetelman who had reached the clearing ahead of locke hung back from approaching the lip of the earthworks but dancy was not so fastidious he strode around the far side of the pit and beckoned to locke to view the contents the tribe were putrefying already they lay where they had been thrown in a jumble of breasts and buttocks and faces and limbs their bodies tinged here and there with purple and black flies built helter skelters in the air above them an education dancy commented locke just looked on as bjrnstrm moved around the other side of the pit to join dancy all of them locke asked the norwegian nodded one fell swoop he said pronouncing each word with unsettling precision blankets said tetelman naming the murder weapon but so quickly locke murmured its very efficient said dancy and difficult to prove even if anybody ever asks disease is natural bjrnstrm observed yes like the trees locke slowly shook his head his eyes pricking i hear good things of you bjrnstrm said to him perhaps we can work together locke didnt even attempt to reply others of the norwegian party had laid down their rifles and were now getting back to work moving the few bodies still to be pitched amongst their fellows from the forlorn heap beside the pit locke could see a child amongst the tangle and an old man whom even now the burial party were picking up the corpse looked jointless as they swung it over the edge of the hole it tumbled down the shallow incline and came to rest face up its arms flung up to either side of its head in a gesture of submission or expulsion it was the elder of course whom cherrick had faced his palms were still red there was a neat bullethole in his temple disease and hopelessness had not been entirely efficient apparently locke watched while the next of the bodies was thrown into the mass grave and a third to follow that bjrnstrm lingering on the far side of the pit was lighting a cigarette he caught lockes eye so it goes he said from behind locke tetelman spoke we thought you wouldnt come back he said per haps attempting to excuse his alliance with bjrnstrm stumpf is dead said locke well even less to divide up tetelman said approaching him and laying a hand on his shoulder locke didnt reply he just stared down amongst the bodies which were now being covered with lime only slowly registering the warmth that was running down his body from the spot where tetelman had touched him disgusted the man had removed his hand and was staring at the growing bloodstain on lockes shirt twilight at the towers the photographs of mironenko which ballard had been shown in munich had proved far from instructive only one or two pictured the kgb man full face and of the others most were blurred and grainy betraying their furtive origins ballard was not overmuch concerned he knew from long and occasionally bitter experience that the eye was all too ready to be deceived but there were other faculties the remnants of senses modern life had rendered obsolete which he had learned to call into play enabling him to sniff out the least signs of betrayal these were the talents he would use when he met with mironenko with them he would root the truth from the man the truth therein lay the conundrum of course for in this context wasnt sincerity a movable feast sergei zakharovich mironenko had been a section leader in directorate s of the kgb for eleven years with access to the most privileged information on the dispersal of soviet illegals in the west in the recent weeks however he had made his disenchantment with his present masters and his consequent desire to defect known to the british security service in return for the elaborate efforts which would have to be made on his behalf he had volunteered to act as an agent within the kgb for a period of three months after which time he would be taken into the bosom of democracy and hidden where his vengeful overlords would never find him it had fallen to ballard to meet the russian face to face in the hope of establishing whether mironenkos disaffection from his ideology was real or faked the answer would not be found on mironenkos lips ballard knew but in some behavioural nuance which only instinct would comprehend time was when ballard would have found the puzzle fascinating that his every waking thought would have circled on the unravelling ahead but such commitment had belonged to a man convinced his actions had some significant effect upon the world he was wiser now the agents of east and west went about their secret works year in year out they plotted they connived occasionally they shed blood there were debacles and tradeoffs and minor tactical victories but in the end things were much the same as ever this city for instance ballard had first come to berlin in april of hed been twentynine fresh from years of intensive training and ready to live a little but he had not felt easy here he found the city charmless often bleak it had taken odell his colleague for those first two years to prove that berlin was worthy of his affections and once ballard fell he was lost for life now he felt more at home in this divided city than he ever had in london its unease its failed idealism and perhaps most acutely of all its terrible isolation matched his he and it maintaining a presence in a wasteland of dead ambition he found mironenko at the germalde galerie and yes the photographs had lied the russian looked older than his fortysix years and sicker than hed appeared in those filched portraits neither man made any sign of acknowledgement they idled through the collection for a full halfhour with mironenko showing acute and apparently genuine interest in the work on view only when both men were satisfied that they were not being watched did the russian quit the building and lead ballard into the polite suburbs of dahlem to a mutually agreed safe house there in a small and unheated kitchen they sat down and talked mironenkos command of english was uncertain or at least appeared so though ballard had the impression that his struggles for sense were as much tactical as giammatical he might well have presented the same facade in the russians situation it seldom hurt to appear less competent than one was but despite the difficulties he had in expressing himself mironenkos avowals were unequivocal i am no longer a communist he stated plainly i have not been a partymember not here he put his fist to his chest for many years he fetched an offwhite handkerchief from his coat pocket pulled off one of his gloves and plucked a bottle of tablets from the folds of the handkerchief forgive me he said as he shook tablets from the bottle i have pains in my head in my hands ballard waited until he had swallowed the medication before asking him why did you begin to doubt the russian pocketed the bottle and the handker chief his wide face devoid of expression how does a man lose his his faith he said is it that i saw too much or too little perhaps he looked at ballards face to see if his hesitant words had made sense finding no comprehension there he tried again i think the man who does not believe he is lost is lost the paradox was elegantly put ballards suspicion as to mironenkos true command of english was confirmed are you lost nozi ballard inquired mironenko didnt reply he was pulling his other glove off and staring at his hands the pills he had swallowed did not seem to be easing the ache he had complained of he fisted and unfisted his hands like an arthritis sufferer testing the advance of his condition not looking up he said i was taught that the party had solutions to every thing that made me free from fear and now now he said now i have strange thoughts they come to me from nowhere go on said ballard mironenko made a tight smile you must know me inside out yes even what i dream yes said ballard mironenko nodded it would be the same with us he said then after a pause ive thought sometimes i would break open do you understand what i say i would crack because there is such rage inside me and that makes me afraid ballard i think they will see how much i hate them he looked up at his interrogator you must be quick he said or they will discover me i try not to think of what they will do again he paused all trace of the smile however humourless had gone the directorate has sections even i dont have knowledge of special hospitals where nobody can go they have ways to break a mans soul in pieces ballard ever the pragmatist wondered if mironenkos vocabulary wasnt rather highflown in the hands of the kgb he doubted if he would be thinking of his souls contentment after all it was the body that had the nerveendings they talked for an hour or more the conversation moving back and forth between politics and personal reminiscence between trivia and confessional at the end of the meeting ballard was in no doubt as to mironenkos antipathy to his masters he was as he had said a man without faith the following day ballard met with cripps in the restaurant at the schweizerhof hotel and made his verbal report on mironenko hes ready and waiting but he insists we be quick about making up our minds im sure he does cripps said his glass eye was troubling him today the chilly air he explained made it sluggish it moved fractionally more slowly than his real eye and on occasion cripps had to nudge it with his fingertip to get it moving were not going to rushed into any decision cripps said wheres the problem i dont have any doubt about his commitment or his desperation so you said cripps replied would you like something for dessert do you doubt my appraisal is that what it is have something sweet to finish off so that i dont feel an utter reprobate you think im wrong about him dont you ballard pressed when cripps didnt reply ballard leaned across the table you do dont you im just saying theres reason for caution cripps said if we finally choose to take him on board the russians are going to be very distressed we have to be sure the deals worth the bad weather that comes with it things are so dicey at the moment when arent they ballard replied tell me a time when there wasnt some crisis in the offing he settled back in the chair and tried to read cripps face his glass eye was if anything more candid than the real one im sick of this damn game ballard muttered the glass eye roved because of the russian maybe believe me said cripps ive got good reason to be careful with this man name one theres nothing verified what have you got on him ballard insisted as i say rumour cripps replied why wasnt i briefed about it cripps made a tiny shake of his head its academic now he said youve provided a good report i just want you to understand that if things dont go the way you think they should its not because your appraisals arent trusted i see no you dont said cripps youre feeling martyred and i dont altogether blame you so what happens now im supposed to forget i ever met the man wouldnt do any harm said cripps out of sight out of mind clearly cripps didnt trust ballard to take his own advice though ballard made several discreet enquiries about the mironenko case in the following week it was plain that his usual circle of contacts had been warned to keep their lips sealed as it was the next news about the case reached ballard via the pages of the morning papers in an article about a body found in a house near the station on kaiser damm at the time of reading he had no way of knowing how the account tied up with mironenko but there was enough detail in the story to arouse his interest for one he had the suspicion that the house named in the article had been used by the service on occasion for another the article described how two unidentified men had almost been caught in the act of removing the body further suggesting that this was no crime of passion about noon he went to see cripps at his offices in the hope of coaxing him with some explanation but cripps was not available nor would be his secretary explained until further notice matters arising had taken him back to munich ballard left a message that he wished to speak with him when he returned as he stepped into the cold air again he realised that hed gained an admirer a thinfaced individual whose hair had retreated from his brow leaving a ludicrous forelock at the highwater mark ballard knew him in passing from cripps entourage but couldnt put a name to the face it was swiftly provided suckling the man said of course said ballard hello i think maybe we should talk if you have a moment the man said his voice was as pinched as his features ballard wanted none of his eossip he was about to refuse the offer when suckling said i suppose you heard what happened to cripps ballard shook his head suckling delighted to possess this nugget said again we should talk they walked along the kantstrasse towards the zoo the street was busy with lunchtime pedestrians but ballard scarcely noticed them the story that suckling unfolded as they walked demanded his full and absolute attention it was simply told cripps it appeared had made an arrangement to meet with mironenko in order to make his own assessment of the russians integrity the house in schoneberg chosen for the meeting had been used on several previous occasions and had long been considered one of the safest locations in the city it had not proved so the previous evening however kgb men had apparently followed mironenko to the house and then attempted to break the party up there was nobody to testify to what had happened subsequently both the men who had accompanied cripps one of them ballards old colleague odell were dead cripps himself was in a coma and mironenko ballard inquired suckling shrugged they took him home to the motherland presumably he said ballard caught a whiff of deceit off the man tm touched that youre keeping me up to date he said to suckling but why you and odell were friends werent you came the reply with cripps out of the picture you dont have many of those left is that so no offence intended suckling said hurriedly but youve got a reputation as a maverick get to the point said ballard there is no point suckling protested i just thought you ought to know what had happened im putting my neck on the line here nice try said ballard he stopped walking suckling wandered on a pace or two before turning to find ballard grinning at him who sent you nobody sent me suckling said clever to send the court gossip i almost fell for it youre very plausible there wasnt enough fat on sucklings face to hide the tic in his cheek what do they suspect me of do they think im conniving with mironenko is that it no i dont think theyre that stupid suckling shook his head like a doctor in the presence of some incurable disease you like making enemies he said occupational hazard i wouldnt lose any sleep over it i dont theres changes in the air suckling said id make sure you have your answers ready fuck the answers ballard said courteously i think its about time i worked out the right questions sending suckling to sound him out smacked of des peration they wanted inside information but about what could they seriously believe he had some involvement with mironenko or worse with the rgb itself he let his resentment subside it was stirring up too much mud and he needed clear water if he was to find his way free of this confusion in one regard suckling was perfectly correct he did have enemies and with cripps indisposed he was vulnerable in such circumstances there were two courses of action he could return to london and there lie low or wait around in berlin to see what manoeuvre they tried next he decided on the latter the charm of hideandseek was rapidly wearing thin as he turned north onto leibnizstrasse he caught the reflection of a greycoated man in a shop window it was a glimpse no more but he had the feeling that he knew the fellows face had they put a watchdog onto him he wondered he turned and caught the mans eye holding it the suspect seemed embarrassed and looked away a performance perhaps and then again perhaps not it mattered little ballard thought let them watch him all they liked he was guiltless if indeed there was such a condition this side of insanity a strange happiness had found sergei mironenko hap piness that came without rhyme or reason and filled his heart up to overflowing only the previous day circumstances had seemed unendurable the aching in his hands and head and spine had steadily worsened and was now accompanied by an itch so demanding hed had to snip his nails to the flesh to prevent himself doing serious damage his body he had concluded was in revolt against him it was that thought which he had tried to explain to ballard that he was divided from himself and feared that he would soon be torn apart but today the fear had gone not so the pains they were if anything worse than theyd been yesterday his sinews and ligaments ached as if theyd been exercised beyond the limits of their design there were bruises at all his joints where blood had broken its banks beneath the skin but that sense of imminent rebellion had disappeared to be replaced with a dreamy peacefulness and at its heart such happiness when he tried to think back over recent events to work out what had cued this transformation his memory played tricks he had been called to meet with ballards superior that he remembered whether he had gone to the meeting he did not the night was a blank ballard would know how things stood he reasoned he had liked and trusted the englishman from the beginning sensing that despite the many differences between them they were more alike than not if he let his instinct lead he would find ballard of that he was certain no doubt the englishman would be surprised to see him even angered at first but when he told ballard of this newfound happiness surely his trespasses would be forgiven ballard dined late and drank until later still in the ring a small transvestite bar which he had been first taken to by odell almost two decades ago no doubt his guides intention had been to prove his sophistication by showing his raw colleague the decadence of berlin but ballard though he never felt any sexual frisson in the company of the rings clientele had immediately felt at home here his neutrality was respected no attempts were made to solicit him he was simply left to drink and watch the passing parade of genders coming here tonight raised the ghost of odell whose name would now be scrubbed from conversation because of his involvement with the mironenko affair ballard had seen this process at work before history did not forgive failure unless it was so profound as to achieve a kind of grandeur for the odells of the world ambitious men who had found themselves through little fault of their own in a culdesac from which all retreat was barred for such men there would be no fine words spoken nor medals struck there would only be oblivion it made him melancholy to think of this and he drank heavily to keep his thoughts mellow but when at two in the morning he stepped out on to the street his depression was only marginally dulled the good burghers of berlin were well abed tomorrow was another working day only the sound of traffic from the kurfurstendamm offered sign of life somewhere near he made his way towards it his thoughts fleecy behind him laughter a young man glamorously dressed as a starlet tottered along the pavement arm in arm with his unsmiling escort ballard recognised the transvestite as a regular at the bar the client to judge by his sober suit was an outoftowner slaking his thirst for boys dressed as girls behind his wifes back ballard picked up his pace the young mans laughter its musicality patently forced set his teeth on edge he heard somebody running nearby caught a shadow moving out of the corner of his eye his watchdog most likely though alcohol had blurred his instincts he felt some anxiety surface the root of which he couldnt fix he walked on featherlight tremors ran in his scalp a few yards on he realised that the laughter from the street behind him had ceased he glanced over his shoulder halfexpecting to see the boy and his customer embracing but both had disappeared slipped off down one of the alleyways no doubt to conclude their contract in darkness somewhere near a dog had begun to bark wildly ballard turned round to look back the way hed come daring the deserted street to display its secrets to him whatever was arousing the buzz in his head and the itch on his palms it was no commonplace anxiety there was something wrong with the street despite its show of innocence it hid terrors the bright lights of the kurfurstendamm were no more than three minutes walk away but he didnt want to turn his back on this mystery and take refuge there instead he proceeded to walk back the way hed come slowly the dog had now ceased its alarm and settled into silence he had only his footsteps for company he reached the corner of the first alleyway and peered down it no light burned at window or doorway he could sense no living presence in the gloom he crossed over the alley and walked on to the next a luxurious stench had crept into the air which became more lavish yet as he approached the corner as he breathed it in the buzz in his head deepened to a threat of thunder a single light flickered in the throat of the alley a meagre wash from an upper window by it he saw the body of the outoftowner lying sprawled on the ground he had been so traumatically mutilated it seemed an attempt might have been made to turn him inside out from the spilled innards that ripe smell rose in all its complexity ballard had seen violent death before and thought himself indifferent to the spectacle but something here in the alley threw his calm into disarray he felt his limbs begin to shake and then from beyond the throw of light the boy spoke in gods name he said his voice had lost all pretension to femininity it was a murmur of undisguised terror ballard took a step down the alley neither the boy nor the reason for his whispered prayer became visible until he had advanced ten yards the boy was halfslumped against the wall amongst the refuse his sequins and taffeta had been ripped from him the body was pale and sexless he seemed not to notice ballard his eyes were fixed on the deepest shadows the shaking in ballards limbs worsened as he followed the boys gaze it was all he could do to prevent his teeth from chattering nevertheless he continued his advance not for the boys sake heroism had little merit hed always been taught but because he was curious more than curious eager to see what manner of man was capable of such casual violence to look into the eyes of such ferocity seemed at that moment the most important thing in all the world now the boy saw him and muttered a pitiful appeal but ballard scarcely heard it he felt other eyes upon him and their touch was like a blow the din in his head took on a sickening rhythm like the sound of helicopter rotors in mere seconds it mounted to a blinding roar ballard pressed his hands to his eyes and stumbled back against the wall dimly aware that the killer was moving out of hiding and making his escape he felt something brush against him and opened his eyes in time to glimpse the man slipping away down the passageway he seemed somehow misshapen his back crooked his head too large ballard loosed a shout after him but the berserker ran on pausing only to look down at the body before racing towards the street ballard heaved himself off the wall and stood upright the noise in his head was diminishing somewhat the attendant giddiness was passing behind him the boy had begun sobbing did you see he said did you see who was it somebody you knew the boy stared at ballard like a frightened doe his mascaraed eyes huge somebody he said ballard was about to repeat the question when there came a shriek of brakes swiftly followed by the sound of the impact leaving the boy to pull his tattered trousseau about him ballard went back into the street voices were raised nearby he hurried to their source a large car was straddling the pavement its headlights blazing the driver was being helped from his seat while his passengers partygoers to judge by their dress and drinkflushed faces stood and debated furiously as to how the accident had happened one of the women was talking about an animal in the road but another of the passengers corrected her the body that lay in the gutter where it had been thrown was not that of an animal ballard had seen little of the killer in the alleyway but he knew instinctively that this was he there was no sign of the malformation he thought hed glimpsed however just a man dressed in a suit that had seen better days lying face down in a patch of blood the police had already arrived and an officer shouted to him to stand away from the body but ballard ignored the instruction and went to steal a look at the dead mans face there was nothing there of the ferocity he had hoped so much to see but there was much he recognised nevertheless the man was odell he told the officers that he had seen nothing of the accident which was essentially true and made his escape from the scene before events in the adjacent alley were discovered it seemed every corner turned on his route back to his rooms brought a fresh question chief amongst them why he had been lied to about odells death and what psychosis had seized the man that made him capable of the slaughter ballard had witnessed he would not get the answers to these questions from his sometime colleagues that he knew the only man whom he might have beguiled an answer from was cripps he remembered the debate theyd had about mironenko and cripps talk of reasons for caution when dealing with the russian the glass eye had known then that there was something in the wind though surely even he had not envisaged the scale of the present disaster two highly valued agents murdered mironenko missing presumed dead he himself if suckling was to be believed at deaths door and all this begun with sergei zakharovich mironenko the lost man of berlin it seemed his tragedy was infectious tomorrow ballard decided he would find suckling and squeeze some answers from him in the meantime his head and his hands ached and he wanted sleep fatigue compromised sound judgement and if ever he needed that faculty it was now but despite his exhaustion sleep eluded him for an hour or more and when it came it was no comfort he dreamt whispers and hard upon them rising as if to drown them out the roar of the helicopters twice he surfaced from sleep with his head pounding twice a hunger to understand what the whispers were telling him drove him to the pillow again when he woke for the third time the noise between his temples had become crippling a thoughtcancelling assault which made him fear for his sanity barely able to see the room through the pain he crawled from his bed pleasehe murmured as if there were somebody to help him from his misery a cool voice answered him out of the darkness what do you want he didnt question the questioner merely said take the pain away you can do that for yourself the voice told him he leaned against the wall nursing his splitting head tears of agony coming and coming i dont know how he said your dreams give you pain the voice replied so you must forget them do you understand forget them and the pain will go he understood the instruction but not how to realise it he had no powers of government in sleep he was the object of these whispers not they his but the voice insisted the dream means you harm bollard you must bury it bury it deep bury it make an image of it ballard picture it in detail he did as he was told he imagined a burial party and a box and in the box this dream he made them dig deep as the voice instructed him so that he would never be able to disinter this hurtful thing again but even as he imagined the box lowered into the pit he heard its boards creak the dream would not lie down it beat against confinement the boards began to break quicklyv the voice said the din of the rotors had risen to a terrifying pitch blood had begun to pour from his nostrils he tasted salt at the back of his throat finish if the voice yelled above the tumult cover it upl ballard looked into the grave the box was thrashing from side to side cover it damn you he tried to make the burial party obey tried to will them to pick up their shovels and bury the offending thing alive but they would not instead they gazed into the grave as he did and watched as the contents of the box fought for light no the voice demanded its fury mounting you must not look the box danced in the hole the lid splintered briefly ballard glimpsed something shining up between the boards it will killyou the voice said and as if to prove its point the volume of the sound rose beyond the point of endurance washing out burial party box and all in a blaze of pain suddenly it seemed that what the voice said was true that he was near to death but it wasnt the dream that was conspiring to kill him but the sentinel they had posted between him and it this skullsplintering cacophony only now did he realise that hed fallen on the floor prostrate beneath this assault reaching out blindly he found the wall and hauled himself towards it the machines still thundering behind his eyes the blood hot on his face he stood up as best he could and began to move towards the bathroom behind him the voice its tantrum controlled began its exhortation afresh it sounded so intimate that he looked round fully expecting to see the speaker and he was not disappointed for a few flickering moments he seemed to be standing in a small windowless room its walls painted a uniform white the light here was bright and dead and in the centre of the room stood the face behind the voice smiling your dreams give you pain he said this was the first commandment again bury them ballard and the pain will pass ballard wept like a child this scrutiny shamed him he looked away from his tutor to bury his tears trust us another voice said close by were your friends he didnt trust their fine words the very pain they claimed to want to save him from was of their making it was a stick to beat him with if the dreams came calling we want to help you one or other of them said nohe murmured no damn you i dont i dont believe the room flickered out and he was in the bedroom again clinging to the wall like a climber to a cliffface before they could come for him with more words more pain he edged his way to the bathroom door and stumbled blindly towards the shower there was a moment of panic while he located the taps and then the water came on at a rush it was bitterly cold but he put his head beneath it while the onslaught of rotorblades tried to shake the plates of his skull apart icy water trekked down his back but he let the rain come down on him in a torrent and by degrees the helicopters took their leave he didnt move though his body juddered with cold until the last of them had gone then he sat on the edge of the bath mopping water from his neck and face and body and eventually when his legs felt courageous enough made his way back into the bedroom he lay down on the same crumpled sheets in much the same position as hed lain in before yet nothing was the same he didnt know what had changed in him or how but he lay there without sleep disturbing his serenity through the remaining hours of the night trying to puzzle it out and a little before dawn he remembered the words he had muttered in the face of the delusion simple words but oh their power i dont believehe said and the commandments trembled it was half an hour before noon when he arrived at the small book exporting firm which served suckling for cover he felt quickwitted despite the disturbance of the night and rapidly charmed his way past the receptionist and entered sucklings office unannounced when sucklings eyes settled on his visitor he started from his desk as if fired upon good morning said ballard i thought it was time we talked sucklings eyes fled to the officedoor which ballard had left ajar sorry is there a draught ballard closed the door gently i want to see cripps he said suckling waded through the sea of books and manu scripts that threatened to engulf his desk are you out of your mind coming back here tell them im a friend of the family ballard offered i cant believe youd be so stupid just point me to cripps and ill be away suckling ignored him in favour of his tirade its taken two years to establish my credentials here ballard laughed im going to report this damn you i think you should said ballard turning up the volume in the meanwhile wheres cripps suckling apparently convinced that he was faced with a lunatic controlled his apoplexy all right he said til have somebody call on you take you to him not good enough ballard replied he crossed to suckling in two short strides and took hold of him by his lapel hed spent at most three hours with suckling in ten years but hed scarcely passed a moment in his presence without itching to do what he was doing now knocking the mans hands away he pushed suckling against the booklined wall a stack of volumes caught by sucklings heel toppled once more ballard said the old man take your fucking hands off me suckling said his fury redoubled at being touched again said ballard cripps ill have you carpeted for this ill have you our ballard leaned towards the reddening face and smiled im out anyway people have died remember london needs a sacrificial lamb and i think im it sucklings face dropped so ive got nothing to lose have i there was no reply ballard pressed closer to suckling tightening his grip on the man have sucklings courage failed him cripps is dead he said ballard didnt release his hold you said the same about odell he remarked at the name sucklings eyes widened and i saw him only last night ballard said out on the town you saw odell oh yes mention of the dead man brought the scene in the alleyway back to mind the smell of the body the boys sobs there were other faiths thought ballard beyond the one hed once shared with the creature beneath him faiths whose devotions were made in heat and blood whose dogmas were dreams where better to baptise himself into that new faith than here in the blood of the enemy somewhere at the very back of his head he could hear the helicopters but he wouldnt let them take to the air he was strong today his head his hands all strong when he drew his nails towards sucklings eyes the blood came easily he had a sudden vision of the face beneath the flesh of sucklings features stripped to the essence sir ballard glanced over his shoulder the receptionist was standing at the open door oh im sorry she said preparing to withdraw to judge by her blushes she assumed this was a lovers tryst shed walked in upon stay said suckling mr ballard was just leaving ballard released his prey there would be other opportunities to have sucklings life til see you again he said suckling drew a handkerchief from his top pocket and pressed it to his face depend upon it he replied now they would come for him he could have no doubt of that he was a rogue element and they would strive to silence him as quickly as possible the thought did not distress him whatever they had tried to make him forget with their brainwashing was more ambitious than they had anticipated however deeply they had taught him to bury it it was digging its way back to the surface he couldnt see it yet but he knew it was near more than once on his way back to his rooms he imagined eyes at his back maybe he was still being tailed but his instincts informed him otherwise the presence he felt closeby so near that it was sometimes at his shoulder was perhaps simply another part of him he felt protected by it as by a local god he had half expected there to be a reception committee awaiting him at his rooms but there was nobody either suckling had been obliged to delay his alarmcall or else the upper echelons were still debating their tactics he pocketed those few keepsakes that he wanted to preserve from their calculating eyes and left the building again without anyone making a move to stop him it felt good to be alive despite the chill that rendered the grim streets grimmer still he decided for no particular reason to go to the zoo which though he had been visiting the city for two decades he had never done as he walked it occurred to him that hed never been as free as he was now that he had shed mastery like an old coat no wonder they feared him they had good reason kantstrasse was busy but he cut his way through the pedestrians easily almost as if they sensed a rare certainty in him and gave him a wide berth as he approached the entrance to the zoo however somebody jostled him he looked round to upbraid the fellow but caught only the back of the mans head as he was submerged in the crowd heading onto hardenbergstrasse suspecting an attempted theft he checked his pockets to find that a scrap of paper had been slipped into one he knew better than to examine it on the spot but casually glanced round again to see if he recognised the courier the man had already slipped away he delayed his visit to the zoo and went instead to the tiergarten and there in the wilds of the great park found a place to read the message it was from mironenko and it requested a meeting to talk of a matter of considerable urgency naming a house in marienfelde as a venue ballard memorised the details then shredded the note it was perfectly possible that the invitation was a trap of course set either by his own faction or by the opposition perhaps a way to test his allegiance or to manipulate him into a situation in which he could be easily despatched despite such doubts he had no choice but to go however in the hope that this blind date was indeed with mironenko whatever dangers this rendezvous brought they were not so new indeed given his longheld doubts of the efficacy of sight hadnt every date hed ever made been in some sense blind by early evening the damp air was thickening towards a fog and by the time he stepped off the bus on hildburg hauserstrasse it had a good hold on the city lending the chill new powers to discomfort ballard went quickly through the quiet streets he scarcely knew the district at all but its proximity to the wall bled it of what little charm it might once have possessed many of the houses were unoccupied of those that were not most were sealed off against the night and the cold and the lights that glared from the watchtowers it was only with the aid of a map that he located the tiny street mironenkos note had named no lights burned in the house ballard knocked hard but there was no answering footstep in the hall he had anticipated several possible scenarios but an absence of response at the house had not been amongst them he knocked again and again it was only then that he heard sounds from within and finally the door was opened to him the hallway was painted grey and brown and lit only by a bare bulb the man silhouetted against this drab interior was not mironenko yes he said what do you want his german was spoken with a distinct muscovite inflection im looking for a friend of mine ballard said the man who was almost as broad as the doorway he stood in shook his head theres nobody here he said only me i was told you must have the wrong house no sooner had the doorkeeper made the remark than noise erupted from down the dreary hallway furniture was being overturned somebody had begun to shout the russian looked over his shoulder and went to slam the door in ballards face but ballards foot was there to stop him taking advantage of the mans divided attention ballard put his shoulder to the door and pushed he was in the hallway indeed he was halfway down it before the russian took a step in pursuit the sound of demolition had escalated and was now drowned out by the sound of a man squealing ballard followed the sound past the sovereignty of the lone bulb and into gloom at the back of the house he might well have lost his way at that point but that a door was flung open ahead of him the room beyond had scarlet floorboards they glistened as if freshly painted and now the decorator appeared in person his torso had been ripped open from neck to navel he pressed his hands to the breached dam but they were useless to stem the flood his blood came in spurts and with it his innards he met ballards gaze his eyes full to overflowing with death but his body had not yet received the instruction to lie down and die it juddered on in a pitiful attempt to escape the scene of execution behind him the spectacle had brought ballard to a halt and the russian from the door now took hold of him and pulled him back into the hallway shouting into his face the outburst in panicked russian was beyond ballard but he needed no translation of the hands that encircled his throat the russian was half his weight again and had the grip of an expert strangler but ballard felt effortlessly the mans superior he wrenched the attackers hands from his neck and struck him across the face it was a fortuitous blow the russian fell back against the staircase his shouts silenced ballard looked back towards the scarlet room the dead man had gone though scraps of flesh had been left on the threshold from within laughter ballard turned to the russian what in gods names going on he demanded but the other man simply stared through the open door even as he spoke the laughter stopped a shadow moved across the bloodsplattered wall of the interior and a voice said ballard there was a roughness there as if the speaker had been shouting all day and night but it was the voice of mironenko dont stand out in the cold he said come on in and bring solomonov the other man made a bid for the front door but ballard had hold of him before he could take two steps theres nothing to be afraid of comrade said mironenko the dogs gone despite the reassurance solomonov began to sob as ballard pressed him towards the open door mironenko was right it was warmer inside and there no sign of a dog there was blood in abundance however the man ballard had last seen teetering in the doorway had been dragged back into this abattoir while he and solomonov had struggled the body had been treated with astonishing barbarity the head had been smashed open the innards were a grim litter underfoot squatting in the shadowy corner of this terrible room mironenko he had been mercilessly beaten to judge by the swelling about his head and upper torso but his unshaven face bore a smile for his saviour i knew youd come he said his gaze fell upon solomonov they followed me he said they meant to kill me i suppose is that what you intended comrade solomonov shook with fear his eyes flitting from the bruised moon of mironenkos face to the pieces of gut that lay everywhere about finding nowhere a place of refuge what stopped them ballard asked mironenko stood up even this slow movement caused solomonov to flinch tell mr ballard mironenko prompted tell him what happened solomonov was too terrified to speak hes kgb of course mironenko explained both trusted men but not trusted enough to be warned poor idiots so they were sent to murder me with just a gun and a prayer he laughed at the thought neither of which were much use in the circumstances i beg you solomonov murmured let me go ill say nothing youll say what they want you to say comrade the way we all must mironenko replied isnt that right ballard all slaves of our faith ballard watched mironenkos face closely there was a fullness there that could not be entirely explained by the bruising the skin almost seemed to crawl they have made us forgetful mironenko said of what ballard enquired of ourselves came the reply and with it mironenko moved from his murky corner and into the light what had solomonov and his dead companion done to him his flesh was a mass of tiny contusions and there were bloodied lumps at his neck and temples which ballard might have taken for bruises but that they palpitated as if something nested beneath the skin mironenko made no sign of discomfort however as he reached out to solomonov at his touch the failed assassin lost control of his bladder but mironenkos intentions were not murderous with eerie tenderness he stroked a tear from solomonovs cheek go back to them he advised the trembling man tell them what youve seen solomonov seemed scarcely to believe his ears or else suspected as did ballard that this forgiveness was a sham and that any attempt to leave would invite fatal consequences but mironenko pressed his point go on he said leave us please or would you prefer to stay and eat solomonov took a single faltering step towards the door when no blow came he took a second step and a third and now he was out of the door and away tell them mironenko shouted after him the front door slammed tell them what said ballard that ive remembered mironenko said that ive found the skin they stole from me for the first time since entering this house ballard began to feel queasy it was not the blood nor the bones underfoot but a look in mironenkos eyes hed seen eyes as bright once before but where you he said quietly you did this certainly mironenko replied how ballard said there was a familiar thunder climbing from the back of his head he tried to ignore it and press some explanation from the russian how damn you we are the same mironenko replied i smell it in you no said ballard the clamour was rising the doctrines are just words its not what were taught but what we know that matters in our marrow in our souls he had talked of souls once before of places his masters had built in which a man could be broken apart at the time ballard had thought such talk mere extravagance now he wasnt so sure what was the burial party all about if not the subjugation of some secret part of him the marrowpart the soulpart before ballard could find the words to express himself mironenko froze his eyes gleaming more brightly than ever theyre outside he said who are the russian shrugged does it matter he said your side or mine either one will silence us if they can that much was true we must be quick he said and headed for the hallway the front door stood ajar mironenko was there in moments ballard followed together they slipped out on to the street the fog had thickened it idled around the street lamps muddying their light making every doorway a hiding place ballard didnt wait to tempt the pursuers out into the open but followed mironenko who was already well ahead swift despite his bulk ballard had to pick up his pace to keep the man in sight one moment he was visible the next the fog closed around him the residential property they moved through now gave way to more anonymous buildings warehouses perhaps whose walls stretched up into the murky darkness unbroken by windows ballard called after him to slow his crippling pace the russian halted and turned back to ballard his outline wavering in the besieged light was it a trick of the fog or had mironenkos condition deteriorated in the minutes since theyd left the house his face seemed to be seeping the lumps on his neck had swelled further we dont have to run ballard said theyre not following theyre always following mironenko replied and as if to give weight to the observation ballard heard fogdeadened footsteps in a nearby street no time to debate mironenko murmured and turning on his heel he ran in seconds the fog had spirited him away again ballard hesitated another moment incautious as it was he wanted to catch a glimpse of his pursuers so as to know them for the future but now as the soft pad of mironenkos step diminished into silence he realised that the other footsteps had also ceased did they know he was waiting for them he held his breath but there was neither sound nor sign of them the delinquent fog idled on he seemed to be alone in it reluctantly he gave up waiting and went after the russian at a run a few yards on the road divided there was no sign of mironenko in either direction cursing his stupidity in lingering behind ballard followed the route which was most heavily shrouded in fog the street was short and ended at a wall lined with spikes beyond which there was a park of some kind the fog clung more tenaciously to this space of damp earth than it did to the street and ballard could see no more than four or five yards across the grass from where he stood but he knew intuitively that he had chosen the right road that mironenko had scaled this wall and was waiting for him somewhere close by behind him the fog kept its counsel either their pursuers had lost him or their way or both he hoisted himself up on to the wall avoiding the spikes by a whisper and dropped down on the opposite side the street had seemed pindrop quiet but it clearly wasnt for it was quieter still inside the park the fog was chillier here and pressed more insistently upon him as he advanced across the wet grass the wall behind him his only point of anchorage in this wasteland became a ghost of itself then faded entirely committed now he walked on a few more steps not certain that he was even taking a straight route suddenly the fog curtain was drawn aside and he saw a figure waiting for him a few yards ahead the bruises now twisted his face so badly ballard would not have known it to be mironenko but that his eyes still burned so brightly the man did not wait for ballard but turned again and loped off into insolidity leaving the englishman to follow cursing both the chase and the quarry as he did so he felt a movement close by his senses were useless in the clammy embrace of fog and night but he saw with that other eye heard with that other ear and he knew he was not alone had mironenko given up the race and come back to escort him he spoke the mans name knowing that in doing so he made his position apparent to any and all but equally certain that whoever stalked him already knew precisely where he stood speak he said there was no reply out of the fog then movement the fog curled upon itself and ballard glimpsed a form dividing the veils mironenko he called after the man again taking several steps through the murk in pursuit and suddenly something was stepping out to meet him he saw the phantom for a moment only long enough to glimpse incandescent eyes and teeth grown so vast they wrenched the mouth into a permanent grimace of those facts eyes and teeth he was certain of the other bizarrities the bristling flesh the monstrous limbs he was less sure maybe his mind exhausted with so much noise and pain was finally losing its grip on the real world inventing terrors to frighten him back into ignorance damn you he said defying both the thunder that was coming to blind him again and the phantoms he would be blinded to almost as if to test his defiance the fog up ahead shimmered and parted and something that he might have taken for human but that it had its belly to the ground slunk into view and out to his right he heard growls to his left another indeterminate form came and went he was surrounded it seemed by mad men and wild dogs and mironenko where was he part of this assembly or prey to it hearing a halfword spoken behind him he swung round to see a figure that was plausibly that of the russian backing into the fog this time he didnt walk in pursuit he ran and his speed was rewarded the figure reappeared ahead of him and ballard stretched to snatch at the mans jacket his fingers found purchase and all at once mironenko was reeling round a growl in his throat and ballard was staring into a face that almost made him cry out his mouth was a raw wound the teeth vast the eyes slits of molten gold the lumps at his neck had swelled and spread so that the russians head was no longer raised above his body but part of one undivided energy head becoming torso without an axis intervening ballard the beast smiled its voice clung to coherence only with the greatest difficulty but ballard heard the remnants of mironenko there the more he scanned the simmering flesh the more appalled he became dont be afraid mironenko said what disease is this the only disease i ever suffered was forgetfulness and im cured of that he grimaced as he spoke as if each word was shaped in contradiction to the instincts of his throat ballard touched his hand to his head despite his revolt against the pain the noise was rising and rising you remember too dont you youre the same no ballard muttered mironenko reached a spinehaired palm to touch him dont be afraid he said youre not alone there are many of us brothers and sisters im not your brother ballard said the noise was bad but the face of mironenko was worse revolted he turned his back on it but the russian only followed him dont you taste freedom ballard and life just a breath away ballard walked on the blood beginning to creep from his nostrils he let it come it only hurts for a while mironenko said then the pain goes ballard kept his head down eyes to the earth mironenko seeing that he was making little impression dropped behind they wont take you back he said youve seen too much the roar of helicopters did not entirely blot these words out ballard knew there was truth in them his step faltered and through the cacophony he heard mironenko murmur look ahead the fog had thinned somewhat and the park wall was visible through rags of mist behind him mironenkos voice had descended to a snarl look at what you are the rotors roared ballards legs felt as though they would fold up beneath him but he kept up his advance towards the wall within yards of it mironenko called after him again but this time the words had fled altogether there was only a low growl ballard could not resist looking just once he glanced over his shoulder again the fog confounded him but not entirely for moments that were both an age and yet too brief ballard saw the thing that had been mironenko in all its glory and at the sight the rotors grew to screaming pitch he clamped his hands to his face as he did so a shot rang out then another then a volley of shots he fell to the ground as much in weakness as in selfdefence and uncovered his eyes to see several human figures moving in the fog though he had forgotten their pursuers they had not forgotten him they had traced him to the park and stepped into the midst of this lunacy and now men and halfmen and things not men were lost in the fog and there was bloody confusion on every side he saw a gunman firing at a shadow only to have an ally appear from the fog with a bullet in his belly saw a thing appear on four legs and flit from sight again on two saw another run by carrying a human head by the hair and laughing from its snouted face the turmoil spilled towards him fearing for his life he stood up and staggered back towards the wall the cries and shots and snarls went on he expected either bullet or beast to find him with every step but he reached the wall alive and attempted to scale it his coordination had deserted him however he had no choice but to follow the wall along its length until he reached the gate behind him the scenes of unmasking and transform ation and mistaken identity went on his enfeebled thoughts turned briefly to mironenko would he or any of his tribe survive this massacre ballard said a voice in the fog he couldnt see the speaker although he recognised the voice hed heard it in his delusion and it had told him lies he felt a pinprick at his neck the man had come from behind and was pressing a needle into him sleep the voice said and with the words came oblivion at first he couldnt remember the mans name his mind wandered like a lost child although his interrogator would time and again demand his attention speaking to him as though they were old friends and there was indeed something familiar about his errant eye that went on its way so much more slowly than its companion at last the name came to him youre cripps he said of course im cripps the man replied is your memory playing tricks dont concern yourself ive given you some suppressants to keep you from losing your balance not that i think thats very likely youve fought the good fight ballard in spite of considerable provocation when i think of the way odell snap ped he sighed do you remember last night at all at first his minds eye was blind but then the memories began to come vague forms moving in a fog the park he said at last i only just got you out god knows how many are dead the other the russian mironenko cripps prompted i dont know im not in charge any longer you see i just stepped in to salvage something if i could london will need us again sooner or later especially now they know the russians have a special corps like us wed heard rumours of course and then after youd met with him began to wonder about mironenko thats why i set up the meeting and of course when i saw him face to face i knew theres something in the eyes something hungry i saw him change yes its quite a sight isnt it the power it unleashes thats why we developed the programme you see to harness that power to have it work for us but its difficult to control it took years of suppression therapy slowly burying the desire for transformation so that what we had left was a man with a beasts faculties a wolf in sheeps clothing we thought we had the problem beaten that if the belief systems didnt keep you subdued the pain response would but we were wrong he stood up and crossed to the window now we have to start again suckling said youd been wounded no merely demoted ordered back to london but youre not going i will now now that ive found you he looked round at ballard youre my vindication ballard youre living proof that my techniques are viable you have full knowledge of your condition yet the therapy holds the leash he turned back to the window rain lashed the glass ballard could almost feel it upon his head upon his back cool sweet rain for a blissful moment he seemed to be running in it close to the ground and the air was full of the scents the downpour had released from the pavements mironenko said forget mironenko cripps told him hes dead youre the last of the old order ballard and the first of the new downstairs a bell rang cripps peered out of the window at the streets below well well he said a delegation come to beg us to return i hope youre flattered he went to the door stay here we neednt show you off tonight youre weary let them wait eh let them sweat he left the stale room closing the door behind him ballard heard his footsteps on the stairs the bell was being rung a second time he got up and crossed to the window the weariness of the late afternoon light matched his weariness he and his city were still of one accord despite the curse that was upon him below a man emerged from the back of the car and crossed to the front door even at this acute angle ballard recognised suckling there were voices in the hallway and with sucklings appearance the debate seemed to become more heated ballard went to the door and listened but his drug dulled mind could make little sense of the argument he prayed that cripps would keep to his word and not allow them to peer at him he didnt want to be a beast like mironenko it wasnt freedom was it to be so terrible it was merely a different kind of tyranny but then he didnt want to be the first of cripps heroic new order either he belonged to nobody he realised not even himself he was hopelessly lost and yet hadnt mironenko said at that first meeting that the man who did not believe himself lost was lost perhaps better that better to exist in the twilight between one state and another to prosper as best he could by doubt and ambiguity than to suffer the certainties of the tower the debate below was gaining in momentum ballard opened the door so as to hear better it was sucklings voice that met him the tone was waspish but no less threatening for that its over he was telling cripps dont you understand plain english cripps made an attempt to protest but suckling cut him short either you come in a gentlemanly fashion or gideon and sheppard carry you out which is it to be what is this cripps demanded youre nobody suckling youre comic relief that was yesterday the man replied thereve been some changes made every dog has his day isnt that right you should know that better than anybody id get a coat if i were you its raining there was a short silence then cripps said all right ill come good man said suckling sweetly gideon go check upstairs im alone said cripps i believe you said suckling then to gideon do it anyway ballard heard somebody move across the hallway and then a sudden flurry of movement cripps was either making an escapebid or attacking suckling one of the two suckling shouted out there was a scuffle then cutting through the confusion a single shot cripps cried out then came the sound of him falling now sucklings voice thick with fury stupid he said stupid cripps groaned something which ballard didnt catch had he asked to be dispatched perhaps for suckling told him no youre going back to london sheppard stop him bleeding gideon upstairs baliard backed away from the head of the stairs as gideon began his ascent he felt sluggish and inept there was no way out of this trap they would corner him and exterminate him he was a beast a mad dog in a maze if hed only killed suckling when hed had the strength to do so but then what good would that have done the world was full of men like suckling men biding their time until they could show their true colours vile soft secret men and suddenly the beast seemed to move in baliard and he thought of the park and the fog and the smile on the face of mironenko and he felt a surge of grief for something hed never had the life of a monster gideon was almost at the top of the stairs though it could only delay the inevitable by moments baliard slipped along the landing and opened the first door he found it was the bathroom there was a bolt on the door which he slipped into place the sound of running water filled the room a piece of guttering had broken and was delivering a torrent of rainwater onto the windowsill the sound and the chill of the bathroom brought the night of delusions back he remembered the pain and blood remembered the shower water beating on his skull cleansing him of the taming pain at the thought four words came to his lips unbidden i do not believe he had been heard theres somebody up here gideon called the man approached the door and beat on it open up baliard heard him quite clearly but didnt reply his throat was burning and the roar of rotors was growing louder again he put his back to the door and despaired suckling was up the stairs and at the door in seconds whos in there he demanded to know answer me whos in there getting no response he ordered that cripps be brought upstairs there was more commotion as the order was obeyed for the last time suckling said the pressure was building in ballards skull this time it seemed the din had lethal intentions his eyes ached as if about to be blown from their sockets he caught sight of something in the mirror above the sink something with gleaming eyes and again the words came i do not believe but this time his throat hot with other business could barely pronounce them ballard said suckling there was triumph in the word my god weve got ballard as well this is our lucky day no thought the man in the mirror there was nobody of that name here nobody of any name at all in fact for werent names the first act of faith the first board in the box you buried freedom in the thing he was becoming would not be named nor boxed nor buried never again for a moment he lost sight of the bathroom and found himself hovering above the grave they had made him dig and in the depths the box danced as its contents fought its premature burial he could hear the wood splintering or was it the sound of the door being broken down the boxlid flew off a rain of nails fell on the heads of the burial party the noise in his head as if knowing that its torments had proved fruitless suddenly fled and with it the delusion he was back in the bathroom facing the open door the men who stared through at him had the faces of fools slack and stupefied with shock seeing the way he was wrought seeing the snout of him the hair of him the golden eye and the yellow tooth of him their horror elated him kill it said suckling and pushed gideon into the breach the man already had his gun from his pocket and was levelling it but his triggerfinger was too slow the beast snatched his hand and pulped the flesh around the steel gideon screamed and stumbled away down the stairs ignoring sucklings shouts as the beast raised his hand to sniff the blood on his palm there was a flash of fire and he felt the blow to his shoulder sheppard had no chance to fire a second shot however before his prey was through the door and upon him forsaking his gun he made a futile bid for the stairs but the beasts hand unsealed the back of his head in one easy stroke the gunman toppled forward the narrow landing filling with the smell of him forgetting his other enemies the beast fell upon the offal and ate somebody said ballard the beast swallowed down the dead mans eyes in one gulp like prime oysters again those syllables ballard he would have gone on with his meal but that the sound of weeping pricked his ears dead to himself he was but not to grief he dropped the meat from his fingers and looked back along the landing the man who was crying only wept from one eye the other gazed on oddly untouched but the pain in the living eye was profound indeed it was despair the beast knew such suffering was too close to him for the sweetness of transformation to have erased it entirely the weeping man was locked in the arms of another man who had his gun placed against the side of his prisoners head if you make another move the captor said til blow his head off do you understand me the beast wiped his mouth tell him cripps hes your baby make him understand the oneeyed man tried to speak but words defeated him blood from the wound in his abdomen seeped between his fingers neither of you need die the captor said the beast didnt like the music of his voice it was shrill and deceitful london would much prefer to have you alive so why dont you tell him cripps tell him i mean him no harm the weeping man nodded ballardhe murmured his voice was softer than the other the beast listened tell me ballard he said how does it feel the beast couldnt quite make sense of the question please tell me for curiositys sake damn you said suckling pressing the gun into cripps flesh this isnt a debating society is it good cripps asked ignoring both man and gun shut up answer me ballard how does it feel as he stared into cripps despairing eyes the meaning of the sounds hed uttered came clear the words falling into place like the pieces of a mosaic is it good the man was asking ballard heard laughter in his throat and found the syllables there to reply yes he told the weeping man yes its good he had not finished his reply before cripps hand sped to snatch at sucklings whether he intended suicide or escape nobody would ever know the triggerfinger twitched and a bullet flew up through cripps head and spread his despair across the ceiling suckling threw the body off and went to level the gun but the beast was already upon him had he been more of a man ballard might have thought to make suckling suffer but he had no such perverse ambition his only thought was to render the enemy extinct as efficiently as possible two sharp and lethal blows did it once the man was dispatched ballard crossed over to where cripps was lying his glass eye had escaped destruction it gazed on fixedly untouched by the holocaust all around them unseating it from the maimed head ballard put in his pocket then he went out into the rain it was dusk he did not know which district of berlin hed been brought to but his impulses freed of reason led him via the back streets and shadows to a wasteland on the outskirts of the city in the middle of which stood a solitary ruin it was anybodys guess as to what the building might once have been an abbatoir an operahouse but by some freak of fate it had escaped demolition though every other building had been levelled for several hundred yards in each direction as he made his way across the weedclogged rubble the wind changed direction by a few degrees and carried the scent of his tribe to him there were many there together in the shelter of the ruin some leaned their backs against the wall and shared a cigarette some were perfect wolves and haunted the darkness like ghosts with golden eyes yet others might have passed for human entirely but for their trails though he feared that names would be forbidden amongst this clan he asked two lovers who were rutting in the shelter of the wall if they knew of a man called mironenko the bitch had a smooth and hairless back and a dozen full teats hanging from her belly listen she said ballard listened and heard somebody talking in a corner of the ruin the voice ebbed and flowed he followed the sound across the roofless interior to where a wolf was standing surrounded by an attentive audience an open book in its front paws at ballards approach one or two of the audience turned their luminous eyes up to him the reader halted ssh said one the comrade is reading to us it was mironenko who spoke ballard slipped into the ring of listeners beside him as the reader took up the story afresh and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth ballard had heard the words before but tonight they were new and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air he looked around the circle of listeners as the words described their familiar pattern and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth somewhere near a beast was crying the book of blood on jerusalem street wyburd looked at the book and the book looked back everything hed ever been told about the boy was true how did you get in mcneal wanted to know there was neither anger nor trepidation in his voice only casual curiosity over the wall wyburd told him the book nodded come to see if the rumours were true something like that amongst connoisseurs of the bizarre mcneals story was told in reverential whispers how the boy had passed himself off as a medium inventing stories on behalf of the departed for his own profit and how the dead had finally tired of his mockery and broken into the living world to exact an immaculate revenge they had written upon him tattooed their true testaments upon his skin so that he would never again take their grief in vain they had turned his body into a living book a book of blood every inch of which was minutely engraved with their histories wyburd was not a credulous man he had never quite believed the story until now but here was living proof of its veracity standing before him there was no part of mcneafs exposed skin which was not itching with tiny words though it was four years and more since the ghosts had come for him the flesh still looked tender as though the wounds would never entirely heal have you seen enough the boy asked theres more hes covered from head to foot sometimes he wonders if they didnt write on the inside as well he sighed do you want a drink wyburd nodded maybe a throatful of spirits would stop his hands from trembling mcneal poured himself a glass of vodka took a slug from it then poured a second glass for his guest as he did so wyburd saw that the boys nape was as densely inscribed as his face and hands the writing creeping up into his hair not even his scalp had escaped the authors attentions it seemed why do you talk about yourself in the third person he asked mcneal as the boy returned with the glass like you werent here the boy mcneal said he isnt here he hasnt been here in a long time he sat down drank wyburd began to feel more than a little uneasy was the boy simply mad or playing some damnfool game the boy swallowed another mouthful of vodka then asked matter of factly whats it worth to you wyburd frowned whats what worth his skin the boy prompted thats what you came for isnt it wyburd emptied his glass with two swallows making no reply mcneal shrugged everyone has the right to silence he said except for the boy of course no silence for him he looked down at his hand turning it over to appraise the writing on his palm the stories go on night and day never stop they tell themselves you see they bleed and bleed you can never hush them never heal them he is mad wyburd thought and somehow the reali sation made what he was about to do easier better to kill a sick animal than a healthy one theres a road you know the boy was saying he wasnt even looking at his executioner a road the dead go down he saw it dark strange road full of people not a day gone by when he hasnt hasnt wanted to go back there back said wyburd happy to keep the boy talking his hand went to his jacket pocket to the knife it comforted him in the presence of this lunacy nothings enough mcneal said not love not music nothing clasping the knife wyburd drew it from his pocket the boys eyes found the blade and warmed to the sight you never told him how much it was worth he said two hundred thousand wyburd replied anyone he knows the assassin shook his head an exile he replied in rio a collector of skins of skins the boy put down his glass he murmured something wyburd didnt catch then very quietly he said be quick and do it he juddered a little as the knife found his heart but wyburd was efficient the moment had come and gone before the boy even knew it was happening much less felt it then it was all over for him at least for wyburd the real labour was only just beginning it took him two hours to complete the flaying when he was finished the skin folded in fresh linen and locked in the suitcase hed brought for that very purpose he was weary tomorrow he would fly to rio he thought as he left the house and claim the rest of his payment then florida he spent the evening in the small apartment hed rented for the tedious weeks of surveillance and planning which had preceded this afternoons work he was glad to be leaving he had been lonely here and anxious with anticipation now the job was done and he could put the time behind him he slept well lulled to sleep by the imagined scent of orange groves it was not fruit he smelt when he woke however but something savoury the room was in darkness he reached to his right and fumbled for the lampswitch but it failed to come on now he heard a heavy slopping sound from across the room he sat up in bed narrowing his eyes against the dark but could see nothing swinging his legs over the edge of the bed he went to stand up his first thought was that hed left the bathroom taps on and had flooded the apartment he was kneedeep in warm water confounded he waded towards the door and reached for the main lightswitch flipping it on it was not water he was standing in too cloying too precious too red he made a cry of disgust and turned to haul open the door but it was locked and there was no key he beat a panicked fusillade upon the solid wood and yelled for help his appeals went unanswered now he turned back into the room the hot tide eddying about his thighs and sought out the fountain head the suitcase it sat where he had left it on the bureau and bled copiously from every seam and from the locks and from around the hinges as if a hundred atrocities were being committed within its confines and it could not contain the flood these acts had unleashed he watched the blood pouring out in steaming abun dance in the scant seconds since hed stepped from the bed the pool had deepened by several inches and still the deluge came he tried the bathroom door but that too was locked and keyless he tried the windows but the shutters were immovable the blood had reached his waist much of the furniture was floating knowing he was lost unless he attempted some direct action he pressed through the flood towards the case and put his hands upon the lid in the hope that he might yet stem the flow it was a lost cause at his touch the blood seemed to come with fresh eagerness threatening to burst the seams the stories go on the boy had said they bleed and bleed and now he seemed to hear them in his head those stories dozens of voices each telling some tragic tale the flood bore him up towards the ceiling he paddled to keep his chin above the frothy tide but in minutes there was barely an inch of air left at the top of the room as even that margin narrowed he added his own voice to thecacophony begging for the nightmare to stop but the other voices drowned him out with their stories and as he kissed the ceiling his breath ran out the dead have highways they run unerring lines of ghosttrains of dreamcarriages across the wasteland behind our lives bearing an endless traffic of departed souls they have signposts these highways and bridges and laybys they have turnpikes and intersections it was at one of thesejntersections that leon wyburd caught sight of the man in the red suit the throng pressed him forward and it was only when he came closer that he realised his error the man was not wearing a suit he was not even wearing his skin it was not the mcneal boy however he had gone on from this point long since it was another flayed man entirely leon fell in beside the man as he walked as they talked together the flayed man told him how he had come to this condition of his brotherinlaws conspiracies and the ingratitude of his daughter leon in turn told of his last moments it was a great relief to tell the story not because he wanted to be remembered but because the telling relieved him of the tale it no longer belonged to him that life that death he had better business as did they all roads to travel splendours to drink down he felt the landscape widen felt the air brightening what the boy had said was true the dead have highways only the living are lost
