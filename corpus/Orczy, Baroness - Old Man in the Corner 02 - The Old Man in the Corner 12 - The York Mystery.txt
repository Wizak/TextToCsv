 the york mystery baroness orczy chapter vii the york mystery chapter viii the capital charge chapter ix a brokenhearted woman chapter vii the york mystery the man in the corner looked quite cheerful that morning he had had two glasses of milk and had even gone to the extravagance of an extra cheesecake polly knew that he was itching to talk police and murders for he east furtive glances at her from time to time produced a bit of string tied and untied it into scores of complicated knots and finally bringing out his pocketbook he placed two or three photographs before her do you know who that is he asked pointing to one of these the girl looked at the face on the picture it was that of a woman not exactly pretty but very gentle and childlike with a strange pathetic look in the large eyes which was wonderfully appealing that was lady arthur skelmerton he said and in a flash there flitted before pollys mind the weird and tragic history which had broken this loving womans heart lady arthur skelmerton that name recalled one of the most bewildering most mysterious passages in the annals of undiscovered crimes yes it was sad wasnt it he commented in answer to pollys thoughts another case which but for idiotic blunders on the part of the police must have stood clear as daylight before the public and satisfied general anxiety would you object to my recapitulating its preliminary details she said nothing so he continued without waiting further for a reply it all occurred during the york racing week a time which brings to the quiet cathedral city its quota of shady characters who congregate wherever money and wits happen to fly away from their owners lord arthur skelmerton a very wellknown figure in london society and in racing circles had rented one of the fine houses which overlook the racecourse he had entered peppercorn by st armandnotre dame for the great ebor handicap peppercorn was the winner of the newmarket and his chances for the ebor were considered a practical certainty if you have ever been to york you will have noticed the fine houses which have their drive and front entrances in the road called the mount and the gardens of which extend as far as the racecourse commanding a lovely view over the entire track it was one of these houses called the elms which lord arthur skelmerton had rented for the summer lady arthur came down some little time before the racing week with her servantsshe had no children but she had many relatives and friends in york since she was the daughter of old sir john etty the cocoa manufacturer a rigid quaker who it was generally said kept the tightest possible hold on his own pursestrings and looked with marked disfavour upon his aristocratic soninlaws fondness for gaming tables and betting books as a matter of fact maud etty had married the handsome young lieutenant in the th hussars quite against her fathers wishes but she was an only child and after a good deal of demur and grumbling sir john who idolized his daughter gave way to her whim and a reluctant consent to the marriage was wrung from him but as a yorkshireman he was far too shrewd a man of the world not to know that love played but a very small part in persuading a dukes son to marry the daughter of a cocoa manufacturer and as long as he lived he determined that since his daughter was being wed because of her wealth that wealth should at least secure her own happiness he refused to give lady arthur any capital which in spite of the most carefully worded settlements would inevitably sooner or later have found its way into the pockets of lord arthurs racing friends but he made his daughter a very handsome allowance amounting to over ј a year which enabled her to keep up an establishment befitting her new rank a great many of these facts intimate enough as they are leaked out you see during that period of intense excitement which followed the murder of charles lavender and when the public eye was fixed searchingly upon lord arthur skelmerton probing all the inner details of his idle useless life it soon became a matter of common gossip that poor little lady arthur continued to worship her handsome husband in spite of his obvious neglect and not having as yet presented him with an heir she settled herself down into a life of humble apology for her plebeian existence atoning for it by condoning all his faults and forgiving all his vices even to the extent of cloaking them before the prying eyes of sir john who was persuaded to look upon his soninlaw as a paragon of all the domestic virtues and a perfect model of a husband among lord arthur skelmertons many expensive tastes there was certainly that for horseflesh and cards after some successful betting at the beginning of his married life he had started a racingstable which it was generally believedas he was very luckywas a regular source of income to him peppercorn however after his brilliant performances at newmarket did not continue to fulfil his masters expectations his collapse at york was attributed to the hardness of the course and to various other causes but its immediate effect was to put lord arthur skelmerton in what is popularly called a tight place for he had backed his horse for all he was worth and must have stood to lose considerably over ј on that one day the collapse of the favourite and the grand victory of king cole a rank outsider on the other hand had proved a golden harvest for the bookmakers and all the york hotels were busy with dinners and suppers given by the confraternity of the turf to celebrate the happy occasion the next day was friday one of few important racing events after which the brilliant and the shady throng which had flocked into the venerable city for the week would fly to more congenial climes and leave it with its fine old minster and its ancient walls as sleepy as quiet as before lord arthur skelmerton also intended to leave york on the saturday and on the friday night he gave a farewell bachelor dinner party at the elms at which lady arthur did not appear after dinner the gentlemen settled down to bridge with pretty stiff points you may be sure it had just struck eleven at the minster tower when constables mcnaught and murphy who were patrolling the racecourse were startled by loud cries of murder and police quickly ascertaining whence these cries proceeded they hurried on at a gallop and came upquite close to the boundary of lord arthur skelmertons groundsupon a group of three men two of whom seemed to be wrestling vigorously with one another whilst the third was lying face downwards on the ground as soon as the constables drew near one of the wrestlers shouted more vigorously and with a certain tone of authority here you fellows hurry up sharp the brute is giving me the slip but the brute did not seem inclined to do anything of the sort he certainly extricated himself with a violent jerk from his assailants grasp but made no attempt to run away the constables had quickly dismounted whilst he who had shouted for help originally added more quietly my name is skelmerton this is the boundary of my property i was smoking a cigar at the pavilion over there with a friend when i heard loud voices followed by a cry and a groan i hurried down the steps and saw this poor fellow lying on the ground with a knife sticking between his shoulderblades and his murderer he added pointing to the man who stood quietly by with constable mcnaughts firm grip upon his shoulder still stooping over the body of his victim i was too late i fear to save the latter but just in time to grapple with the assassin its a lie here interrupted the man hoarsely i didnt do it constable i swear i didnt do it i saw him falli was coming along a couple of hundred yards away and i tried to see if the poor fellow was dead i swear i didnt do it youll have to explain that to the inspector presently my man was constable mcnaughts quiet comment and still vigorously protesting his innocence the accused allowed himself to be led away and the body was conveyed to the station pending fuller identification the next morning the papers were full of the tragedy a column and a half of the york herald was devoted to an account of lord arthur skelmertons plucky capture of the assassin the latter had continued to declare his innocence but had remarked it appears with grim humour that he quite saw he was in a tight place out of which however he would find it easy to extricate himself he had stated to the police that the deceaseds name was charles lavender a wellknown bookmaker which fact was soon verified for many of the murdered mans pals were still in the city so far the most pushing of newspaper reporters had been unable to glean further information from the police no one doubted however but that the man in charge who gave his name as george higgins had killed the bookmaker for purposes of robbery the inquest had been fixed for the tuesday after the murder lord arthur had been obliged to stay in york a few days as his evidence would be needed that fact gave the case perhaps a certain amount of interest as far as york and london society were concerned charles lavender moreover was well known on the turf but no bombshell exploding beneath the walls of the ancient cathedral city could more have astonished its inhabitants than the news which at about five in the afternoon on the day of the inquest spread like wildfire throughout the town that news was that the inquest had concluded at three oclock with a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown and that two hours later the police had arrested lord arthur skelmerton at his private residence the elms and charged him on a warrant with the murder of charles lavender the bookmaker chapter viii the capital charge the police it appears instinctively feeling that some mystery lurked round the death of the bookmaker and his supposed murderers quiet protestations of innocence had taken a very considerable amount of trouble in collecting all the evidence they could for the inquest which might throw some light upon charles lavenders life previous to his tragic end thus it was that a very large array of witnesses was brought before the coroner chief among whom was of course lord arthur skelmerton the first witnesses called were the two constables who deposed that just as the church clocks in the neighbourhood were striking eleven they had heard the cries for help had ridden to the spot whence the sounds proceeded and had found the prisoner in the tight grasp of lord arthur skelmerton who at once accused the man of murder and gave him in charge both constables gave the same version of the incident and both were positive as to the time when it occurred medical evidence went to prove that the deceased had been stabbed from behind between the shoulderblades whilst he was walking that the wound was inflicted by a large hunting knife which was produced and which had been left sticking in the wound lord arthur skelmerton was then called and substantially repeated what he had already told the constables he stated namely that on the night in question he had some gentlemen friends to dinner and afterwards bridge was played he himself was not playing much and at a few minutes before eleven he strolled out with a cigar as far as the pavilion at the end of his garden he then heard the voices the cry and the groan previously described by him and managed to hold the murderer down until the arrival of the constables at this point the police proposed to call a witness james terry by name and a bookmaker by profession who had been chiefly instrumental in identifying the deceased a pal of his it was his evidence which first introduced that element of sensation into the case which culminated in the wildly exciting arrest of a dukes son upon a capital charge it appears that on the evening after the ebor terry and lavender were in the bar of the black swan hotel having drinks i had done pretty well over peppercorns fiasco he explained but poor old lavender was very much down in the dumps he had held only a few very small bets against the favourite and the rest of the day had been a poor one with him i asked him if he had any bets with the owner of peppercorn and he told me that he only held one for less than ј i laughed and said that if he held one for ј it would make no difference as from what i had heard from the other fellows lord arthur skelmerton must be about stumped lavender seemed terribly put out at this and swore he would get that ј out of lord arthur if no one else got another penny from him its the only money ive made today he says to me i mean to get it you wont i says i will he says you will have to look pretty sharp about it then i says for every one will be wanting to get something and first come first served oh hell serve me right enough never you mind says lavender to me with a laugh if he dont pay up willingly ive got that in my pocket which will make him sit up and open my ladys eyes and sir john ettys too about their precious noble lord then he seemed to think he had gone too far and wouldnt say anything more to me about that affair i saw him on the course the next day i asked him if he had got his ј he said no but i shall get it today lord arthur skelmerton after having given his own evidence had left the court it was therefore impossible to know how he would take this account which threw so serious a light upon an association with the dead man of which he himself had said nothing nothing could shake james terrys account of the facts he had placed before the jury and when the police informed the coroner that they proposed to place george higgins himself in the witnessbox as his evidence would prove as it were a complement and corollary of that of terry the jury very eagerly assented if james terry the bookmaker loud florid vulgarwas an unprepossessing individual certainly george higgins who was still under the accusation of murder was ten thousand times more so none too clean slouchy obsequious yet insolent he was the very personification of the cad who haunts the racecourse and who lives not so much by his own wits as by the lack of them in others he described himself as a turf commission agent whatever that may be he stated that at about six oclock on the friday afternoon when the racecourse was still full of people all hurrying after the days excitements he himself happened to be standing close the hedge which marks the boundary of lord arthur skelmertons grounds there is a pavilion there at the end of the garden he explained on slightly elevated ground and he could hear and see a group of ladies and gentlemen having tea some steps lead down a little to the left of the garden on to the course and presently he noticed at the bottom of these steps lord arthur skelmerton and charles lavender standing talking together he knew both gentlemen by sight but he could not see them very well as they were both partly hidden by the hedge he was quite sure that the gentlemen had not seen him and he could not help overhearing some of their conversation thats my last word lavender lord arthur was saying very quietly i havent got the money and i cant pay you now youll have to wait wait i cant wait said old lavender in reply ive got my engagements to meet same as you im not going to risk being posted up as a defaulter while you hold ј of my money youd better give it me now or but lord arthur interrupted him very quietly and said yes my good man or or ill let sir john have a good look at that little bill i had of yours a couple of years ago if youll remember my lord it has got at the bottom of it sir johns signature in your handwriting perhaps sir john or perhaps my lady would pay me something for that little bill if not the police can have a squint at it ive held my tongue long enough and look here lavender said lord arthur do you know what this little game of yours is called in law yes and i dont care says lavender if i dont have that ј i am a ruined man if you ruin me ill do for you and we shall be quits thats my last word he was talking very loudly and i thought some of lord arlhurs friends up in the pavilion must have heard he thought so too i think for he said quickly if you dont hold your confounded tongue ill give you in charge for blackmail this instant you wouldnt dare says lavender and he began to laugh but just then a lady from the top of the steps said your tea is getting cold and lord arthur turned to go but just before he went lavender says to him ill come back tonight youll have the money then george higgins it appears after he had heard this interesting conversation pondered as to whether he could not turn what he knew into some sort of profit being a gentleman who lives entirely by his wits this type of knowledge forms his chief source of income as a preliminary to future moves he decided not to lose sight of lavender for the rest of the day he went and had dinner at the black swan he explained and i after i had had a bite myself waited outside till i saw him come out at about ten oclock i was rewarded for my trouble he told the hall porter to get him a fly and he jumped into it i could not hear what direction he gave the driver but the fly certainly drove off towards the racecourse now i was interested in this little affair continued the witness and i couldnt afford a fly i started to run of course i couldnt keep up with it but i thought i knew which way my gentleman had gone i made straight for the racecourse and for the hedge at the bottom of lord arthur skelmertons grounds it was rather a dark night and there was a slight drizzle i couldnt see more than about a hundred yards before me all at once it seemed to me as if i heard lavenders voice talking loudly in the distance i hurried forward and suddenly saw a group of two figuresmere blurs in the darknessfor one instant at a distance of about fifty yards from where i was the next moment one figure had fallen forward and the other had disappeared i ran to the spot only to find the body of the murdered man lying on the ground i stooped to see if i could be of any use to him and immediately i was collared from behind by lord arthur himself you may imagine said the man in the corner how keen was the excitement of that moment in court coroner and jury alike literally hung breathless on every word that shabby vulgar individual uttered you see by itself his evidence would have been worth very little but coming on the top of that given by james terry its significancemore its truthhad become glaringly apparent closely crossexamined he adhered strictly to his statement and having finished his evidence george higgins remained in charge of the constables and the next witness of importance was called up this was mr chipps the senior footman in the employment of lord arthur skelmerton he deposed that at about on the friday evening a party drove up to the elms in a fly and asked to see lord arthur on being told that his lordship had company he seemed terribly put out i hasked the party to give me is card continued mr chipps as i didnt know perhaps that is lordship might wish to see im but i kept im standing at the all door as i didnt altogether like his looks i took the card in his lordship and the gentlemen was playin cards in the smokingroom and as soon as i could do so without disturbing is lordship i give him the partys card what name was there on the card here interrupted the coroner i couldnt say now sir replied mr chipps i dont really remember it was a name i had never seen before but i see so many visiting cards one way and the other in is lordships all that i cant remember all the names then after a few minutes waiting you gave his lordship the card what happened then is lordship didnt seem at all pleased said mr chipps with much guarded dignity but finally he said show him into the library chipps ill see him and he got up from the card table saying to the gentlemen go on without me ill be back in a minute or two i was about to open the door for is lordship when my lady came into the room and then his lordship suddenly changed his mind like and said to me tell that man im busy and cant see him and e sat down again at the card table i went back to the all and told the party is lordship wouldnt see im e said oh it doesnt matter and went away quite quiet like do you recollect at all at what time that was asked one of the jury yes sir while i was waiting to speak to is lordship i looked at the clock sir it was twenty past ten sir there was one more significant fact in connection with the case which tended still more to excite the curiosity of the public at the time and still further to bewilder the police later on and that fact was mentioned by chipps in his evidence the knife namely with which charles lavender had been stabbed and which remember had been left in the wound was now produced in court after a little hesitation chipps identified it as the property of his master lord arthur skelmerton can you wonder then that the jury absolutely refused to bring in a verdict against george higgins there was really beyond lord arthur skelmertons testimony not one particle of evidence against him whilst as the day wore on and witness after witness was called up suspicion ripened in the minds of all those present that the murderer could be no other than lord arthur skelmerton himself the knife was of course the strongest piece of circumstantial evidence and no doubt the police hoped to collect a great deal more now that they held a clue in their hands directly after the verdict therefore which was guardedly directed against some person unknown the police obtained a warrant and later on arrested lord arthur in his own house the sensation of course was tremendous hours before he was brought up before the magistrate the approach to the court was thronged his friends mostly ladies were all eager you see to watch the dashing society man in so terrible a position there was universal sympathy for lady arthur who was in a very precarious state of health her worship of her worthless husband was well known small wonder that his final and awful misdeed had practically broken her heart the latest bulletin issued just after his arrest stated that her ladyship was not expected to live she was then in a comatose condition and all hope had perforce to be abandoned at last the prisoner was brought in he looked very pale perhaps but otherwise kept up the bearing of a highbred gentleman he was accompanied by his solicitor sir marmaduke ingersoll who was evidently talking to him in quiet reassuring tones mr buchanan prosecuted for the treasury and certainly his indictment was terrific according to him but one decision could be arrived at namely that the accused in the dock had in a moment of passion and perhaps of fear killed the blackmailer who threatened him with disclosures which might for ever have ruined him socially and having committed the deed and fearing its consequences probably realizing that the patrolling constables might catch sight of his retreating figure he had availed himself of george higginss presence on the spot to loudly accuse him of the murder having concluded his able speech mr buchanan called his witnesses and the evidence which on second hearing seemed more damning than ever was all gone through again sir marmaduke had no question to ask of the witnesses for the prosecution he stared at them placidly through his goldrimmed spectacles then he was ready to call his own for the defence colonel mcintosh ra was the first he was present at the bachelors party given by lord arthur the night of the murder his evidence tended at first to corroborate that of chipps the footman with regard to lord arthurs orders to show the visitor into the library and his counterorder as soon as his wife came into the room did you not think it strange colonel asked mr buchanan that lord arthur should so suddenly have changed his mind about seeing his visitor well not exactly strange said the colonel a fine manly soldierly figure who looked curiously out of his element in the witnessbox i dont think that it is a very rare occurrence for racing men to have certain acquaintances whom they would not wish their wives to know anything about then it did not strike you that lord arthur skelmerton had some reason for not wishing his wife to know of that particular visitors presence in his house i dont think that i gave the matter the slightest serious consideration was the colonels guarded reply mr buchanan did not press the point and allowed the witness to conclude his statements i had finished my turn at bridge he said and went out into the garden to smoke a cigar lord arthur skelmerton joined me a few minutes later and we were sitting in the pavilion when i heard a loud and as i thought threatening voice from the other side of the hedge i did not catch the words but lord arthur said to me there seems to be a row down there ill go and have a look and see what it is i tried to dissuade him and certainly made no attempt to follow him but not more than half a minute could have elapsed before i heard a cry and a groan then lord arthurs footsteps hurrying down the wooden stairs which lead on to the racecourse you may imagine said the man in the corner what severe crossexamination the gallant colonel had to undergo in order that his assertions might in some way be shaken by the prosecution but with military precision and frigid calm he repeated his important statements amidst a general silence through which you could have heard the proverbial pin he had heard the threatening voice while sitting with lord arthur skelmerton then came the cry and groan and after that lord arthurs steps down the stairs he himself thought of following to see what had happened but it was a very dark night and he did not know the grounds very well while trying to find his way to the garden steps he heard lord arthurs cry for help the tramp of the patrolling constables horses and subsequently the whole scene between lord arthur the man higgins and the constables when he finally found his way to the stairs lord arthur was returning in order to send a groom for police assistance the witness stuck to his points as he had to his guns at beckfontein a year ago nothing could shake him and sir marmaduke looked triumphantly across at his opposing colleague with the gallant colonels statements the edifice of the prosecution certainly began to collapse you see there was not a particle of evidence to show that the accused had met and spoken to the deceased after the latters visit at the front door of the elms he told chipps that he wouldnt see the visitor and chipps went into the hall directly and showed lavender out the way he came no assignation could have been made no hint could have been given by the murdered man to lord arthur that he would go round to the back entrance and wished to see him there two other guests of lord arthurs swore positively that after chipps had announced the visitor their host stayed at the cardtable until a quarter to eleven when evidently he went out to join colonel mcintosh in the garden sir marmadukes speech was clever in the extreme bit by bit he demolished that tower of strength the case against the accused basing his defence entirely upon the evidence of lord arthur skelmertons guests that night until lord arthur was playing cards a quarter of an hour later the police were on the scene and the murder had been committed in the meanwhile colonel mcintoshs evidence proved conclusively that the accused had been sitting with him smoking a cigar it was obvious therefore clear as daylight concluded the great lawyer that his client was entitled to a full discharge nay more he thought that the police should have been more careful before they harrowed up public feeling by arresting a highborn gentleman on such insufficient evidence as they had brought forward the question of the knife remained certainly but sir marmaduke passed over it with guarded eloquence placing that strange question in the category of those inexplicable coincidences which tend to puzzle the ablest detective and cause them to commit such unpardonable blunders as the present one had been after all the footman may have been mistaken the pattern of that knife was not an exclusive one and he on behalf of his client flatly denied that it had ever belonged to him well continued the man in the corner with the chuckle peculiar to him in moments of excitement the noble prisoner was discharged perhaps it would be invidious to say that he left the court without a stain on his character for i daresay you know from experience that the crime known as the york mystery has never been satisfactorily cleared up many people shook their heads dubiously when they remembered that after all charles lavender was killed with a knife which one witness had sworn belonged to lord arthur others again reverted to the original theory that george higgins was the murderer that he and james terry had concocted the story of lavenders attempt at blackmail on lord arthur and that the murder had been committed for the sole purpose of robbery be that as it may the police have not so far been able to collect sufficient evidence against higgins or terry and the crime has been classed by press and public alike in the category of socalled impenetrable mysteries chapter ix a brokenhearted woman the man in the corner called for another glass of milk and drank it down slowly before he resumed now lord arthur lives mostly abroad he said his poor suffering wife died the day after he was liberated by the magistrate she never recovered consciousness even sufficiently to hear the joyful news that the man she loved so well was innocent after all mystery he added as if in answer to pollys own thoughts the murder of that man was never a mystery to me i cannot understand how the police could have been so blind when every one of the witnesses both for the prosecution and defence practically pointed all the time to the one guilty person what do you think of it all yourself i think the whole case so bewildering she replied that i do not see one single clear point in it you dont he said excitedly while the bony fingers fidgeted again with that inevitable bit of string you dont see that there is one point clear which to me was the key of the whole thing lavender was murdered wasnt he lord arthur did not kill him he had at least in colonel mcintosh an unimpeachable witness to prove that he could not have committed that murderand yet he added with slow excited emphasis marking each sentence with a knot and yet he deliberately tries to throw the guilt upon a man who obviously was also innocent now why he may have thought him guilty or wished to shield or cover the retreat of one he knew to be guilty i dont understand think of someone he said excitedly someone whose desire would be as great as that of lord arthur to silence a scandal round that gentlemans name someone who unknown perhaps to lord arthur had overheard the same conversation which george higgins related to the police and the magistrate someone who whilst chipps was taking lavenders card in to his master had a few minutes time wherein to make an assignation with lavender promising him money no doubt in exchange for the compromising bills surely you dont mean gasped polly point number one he interrupted quietly utterly missed by the police george higgins in his deposition stated that at the most animated stage of lavenders conversation with lord arthur and when the bookmakers tone of voice became loud and threatening a voice from the top of the steps interrupted that conversation saying your tea is getting cold yesbut she argued wait a moment for there is point number two that voice was a ladys voice now i did exactly what the police should have done but did not do i went to have a look from the racecourse side at those garden steps which to my mind are such important factors in the discovery of this crime i found only about a dozen rather low steps anyone standing on the top must have heard every word charles lavender uttered the moment he raised his voice even then very well you grant that he said excitedly then there was the great the allimportant point which oddly enough the prosecution never for a moment took into consideration when chipps the footman first told lavender that lord arthur could not see him the bookmaker was terribly put out chipps then goes to speak to his master a few minutes elapse and when the footman once again tells lavender that his lordship wont see him the latter says very well and seems to treat the matter with complete indifference obviously therefore something must have happened in between to alter the bookmakers frame of mind well what had happened think over all the evidence and you will see that one thing only had occurred in the interval namely lady arthurs advent into the room in order to go into the smokingroom she must have crossed the hall she must have seen lavender in that brief interval she must have realized that the man was persistent and therefore a living danger to her husband remember women have done strange things they are a far greater puzzle to the student of human nature than the sterner less complex sex has ever been as i argued beforeas the police should have argued all alongwhy did lord arthur deliberately accuse an innocent man of murder if not to shield the guilty one remember lady arthur may have been discovered the man george higgins may have caught sight of her before she had time to make good her retreat his attention as well as that of the constables had to be diverted lord arthur acted on the blind impulse of saving his wife at any cost she may have been met by colonel mcintosh argued polly perhaps she was he said who knows the gallant colonel had to swear to his friends innocence he could do that in all conscienceafter that his duty was accomplished no innocent man was suffering for the guilty the knife which had belonged to lord arthur would always save george higgins for a time it had pointed to the husband fortunately never to the wife poor thing she died probably of a broken heart but women when they love think only of one object on earththe one who is beloved to me the whole thing was clear from the very first when i read the account of the murderthe knife stabbingbah dont i know enough of english crime not to be certain at once that no englishman be he ruffian from the gutter or be he dukes son ever stabs his victim in the back italians french spaniards do it if you will and women of most nations an englishmans instinct is to strike and not to stab george higgins or lord arthur skelmerton would have knocked their victim down the woman only would lie in wait till the enemys back was turned she knows her weakness and she does not mean to miss think it over there is not one flaw in my argument but the police never thought the matter outperhaps in this case it was as well he had gone and left miss polly burton still staring at the photograph of a pretty gentlelooking woman with a decided wilful curve round the mouth and a strange unaccountable look in the large pathetic eyes and the little journalist felt quite thankful that in this case the murder of charles lavender the bookmakercowardly wicked as it washad remained a mystery to the police and the public
