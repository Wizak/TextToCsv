night smoke prologue fire it cleansed it destroyed with its heat lives could be saved or lives could be taken it was one of the greatest discoveries of man and one of his chief fears and one of his fascinations mothers warned their children not to play with matches not to touch the red glow of the stove for no matter how pretty the flame how seductive the warmth fire against flesh burned in the hearth it was romantic cozy cheerful dancing and crackling wafting scented smoke and flickering soft golden light old men dreamed by it lovers wooed by it in the campfire it shot its sparks toward a starry sky tempting wideeyed children to roast their marshmallows into black goo while shivering over ghost stories there were dark hopeless corners of the city where the homeless cupped their frozen hands over trashcan fires their faces drawn and weary in the shadowy light their minds too numb for dreams in the city of urbana there were many fires a carelessly dropped cigarette smoldering in a mattress faulty wiring overlooked or ignored by a corrupt inspector a kerosene heater set too close to the drapes oily rags tossed in a stuffy closet a flash of lightning an unattended candle all could cause destruction of property loss of life ignorance an accident an act of god but there were other ways more devious ways once inside the building he took several short shallow breaths it was so simple really and so exciting the power was in his hands now he knew exactly what to do and there was a thrill in doing it alone in the dark it wouldnt be dark for long the thought made him giggle as he climbed to the second floor he would soon make the light two cans of gasoline would be enough with the first he splashed the old wooden floor soaking it leaving a trail as he moved from wall to wall from room to room now and again he stopped pulling stock from the racks scattering matchbooks over the stream of flammables adding fuel that would feed the flames and spread them the smell of the accelerant was sweet an exotic perfume that heightened his senses he wasnt panicked he wasnt hurried as he climbed the winding metal stairs to the next floor he was quiet of course for he wasnt a stupid man but he knew the night watchman was bent over his magazines in another part of the building as he worked he glanced up at the spiderlike sprinklers in the ceiling hed already seen to those there would be no hiss of water from the pipes as the flames rose no warning buzz from smoke alarms this fire would burn and burn and burn until the window glass exploded from the angry fists of heat paint would blister metal would melt rafters would fall charred and flaming he wished for a moment he wished he could stay stand in the center of it all and watch the sleeping fire awaken grumbling he wanted to be there to admire and absorb as it stirred snapped then stretched its hot bright body he wanted to hear its triumphant roar as it hungrily devoured everything in its path but he would be far away by then too far to see to hear to smell he would have to imagine it with a sigh he lit the first match held the flame at eye level admiring the infant spark mesmerized by it he was smiling as proud as any expectant father as he tossed the tiny fire into a dark pool of gas he watched for a moment only a moment as the animal erupted into life streaking along the trail hed left for it he left quietly hurrying now into the frigid night soon his feet had picked up the rhythm of his racing heart chapter contents prev next annoyed exhausted natalie stepped into her penthouse apartment the dinner meeting with her marketing executives had run beyond midnight she could have come home then she reminded herself as she stepped out of her shoes but no her office was en route from the restaurant to her apartment she simply hadnt been able to resist stopping in for one more look at the new designs one last check on the ads heralding the grand opening both had needed work and really shed only intended to make a few notes draft one or two memos so why was she stumbling toward the bedroom at am she asked herself the answer was easy she was compulsive obsessive she was natalie thought an idiot particularly since she had an eightoclock breakfast meeting with several of her east coast sales reps no problem she assured herself no problem at all who needed sleep certainly not natalie fletcher the thirtytwoyearold dynamo who was currently expanding fletcher industries into one more avenue of profit and there would be profit shed put all her skill and experience and creativity into building ladys choice from the ground up before profit there would be the excitement of conception birth growth those first pangs and pleasures of an infant company its own way her infant company she thought with tired satisfaction her baby she would tend and teach and nurtureand yes when necessary walk the floor at am a glance in the mirror over the bureau told her that even a dynamo needed rest her cheeks had lost both their natural color as well as their cosmetic blush and her face looked entirely too fragile and pale the simple twist that scooped her hair back and had started the evening looking sophisticated and chic now only seemed to emphasize the shadows that smudged her dark green eyes because she was a woman who prided herself on her energy and stamina she turned away from the reflection blowing her honeytoned bangs out of her eyes and rotating her shoulders to ease the stiffness in any case sharks didnt sleep she reminded herself even business sharks but this one was very tempted to fall on the bed fully dressed that wouldnt do she thought and shrugged out of her coat organization and control were every bit as important in business as a good head for figures ingrained habit had her walking to the closet and she was draping the velvet wrap on a padded hanger when the phone rang let the machine get it she ordered herself but by the second ring she was snatching up the receiver hello ms fletcher yes the receiver clanged against the emeralds at her ear she was reaching up to remove the earring when the panic in the voice stopped her its jim banks ms fletcher the night watchman over at the south side warehouse weve got trouble here trouble did someone break in its fire holy god ms fletcher the whole place is going up fire she brought her other hand to the receiver as if it might leap from her ear at the warehouse was anyone in the building is anyone in there no maam there was just me his voice shook cracked i was downstairs in the coffee room when i heard an explosion mustve been a bomb or something i dont know i called the fire department she could hear other sounds now sirens shouts are you hurt no i got out i got out mother of god ms fletcher its terrible its just terrible im on my way it took natalie fifteen minutes to make the trip from her plush westside neighborhood to the dingy south side with its warehouses and factories but she saw the fire heard it before she pulled up behind the string of engines men with their faces smeared with soot manned hoses wielded axes smoke and flame belched from shattered windows and spewed through gaps in the ruined roof the heat was enormous even at this distance it shot out slapping her face while the icy february wind swirled at her back everything she knew everything inside the building was lost ms fletcher struggling against horror and fascination she turned and looked at a round middleaged man in a gray uniform im jim banks oh yes she reached out automatically to take his hand it was freezing and as shaky as his voice youre all right are you sure yes maam its an awful thing they watched the fire and those who fought it for a moment in silence the smoke alarms i didnt hear anything not until the explosion i started to head upstairs and i saw the fire it was everywhere he rubbed a hand over his mouth never in his life had he seen anything like it never in his life did he want to see its like again just everywhere i got out and called the fire department from my truck you did the right thing do you know whos in charge here no ms fletcher i dont these guys work fast and they dont spend a lot of time talking all right why dont you go home now jim ill deal with this if they need to talk to you i have your beeper number and they can call nothing much to do he looked down at the ground and shook his head im mighty sorry ms fletcher so am i i appreciate you calling me thought i should he gave one last glance at the building seemed to shudder then trudged off to his truck natalie stood where she was and waited a crowd had gathered by the time ry got to the scene a fire drew crowds he knew like a good fistfight or a flashy juggler people even took sidesand a great many of them rooted for the fire he stepped out of his car a lean broadshouldered man with tired eyes the color of the smoke stinging the winter sky his narrow bony face was set impassive the lights flashing around him shadowed then highlighted the hollows and planes the shallow cleft in his chin that women loved and he found a small nuisance he set his boots on the sodden ground and stepped into them with a grace and economy of motion that came from years of training though flames still licked and sparked his experienced eye told him that the men had contained and nearly suppressed it soon it would be time for him to go to work automatically he put on the black protective jacket covering his flannel shirt and his jeans down past the hips he combed one hand through his unruly hair hair that was a deep dark brown and showed hints of fire in sunlight he set his dented smokestained hat on his head lit a cigarette then tugged on protective gloves and while he performed these habitual acts he scanned the scene a man in his position needed to keep an open mind about fire he would take an overview of the scene the weather note the wind direction talk to the fire fighters there would be all manner of routine and scientific tests to run but first he would trust his eyes and his nose the warehouse was most probably a loss but it was no longer his job to save it his job was to find the whys and the hows he exhaled smoke and studied the crowd he knew the night watchman had called in the alarm the man would have to be interviewed ry looked over the faces one by one excitement was normal he saw it in the eyes of the young man who watched the destruction dazzled and shock in the slackjawed woman who huddled against him horror admiration relief that the fire hadnt touched them or theirs he saw that as well then his gaze fell on the blonde she stood apart from the rest staring straight ahead while the light wind teased her honey blond hair out of its fancy twist expensive shoes ry noted of supple midnight leather as out of place in this part of town as her velvet coat and her fancy face a hell of a face he thought idly lifting the cigarette to his lips again a pale oval that belonged on a cameo eyes he couldnt make out their color but they were dark no excitement there he mused no horror no shock anger maybe just a touch of it she was either a woman of little emotion or one who knew how to control it a hothouse rose he decided and just what was she doing so far out of her milieu at nearly four oclock in the morning hey inspector grimy and wet lieutenant holden trudged over to bum a cigarette chalk up another one for the fighting twentysecond ry knew holden and was already holding the pack out looks like you killed another one this was a bitch cupping his hands against the wind holden lit up fully involved by the time we got here call came in from the night watchman at second and third floors took most of it but the equipment on ones pretty well gone too youll probably find your point of origin on the second yeah though the fire was winding down ry knew holden wasnt just shooting the breeze found some streamers going up the steps at the east end probably started the fire with them but not all the material went up ladies lingerie hmmm ladies lingerie holden said with a grin thats what they were warehousing lots of nighties and undies youve got a nice stream of underwear and matchbooks that didnt go up he slapped ry on the shoulder have fun hey probie he shouted to one of the probationary fire fighters you going to hold that hose or play with it got to watch em every minute ry dont i know it out of the corner of his eye ry watched his hothouse flower pick her way toward a fire engine he and holden separated isnt there anything you can tell me natalie asked an exhausted fire fighter how did it start lady i just put them out he sat on a running board no longer interested in the smoldering wreck of the warehouse you want answers he jerked his thumb in rys direction ask the inspector civilians dont belong at fire scenes ry said from behind her when she turned to look at him he saw that her eyes were green a deep jade green its my fire scene her voice was cool like the wind that eased her hair with a faint drawl that made him think of cowboys and schoolmarms my warehouse she continued my problem is that so ry took another survey she was cold he knew from experience that there was no place colder than a fire scene in winter but her spine was straight and that delicate chin lifted and that would make you natalie fletcher i own the building and everything in it and id like some answers she cocked one elegantly arched brow and that would make you piasecki arson investigator arson shock had her gaping before she snapped back into control you think this was arson its my job to find out he glanced down nearly sneered youre going to ruin those shoes miz fletcher my shoes are the least of my she broke off when he took her arm and started to steer her away what are you doing youre in the way that would be your car wouldnt it he nodded toward a shiny new mercedes convertible yes but get in it i will not get in it she tried to shake him off and discovered she would have needed a crowbar will you let go of me she smelled a hell of a lot better than smoke and sodden debris ry took a deep gulp of her then tried for diplomacy it was something he was proud to admit that had never been his strong suit look youre cold whats the point in standing out in the wind she stiffened against both him and the wind the point is thats my building whats left of it fine theyd do it her way since it suited him but he placed her between the car and his body to shelter her from the worst of the cold its kind of late at night to be checking your inventory isnt it it is she stuck her hands in her pockets trying fruitlessly to warm them i drove out after the night watchman called me and that would have been i dont know around two around two he repeated and let his gaze skim over her again there was a snazzy dinner suit under the velvet he noted the material looked soft expensive and it was the same color as her eyes pretty fancy outfit for a fire i had a late meeting and didnt think to change into more appropriate clothes before i came idiot she thought and looked back grimly at what was left of her property is there a point to this your meeting ran until two no it broke up about midnight how come youre still dressed what how come youre still dressed he took out another cigarette lit it late date no i went by my office to do some paperwork id barely gotten home when jim banks the night watchman called me then you were alone from midnight until two yes i her eyes cut back to his narrowed do you think im responsible for this is that what youre getting at here what the hell was your name piasecki he said and smiled ryan piasecki and i dont think anything yet miz fletcher im just separating the details her eyes were no longer cool controlled they had flared to flash point then ill give you some more the building and its contents are fully insured im with united security what kind of business are you in im fletcher industries inspector piasecki you may have heard of it he had most certainly real estate mining shipping the conglomerate owned considerable property including several holdings in urbana but there were reasons that big companies as well as small ones resorted to arson you run fletcher industries i oversee several of its interests including this one most particularly this one she thought this one was her baby were opening several specialty boutiques countrywide in the spring in addition to a catalog service a large portion of my inventory was in that building what sort of inventory now she smiled lingerie inspector bras panties negligees silks satins lace you might be familiar with the concept enough to appreciate it she was shivering now obviously struggling to keep her teeth from chattering he imagined her feet would be blocks of ice in those thin pricey shoes look youre freezing out here get in the car go home well be in touch i want to know what happened to my building whats left of my stock your building burned down miz fletcher and its unlikely theres anything left of your stock that would raise a mans blood pressure he opened the car door ive got a job to do and id advise you to call your insurance agent youve got a real knack for soothing the victims dont you piasecki no cant say that i do he took a notebook and pencil stub from his shirt pocket give me your address and phone number home and office natalie took a deep breath then let it out slowly before she gave him the information he wanted you know she added ive always had a soft spot for public servants my brothers a cop in denver that so yes thats so she slid into the car youve managed in one short meeting to change my mind she slammed the door sorry she didnt do it quickly enough to catch his fingers with one last glance at the ruined building she drove away ry watched her taillights disappear and added another note to his book great legs not that hed forget he mused as he turned away but a good inspector wrote everything down natalie forced herself to sleep for two hours then rose and took a stingingcold shower wrapped in her robe she called her assistant and arranged to have her morning appointments canceled or shifted with her first cup of coffee she phoned her parents in colorado she was on cup number two by the time she had given them all the details she knew soothed their concern and listened to their advice with cup number three she contacted her insurance agent and arranged to meet him at the site after downing aspirin with the remains of that cup she dressed for what promised to be a very long day she was nearly out of the door when the phone stopped her you have a machine she reminded herself even as she darted back to answer it hello nat its deborah i just heard oh rubbing the back of her neck natalie sat on the arm of a chair deborah oroarke guthrie was a double pleasure both friend and family i guess its hit the news already there was a slight hesitation im sorry natalie really sorry how bad is it im not sure last night it looked about as bad as it gets but im going out now meeting my insurance agent who knows we may salvage something would you like me to come with you i can reschedule my morning natalie smiled deborah would do just that as if she didnt have enough on her plate with her husband her baby her job as assistant district attorney no but thanks for asking ill let you know something when i know something come to dinner tonight you can relax soak up some sympathy id like that if theres anything else i can do just tell me actually you could call denver keep your sister and my brother from riding east to the rescue ill do that oh one more thing natalie rose checked the contents of her briefcase as she spoke what do you know about an inspector piasecki ryan piasecki piasecki there was a slight pause as deborah flipped through her mental files natalie could all but see the process arson squad hes the best in the city he would be natalie muttered is arson suspected deborah said carefully i dont know i just know he was there he was rude and he wouldnt tell me anything it takes time to determine the cause of a fire natalie i can put some pressure on if you want me to it was tempting just for the imagined pleasure of seeing piasecki scramble no thanks not yet anyway ill see you later seven oclock deborah insisted ill be there thanks natalie hung up and grabbed her coat with luck shed beat the insurance agent to the site by a good thirty minutes luck was with herin that area anyway when natalie pulled up behind the firedepartment barricade she discovered she was going to need a great deal more than luck to win this battle it looked worse incredibly worse than it had the night before it was a small building only three floors the cinderblock outer walls had held and now stood blackened and streaked with soot still dripping with water from the hoses the ground was littered with charred and sodden wood broken glass twisted metal the air stank of smoke miserable she ducked under the yellow tape for a closer look what the hell do you think youre doing she jolted then shaded her eyes from the sun to see more clearly she should have known natalie thought when she saw ry making his way toward her through the wreckage didnt you see the sign he demanded of course i saw it this is my property inspector the insurance adjuster is meeting me here shortly i believe im within my rights in inspecting the damage he gave her one disgusted look dont you have any other kind of shoes i beg your pardon stay here muttering to himself he stalked to his car came back with a pair of oversize firemans boots put these on but he took her arm throwing her off balance put those ridiculous shoes into the boots otherwise youre going to hurt yourself fine she stepped into them feeling absurd the tops of the boots covered her legs almost to the knee the navy suit and matching wool coat she wore were runwaymodel smart a trio of gold chains draped around her neck added flash nice look he commented now lets get something straight i need to preserve this scene and that means you dont touch anything he said it even though his authority to keep her out was debatable and hed already found a great deal of what hed been looking for i have no intention of thats what they all say she drew herself up tell me inspector do you work alone because you prefer it or because no one can stand to be around you for longer than five minutes both he smiled then the change of expression was dazzling charmingand suspicious she wasnt sure but she thought the faintest of dimples winked beside his mouth what are you doing clunking around a fire scene in a fivehundreddollar suit i wary of the smile she tugged her coat closed i have meetings all afternoon i wont have time to change executives he kept his hand on her arm as he turned come on then be careful where you gothe sites not totally safe but you can take a look at what she left you ive still got work to do he led her in through the mangled doorway the ceiling was a yawning pit between floors what had fallen or had been knocked through lay in filthy layers of sodden ash and alligatored wood she shivered once at the sight of the twisted mass of burned mannequins that lay sprawled and broken they didnt suffer ry assured her and her eyes flashed back to his im sure you can view this as a joke but fires never a joke watch your step she saw where hed been working near the base of a broken inner wall there was a small wire screen in a wooden frame a shovel that looked like a childs toy a few mason jars a crowbar a yardstick while she watched ry pried off a scored section of baseboard what are you doing my job she set her teeth are we on the same side here he glanced up maybe with a putty knife he began to scrape at residue he sniffed he grunted and when he was satisfied placed it in a jar do you know what oxidation is ms fletcher she frowned shifted more or less the chemical union of a substance with oxygen it can be slow like paint drying or fast heat and light a fires fast and some things help it move faster he continued to scrape then looked up again held out the knife take a whiff dubious she stepped forward and sniffed what do you smell smoke wet i dont know he placed the residue in the jar gasoline he said watching her face see a liquid seeks its level goes into cracks in the floor into deadair comers flows under baseboard if it gets caught under there it doesnt burn you see the place i cleared out here she moistened her lips studied the floor he had shoveled or swept clear of debris there was a black stain like a shadow burned into the wood yes the charredblob pattern its like a map i keep at this layer by layer and ill be able to tell what happened before during youre telling me someone poured gas in here and lit a match he said nothing only scooted forward a bit to pick up a scrap of burned cloth silk he said with a rub of his fingertips too bad he placed the scrap in what looked like a flour tin sometimes a torch will lay out streamers give the fire more of an appetite they dont always burn he picked up an almost perfectly preserved cup from a lacy bra amused his eyes met natalies over it funny what resists isnt it she was cold again but not from the wind it was from within and it was rage if this fire was deliberately set i want to know interested in the change in her eyes he sat back on his haunches his black firemans coat was unhooked revealing jeans worn white at the knees and a flannel shut he hadnt left the scene since his arrival youll get my report he rose then draw me a picture what did this place look like twentyfour hours ago she closed her eyes for a moment but it didnt help she could still smell the destruction it was three stories about two thousand square feet iron balconies and interior steps seamstresses worked on the third floor all of our merchandise is handmade classy yes thats the idea we have another plant in this district where most of the sewing is done the twelve machines upstairs were just for finish work there was a small coffee room to the left rest rooms on the second the floor was made of linoleum rather than wood we stored the stock there i kept a small office up there as well though i do most of my work uptown the area down here was for inspecting packaging and shipping we were to begin fulfilling our spring orders in three weeks she turned not quite sure where she intended to go and stumbled over debris rys quick grab saved her from a nasty spill hold on he murmured shaken she leaned back against him for a moment there was strength there if not sympathy at the moment she preferred it that way we employed over seventy people in this plant alone people who are out of work until i can sort this out she whirled back he gripped her arms to keep her steady and it was deliberate control he thought well she didnt have it now she was as volatile as a lit match i havent finished my investigation it was deliberate she repeated and youre thinking i could have done it that i came in here in the middle of the night with a can of gasoline her face was close to his funny he thought he hadnt noticed how tall she was in those fancy anklebreaking shoes its a little hard to picture hired someone then she tossed out hired someone to burn down the building even though there was a man in it but whats one security guard against a nice fat insurance check he was silent for a moment his eyes locked on hers you tell me infuriated she wrenched away from him no inspector youre going to have to tell me and whether you like it or not im going be on you like a shadow through every step of the investigation every step she repeated until i have all the answers she strode out of the building dignified despite the awkward boots her temper was barely under control when she saw the car pull up beside hers recognizing it she sighed made her way to the tape barrier and under it donald she held out her hands oh donald what a mess gripping her hands he looked beyond her to the building for a moment he just stood there holding her hands shaking his head how could this have happened the wiring we had the wiring checked two months ago i know im so sorry all your work two years of his life she thought and hers up in smoke everything there was a faint tremor in his voice in his hand as it gripped hers is it all gone im afraid it is we have other inventory donald this isnt going to whip us youre tougher than me nat after a last quick squeeze he released her hands this was my biggest shot youre the ceo but i feel like i was captain and my ship just sank natalies heart went out to him it wasnt simply business with donald hawthorne she thought any more than it was simply business with her this new company was a dream a fresh excitement and a chance for both of them to try something completely different no not just to try she reminded herself to succeed were going to have to work our butts off for the next three weeks he turned back a small smile curving his lips do you really think we can pull it off after this on schedule yes i do determination hardened her lips its a delay thats all so we shuffle things around well certainly have to postpone the audit i cant even think of that now he stopped blinked jesus nat the files the records i dont think were going to salvage any of the paperwork that was in the warehouse she looked back toward her building its going to make things more complicated add some work hours but well put it back together but how can we manage the audit when it goes on the back burner until were up and running well talk about it back at the office as soon as i meet the insurance agent get the ball rolling im heading back in already her mind was working out the details the steps and stages well put on some double shifts order new material pull in some inventory from chicago and atlanta well make it work donald ladys choice is going to open in march come hell or high water his smile flashed into a grin if anybody can make it work you can we can she told him now i need you to get back uptown start making calls pr she knew was his strong suit he was overly impulsive perhaps but she needed the actionoriented with her now you get melvin and deirdre hopping donald bribe or threaten distributors plead with the union soothe the clients thats what you do best im on it you can count on me i know i can ill be in the office soon to crack the whip boyfriend ry wondered as he watched the two embrace the tall polished executive with the pretty face and shiny shoes looked to be her type as a matter of course he noted down the license number of the lincoln beside natalies car then went back to work chapter contents prev next shes going to be here any minute assistant district attorney deborah oroarke guthrie put fisted hands on her hips i want the whole story gage before natalie gets here gage added another log to the fire before he turned to his wife shed changed out of her business suit into soft wool slacks and a cashmere sweater of midnight blue her ebony hair fell loose nearly to her shoulders youre beautiful deborah i dont tell you that often enough she lifted a brow oh he was a smooth operator and charming and clever but so was she no evasions gage youve managed to avoid telling me everything you know so far but you were in court all day he reminded her i was in meetings thats beside the point im here now you certainly are he walked to her slipped his arms through hers and circled her waist his lips curved as they lowered to hers hello more than two years of marriage hadnt diluted her response to him her mouth softened parted but then she remembered herself and stepped back no you dont consider yourself under oath and in the witness chair guthrie spill it i know you were there i was there annoyance flickered in his eyes before he crossed over to pour mineral water for deborah yes hed been there he thought too late he had his own way of combating the dark side of urbana the giftor the cursehed been left with after surviving what should have been a fatal shooting gave him an edge hed been a cop too long to close his eyes to injustice now with the odd twist fate had dealt him he fought crime his own way with his own special talent deborah watched him stare down at his hand flex it it was an old habit one that told her he was thinking of how he could make it make himself fade to nothing and when he did he was nemesis a shadow that haunted the streets of urbana a shadow that had slipped into her life and her heart as real and as dear to her as the man who stood before her i was there he repeated and poured a glass of wine for himself but too late to do anything i didnt beat the first engine company by more than five minutes you cant always be first on the scene gage deborah murmured even nemesis isnt omnipotent no he handed her the glass the point is i didnt see who started the fire if indeed it was arson which you believe it was he smiled again i have a suspicious mind so do i she tapped her glass against his i wish there was something i could do for natalie shes worked so hard to get this new company off the ground youre doing something gage told her youre here and shell fight back thats one thing you can count on she tilted her head i dont suppose anyone saw you around the warehouse last night now he grinned what do you think she blew out a breath i think ill never quite get used to it when the doorbell sounded deborah set her glass aside ill get she hurried to the door then opened her arms to natalie im so glad you could come i wouldnt miss one of franks meals for anything determined to be cheerful natalie kissed deborah then linked arms with her as they walked back into the sitting room she offered her host a brilliant smile hello gorgeous she kissed gage as well accepted the drink he offered and a seat by the fire she sighed once a beautiful house a beautiful couple so incredibly in love natalie told herself if she were inclined toward domesticity she might be envious how are you coping deborah asked her well i love a challenge and this is a big one the bottom line is ladys choice will have its grand opening nationwide in three weeks i was under the impression that you lost quite a bit of merchandise gage commented cloaked by the shadow of his gift hed watched her arrive at the scene the night before as well as the building there are other buildings in fact she had already arranged to purchase another warehouse it would even after the insurance payoff put a dent in the estimated profits for the year but they would make it up natalie thought she would see to that were going to be working overtime for a while to make up some of the losses and i can pull some stock in from other locations urbanas our flagship store i intend for it to go off with a bang she sipped her wine running the stages through her mind ive got donald with a phone glued to his ear with his background in public relations hes the best qualified to beg and borrow melvins already flown out on a fourcity jaunt to swing through the other plants and stores hell work some of his wizardry in figuring who can spare what merchandise and deirdres working on the figures ive talked to the union leaders and some of the laborers i intend to be back in full production within fortyeight hours gage toasted her if anyone can do it he was a businessman himself among other things and knew exactly how much work how much risk and how much sweat natalie would face is there anything new on the fire itself not specifically frowning natalie glanced into the cheerful flames in the hearth so harmless she thought so attractive ive talked with the investigator a couple of times he implies he interrogates and by god he irritates but he doesnt commit ryan piasecki deborah stated and it was her turn to smile i stole a few minutes today to do some checking on him i thought youd be interested bless you natalie leaned forward so whats the story hes been with the department for fifteen years fought fires for ten and worked his way up to lieutenant a couple of smears in his file natalies lips curved smugly oh really apparently he belted a city councilman at a fire scene broke his jaw violent tendencies natalie muttered i knew it it was what they call a class c fire deborah continued in a chemical plant piasecki was with engine company and they were the first to respond there was no backup economic cutbacks she added as natalies brows knit number lost three men in that fire and two more were critically injured the councilman showed up with the press in tow and began to pontificate on our system at work hed spearheaded the cutbacks damn it natalie blew out a breath i guess id have belted him too there was another disciplinary action when he stormed into the mayors office with a bagful of firesite salvage and dumped it on the desk it was from a lowrent apartment building on the east side that had just passed inspectioneven though the wiring was bad the furnace faulty no smoke alarms broken fire escapes twenty people died i wanted you to tell me that my instincts were on target natalie muttered that i had a good reason for detesting him sorry deborah had developed a soft spot for men who fought crime and corruption in untraditional manners she shot gage a look that warmed them both well natalie sighed what else do you have on him he moved to the arson squad about five years ago he has a reputation for being abrasive aggressive and annoying thats better and for having the nose of a bloodhound the eyes of a hawk and the tenacity of a pit bull he keeps digging and digging until he finds the answers ive never had to use him in court but i asked around you cant shake him on the stand hes smart he writes everything down everything and he remembers it hes thirtysix divorced hes a team player who prefers to work alone i suppose it should make me feel better knowing im in competent hands natalie moved her shoulders restlessly but it doesnt i appreciate the profile no problem deborah began then broke off when the sound of crying came through the baby monitor beside her sounds like the boss is awake no ill go she said when gage got to his feet she just wants company am i going to get a peek natalie asked sure come on ill tell frank to hold dinner until youre done with a frown in his eyes gage watched natalie head upstairs with his wife you know natalie said as they started up to the nursery you look fabulous i dont see how you manage it all a demanding career a dynamic husband and all the social obligations that go with him and the adorable adrianna i could tell you its all a matter of time management and prioritizing with a grin deborah opened the door of the nursery but what it really comes down to is passion for the job for gage for our addy theres nothing you cant have if youre passionate about it the nursery was a symphony of color murals on the ceiling told stories of princesses and magic horses primary tones brightened the walls and bled into rainbows with her hands gripped on the rail of her jenny lind crib legs wobbling tenmonthold addy pouted oblivious of the ambiance oh sweetie deborah reached down picked her up to nuzzle here you are all wet and lonely the pout transformed into a beaming satisfied smile mama natalie watched while deborah laid addy on the changing table shes prettier every time i see her gently she brushed at the dark thatch of hair on the babys head pleased with the attention addy kicked her feet and began to babble were thinking about having another another natalie blinked into deborahs glowing face already well its still in the whatif stage but wed really like to have three she pressed a kiss to the soft curve of addys neck chuckling when she tugged on her hair i just love being a mother it shows can i once the fresh diaper was in place natalie lifted the baby there was envy she discovered for this small miracle who curved so perfectly into her arms two days later natalie was at her desk a headache drumming behind her eyes she didnt mind it the incessant throbbing pushed her forward if the mechanic cant repair the machines get new ones i want every seamstress online no tomorrow afternoon wont do she tapped a pen on the edge of her desk shifted the phone from ear to ear today ill be in myself by one to check on the new stock i know its a madhouse lets keep it that way she hung up and looked at her three associates donald he skimmed a hand over his burnished hair the first ad runs in the times on saturday fullpage threecolor the ad with necessary variations will be running in the other cities simultaneously the changes i wanted implemented catalogs shipped today they look fabulous yes they do pleased natalie glanced down at the glossy catalog on her desk melvin as was his habit melvin glasky slipped off his rimless glasses polishing them as he spoke he was in his midfifties addicted to bow ties and golf he was thin of frame and pink of cheek and sported a saltandpepper toupee that he naively believed was his little secret atlanta looks the best though chicago and la are gearing up he gestured to the report on her desk i worked out deals with each location for inventory transfers not everybody was happy about it his lenses glinted like diamonds when he set them back on his nose the store manager in chicago defended her stock like a mama bear she didnt want to give up one brassiere natalies lips twitched at his drawling pronunciation so so i blamed it on you natalie leaned back in her chair and chuckled of course you did i told her that you wanted twice what youd told me you needed which gave me negotiating room she figured you should filch from catalog i agreed his eyes twinkled then i told her how you considered catalog sacred wouldnt touch one pair of panties because you wanted all catalog orders fulfilled within ten days of order youre inflexible her lips twitched again in the eighteen months theyd worked together on this project shed come to adore melvin i certainly am so i told her how id take the heat and half of what you ordered youd have made a hell of a politician melvin what do you think i am in any case youve got about fifty percent of your inventory back for the flagship store i owe you deirdre ive run the projected increases in payroll and material expenses deirdre marks tossed her flyaway ginger braid behind her shoulder her slightly flattened tones were pure midwest and her mind was as quick and controlled as a hightech computer also the outlay for the new site and equipment with the incentive bonuses you authorized well be in the red ive done graphs ive seen them mulling over her options natalie rubbed the back of her neck the insurance money when it comes through will offset that somewhat im willing to risk my investment and add to it to see that this works from a straight financial standpoint deirdre continued any return looks dim at least in the foreseeable future firstyear sales alone would have to be in excess of she shrugged her narrow shoulders at natalies stubborn expression you have the figures yes and i appreciate the extra work the files at the south side warehouse were destroyed fortunately id had maureen make copies of the bulk of them she rubbed her eyes caught herself and folded her hands im very aware that the majority of new business ventures fold within the first year this isnt going to be one of them im not looking for shortterm profits but for longterm success i intend for ladys choice to be at the top on retail and direct sales within ten years so im certainly not going to take a step back at the first real obstacle she flicked a finger over a button when her buzzer sounded yes maureen inspector piasecki would like to see you ms fletcher he doesnt have an appointment automatically natalie scanned her desk calendar she could spare piasecki fifteen minutes and still make it to the new warehouse well have to finish this later she said with a glance at her associates show him in maureen ry preferred meeting friends or foes on their own turf he hadnt yet decided which category natalie fletcher fell into he had however decided to swing by her office to get a firsthand look at that part of her operation he couldnt say he was disappointed fancy digs for a fancy lady he thought thick carpet lots of glass softcolored cushy chairs in the waiting area original paintings on the walls live thriving plants and her secretary or assistant or whatever title the pretty little thing at the lobby desk carried worked with topgrade equipment the bosss office was no surprise either rys quick scan showed him more thick carpet in slate blue rosy walls decorated with the splashy modern art hed never cared for antique furnitureprobably the real thing her desk was some old european piece he supposed they went in for all that gingerbread work and curves natalie sat behind it in one of her tidy suits a wide tinted window at her back three other people stood like soldiers ready to snap to attention at her command he recognized the younger man as the one shed embraced at the fire site tailored suit shiny leather shoes ruthlessly knotted tie pretty face blowdried hair soft hands the second man was older and looked to be on the edge of a smile he wore a polkadot bow tie and a mediocre toupee the woman made a fine foil for her boss boxy jacketslightly wrinkledflatheeled shoes messy hair that couldnt decide if it wanted to be red or brown closing in on forty ry judged and not much interested in fighting it inspector natalie waited a full ten seconds before rising and holding out a hand ms fletcher he gave her long narrow fingers a perfunctory squeeze inspector piasecki is investigating the warehouse fire and in his usual uniform of jeans and a flannel shirt she noted didnt the city issue official attire inspector these are three of my toplevel executivesdonald hawthorne melvin glasky and deirdre marks ry nodded at the introductions then turned his attention to natalie again id have thought a smart woman like you would know better than to put her office on the fortysecond floor i beg your pardon it makes rescue hellnot only for you but for the department no way to get a ladder up here that windows for looks not for ventilation or escape youve got fortytwo floors to get down in a stairway thats liable to be filled with smoke natalie sat again without asking him to join her this building is equipped with all necessary safety devices sprinklers smoke detectors extinguishers he only smiled so was your warehouse ms fletcher her headache was coming back doubletime inspector did you come here to update me on your investigation or to criticize my work space i can do both if youll excuse us natalie glanced toward her three associates once the door had closed behind them natalie gestured to a chair lets clear the air here you dont like me i dont like you but we both have a common goal very often i have to work with people i dont care for on a personal level it doesnt stop me from doing my job she tilted her head aimed what he considered a very cool very regal stare at him does it stop you he crossed his scuffed hightops at the ankles nope good now what do you have to tell me ive just filed my report you no longer have a suspicious fire youve got arson despite the fact that shed been expecting it her stomach clutched once theres no question she shook her head before he could speak no there wouldnt be ive been told youre very thorough have you you ought to try aspirin before you rub a hole in your head annoyed natalie dropped the hand shed been using to massage her temple whats the next step ive got cause method point of origin i want motive arent there people who set fires simply because they enjoy it because theyre compelled to sure he started to reach for a cigarette then noticed there wasnt an ashtray in sight maybe youve got a gardenvariety spark or maybe youve got a hired torch you were carrying a lot of insurance ms fletcher thats right i had a reason for it i lost over a million and a half in merchandise and equipment alone you were covered for a hell of a lot more if you know anything at all about real estate inspector youre aware that the building was quite valuable if youre looking for insurance fraud youre wasting your time ive got time he rose im going to need a statement ms fletcher official tomorrow my office two oclock she rose as well i can give you a statement here and now my office ms fletcher he took a card out of his pocket set it on her desk look at it this way if youre in the clear the sooner we get this done the sooner you collect your insurance very well she picked up the card and slipped it into the pocket of her suit the sooner the better is that all for the moment inspector yeah his eyes skimmed down to the cover of the catalog lying on the desk an ivoryskinned model was curled over a velvet settee showing off a backless red gown with a froth of tantalizing lace at the bodice nice his gaze shot back to natalies a classy way to sell sex romance inspector some people still enjoy it do you i dont think that applies i just wondered if you believe in what youre selling or if you just go for the bucks just as hed wondered if she wore her own products under those neatly tailored suits then ill satisfy your curiosity i always believe in what im selling and i enjoy making money im very good at it she picked up the catalog and held it out to him why dont you take this along all our merchandise is unconditionally guaranteed the tollfree number will be in full operation on monday if shed expected him to refuse or fumble she was disappointed ry rolled the catalog into a tube and tucked it into his hip pocket thanks now if youll excuse me i have an outside appointment she stepped out from behind the desk hed been hoping for that whatever he thought about her he enjoyed her legs need a lift surprised she turned away from the small closet at the end of the room no i have a car it more than surprised her when he came up behind her to help her on with her coat his hands lingered lightly briefly on her shoulders youre stressed out ms fletcher im busy inspector she turned off balance and was annoyed when she had to jerk back or bump up against him and jumpy he added with a quick satisfied curve of his lips hed wondered if she was as elementally aware of him as he was of her a suspicious man might say those were signs of guilt it so happens im a suspicious man but you know what i think im fascinated by what you think sarcasm apparently had no effect on him he just continued to smile at her i think youre just made up that way tense and jumpy youve got plenty of control and you know just how to keep the fires banked but now and again it slips its interesting when it does it was slipping now she could feel it sliding greasily out of her hands do you know what i think inspector the dimple that should have been out of place on his strong face winked im fascinated by what you think ms fletcher i think youre an arrogant narrowminded irritating man who thinks entirely too much of himself id say were both right and youre in my way youre right about that too but he didnt move wasnt quite ready to damned if you dont have the fanciest face she blinked i beg your pardon an observation youre one classy number his fingers itched to touch so he dipped them into his pockets hed thrown her off that was obvious from the way she was staring at him half horrified half intrigued ry saw no reason not to take advantage of it a mans hardpressed not to do a little fantasizing once hes had a good look at you ive had a couple of good looks now i dont think only sheer pride prevented her stepping back or forward i dont think this is appropriate if we ever get to know each other better youll find out that propriety isnt at the top of my list tell me do you and hawthorne have a personal thing going his eyes dark intense close dazzled her for a moment donald of course not appalled she caught herself thats none of your business her answer pleased him on professional and personal levels everything about you is my business she tossed up her chin eyes smoldering so this pitiful excuse for a flirtation is just a way to get me to incriminate myself i didnt think it was that pitiful obvious he admitted but not pitiful on a professional level it worked i could have lied you have to think before you lie and you werent thinking he liked the idea of being able to frazzle her and pushed a little further it so happens that on a strictly personal level i like the way you look but dont worry it wont get in the way of the job i dont like you inspector piasecki you said that already for his own pleasure he reached out tugged her coat closed button up its cold out there my office he added as he turned for the door tomorrow two oclock he strolled out thinking of her natalie fletcher he mused punching the elevator button for the lobby highclass brains in a firstclass package maybe shed torched her own building for a quick profit she wouldnt be the first or the last but his instincts told him no she didnt strike him as a woman who looked for shortcuts he stepped into the elevator car which tossed his own image back to him in smoked glass everything about her was topoftheline and her background just didnt equal fraud fletcher industries generated enough profit annually to buy a couple of small third world countries this new arm of it was natalies baby and even if it folded in the first year it wouldnt shake the corporate foundations of course there was emotional attachment to be considered those same instincts told him she had a great deal of emotional attachment to this new endeavor that was enough for some to try to eke out a quick profit to save a shaky investment but it didnt jibe not with her someone else in the company maybe a competitor hoping to sabotage her business before it got off the ground or a classic pyro looking for a thrill whatever it was hed find it and he thought he was going to enjoy rattling natalie fletchers cage while he was going about it one classy lady he mused he imagined shed look gooddamn goodmodeling her own merchandise the beeper hooked to his belt sounded as he stepped from the elevator another fire he thought and moved quickly to the nearest phone there was always another fire chapter contents prev next ry kept her cooling her heels for fifteen minutes it was a standard ploy one shed often used herself to psych out an opponent she was determined not to fall for it there wasnt even enough room in the damn closet he called an office to pace he worked in one of the oldest fire stations in the city two floors above the engines and trucks in a small glassedin box that offered an uninspiring view of a cracked parking lot and sagging tenements in the adjoining room natalie could see a woman pecking listlessly at a typewriter that sat on a desk overflowing with files and forms the walls throughout were a dingy yellow that might decades ago have been white they were checkerboard with photos of fire scenessome of which were grim enough to have had her turning awaybulletins flyers and a number of polish jokes in dubious taste obviously ry had no problem shrugging off the clichéd humor about his heritage metal shelves were piled with books binders pamphlets and a couple of trophies each topped with a statuette of a basketball player and she noted with a sniff dust his desk slightly larger than a card table and badly scarred was propped up under one shortened leg by a tattered paperback copy of the red pony the man didnt even have respect for steinbeck when her curiosity got the better of her natalie rose from the folding chair with its torn plastic seat and poked around his desk no photographs she noted no personal mementos bent paper clips broken pencils a claw hammer a ridiculous mess of disorganized paperwork she pushed at some of that then jumped back in horror when she revealed the decapitated head of a doll she might have laughed at herself if it wasnt so hideous the remnant of a childs toy the frizzy blond hair nearly burned away the once rosy face melted into mush on one side one bright blue eye remained staring souvenirs ry said from the doorway hed been watching her for a couple of minutes from a class a fire up in the east sixties the kid made it he glanced down at the head on his desk she was in a little better shape than her doll her shudder was quick and uncontrollable thats horrible yeah it was the kids father started it with a can of kerosene in the living room the wife wanted a divorce when he was finished she didnt need one he was so cold about it she thought maybe he had to be you have a miserable job inspector thats why i love it he glanced around as the outer door opened have a seat ill be right with you ry pulled the office door closed before he turned to the uniformed fire fighter whod come in behind him through the glass natalie could hear the mutter of voices she didnt need to hear ry raise his voiceas he soon didto know that the young fireman was receiving a firstclass dressingdown who told you to ventilate that wall probie sir i thought probies dont think youre not smart enough to think if you were youd know what fresh air does for a fire youd know what happens when you let it in and theres a damn puddle of fuel oil sloshing under your boots yes sir i know sir i didnt see it the smoke youd better learn to see through smoke youd better learn to see through everything and when the fire goes into the frigging wall you dont take it on yourself to give it a way out while youre standing in accelerant youre lucky to be alive probie and sos the team who were unlucky enough to be with you yes sir i know sir you dont know diddly thats the first thing you remember the next time you go in to eat smoke now get out of here natalie crossed her legs when ry came into the room youre a real diplomat that kid couldnt have been more than twenty be nice if he lived to a ripe old age wouldnt it with a flick of his wrist ry tugged down the blinds closing them in your technique makes me regret i didnt bring a lawyer with me relax he moved to his desk pushed some files out of his way i dont have the authority to arrest just to investigate well ill sleep easy now deliberately she took a long look at her watch how long do you think this is going to take ive already wasted twenty minutes i got held up he sat opened the bag hed brought in with him have you had lunch no her eyes narrowed as he took out a wrapped package that smelled tantalizingly of deli are you telling me that youve kept me waiting in here while you picked up a sandwich it was on my way he offered her half of a corned beef on rye ive got a couple of coffees too ill take the coffee keep the sandwich suit yourself he handed her a small insulated cup mind if we record this id prefer it eating with one hand he opened a desk drawer took out a tape recorder you must have a closet full of those suits this one was the color of crushed raspberries and fastened at the left hip with gold buttons do you ever wear anything else i beg your pardon small talk ms fletcher im not here for small talk she snapped back and stop calling me ms fletcher in that irritating way no problem natalie just call me ry he switched on the recorder and began by reciting the time date and location of the interview despite the tape he took out a notebook and pencil this interview is being conducted by inspector ryan piasecki with natalie fletcher re the fire at the fletcher industries warehouse south harbor avenue on february of this year he took a sip of his coffee ms fletcher you are the owner of the aforesaid building and its contents the building and its contents arewerethe property of fletcher industries of which i am an executive officer how long has the building belonged to your company for eight years it was previously used to warehouse inventory for fletcher shipping the heater beside him began to whine and gurgle ry kicked it carelessly it went back to a subdued hum and now fletcher shipping moved to a new location she relaxed a little it was going to be routine now business the warehouse was converted nearly two years ago to accommodate a new company we used the building for manufacturing and warehousing merchandise for ladys choice we make ladies lingerie and what were the hours of operation normally eight to six monday through friday in the last six months we expanded that to include saturdays from eight to noon he continued to eat asking standard questions about business practices security vandalism her answers were quick cool and concise you have a number of suppliers yes we use american companies only thats a firm policy ups the overhead in the short term i believe in the long term the company will generate profits to merit it youve put a lot of personal time into this company incurred a lot of expenses invested your own money thats right what happens if the business doesnt live up to your expectations it will he leaned back now enjoying what was left of his cooling coffee if it doesnt then i would lose my time and my money when was the last time you were in the building before the fire the sudden change of topic surprised but didnt throw her i went by for a routine check three days before the fire that would have been the ninth of february he noted it down did you notice any inventory missing no damaged equipment no any holes in security no i would have dealt with any of those things immediately did he think she was an idiot work was progressing on schedule and the inventory i looked over was fine his eyes cut back to hers lingered you didnt look over everything i did a spot check inspector the stare was designed to make her uncomfortable she knew she refused to allow it it isnt a productive use of time for me or my staff to examine every negligee or garter belt the building was inspected in november you were up to code on all fire regulations thats right can you explain how it was that on the night of the fire the sprinkler and smoke alarm systems were inoperative inoperative her heart picked up a beat im not sure what you mean they were tampered with ms fletcher so was your security system she kept her eyes level with his no i cant explain it can you he took out a cigarette flicked a wooden match into flame with his thumbnail do you have any enemies her face went blank enemies anyone whod like to see you fail personally or professionally ino i cant think of anyone personally the idea left her shaken she pulled a hand through her hair from the crown to the tips that swung at chin level naturally i have competitors anyone whos given you trouble no disgruntled employees fire anyone lately no i cant speak for every level of the organization i have managers who have autonomy in their own departments but nothings come back to me he continued to smoke as he asked questions took notes he wound the interview down closing it by logging the time i spoke to your insurance adjuster this morning he told her and your security guard i have interviews set up with the foremen at the warehouse when she didnt respond he crushed out his cigarette want some water no she let out a breath thank you do you think im responsible what i know goes into the report not what i think i want to know she stood then im asking you to tell me what you think she didnt belong here that was the first thought that crossed his mind not here in the cramped little room that smelled of whatever the men were cooking downstairs boardrooms and bedrooms he was certain shed be equally adept in both venues i dont know natalie maybe its your pretty face affecting my judgment but noi dont think youre responsible feel better not much i suppose my only choice now is to depend on you to find out the who and why she let out a little sigh as much as it galls me i have a feeling youre just the man for the job a compliment and so early in our relationship with any luck itll be the first and the last she shifted reached down for her briefcase he moved quickly and quietly before she could lift it his hand closed over hers on the strap take a break she flexed her hand under his once felt the hard callused palm then went still excuse me youre revved natalie but youre running on empty you need to relax it was unlikely she would or could with him holding on to her what i need to do is get back to work so if thats all inspector i thought we were on a firstname basis now come on i want to show you something i dont have time she began as he pulled her out of the room i have an appointment you always seem to arent you ever late no every mans fantasy woman beautiful smart and prompt he led her down a staircase how tall are you without the stilts she lifted a brow at his description of her elegant italian pumps tall enough he stopped one step below her and turned they were lined up eye to eye mouth to mouth yeah id say you are just tall enough he tugged her as he might have a disinterested mule until they reached the ground floor there were scents wafting out from the kitchen chili was on the menu for tonight a couple of men were checking equipment on one of the engines another was rolling a hose on the chilly concrete floor ry was greeted with salutes and quick grins natalie with pursed lips and groans they cant help it ry told her we dont get legs like yours walking through here every day ill give you a boost what ill give you a boost he repeated as he opened the door on an engine not that the guys wouldnt appreciate the way that skirt would ride up if you climbed in on your own but before she could protest ry had gripped her by the waist and lifted her she had a moment to think the strength in his arms was uncannily effortless before he joined her move over he ordered unless youd rather sit on my lap she scooted across the seat why am i sitting in a fire engine everybody wants to at least once very much at home he stretched his arm over the seat so what do you think she scanned the gauges and dials the oversize gearshift the photo of miss january taped to the dash its interesting thats it she caught her bottom lip between her teeth she wondered which control operated the siren which the lights okay its fun she leaned forward for a better view through the windshield were really up here arent we is this the he caught her hand just before she could yank the cord over her head horn he finished the men are used to it but believe me with the acoustics in here and the outside doors shut youd be sorry if you sounded it too bad she skimmed back her hair as she turned her face toward him are you showing me your toy to relax me or just to show off both howm i doing maybe youre not quite the jerk you appear to be you keep being so nice to me im going to fall in love she laughed and realized she was almost relaxed i think were both safe on that count what made you decide to sit in a fire engine for ten years youve been checking up on me idly he lifted his fingers just enough to reach the tips of her hair soft he thought like sunny silk thats right she shot him a look so so i guess were even im a thirdgeneration smoke eater its in the blood mmm that she understood but you gave it up no i shifted gears thats different she supposed it was but it wasnt a real answer why do you keep that souvenir on your desk she watched his eyes closely as she asked the dolls head its from my last fire the last one i fought he could still remember itthe heat the smoke the screaming i carried the kid out the bedroom door was locked my guess is hed herded his wife and kid inyou know you cant live with me you wont live without me he had a gun it wasnt loaded but she wouldnt have known that thats horrible she wondered if she would have risked the gun and thought she would have better a bullet fast and final than the terrors of smoke and flame his own family some guys dont take kindly to divorce he shrugged his own had been painless enough almost anticlimactic the way it came out he made them sit there while the fire got bigger and the smoke snuck under the door it was a frame house old went up like a matchstick the woman had tried to protect the kid had curled over her in a corner i couldnt get them both at once so i took the kid his eyes changed now darkened focused on something only he could see the woman was gone anyway i knew she was gone but theres always a chance i was headed down the steps with the kid when the floor gave way you saved the child natalie said gently the mother saved the child he could never forget that could never forget that selfless and hopeless devotion the son of a bitch who torched the house jumped out the secondstory window oh he was burned smoke inhalation broken leg but he lived through it he cared she realized she hadnt seen that before or hadnt wanted to it changed him changed her perception of him and you decided to go after the men who start them instead of the fires themselves more or less he snapped his head up like a wolf scenting prey when the alarm shrilled the station sprang to life with running feet shouted orders ry pitched his voice over the din lets get out of the way he pushed open the door caught natalie in one arm and swung out chemical plant someone said as they hurried by pulling on protective gear in seconds it seemed the engines were manned and screaming out the arched double doors its so fast natalie said ears still ringing pulse still jumping they move so fast yeah its exciting she pressed a hand to her speeding heart i didnt realize do you miss it she looked up at him then and her hand went limp he was still holding her against him and his eyes were dark and focused on hers now and again well itsi should go yeah you should go but he shifted her until she was wrapped in both his arms maybe it was a kneejerk reaction to the sirens maybe it was the exotic and irresistible scent of her but his blood was pumping and he wanted to see just once if she tasted as good as she looked this is insane she managed to say she knew what he intended to do what she wanted him to do this has got to be wrong his lips curved just a little whats your point then his mouth closed over hers she didnt push back for nearly one heartbeat she didnt respond in that instant she thought shed been paralyzed struck deaf dumb and blind then in a tidal wave every sense flooded back every nerve snapped every pulse jolted his mouth was hard as his hands were as his body was she felt terrifyingly gloriously feminine pressed against him a need she hadnt been aware of exploded into bloom her briefcase hit the floor with a thud as she wrapped herself around him he was no longer thinking just once a man would starve to death after only one taste a man would certainly beg for more she was soft and strong and sinfully sweet with a flavor that both tempted and tormented heat radiated between them as the wind whipped in through the open doors at their back the clatter of street noises horns and tires sounded around them along with her dazed throaty moan he pulled back once to look at her face saw himself in the cloudy green of her eyes and then his mouth crushed hers again no this wasnt going to happen just once she couldnt breathe no longer wanted to his lips were moving against hers forming words she could neither hear nor understand for the first time in her memory she could do nothing but feel and the feelings came so fast so sharp and strong they left her in tatters he pulled back again staggered by what had ripped through him in so short a time he was winded weak and the sensation infuriated as much as it baffled him she only stood there staring at him with a mixture of shock and hunger in her eyes sorry he muttered and hooked his thumbs in his pockets sorry she repeated she sucked in a deep breath wondered if her head would ever stop spinning sorry thats right he couldnt decide whether to curse her or himself damn it his knees were weak that was out of line out of line she brushed her hair back from her face furious to find her skin heated hed torn aside every defense every line of control and now he dared to apologize her chin snapped up her shoulders straightened youve certainly got a way with words tell me inspector do you paw all your suspects his eyes narrowed kindled it was mutual pawing and no youre the first lucky me amazed appalled that she was very near tears natalie snatched up her briefcase i believe this concludes our meeting hold it ryan played fair and cursed them both when she continued striding toward the doors i said hold it he headed after her and with one hand on her arm he spun her around her breath hissed out between clenched teeth i refuse to give in to the typical cliché of slapping you but its costing me i apologized stuff it be reasonable he cautioned himself it was either that or kiss her again look ms fletcher you didnt exactly fight me off a mistake i assure you that will not be repeated she made it to the sidewalk this time before he caught her i dont want you he said definitely insulted provoked beyond her control she jabbed a finger into his chest oh really then perhaps youd care to explain that hamhanded maneuver in there there was nothing hamhanded about it i hardly touched you and you went off like a rocket its not my fault if you were ripe her eyes went huge ballistic ripe ripe why youyou overbearing arrogant selfabsorbed idiot tell him honey was the advice of a toothy bag lady who shoved past with her teetering cart dont let him get away with it that was a bad choice of words ry responded goaded into adding more fuel to the fire i should have said repressed i am going to hit you and he continued ignoring her i should have said i dont like wanting you natalie concentrated for one moment on simply breathing she would not absolutely would not lower herself to having a public brawl on the sidewalk that inspector piasecki may be the first and last time we ever have the same sentiment about anything i dont like it either dont like me wanting you or dont like you wanting me either he nodded and they eyed each other like boxers between rounds so well talk it out tonight we will not he would he promised himself be patient if it killed him or her natalie just how complicated do you want to make this i dont want to make it complicated ry i want to make it impossible why she speared him with a look skimming her gaze from the toes of his shoes to the top of his head i should think that would be obvious even to you he rocked back on his heels i dont know what it is about that snotty attitude of yoursit just does something for me you want to play this traditional with me asking you out to dinner that routine she closed her eyes and prayed for patience i dont seem to be getting through she opened them again no i dont want you asking me out to dinner or any routine what happened inside there was wild incredible an aberration she said between her teeth it wouldnt be a hardship to prove you wrong but if we started that again out here wed probably be arrested before we were finished ryan was enjoying himself now immersed in the simple challenge of her and he intended to win but i see what it is ive spooked you now youre afraid to be alone with me afraid youll lose control heat stung her cheeks thats very lame he shrugged works for me she studied him he wanted to prove something he was about to be disappointed all right eight oclock chez robert on third ill meet you there fine fine she turned away oh piasecki she called over her shoulder they frown on eating with your fingers ill keep it in mind natalie was sure she had lost her mind she dashed into her apartment at facts figures projections graphs were all running through her head and her phone was ringing she caught the cordless on the fly and dashed into the bedroom to change yes what is that how mom taught you to answer the phone boyd some of the tension of the day drained away at the sound of her brothers voice im sorry ive just come in from the last of several mindnumbing meetings dont look for sympathy here youre the one who opted to carry on the family tradition right you are she stepped out of her shoes so hows the fight against crime and corruption in denver captain fletcher were holding our own cilia and the kids send love kisses and so forth and send mine back at them arent they going to talk to me im at the station im a little concerned about crime out there in urbana she searched through her closet the phone caught in the curve of her shoulder how did you find out the fire was arson already i barely found out myself we have ways actually i just got off the phone with the investigator in charge piasecki natalie tossed a black dinner dress on her bed you talked to him ten minutes ago it sounds like youre in good hands nat not if i can help it she muttered what he appears to know his job she said calmly though his methods lack a certain style arsons a dirty business and a dangerous one im worried about you pal dont be youre the cop remember she struggled out of her jacket promising herself shed hang it up before she left im the ceo in the ivory tower ive never known you to stay there i want you to keep me uptodate on the investigation i can do that she wiggled out of her skirt and guiltily left it pooled on the floor and tell mom and dad if you talk to them before i do that things are under control i wont bore you with all the business data i appreciate that she grinned boyd had no patience with ledgers or bar graphs but im about to put another very colorful feather in the fletcher industries cap with underwear lingerie darling a little breathless she fastened on a strapless black bra you can buy underwear at a drugstore right well i can tell you on a personal level cilia and i have both thoroughly enjoyed the samples you sent out i particularly liked the little red thing with the tiny hearts i thought you would she stepped into the dress tugged it up to her hips with valentines day coming up you should think about ordering her the matching peignoir put it on my tab take care of yourself nat i intend to with any luck ill be seeing you next month im going to scout out locations in denver your rooms ready for you anytime and so are we i love you i love you too bye she hung up by dropping the phone on the bed freeing herself to zip the dress into place not exactly a sedate number she mused turning toward the mirror not with the way it draped off the shoulders and veed down over the curve of the breasts repressed she shook back her hair this ought to show him the phone rang again making her swear in disgust she ignored the first ring and picked up her brush by the third shed given up and pounced on the phone hello just breathing quick and a faint chuckle hello is someone there midnight what distracted she carried the phone to the dresser to select the right jewelry im sorry i didnt catch that midnight witching hour wait and see when the phone clicked she disconnected set it down with a shake of her head cranks use the answering machine natalie she ordered herself thats what its there for a glance at her watch had her swearing again she forgot the call as she went into grooming overdrive she absolutely refused to be late chapter contents prev next natalie arrived at chez robert precisely at eight the fourstar french restaurant with its floral walls and candlelit corners had been a favorite of hers since she relocated to urbana just stepping inside put her at ease she had no more than checked her coat when she was greeted enthusiastically by the maitre d he kissed her hand with a flourish and beamed ah mademoiselle fletcher a pleasure as always i didnt know you were dining with us this evening im meeting a companion andre a mr piasecki pi brows knit andre scanned his reservation book while he mentally sounded out the name ah yes two for eight oclock pizekee close enough natalie murmured your companion has not yet arrived mademoiselle let me escort you to your table with a few quick and ruthless adjustments andre shifted ryans reservation to suit his favorite customer moving the seating from a small central table in the main traffic pattern to natalies favorite quiet corner booth thank you andre already at home natalie settled into the booth with a little sigh beneath the table her feet slipped out of her shoes my pleasure as always would you care for a drink while you wait a glass of champagne thank you my usual of course right away and mademoiselle if i may be so presumptuous the lobster robert tonight it is he kissed his fingers ill keep that in mind while she waited natalie took out her date book and began to make notations on her schedule for the next day she had nearly finished her champagne when ry walked up to the table she didnt bother to glance up its a good thing im not a fire im never late for a fire he took his seat and they spent a moment measuring each other so he owned a suit natalie thought and he looked good in it dark jacket crisp white shirt subtle gray tie even though his hair wasnt quite tamed it was definitely a more classic look than shed expected from him i use it for funerals ry said reading her perfectly she only lifted a brow well that certainly sets the tone for the evening doesnt it you picked the spot he reminded her he glanced around the restaurant quiet class he mused just a tad ornate and stuffyexactly what hed expected so hows the food here its excellent mademoiselle fletcher robert himself small plump and tuxedoed stopped by the table to kiss natalies hand bienvenue he began ry sat back took out a cigarette and watched as they rattled away in french she spoke it like a native that too hed expected du champagne pour mademoiselle robert told the waiter et pour vous monsieur beer ry said american if youve got it bien sur robert strutted back to the kitchen to harass his chef well legs that should have made your point ry commented excuse me just how out of place will he be in a fancy french restaurant where the owner kisses your knuckles and asks after your family i dont know what youre natalie frowned as she picked up her glass how do you know he asked after my family i have a frenchcanadian grandmother i probably speak the lingo nearly as well as you do even if the accent isnt as classy he blew out a stream of smoke and smiled at her through it i didnt peg you as a snob natalie i certainly am not a snob insulted she set her glass down again her shoulders stiffening but when he only continued to smile a little frisson of guilt worked its way through her conscience maybe i wanted to make you a little uncomfortable she sighed gave up a lot uncomfortable you annoyed me i did better than that angling his head he gave her a long slow study she looked like something a man might beg for creamy skin flowing out of a black dress just a few sparkles here and there sleek golden hair curving around her face big sulky green eyes red mouth oh yes he decided a man would surely beg her nerves began to jangle as he continued to stare is there a problem no no problem did you wear that dress to make me uncomfortable yes he picked up his menu its working hows the steak here relax she ordered herself obviously he was trying to make her crazy you wont get better in the city though i generally prefer the seafood she pouted a bit as she studied her menu the evening was not going as shed planned not only had he seen through her but hed already turned the tables so that she looked and felt foolish try again she told herself and make the best of a bad deal after theyd given their orders natalie took a deep breath i suppose since were here we might as well have a truce were we fighting lets just try for a pleasant evening she picked up her champagne flute again sipped she was after all an expert in negotiations and diplomacy lets start with the obvious your name irish first eastern european last irish mother polish father and a frenchcanadian grandmother on my mothers side my other grandmothers a scot which makes you an allamerican boy youve got hightea hands he picked up her hand startling her by running his fingers down hers they go with your name uppercrust classy well after shed tugged her hand free she cleared her throat giving undue attention to buttering a roll you said you were thirdgeneration in the department do i make you nervous when i touch you yes lets try to keep this simple why since she had no ready answer for that she let out a little huff of relief when their appetizers were served you must have always wanted to be a fire fighter all right he decided they could cruise along at her speed for now sure i did i practically grew up at engine company where my pop worked i imagine there was some family pressure no how about you me the fletcher tradition big business corporate towers he lifted a brow family pressure plenty of it she said and smiled ruthless unbending determined and all from my corner her eyes glinted with amusement it had always been assumed that my brother boyd would take over the reins both he and i had different ideas about that so he strapped on a badge and a gun and i harassed my parents into accepting me as heir apparent they objected no not really it didnt take them long to realize i was serious and capable she took a last bite of her coquilles saintjacques and offered ry the rest i love business the wheeling the dealing the paperwork the meetings and this new company its all mine your catalogs a big hit down at the station the amusement settled in and felt comfortable oh really a lot of the men have wives or ladies im just helping you pick up a few orders thats generous of you she studied him over the rim of her glass what about you are you going to make any orders i dont have a wife or a lady those smoky eyes flicked over her face again at the moment but you did have a wife briefly sorry im prying no problem he shrugged and finished off his beer its old news nearly ten years old i guess you could say she fell for the uniform then decided she didnt like the hours i had to be in it children no he regretted that sometimes wondered if he always would we were only together a couple of years she hooked up with a plumber and moved to the suburbs he reached out skimmed a fingertip down the side of her neck along the curve of her shoulder im beginning to think i like your shoulders as much as your legs his eyes locked on hers maybe its the whole package thats a fascinating compliment she didnt give in to the urge to shift away but she did switch from champagne to water suddenly her mouth was dry as dust but dont you think the current circumstances require a certain professional detachment no if i thought you had anything to do with setting that fire maybe he liked the way her eyes lit and narrowed when he pushed the right button but as it stands i can do my job just fine and still wonder what it would be like to make love with you her pulse jolted scrambled she used the time while their entrees were served to steady it id prefer if youd concentrate on the first in fact if you could bring me uptodate seems a waste to talk shop in a joint like this but he shrugged his shoulders the bottom line is arson an incendiary fire the motive could be revenge money straight vandalism or malicious destruction or kicks a pyromaniac she preferred that one only because it was less personal how do you handle that first you dont go in biased a lot of times people and the media start shouting pyro whenever theres a series of fires even if they seem related its not always the case but it often is and its often simple somebody burns a dozen cars because hes ticked he bought a lemon so dont jump to conclusions exactly but if it is someone whos disturbed head doctors are always working on the whys are you going to let me taste that hmmm oh all right she nudged her plate closer to his so that he could sample her lobster do you work with psychiatrists mostly the shrinks dont come into it until youve got the firebug in custody thats good stuff he added nodding toward her plate anyway that could be after any number of fires months of investigation maybe they blame his mother she paid too much attention to him or his father because he didnt pay enough you know how it goes amused interested she cut off a piece of lobster and slipped it onto his plate you dont think much of psychiatry i didnt say that i just dont go in for blaming somebody else when you did the crime now you sound like my brother hes probably a good cop want some of this steak no thanks like a bulldog she kept her teeth in the topic wouldnt you as an investigator have to know something about the psychology of the fire starter ry chewed his steak signaled for another beer you really want to get into this its interesting particularly now okay short lesson you can divide pathological fire starters into four groups the mentally ill the psychotic the neurotic and the sociopath youre going to have some overlap most of the time but that sorts them the neurotic or psychoneurotic is the pyromaniac arent they all no the true pyros a lot rarer than most people think its an uncontrollable compulsion he has to set the fire when the urge hits him he goes with it wherever whenever hes not really thinking about covering up or getting away so hes usually easy to catch i thought pyro was more of a general term she started to tuck her hair behind her ear ry beat her to it letting his fingers linger for a moment i like to see your face when i talk to you he kept his hand on hers bringing them both back to the table i like to touch you when i talk to you silence hung for a full ten seconds youre not talking natalie pointed out sometimes i just like to look come here a minute she recognized the light in his eyes recognized her own helpless response to it and to him deliberately she eased away i dont think so youre a dangerous man inspector thanks why dont you come home with me natalie she let out a long quiet breath youre also a very blunt one a woman like you could get poetry and fancy moves any time she wanted ry neither had them nor believed in them you might want to try something more basic this is certainly basic she agreed i think we could use some coffee he signaled the waiter you didnt answer my question no i didnt and no she waited until the table was cleared the coffee order given despite a certain elemental attraction i think it would be unwise to pursue this any further were both committed to our careers diametrically opposed in personality and lifestyle even though our relationship has been brief and abrasive i think its clear we have nothing in common we are as we might say in my business a bad risk he said nothing for a minute only studied her as if considering that makes sense her stomach muscles relaxed she even smiled at him as she picked up her coffee good then were agreed i didnt say i agreed he pointed out i said it made sense he lit a cigarette his eyes on hers over the flame ive been thinking about you natalie and ive got to tell you i dont much like the way you make me feel its distracting annoying and inconvenient her chin angled im so glad we cleared this up she said coolly god knows it gets me right in the gut when you talk to me like that duchess to serf he shook his head drew in smoke i must be perverse anyway i dont like it im not altogether sure i like you his eyes narrowed the light in them stopping the pithy comment before it could slip through her lips but ive never wanted anyone so damn much in my whole life thats a problem your problem she managed our problem ive got a rep for being tenacious she set her cup down carefully before it could slip from her limp fingers id think a simple no would do ry so would i he shrugged go figure i havent been able to clear you out of my head since i saw you standing there freezing at the fire scene i made a mistake when i kissed you this afternoon i figured once i had that would be it case closed he moved quickly and so smoothly she barely had time to blink before his mouth was hot and hard on hers dazed she lifted a hand to his shoulder but her fingers only dug in held on as she was buffeted with fresh excitement i was wrong he drew back case isnt closed and thats our problem yeah she let out a shaky breath no amount of common sense could outweigh her instant and primitive response to him he touched she wanted it was as simple and as terrifying as that but common sense was her only defense this isnt going to work its ridiculous to think that it could im not prepared to jump into an affair simply because of some basic animal lust see we do have something in common despite the fact that the kiss had stirred him to aching he smiled at her the lust part laughing she dragged her hair back from her face oh i need to get away from you for a while and consider the options this isnt a business deal ms fletcher she looked at him again and wished she could have some distance just a little distance so that she could think clearly i never make a decision without considering the bottom line profit and loss wary she inclined her head in a manner of speaking you could call it risk and reward intimate relationships havent been my strong suit thats been my choice if im going to have one with you however brief that will be my choice as well thats fair do you want me to work up a prospectus dont be snide ry then because it soothed some of the tension to realize shed annoyed him she smiled but id certainly give it my full attention playing it up she cupped her chin on her hands leaning closer skimming her gaze over his face you are very attractive in a roughedged notquitetamed sort of way he shifted drew hard on his cigarette thanks a lot no really so she thought he could be embarrassed the faint cleft in the chin the sharp cheekbones the lean face the dark sexy eyes her lips curved as he narrowed those eyes and all that hair just a little unruly the tough body the tough attitude impatient he crushed out his cigarette what are you pulling here natalie just giving you back a little of your own yes youre a very attractive package wasnt that your word dangerous dynamic like nemesis now he winced give me a break her chuckle was warm and deep no really theres a lot of similarity between you and urbanas mysterious upholder of justice you both appear to have your own agenda and your own roughedged style he fights crime appearing and disappearing like smoke an interesting connection between the two of you i might even wonder if you could be himexcept that hes a very romantic figure and there inspector you part company she tossed back her hair and laughed i believe youre speechless who would have thought it would be that easy to score a point off you she might have scored one but the game wasnt over he caught her chin in his hand held it steady and close even as her eyes continued to dance i guess i could handle it if you wanted to treat me hike an object just promise to respect me in the morning nope youre a hard woman ms fletcher okay scratch respect how about awe ill consider it if and when it becomes applicable now why dont we get the check its late when the check was served as it always was in such establishments with a faint air of apology natalie reached for it automatically ry pushed her hand aside and picked it up himself ry i didnt mean for you to pay the tab flustered she watched him pull out a credit card she knew exactly what a meal cost at chez robert and had a good idea what salary a city employee pulled down really it was my idea to come here shut up natalie he figured the tip signed the stub now i feel guilty damn it we both know i picked this place to rub your nose in it at least let me split it he pocketed his wallet no he slid out of the booth offered his hand dont worry he said dryly i can still make the rent this month probably youre just being stubborn she muttered wheres the ticket for your coat male ego she thought on a disgusted sigh as she took the ticket from her purse she exchanged goodnights with andre and robert before ry helped her into her coat do you need a lift ry asked her no i have my car good i dont have mine you can give me a ride home she shot a suspicious look over her shoulder as they stepped outside if this is some sort of maneuver ill tell you right now im not falling for it fine i can take a cab he scanned the street if i can find one its a cold night he added feels like snow on the way her breath streamed out my cars in the lot around the corner where am i taking you twentysecond between seventh and eighth terrific it was about as far out of her way as possible i have to make a stop first at the store what store he slipped an arm around her waist as much for pleasure as to protect her from the cold my store we had the carpets laid today and i didnt have time to check it before dinner since its halfway between your place and mine i might as well do it now i didnt think business execs checked on carpet at nearly midnight this one does she smiled sweetly but if its inconvenient for you id be happy to drop you off at the bus stop thanks anyway he waited while she unlocked her car do you have any stock in that place yet about twenty percent of what we want for the grand opening youre welcome to browse he slid into the car i was hoping youd say that she drove well that was no surprise from what ry had observed natalie fletcher did everything with seamless competence the fact that she could be shaken the fact that the right word the right look at the right time could bring a faint bloom to her cheeks made her human and outrageously appealing have you always lived in urbana as she asked she automatically turned down the radio yeah i like it so do i she liked the movement of the city the noise the crowds weve had holdings here for years of course but i never lived in urbana where colorado springs mostly thats where were based home and business i like the east the streets were dark now and the wind was whipping through the canyons formed by the spearing buildings i like eastern cities the way people live on top of each other and rush to get everywhere no western comments about overcrowding and crime rates fletcher industries was founded on real estate remember the more people the more housing required and as to crime she shrugged we have a hardworking police force and nemesis youre interested in him who wouldnt be of course as the sister of a police captain i should add that i dont approve of private citizens doing police work why not he seems to get the job done i wouldnt mind having him on my side he frowned as she stopped at a light the streets were nearly empty here with dark pockets and narrow alleys do you do many runs like this alone when necessary why dont you have a driver because i like to drive myself she shot him a look just as the light turned green youre not going to be typical and give me a lecture about the dangers facing a woman alone in the city its not all museums and french restaurants ry im a big girl ive spent time alone in paris bangkok london and bonn among other cities i think i can handle urbana the cops and your pal nemesis cant be everywhere he pointed out any woman who has a big brother knows just how to drop a man to his knees she said blithely and ive taken a selfdefense course that should make every mugger in the city tremble ignoring the sarcasm she pulled up to the curb and turned off the engine this is it the quick surge of pride rose the moment she was out of the car and facing the building her building so what do you think it was sleek and feminine like its owner all marble and glass and its wide display window was scrolled with the ladys choice logo in gold leaf the entrance door was beveled glass etched with rosettes that glinted in the backwash from the streetlights pretty he thought impractical expensive nice look as our flagship store i wanted it to be impressive classic and she ran her fingertip over the etching subtly erotic she dealt with the locks sturdy ry noted with some approval solid just inside the door she paused to enter her code on the computerized security system natalie turned on the lights relocked the front door perfect she nodded with approval at the mauve carpet the walls were teal freshly painted a curvy love seat and gleaming tea table were set in a corner to invite customers to relax and decide over merchandise racks were recessed natalie could already envision them full dripping with silks and laces in pastels bold vibrant colors and creamy whites most of the stock hasnt been put out yet my manager and her staff will see to that this week and the window treatment we have the most incredible brocade peignoir thatll be the focus ry moved over to a faceless mannequin fingered the lace at the leg of a jade teddy the same color as natalies eyes he thought so what do you charge for something like this mmm she examined the piece herself silk seed pearls at the bodice probably about onefifty one hundred and fifty dollars he shook his head in disgust one good tug and its a rag instantly she bristled our merchandise is topquality it will certainly hold up to normal wear honey a little number like this isnt designed for normal he cocked a brow looks about your size you keep dreaming piasecki she tossed her coat over the love seat the point of good lingerie is style texture the sheen of silk the foam of lace ours is designed to make a woman feel attractive and good about herselfpampered i thought the idea was to make a man beg that couldnt hurt she tossed back look around if you like im going to run upstairs and check a couple of invoices while im here it wont take me more than five minutes ill come with you offices upstairs he asked as they started toward a white floating staircase just the managers well have more merchandise up there and changing rooms weve also set up a separate area for brides specialized weddingdress undergarments honeymoon lingerie once were fully operational she broke off when he grabbed her arm quiet what quiet he said again he didnt hear it not yet but he could smell it just the faintest sting in the air do you have extinguishers in here of course in the storeroom up in the office she tugged at his hand what is this are you going to try to cite me for firecode violations get outside with her gaping after him he darted toward the back of the store she was organized he had to admit he found the fire extinguisher up to code in full view in the crowded storeroom what are you doing with that she demanded when he came back i said get outside youve got a fire a he was halfway up the steps before she unfroze and raced after him thats impossible how do you know theres nothing gas he snapped out smoke she started to tell him he was imagining things but she smelled it now ry he cursed and kicked aside a streamer of papers and matches it hadnt caught yet but he saw where they were leading the glossy white door was closed and smoke was creeping sulkily under it he felt the door and the heat pushing against it his head whipped toward hers the eyes cold get out he said again call it in a scream strangled in her throat as he kicked the door open fire leapt out ry walked into it chapter contents prev next it was like a dream a nightmare standing there frozen while flame licked at the door frame and ry stepped in to meet it in the instant he disappeared into smoke and fire her heart seemed to stop its beat simply ceasing then the panic that had halted it whipped it to racing her head buzzed with the echo of a hundred pulses as she dashed to the door after him she could see him smothering the fire that sprinted across the floor and ate merrily at the base of the walls smoke billowed around him seared her eyes burned her lungs like some warrior he challenged it fought it down in horror she saw it strike back and lick slyly at his arm now she did scream leaping in to pound at the smoke that puffed from his back he whirled to face her furious to find her there youre on fire she barely choked the words out for gods sake ry let it go stay back with an arching movement he smothered the flames that had begun to lap at the central desk the paperwork left on its top he knew would feed the fire focused he turned to attack the smoldering baseboard the intricately carved trim that was flaming take this he shoved the extinguisher into her hands the main fire was out and the smaller ones were all but smothered he nearly had it from the terror in her eyes he could see that she didnt realize the beast was nearly beaten use it he ordered and in one stride he had reached the flaming curtains and torn them down there would be pain laterhe knew that as well but now he fought the fire hand to hand once the smoldering smokestained lace was nothing more than harmless rags he snatched the extinguisher out of her numbed hands and killed what was left it didnt have much of a start but his jacket was still smoking he yanked it off tossed it aside wouldnt have gotten this far this fast if there werent so many flammables in here he set the nearly empty extinguisher aside its out still he checked the room kicking through the ruined drapes searching for any cagey spark that waited to burn clean again its out he repeated and shoved her toward the door get downstairs she stumbled almost falling to her knees a violent fit of coughing nearly paralyzed her her stomach heaved her head spun near fainting she braced a hand against the wall and fought to breathe damn it natalie in one sweep he had her up in his arms he carried her through the blinding smoke down the elegant staircase i told you to get out dont you ever listen she tried to speak and only coughed weakly it felt as though she were floating even when he laid her against the cool cushions of the love seat her head continued to reel he was cursing her but his voice seemed far away and harmless if she could just get one breath she thought one full breath to soothe her burning throat he watched her eyes roll back jerking her ruthlessly he pushed her head between her knees dont you faint on me his voice was curt his hand on the back of her head firm stay here breathe slow you hear me she nodded weakly he left her and when cold fresh air slapped her cheeks she shivered after propping the outside door open ry came back rubbing his hands up and down her spine shed scared him badly so he did what came naturally to combat the fearhe yelled at her that was stupid and thoughtless youre lucky to get out of there with a sick stomach and some smoke inhalation i told you to get out you went in she winced as the words tormented her abused throat you went right in im trained youre not he hauled her back into a sitting position to check her over her face was dead white under sooty smears but her eyes were clear again nausea he asked in clipped tones no she pressed the heels of her hands to her stinging eyes not now dizzy no her voice was hoarse strained he imagined her throat felt as though it had been scored with a hot poker is there any water around here ill get you some im all right she dropped her hands let her head fall back against the cushion now that the sickness was passing fear was creeping in it seemed so fast so horribly fast are you sure its out its my job to be sure frowning he caught her chin his eyes narrowing as he studied her face im taking you to the hospital i dont need a damn hospital in a badtempered movement she shoved at him then gasped when she saw his hands ry your hands she grabbed his wrists youre burned he glanced down there were a few welts some reddening nothing major reaction set in with shudders you were on fire i saw your jacket catch fire it was an old jacket stop he ordered when tears swam in her eyes overflowed dont if he hated one thing more than fire it was a womans tears he swore and crushed his mouth to hers hoping that would stop the flood her arms came hard around him surprising him with their strength and urgency but her mouth trembled beneath his moving him to gentle the kiss to soothe better he murmured and stroked her hair im all right she said again willing herself to believe it there should be a firstaid kit in the storeroom you need to put something on your hands its no big deal he began but she shoved away from him and rose i have to do something damn it i have to do something she dashed off baffled by her ry stood and moved to relock the door he needed to go up again and ventilate the office but he wanted her out of the way before he made a preliminary investigation he tugged off his tie loosened his collar theres some salve in here steadier now natalie came back in with a small firstaid kit fine deciding tending to him would do her some good he sat back and let her play nurse he had to admit the cool balm and her gentle fingers didnt do him any harm either youre lucky it isnt worse it was insane just walking into that room he cocked a brow youre welcome she looked up at him then his face was smeared from the smoke his eyes were reddened from it i am grateful she said quietly very grateful but it was just things ry just things she looked away again busying herself replacing the tube of salve i guess i owe you a new suit i hate suits he shifted uncomfortably when he heard her quick unsteady sob dont cry again if you really want to thank me dont cry all right she sniffed inelegantly and rubbed her hands over her face i was so scared its over he gave her hand an awkward pat will you be all right for a minute i want to go up and open the window the smoke needs a way to escape ill come no you wont sit here he rose again put a firm hand on her shoulder please stay here he turned and left her natalie used the time he was gone to compose herself and to think when he came back down she was sitting with her hands folded in her lap it was the same as the warehouse wasnt it she lifted her gaze to his the way it was set we cant pretend it was a coincidence yes he said it was the same and no we cant well talk about this later ill drive you home im the words slid back down her throat when he dragged her roughly to her feet if you tell me one more time that youre all right im going to punch you youre sick youre scared and you sucked in smoke now this is the way were going to work this im driving you home well report this on the phone in that snazzy car of yours youre going to go to bed and tomorrow youre going to see a doctor once you check out well go from there stop yelling at me i wouldnt have to yell if youd listen he grabbed her coat put this on this is my property i have a right to be here well im taking you out he shoved her arm into the sleeve of her coat if you dont like it call your fancy lawyers and sue me theres no reason for you to take this attitude he started to swear stopped himself as a precaution he took one slow breath natalie im tired his voice was quiet now nearly reasonable ive got a job to do here and i cant do it if youre in my way so cooperate please he was right she knew he was right she turned away picked up her purse keep my car ill arrange to have it picked up tomorrow i appreciate it she gave him the car keys and the keys to the shop ill be here tomorrow ry i figured you would he lifted a hand and rubbed his knuckles along her jawline heytry not to worry im the best she nearly smiled so ive been told it was nearly eight the following morning when the cab dropped natalie off in front of ladys choice she noted without surprise that her car was out front a firedepartment sign visible through the windshield instead of bothering with the buzzer she used the spare set of keys shed picked up that morning at the office and let herself in she couldnt smell the smoke that was a relief shed spent a great deal of time during the night worrying and calculating the possible losses if the stock already in place had been damaged by smoke the first floor looked as pristine and elegant as it had the night before if ry gave her the goahead shed contact her manager and reestablish business as usual she took off her coat and gloves and started upstairs for ry it had been a long and productive night hed stopped in at the station after he dropped natalie off to change and to pick up his tools hed worked alone through the nightthe way he preferred it he was just sealing an evidence jar when she walked in good morning legs crouched on the floor amid the rubble he didnt bother to look past them she scanned the room sighed the carpet was a blackened mess charred pieces of wood trim had been pried from the sooty walls and lay scattered the elegant queen anne desk was blackened and scored and the irishlace drapes were a heap of useless rags despite the open window where the light wind shook in thin snow the air stank with stale smoke why does it always look worse the next day its not so bad a little paint new trim she ran a fingertip over the wallpaper the violetandrosebud pattern shed chosen personally ruined now she thought easy for you to say yeah he agreed labeling the evidence jar i guess it is he glanced up then today shed scooped her hair up the style appealed to him the way it showed off the line of her neck and jaw this mornings suit was royal purple military in style it looked he thought as though the lady were ready for a fight howd you sleep surprisingly well all in all except for one bonechilling nightmare she didnt want to mention you he hadnt been to bed at all and merely shrugged have you called your adjuster i will as soon as his office opens her voice cooled automatically are you going to interview me again inspector annoyance flared briefly in his eyes i dont think thats necessary do you he began to replace his tools in their box ill have a report by tomorrow she closed her eyes a moment im sorry im not angry with you ry im just angry fair enough can you she broke off turning quickly at the sound of footsteps on the stairs gage she forced a smile held out her hands when he walked in i heard with one quick glance he took in the damage i thought id come by and see if there was anything i could do thanks she kissed him lightly on the cheek before she turned back to ry he was still crouchedvery much she thought intrigued like an animal about to spring gage guthrie inspector ryan piasecki ive heard you do good work after a moment ry straightened and accepted the hand gage offered ive heard the same about you feeling territorial ry measured the man as he spoke to natalie are you two pals thats right and a bit more she watched fascinated as rys eyes kindled if you can follow the connections gage is married to my brothers wifes sister the fire banked rys shoulders relaxed extended family in a manner of speaking judging the situation quickly and accurately gage decided to do a little checking on the inspector himself are you looking at the same fire starter here were not ready to release that information hes got his official hat on natalie said dryly unofficially she continued ignoring rys scowl it looks the same when we came in last night you were here gage interrupted her gripping natalies arm you i had a few things i wanted to check on fortunately blowing out a breath she took another scan of the room it could have been a lot worse i happened to have a veteran fire fighter along gage relaxed fractionally youve got no business going around the city alone at night yeah ry took out a cigarette you try to tell her natalie merely lifted a brow do you go around the city gage alone at night he tucked his tongue in his cheek if she only knew its entirely different and dont give me a lecture on equality he went on before she could speak im all for it in the home in the workplace but on the street it comes down to basic common sense a womans more of a target mmm hmmm natalie smiled pleasantly and does deborah buy that line from you now his lips did curve no shes every bit as hardheaded as you frustrated that hed been on the other side of town when nat needed him gage tucked his hands in his pockets if i cant do anything else i can offer you any of the facilities or staff of guthrie international ill take you up on that if it becomes necessary she sent him a quick hopeful look i dont suppose you could use your influence to keep your wife from calling my brother and cilia and relating all of this he patted her cheek not a chance maybe i should mention that she talked to althea last week and filled her in on what happened at the warehouse giving in to fatigue natalie rubbed her temples althea grayson her brothers former partner on the force was very pregnant im surrounded by cops she muttered theres no reason to get althea upset in her condition she and colt should be concentrating on each other its a problem when you have so many people who care about you stay out of empty buildings gage added and kissed her nice to meet you inspector yeah see you give deborah and addy my love natalie said as she walked gage to the doorway and stop worrying about me ill do the first but not the second whos addy ry asked before he heard the downstairs door close behind gage hmmm oh their baby distracted she circled around a charred hole in the carpet to examine her antique filing cabinets it was some consolation to see that they were undamaged i really need to clear this up ry too many people are losing sleep youve got a lot of close ties he walked to the open window and put out his cigarette i cant make this work any faster to please them just take your friends advice stay off the streets at night and out of empty buildings i dont want advice i want answers someone broke in here last night and tried to burn me out how and why okay ms fletcher i can give you the how ry leaned a hip against the partially burned desk on the night of february twentysixth a fire was discovered by inspector piasecki and natalie fletcher owner of the building ry he held up a hand to stop her after entering the building piasecki and fletcher started up to the second floor when piasecki detected the odor of an accelerant and smoke piasecki then ordered fletcher to flee the building an order i might add that she stupidly ignored finding an extinguisher in the storeroom piasecki proceeded to the fire which had involved an office on the second floor streamers of paper clothing and matchbooks were observed the fire was extinguished without extensive damage im very aware of that particular sequence of events you wanted a report youre getting one an examination of the debris led the investigator to believe that the fire had been started approximately two feet inside the door with the use of gasoline as an accelerant no forced entry into the building could be determined by the inspector or the police department arson is indicated she took a careful breath youre angry with me yeah im angry with you youre pushing me natalie and yourself you want this all tidied up because people are worried about you and youre concerned with selling your pantyhose on time and youre missing one small very important detail no im not she was pale again and rigid im trying not to be frightened by it it isnt difficult to add the elements and come up with the fact that someone is doing this to me deliberately two of my buildings within two weeks im not a fool ry youre a fool if youre not frightened by it youve got an enemy who i dont know she shot back if i did dont you think id tell you youve just told me there was no forced entry that means someone i know someone who works for me could have gotten in here and started the fire its a torch excuse me a pro ry explained not a very good one but a pro somebody hired a torch to set the fires it could be that somebody let him in or he found a way to bypass your security but he didnt finish the job here so its likely hell hit you again she forced back a shudder thats comforting thats very comforting i dont want you to be comforted i want you to be alert how many people work for you at ladys choice frazzled she pushed at her hair around six hundred i think in urbana you got a personnel list i can get one i want it look im going to run the data through the computer see how many known pros we have in the area who use this technique its a start youll keep me uptodate ill be in the office most of the day my assistant will know how to reach me if im out he straightened walked to her and cupped her face why dont you take the day off go shopping go see a movie are you joking he dropped his hands shoved them in his pockets listen natalie youve got one more person worried about you okay i think its okay she said slowly ill stay available ry but i have a lot of work to do she smiled in an attempt to lighten the mood starting with getting a cleaning crew and decorators in here not until i tell you how did i know youd say that resigned she glanced toward the wooden cabinets against the left wall is it all right if i get some files out i only moved them out of the main office a few days ago so i could work on them here she lifted a shoulder or id hoped to work on them here more delays she said under her breath yeah go ahead watch your step he watched it as well and shook his head he didnt see how she could walk so smoothly on those skyscraper heels she seemed addicted to but he had to admit they did fascinating things to her legs how are your hands she asked as she flipped through the files what your hands she glanced back saw where his gaze was focused and laughed god piasecki youre obsessed i bet they go all the way up to your shoulders he skimmed his eyes up to hers the hands arent too bad thanks whens your doctors appointment she turned away to give unmerited attention to the files i dont need a doctor i dont like doctors chicken maybe my throats a little sore thats all i can deal with that without a doctor poking at me and if youre going to lecture me on that ill lecture you on deliberately sucking smoke into your lungs with a wince he tucked away the cigarette hed just pulled out i didnt say anything are you about done i want to get this evidence to the lab yes the fact that the files didnt go up saves me a lot of time and trouble i need deirdre to run an audit after weve dealt with this other mess im hoping things look solid enough for me to scout around and open a branch in denver the little flutter under his heart wasnt easily ignored denver are you going to be moving back to colorado hmmm satisfied she tucked the paperwork in her briefcase it depends im not thinking that far ahead yet first we have to get the stores we have off the ground that isnt going to happen overnight she swung the strap of her briefcase over her shoulder that should do it i want to see you it cost him to say it even more to admit it to himself i need to see you natalie away from all this her suddenly nervous fingers tugged at the strap of her briefcase were both pretty swamped at the moment ry it might be smarter for us to concentrate on what needs to be done and keep a little personal distance it would be smarter well then she took one step toward the door before he blocked her path i want to see you he repeated and i want to touch you and i want to take you to bed heat curled inside her threatening to flash it didnt seem to matter that his words were rough blunt and without finesse poetry and rose petals would have left her much less vulnerable i know what you want i need to be sure what i want what i can handle ive always been a logical person youve got a way of clouding that tonight i have to work late she felt herself weakening yearning a dinner meeting ill wait i dont know when ill be finished probably not much before midnight he backed her toward the wall midnight then she began to wonder why she was resisting her eyes started to cloud and close midnight she repeated waiting for his mouth to cover hers wanting to taste it to surge under it her eyes sprang open she jerked back oh god midnight her cheeks had gone white again ry lifted his hands to support her what is it midnight she repeated pressing a hand to her brow i didnt put it together never thought of it it was just past twelve when we got here last night he nodded watching her so i got a call when i was dressing for dinner i never seem to be able to ignore the ring and let the machine pick up so i answered he said midnight eyes narrowed ry braced her against the wall who i dont know i didnt recognize the voice he saidlet me think she pushed away to pace out into the hall midnight he said midnight the witching hour watch for it or wait for itsomething like that she gestured toward the charred and ruined carpet this must be what he meant why the hell didnt you tell me this before because i just remembered every bit as angry as he she whirled on ry i thought it was a crank call so i ignored it forgot it then when this happened i had a little more on my mind than a nuisance call how was i supposed to know it was a warning or a threat he ignored that and took his notebook out of his pocket to write down the words shed related what time did you get the call it must have been around seventhirty i was looking for earrings and rushing because id gotten held up and was running late did you hear any background noises on the line unsure she fought to remember she hadnt been paying attention shed been thinking of ry i didnt notice any his voice was highpitched it was a man im sure of that but it was a girlish kind of voice he giggled she remembered rys gaze shot to her face then back to his book did it sound mechanical or genuine she went blank for a moment oh you mean like a tape no it didnt sound like a tape is your number listed no then she understood the significance of the question no she repeated slowly its not i want a list of everyone who has your home number everyone she straightened forcing herself to keep calm i can give you a list of everyone i know who has it i cant tell you who might have gotten it by other means she cleared her aching throat ry do professionals usually call their victims before a fire he tucked his notebook away and looked into her eyes even pros can be crazy ill drive you to your office its not necessary patience he reminded himself hed worked overtime so that he could be patient with her then he thought the hell with it you listen to this real careful he curled his fingers around the lapel of her jacket im driving you to your office got that i dont see he tugged got it she bit back an oath it would be petty to argue fine im going to need my car later today so youll have to get yourself wherever youre going after you drop me off keep listening he said evenly until i get back to you youre not to go anywhere alone thats ridiculous ive got a business to run nowhere alone he repeated otherwise im going to call some of my pals in urbana pd and have them sit on you when she opened her mouth to protest he overrode her and i can sure as hell keep your little shop here offlimits to everyone but official fire and policedepartment personnel until further notice that sounds like a threat she said stiffly youre a real sharp lady you get one of your minions to drive you today natalie or ill slap a firedepartment restriction on the front door of this place for the next couple of weeks he could she realized reading the determination on his face and he would from experience she knew it was smarter and more practical to give up a small point in a negotiation in order to salvage the bottom line all right ill assign a driver for any outoftheoffice meetings today but id like to point out that this man is burning my buildings ry not threatening me personally he called you personally thats enough she hated the fact that hed frightened her stringent control kept her dealing with office details coolly efficiently by noon she had a cleanup crew on standby waiting for rys okay shed ordered her assistant to contact the decorator about new carpet wallpaper draperies and paint shed dealt with a frantic call from her atlanta branch and an irate one from chicago and managed to play down the problem with her family back in colorado impatient she buzzed her assistant maureen i needed those printouts thirty minutes ago yes ms fletcher the systems down in accounting theyre working on it tell them she bit back the searing words and forced her voice to level tell them its a priority thank you maureen deliberately she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes having an edge was an advantage in business she reminded herself being edgy was a liability if she was going to handle the meetings set for the rest of the day she had to pull herself together slowly she unfisted her hands and ordered her muscles to relax shed nearly accomplished it when a quick knock came at her door she straightened in her chair as melvin poked his head in safe nearly she told him come in i come bearing gifts he carried a tray into the room if thats coffee i may find the energy to get up and kiss your whole face he flushed brightly and chuckled not only is it coffee but theres chicken salad to go with it even you have to eat natalie tell me about it she pressed a hand to her stomach as she rose to join him at the sofa im empty this is very sweet of you melvin and selfserving youve been burning up the interoffice lines so i had my secretary put this together you take a break he fiddled with his bright red bow tie we take a break i guess i have been playing simon legree today with a little sigh natalie inhaled the scent of coffee as she poured youre entitled he sat beside her have you got time over lunch to tell me how bad things are over at the flagship not as bad as they could have been she indulged herself by slipping out of her shoes and tucking her legs up as she ate minor really from what i could tell it looked like mostly cosmetic damage to the managers office it didnt get to the stock thank god he said heartily i dont know how much my charm would have worked a second time in persuading the branches to part with inventory unnecessary she said between bites we got lucky this time melvin but but theres a pattern here that concerns me someone doesnt want ladys choice to fly frowning he picked up the roll on her plate broke it in half unforgettable womans our top competitor or well be theirs ive thought of that it just doesnt fit that companys been around nearly fifty years its solid respectable she sighed hating what she needed to say but i am worried about corporate espionage melvin within ladys choice one of our people hed lost the taste for the roll it isnt a possibility i likeor one i can overlook thoughtful she switched from food to coffee i could call a meeting of department heads get input and opinions about their people and she would she thought she would have to but that doesnt deal with the department heads themselves a lot of your top people have been with fletcher for years natalie im aware of that restless she rose drinking coffee as she paced i cant think of any reason why someone in the organization would want to delay the opening but i have to look for that reason that puts us all under the gun she turned back im sorry melvin it does no need to be sorry its business he waved it aside but his smile was a little strained as he rose whats the next step im going to meet the adjuster at the shop at one she glanced at her watch and swore id better get started let me do it anticipating her melvin held up a hand you have more than you can handle right here delegate natalie remember ill meet the agent give you a full report when i get back all right it would save me a very frenzied hour frowning she stepped back into her shoes if the arson inspector is onsite you might ask him to contact me with any progress will do theres a shipment due in to the shop late this afternoon do you want to put a hold on it no shed already thought it through business as usual ive put a security guard on the building it wont be easy for anyone to get in again well stay on schedule melvin assured her damn right we will chapter contents prev next ry preferred good solid human reasoning to computer analysis but hed learned to use all available tools the arson pattern recognition system was one of the best over the past few years hed become adept enough at the keyboard now with his secretary long gone for the day and the men downstairs settled into sleep he worked alone the aprs used intelligently was an effective tool for identifying and classifying trends in data it was possible with a series of fires suspected to be related to use the tool to predict where and when future arsons in the series were most likely to occur the computer told him what hed already deduced natalies production plant was a prime target hed already assigned a team to patrol and survey the area but he was more concerned about natalie herself the phone call shed received made it personal and it had given him a very specific clue reaching for coffee with one hand ry tapped on keys and linked up with the national fire data system he plugged in his patternincident information geographical locations and fire data the process would not only help him but serve to aid future investigators then he worked on suspects again he input the fire data the method to these he was able to add the phone call natalies impression of the voice and the wording he sat back and watched the computer reinforce his own conclusions clarence robert jacoby aka jacoby aka clarence roberts last known address south street urbana white male dob it went on to list half a dozen arrests for arson and incendiary fires all urban one conviction had put him away for five years another arrest two years ago was still pending as hed skipped out on bail and the pattern was there jacoby was a parttime pro who liked to burn things he habitually preferred gasoline as an accelerant used streamers of convenient onsite flammables along with matchbooks from his own collection he often called his victims his psychiatric evaluation classified him as a neurotic with sociopathic tendencies you like fire dont you you little bastard ry muttered tapping his finger against the keyboard you dont even mind when it burns you isnt that what you told me its like a kiss ry flipped a switch and had the data printing out wearily he rubbed the heels of his hands over his eyes as the machine clattered hed caught about two hours sleep on the sofa in the outer office that evening fatigue was catching up with him but he had his quarry now he was sure of it and he thought he had a trail more out of habit than desire ry lit a cigarette before punching in numbers on the phone piasecki im swinging by the fletcher plant on my way home you can reach me he trailed off checking his watch midnight he noted on the dot maybe he should take that as a sign you can reach me at this number until i check in again he recited natalies home number from memory then hung up he shut down the computer grabbed the printout and his jacket then hit the lights natalie pulled on a robe one of her favorites from the ladys choice line and debated whether to crawl into bed or sink into a hot bath she decided to soothe her nerves with a glass of wine before she did either shed tried to reach ry three times that afternoon only to be told he was unavailable she was supposed to be available she thought nastily but he could come and go as he pleased not a word all day well he was going to get a surprise first thing in the morning when she walked right into his office and demanded a progress report as if she didnt have enough to worry about with department meetings production meetings meeting meetings and she was tracking the early catalog orders by region at least that looked promising she thought and walked over to enjoy her view of the city she wasnt going to let anything stand in her way not fires and certainly not a fire inspector if there was someone on her staffin any positionwho was responsible for the arson she would find out who it was and she would deal with it within a year she would have pushed ladys choice over the top within five she would double the number of branches fletcher industries would have a new success one she would have nurtured from inception she could be proud and satisfied so why was she suddenly so lonely his fault she decided sipping her wine for making her restless with her life for making her question her priorities at a time when she needed all her concentration and effort focused physical attraction even with this kind of intensity wasnt enough shouldnt be enough to distract her from her goals shed been attracted before and certainly knew how to play the game safely after all she was thirtytwo hardly a novice in the relationship arena skilled and cautious shed always come through unscathed no man had ever involved her heart quite enough to cause scarring why did that suddenly seem so sad annoyed with the thought she shook it off she was wasting her time brooding about ryan piasecki god knew he wasnt even her type he was rough and rude and undeniably abrasive she preferred a smoother sort a safer sort why did that suddenly seem so shallow she set her halffull glass aside and shook back her hair what she needed was sleep not selfanalysis the phone rang just as she reached out to switch off the lights oh i hate you she muttered and picked up the receiver hello ms fletcher this is mark at the desk downstairs yes mark what is it theres an inspector piasecki here to see you oh really she checked her watch toying with the idea of sending him away mark would you ask him if its official business yes maam is this official business inspector she heard rys voice clearly through the earpiece asking mark whether he would like him to get a team down there in the next twenty minutes to look for code violations when mark sputtered natalie took pity on him just send him up mark yes ms fletcher thank you she disconnected then paced to the door and back she certainly wasnt going to check her appearance in the mirror of course she did by the time ry pounded on her door shed managed to dash into the bedroom brush her hair and dab on some perfume dont you think its unfair to threaten people in order to get your way she demanded when she yanked open the door not when it works he took his time looking at her the floorlength robe was unadorned the color of heavy cream the silk crossed over her breasts nipped in at the belted waist then fell thin and close down her hips dont you think its a waste to wear something like that when youre alone no i dont are we going to talk in the hall i suppose not she closed the door behind him i wont bother to point out that its late he said nothing only wandered around the living area of the apartment soft colors offset by those vibrant abstract paintings she apparently liked lots of trinkets he noted but tidy there were fresh flowers a fireplace piped for gas and a wide window through which the lights of the city gleamed nice place i like it you like heights he moved to the window and looked down she was a good twenty floors above any possible ladder rescue maybe i will have this place checked to see if its up to code he glanced back at her got a beer no then she sighed manners would always rise above annoyance i was having a glass of wine would you like one he shrugged he wasnt much of a wine drinker but his system couldnt handle any more coffee taking that as an indication of assent natalie went into the kitchen to pour another glass got anything to go with it he asked from the doorway like food she started to snap at him about mistaking her apartment for an allnight diner but then she got a good look at his face in the strong kitchen light if shed ever seen exhaustion she was seeing it now i dont do a lot of cooking but i have some brie crackers some fruit nearly amused he rubbed his hands over his face brie he gave a short laugh as he dropped his hands great fine go sit down she handed him the wine ill bring it out thanks a few minutes later she found him on her sofa his legs stretched out his eyes halfclosed why arent you home in bed i had some stuff to do with one hand he reached for the tray shed set on the table with the other he reached for her content with her beside him he piled soft cheese on a cracker its not halfbad he said with his mouth full i missed dinner i suppose i could send out for something this is fine i figured youd want an update i do but i thought id hear from you several hours ago he mumbled something over a new cracker what court he said and swallowed i had to be in court most of the afternoon i see got your messages though the refueling helped and he grinned did you miss me the update she said dryly its the least you can do while youre cleaning out my pantry he helped himself to a handful of glossy green grapes ive ordered surveillance for your plant on winesap her ringers tightened on the stern of her glass do you think its a target fits the pattern have you noticed a man around any of your properties white guy about fivefour a hundred and thirty thinning sandy hair fortysomething but with this round moony face that makes him look like a kid he broke off to wash crackers down with wine pale mousylooking eyes lots of teeth no i cant think of anyone like that why hes a torch nasty little guy about halfcrazy the wine wasnt halfbad either ry was discovering and sipped again alltheway crazy would be easier he likes to make things burn and he doesnt mind getting paid for it you think hes the one natalie said quietly and you know him personally dont you weve met clarence and me last time i saw him was oh about ten years ago hed hung around too long on one of his jobs he was on fire when i got to him we were both smoking by the time i got him out natalie struggled for calm why do you think its him briefly ry gave her a rundown on his work that evening so its his kind of job he added plus the phone call he likes the phone too and the voice you describedthats pure clarence you could have told me that this morning couldve he shrugged didnt see the point the point she said between her teeth is that were talking about my building my property he studied her a moment it wasnt such a bad idea he supposed to use anger to cover fear he couldnt blame her for it tell me ms fletcher in your position as ceo or whatever it is you are do you make reports before during or after youve checked your data it irritated as hed meant it to and it deflated as hed meant it to all right she expelled a rush of air tell me the rest ry set his glass aside he moves around city to city im betting hes back in urbana and ill find him is there an ashtray around here in silence natalie rose and took a small mosaic dish from another table she was being unfair she realized and it wasnt like her obviously he was dead tired because hed put in dozens of extra hoursfor her youve been working on this all night he struck a match thats the job is it she asked quietly yeah his eyes met hers and its you her pulse began to drum she couldnt stop it youre making it very hard for me ry thats the idea lazily he skimmed a finger along the lapel of her robe barely brushing the skin her scent rose up from it subtly tantalizingly you want me to ask you how your day went no with a tired laugh she shook her head no i guess you dont want to talk about the weather politics sports natalie paused before she spoke again she didnt want her voice to sound breathy not particularly he grunted leaned over to crush out his cigarette i should go let you get some sleep her emotions tangled she rose as he did thats probably best sensible it wasnt what she wanted just what was best and it wasnt shed begun to realize what she needed just what was sensible but im not going to his eyes locked on hers unless you tell me her heartbeat thickened she could feel the shudder start all the way down in the soles of her feet and work its way up tell you what he smiled moved closer stopping just before their bodies brushed the first answer whether she wanted him to go or stay was already easily read in her eyes wheres the bedroom natalie a little dazed she looked over his shoulder gesturing vaguely there back there with that quick surprising grace of his he scooped her up i think i can make it that far this is a mistake she was already raining kisses over his face his throat i know its a mistake everybody makes one now and again im smart while her breath hitched her fingers hurried to unbutton his shirt and im levelheaded i have to be because she let out a groan as her fingers found flesh god i love your body yeah he nearly staggered as she tugged his shirt out of his jeans consider it all yours i should have known mmm she was busy biting at his shoulder what that youd have a firstclass bed he tumbled with her onto the satin covers already halfmad for him she dragged at his shirt hurry she demanded ive wanted you to hurry since the first time you touched me let me catch up equally frantic he crushed his mouth to hers sinking in breathless she yanked at the snap of his jeans this is insane she struggled to find him drinking hungrily from his mouth as they rolled across the bed he couldnt catch his breath or even a slippery hold on control its about to be he muttered tugging her robe open he found the thin swatch of matching silk beneath a moan ripped through him as he closed his mouth over her creamcovered breast silk and heat and fragrant flesh everything she was filled him taunted him tormented him woman all woman beauty and grace and passion temptation and torment and triumph all of it all of her obsessed him they thrashed over the slick satin spread groping for more here was fire the bright dangerous flash of it it seared through him burned scarred while her hands and mouth raced over him igniting hundreds of new flames he didnt fight it back for once he wanted to be consumed with an oath he tore at the silk and dined greedily on her flesh his hands were rough and hard and wonderful shed never felt more alive or more desperate she craved him knew that she had on some deep level right from the beginning but now she had him could feel the press of that hard muscled body against her could taste the violent urgency of his need whenever their mouths met could hear his response to her touch to her taste in every hurried breath if it was elemental so be it she felt lusty and wanton and absolutely free her teeth dug into his shoulder as he whipped her ruthlessly over the first crest she cried out his name all but screamed it arching upward taut as a bow he arrowed into her hard deep she was blind and deaf from the pleasure of it oblivious of her own sobbing breaths as they mated in a frenzied rhythm her body plunged against his tireless driven by a need that seemed insatiable then body and need erupted the light was on funny he hadnt even noticed that when normally he was accustomed to picking up every small detail the lamps glow was soft picking up the cool sherbet tones of her bedroom ryan lay still his head on her breast and waited for his system to level beneath his ear her heart continued to thunder her flesh was damp her body limp every few moments a tremor shook her he didnt smile in triumph as he might have done but simply stared in wonder hed wanted to conquer her he couldntwouldntdeny it hed craved the sensation of having her body buck and shudder under his from the first moment he saw her but he hadnt expected the tornado of need that had swept through them both that had them clawing at each other like animals he knew hed been rough he wasnt a particularly gentle man so that didnt bother him but hed never lost control so completely with any woman nor had he ever wanted one so intensely only moments after hed had her that should have done it he muttered hmmm she felt weak as water achy and sweet it should have gotten it out of my system gotten you out at least started getting you out oh she found the energy to open her eyes the light dim as it was had her wincing slowly her mind began to clear quickly her skin began to heat she remembered the way shed torn at his clothes wrestled him into bed without a single coherent thought except having him she let out a breath drew another in youre right she decided it should have whats wrong with us with a laugh he lifted his head looking at her flushed face her tousled hair damned if i know are you okay now she smiled the hell with logic damned if i know what just happened heres a bit out of the usual realm for me good he lowered his head skimmed his tongue lightly over her breast i want you again natalie she quivered once good when the alarm went off natalie groaned rolled over to shut it off and bumped solidly into ry he grunted slapped at the buzzer with one hand and brought her to rest on top of him with the other whats the noise for he asked and ran an interested hand down her spine to the hip to wake me up he opened one eye yeah he thought he should have known it she looked just as good in the morning as she did every other time of the day why it goes like this still groggy she pushed her hair out of her face the alarm goes off i get up shower dress drink copious cups of coffee and go to work ive had some experience with the process anybody tell you todays saturday i know what day it is she said at least she did now i have work no you dont you just think you do he cradled her head against his shoulder casting one bleary eye at the clock it was am he calculated theyd had three hours sleep at the outside go back to sleep i cant he let out a longsuffering sigh all right all right but you should have warned me you were insatiable more than willing to oblige he rolled her over again and began to nibble on her shoulder i didnt mean that she laughed trying to wiggle free i have paperwork calls to make his hand was sneaking up to stroke her breast fire kindled instantly in the pit of her stomach cut it out uhuh you woke me up now you pay she couldnt help it simply couldnt and she began to stretch under his hands were lucky we didnt kill each other last night are you sure you want to take another chance men like me face danger every day he covered her grinning mouth with his she was more than three hours behind schedule when she stepped out of the shower so shed work late natalie decided and after wrapping a towel around her hair she began to cream her legs a good executive understood the merits of flextime yawning she wiped steam from the bathroom mirror and took a good look at her face she should be exhausted she realized she certainly should look exhausted after the wild night she and ry had shared but she wasnt and she didnt she looked soft she thought satisfied and why not she thought dragging the towel from her hair when a woman took thirtytwo years to experience just what a bout of hot sweaty sex could do for the mind and body she ought to look satisfied nothing absolutely nothing shed ever experienced came close to what shed felt what shed done what shed discovered during the night with ry so if she smiled like a fool while she combed out her wet hair why not if she felt like singing as she wrapped her tingling body in her robe it was understandable and if she had to rearrange her schedule for the day because shed spent most of the night and all of the morning wrestling in bed with a man who made her blood bubble more power to her she stepped back into the bedroom and grinned at the tangled sheets lips pursed she picked up the remains of her chemise the strap was torn and a froth of lace hung limp apparently she decided her merchandise didnt quite live up to ry piaseckis idea of wear and tear and wasnt it fabulous laughing out loud she tossed the chemise aside and followed her nose into the kitchen i smell coffee she began then paused in the doorway he was breaking eggs into a bowl with those big hard hands of his his hair was damp as hers was because hed beaten her to the shower he was barefoot jeans snug at his hips flannel shirt rolled up to the elbows incredibly she wanted him all over again you have next to nothing in this place to eat i eat out a lot with an order to control herself she moved to the coffeepot what are you making omelets you had four eggs some cheddar and some very limp broccoli i was going to steam it she cocked her head as she sampled the coffee so you cook every selfrespecting fire fighter cooks you take shifts at the station he located a whisk then turned to her wet hair glowing face sleepy eyes hello legs you look good thanks she smiled over the rim of her cup if he continued to look at her in just that way she realized she would drag him right down onto the floor it might be wise she decided to tend to some practical matters am i supposed to help can you handle toast barely she set her cup aside and opened the cupboard they worked in silence for a moment he beating eggs she popping bread in the toaster i she wasnt sure how to put it delicately i suppose when you were fighting fires you faced a lot of dangerous situations yeah so the scars on your shoulder your back shed discovered them in her explorations in the night the raised welts and scarred ridges over that taut really beautiful body line of duty thats right he glanced up in truth he didnt think about them but it occurred to him in the harsh light of day that a woman like her might find them offensive do they bother you no i just wondered how you got burned he set the bowl aside and placed a pan on the stove to heat maybe they bothered her he thought maybe they didnt but it seemed best to get the matter out of the way our friend clarence while i was pulling him out of the fire he started the ceiling collapsed ry could remember it still the rain of flame the animal roar of it the staggering nightmare of pain it fell down on us like judgment he was screaming laughing i got him outside i dont remember much after that until i woke up in the burn ward im sorry it could have been a lot worse my gear went a long way toward protecting me i got off lucky deliberately focused he poured the beaten eggs into the pan my father went down like that fire went into the walls when they ventilated the ceiling it went it all went he cursed under his breath where the hell had that come from he wondered he hadnt meant to say it the death of his father certainly wasnt typical morningafter conversation you should butter that toast before it gets cold she said nothing could think of nothing only went to him wrapping her arms around his waist pressing her cheek to his back i didnt know youd lost your father there was so much she thought that she didnt know twelve years ago it was in a high school some kid who wasnt happy with his chemistry grade torched the lab it got away from him pop knew the risks he muttered uncomfortable with the sensation her quiet sympathy was stirring we all know them she held on i didnt mean to open old wounds ry its all right he was a hell of a smoke eater natalie stayed where she was another moment baffled by what she was feeling this need to comfort to share this terrible urge to be part of what he was cautious she stepped back it wouldnt do she reminded herself it wouldnt do at all to look for more between them than what there was and this clarencehow will you find him i could get lucky and track him down through contacts with a quick competent touch ry folded the egg mixture or well pick him up when he scouts out his next target my plant probably more relaxed now that there was a little distance between them he shot her a look over his shoulder cheer up natalie youve got the best in the city working to protect your nighties you know very well its not just she broke off when her doorbell rang never mind hold on doesnt your doorman call up when someones coming to see you not if its a neighbor use the judas hole he ordered and reached for plates yes daddy amused by him natalie went to the door one look through the peephole had her stifling a shout and dragging back the locks boyd for heavens sake she threw her arms around her brother cilia the whole crew cilia warned her laughing as they hugged the cop wouldnt let me call ahead and alert you to the invasion im just so glad to see you she bent down to hug her niece and nephews but what are you doing here checking up on you boyd shifted the bag of takeout he carried to his other hip you know the captain cilia said bryant touch nothing under penalty of death she aimed a cautious look at her oldest son at eight he couldnt be trusted the minute deborah called us about the second fire he herded us up and moved us out allison this isnt a basketball court why dont you put that down now territorial allison hugged the basketball to her chest im not going to throw it or anything shes fine natalie assured cilia stroking a distracted hand down allisons golden hair boyd i cant believe youd drag everyone across the country for something like this the kids have monday off at school boyd crouched down to pick up the jacket their youngest had already tossed on the floor so were taking a quick weekend thats all were staying with deborah and gage cilia added so dont panic its not that and we brought supplies boyd held out the bag filled with takeout burgers and fries how about lunch well i she cleared her throat and looked toward the kitchen how she wondered was she going to explain ry keenan with the curiosity of an active fiveyearold had already discovered him from the kitchen doorway he grinned up at ry hi hi yourself curious to see just how natalie handled things ry strolled out of the kitchen want to see what i can do keenan asked him before anyone else could speak sure always ready to show off a new skill keenan shinnied up rys leg scooting up and around until he was riding piggyback not bad ry gave the boy a little boost to settle him in place thats keenan cilia explained running her tongue over her teeth as she considered our youngest monkey im sorry ah natalie dragged a hand through her damp hair she didnt have to look at boyd to know hed have that speculative bigbrother look in his eyes boyd and cilia fletcher ry piasecki she cleared her throat and this is allison and bryant now she sighed youve already met keenan piasecki boyd repeated arson just the man he wanted to see boyd thought but he hadnt expected to find him barefoot in his sisters kitchen thats right brother and sister shared strong good looks ry mused and he thought an innate suspicion of strangers youre the cop from denver bryant piped up hes a police captain he wears a gun to work can i have a drink aunt nat sure i but bryant was already darting into the kitchen well this is awkward she thought maybe i should get some plates before the food gets cold good idea all she has is eggs ry eyed the bag boyd still carried recognizing the package maybe we can work a deal for some of your french fries youre the one investigating the fires right boyd began slick cilia said glaring at her husband no interrogations on an empty stomach you can grill him after we eat weve been on a plane for hours she explained when bryant came back in and tried to wrestle the ball away from allison were a little edgy no problem ah instant before boyd ry snatched the ball that squirted out of flailing hands like to shoot hoop he asked allison uhhuh she gave him a quick winning smile i made the team bryant didnt basketballs stupid sulking bryant slouched in a chair id rather play nintendo ry juggled keenan on his back as he turned the ball in his hands it so happens ive got a game in a couple of hours maybe youd like to come really allisons eyes lit as she turned to cilia mom it sounds like fun intrigued cilia strolled toward the kitchen ill just give natalie a hand and she thought pump her sisterinlaw for details chapter contents prev next the last place natalie expected to spend her saturday afternoon was courtside watching cops and fire fighters play round ball she sulked through most of the first quarter her elbow on her knee her chin on her fist after all ry hadnt mentioned the game to her hadnt directly invited her she was there to witness what was obviously an important annual rivalry only because of her niece not that it mattered to her she assured herself ry was certainly under no obligation to include her in his personal entertainment the pig beside her allison was in basketball heaven cheering on the red jerseys with a rabid fans passionate enthusiasm her brandycolored eyes glinted as she followed the action up and down the court of the old westside gym its not such a bad way to spend the afternoon cilia commented over the shrill sound of the refs whistle watching a bunch of halfnaked guys sweat her eyes the same warm shade as her daughters danced by the way your guys very cute i told you hes not my guy were just yeah you told me chuckling cilia wrapped an arm around natalies shoulders cheer up nat if youd gone along with boyd and the boys to unload at deborahs your big bro would be grilling you right now youve got a point she let out a sigh despite herself she was following the action the cops were doubleteaming ry consistently she noted not a bad strategy as he played like a steamroller and lad already scored seven points in the first quarter not that she was counting he didnt mention this game to me she muttered oh fighting back a grin cilia ran her tongue over her teeth he must have had something else on his mind hey she surged to her feet along with most of the crowd as one of the blue jerseys rammed an elbow sharply in rys ribs foul cilia shouted between her cupped hands he can take it natalie mumbled and tried not to care as ry approached the foul line hes got an iron stomach she struggled between pride and resentment when he sank his shot rys the best allison beamed well into a deep case of hero worship did you see how he moves upcourt and hes got a terrific vertical leap hes already blocked three shots under the hoop so maybe he looked good natalie conceded those long muscled legs pumping those broad shoulders slick with sweat all that wonderful hair flying as he pivoted or leapt then there was that look that came into his eyes wolfish and arrogant so maybe she wanted him to win that didnt mean she was going to stand up and cheer by the third quarter she was on her feet like the rest of the crowd when ry sank a threepointer that put the smoke eaters over the bloodhounds by two nothing but net she shouted jostling cilia did you see that hes got some great moves cilia agreed fast hands yeah natalie felt the foolish grin spread over her face tell me about it heart thumping she dropped back on the bench she was leaning forward now her gaze glued to the ball the sound of running feet echoed as the men pounded upcourt the cops took a shot the smoke eaters blocked it the ensuing scuffle left two men on the ground others snarling in each others faces as the ref blew his whistle now natalie thought grimly they were playing dirty with a grunt she dipped her hand into the bag of salted nuts cilia offered fast break flying elbows a tangle of bodies under the net as the ball shot up careened was pursued going to put out your fire piasecki one of the cops taunted natalie saw ry flick the sweaty hair out of his eyes and grin not with that equipment trash talk natalie sneered at the cop as she chomped a peanut no round ball game was complete without it she hooted down the referee as he stepped between two overenthusiastic competitors barely preventing an informal boxing match boys boys cilia said with a sigh they always take their games so seriously games are serious natalie muttered it was too close to call natalie continued to munch on peanuts as a sensible alternative to her fingernails when a timeout was called she glanced at the clock there was less than six minutes to go and the bloodhounds were up to on the sidelines the smoke eaters coach was surrounded by his team the lanky silverhaired man was punching his fist into his palm to accentuate whatever instructions he was giving his men most were bent at the waist hands on knees as they caught their breath for the final battle as they headed back onto the court ry turned his gaze shot unerringly to natalie and he grinned quick cocky arrogant wow cilia murmured now thats serious very powerful stuff youre telling me natalie blew out a breath when that did nothing to level her system she used the excess energy to cheer on her team it was a fight to the finish the lead tipping back to the smoke eaters then sliding away as time dripped away second by second the crowd stayed on its feet building a wall of sound with seconds to go the smoke eaters a point behind natalie was chewing on her knuckles then she saw ry make his move oh yes she whispered it first almost like a prayer then she began to shout it as he burst through the line of defense controlling the ball as if it were attached to the palm of his hand by an invisible string they blocked he pivoted he had one chance and he was surrounded natalies heart tripped as he feinted faked then sprang off the floor with a turnaround jump shot that found the sweet spot the crowd went wild natalie knew she did spinning around to hug allison then cilia what was left of the peanuts flew through the air like rain the instant the clock ran out the stands emptied in a surge of bodies onto the court she caught a glimpse of ry a moment before he was swallowed up she sank back onto the bench with a hand over her heart im exhausted she laughed and rubbed her damp hands on the knees of her jeans ive got to sit what a game allison was bouncing up and down in her sneakers wasnt he great did you see mom he scored thirtythree points wasnt he great you bet can we tell him can we go down and tell him cilia studied the jostling crowd then looked into her daughters shining eyes sure coming natalie ill stay here if you manage to get to him tell him ill hang around and wait okay youll bring him to dinner at debs tonight cautious natalie drummed her fingers on her knee ill run it by him bring him cilia ordered then leaned over and kissed natalies cheek see you later gradually the gym emptied the fans swarming out to celebrate the players heading off to shower content natalie sat in the quiet it had been her first full day off in six months and shed decided it wasnt such a bad way to spend it after all and since ry hadnt actually asked her to come he was under no real obligation neither of them was sensibly neither of them was looking for restrictions for commitments for romance it was simply a primal urge on both parts fiercely intense now and very likely to fade it was fortunate that they both understood that right from the beginning there was some affection between them naturally and respect but this wasnt a relationship in the true sense of the word neither of them wanted that it was simply an affairenjoyable while it lasted no harm done when it ended then he walked out on court his hair dark and damp from his shower his gaze swept up and locked on hers oh boy was all she could think while her heart turned a long slow somersault she was in trouble good game she managed and forced herself to stand and walk down to him it had its moments he cocked his head you know its the first time ive seen you dressed in anything but one of those highclass suits to cover the sudden rash of nerves natalie reached down and picked up one of the game balls jeans and sweaters arent usually office attire they look good on you legs thanks she turned the ball in her hand studying it rather than him allison had the time of her life it was nice of you to invite her shes a cute kid they all are shes got your mouth you know and the jawline shes going to be a real heartbreaker right now shes more interested in scoring points on court than scoring them with boys more relaxed natalie looked up again smiling at him you scored a few yourself today inspector thirtythree he said but whos counting allison and she had been too carrying the ball she wandered out on the court i take it this was your annual battle against the bloodhounds yeah we take them on once a year the proceeds go to charity and all that but mostly we come to beat the hell out of each other head down she bounced the ball once caught it you never mentioned it i mean not until allison showed up no he was watching her intrigued if he wasnt mistaken there was a touch of annoyance in her voice i guess i didnt she turned her head why didnt you definitely annoyed he decided and scratched his cheek i didnt figure it would be your kind of thing now her chin angled oh really hey its not the opera or the ballet he shrugged and tucked his thumbs in his front pockets or a fancy french restaurant she let out a slow breath drew another in are you calling me a snob again careful piasecki he warned himself there was definitely a trapdoor here somewhere not exactly lets just say i couldnt see someone like you getting worked up over a basketball game someone like me she repeated stung she pivoted planted her feet and sent the ball sailing toward the hoop it swished through bounced on the court when she looked back at ry she had the satisfaction of seeing his mouth hanging open someone like me she said again and went to retrieve the ball just what does that mean piasecki he got his hands out of his pockets just in time to catch the ball she heaved at him before it thudded into his chest he passed it back to her hard lifting a brow when she caught it do that again he demanded all right deliberately she stepped behind the threepoint line gauged her shot and let it rip the whisper of the ball dropping through the hoop made her smile well well well this time ry retrieved the ball himself he was rapidly reassessing his opponent im impressed legs definitely impressed how about a little oneonone fine she crouched circling him as he dribbled you know i cant quick as a snake she darted in snatched the ball she executed a perfect layup tapping the ball on the backboard and into the hoop i believe thats my point she said and passed the ball back to him youre good oh im better than good flicking her hair back she moved in to block him i was allstate in college pal team captain my junior and senior years where do you think allison gets it okay aunt nat lets play ball he pivoted away she was on him like glue good moves he noted smooth aggressive maybe he held back after all he wasnt about to send a woman to the boards no matter how much male ego was on the line she didnt have the same sensitivity and turned into his block hard enough to take his breath away frowning he rubbed the point under his heart where her shoulder had rammed her eyes were glittering now bold as the emerald city thats a foul she stole the ball made the point with an impressive overtheshoulder hook i dont see a ref she had the advantage and they both knew it not only had he played fullout for an entire game but shed had that time to assess his technique study his moves and she was better he had to admit a hell of a lot better than half the cops who had gone up against him that afternoon and worse she knew it he scored off her but it was no easy thing she was sneaky he discovered using speed and grace and oldfashioned guts to make up for the difference in height they juggled the lead shed shoved the sleeves of her sweater up she leapt with him blocking his shot by a fingertip and having no compunctions about using whatever talent she had let her body bump linger then slide against his his blood heated as shed meant it to panting he picked up the ball and stared at her her lips were curved smugly her face was flushed her hair was tumbled he realized he could eat her alive he moved in quickly startling her she let out a squeal when he snatched her around the waist and hauled her over his shoulder she was laughing when he sent the ball home with his free hand now thats definitely a foul i dont see any ref he shifted her letting gravity take her down until they were facetoface her legs clamped at his waist he reached out gathered her hair in one hand and pulled her mouth to his whatever breath she had left clogged opening to him she dived into the greedy kiss and demanded more the blood drained so quickly so completely out of his head he nearly staggered with a sudden voracious appetite he tore his mouth from hers and devoured the flesh of her throat smooth salty with the lingering undertone of that haunting scent she used his mouth watered theres a storeroom in the back that locks her hands were already tugging at his shirt her breathing was ragged then why are we out here good question with her locked around him her teeth doing incredible things to his ear he pushed through the swinging doors and turned into a narrow corridor desperate for her he fumbled at the knob of the storeroom door swore then shoved it open when he slammed it and locked it at their backs they were closed in a tiny room crammed with sports equipment and smelling of sweat impatient natalie tugged at his hair dragging his mouth back to hers he nearly tripped over a medicine ball as he looked around frantically for something anything that could double as a bed he settled on a weight bench with natalie on his lap i feel like a damn teenager he muttered pulling at the snap of her jeans beneath the denim her skin was hot damp trembling me too her heart was beating against her ribs like a hammer oh god i want you hurry frantic hands tore at clothes scattered them there was no time no need for finesse only for heat it was building inside her so fast so hot she felt she might implode and there would be nothing left of her but a shell his hands were at her throat her breasts her hips thrilling her tormenting her nothing and no one mattered but him and this wild incendiary fire they set together she wanted it hotter higher faster with a low feline sound that shuddered through his blood she straddled him his heart seemed to stop in the instant she imprisoned him as her body arched back her eyes closing she filled his vision his mind left him helpless then her eyes opened again and locked on his she began to move fast and agile already it was flash point he let the power take him and her ive never done anything like this before staggered and spent natalie struggled back into her clothes i mean never it wasnt exactly the way id planned it baffled ry dragged a hand through his hair were worse than a couple of kids natalie smoothed down her sweater sighing lavishly it was fabulous his lips twitched yeah then he sobered so are you she smiled and tried fingercombing her hair into place wed better stop pushing our luck and get out of here and ive got to get home and change she discovered that one of her earrings had fallen out and located it on the floor theres dinner at the guthries tonight he watched her fasten the earring foolishly charmed by the simple female act ill give you a lift home id appreciate it feeling awkward she turned to unlock the door youre welcome to come to dinner i know boyd wants a chance to talk with you about the fires he closed a hand over hers on the knob hows the food she smiled again looking back at him fabulous she was right about the food ry discovered rack of lamb fresh asparagus glossy candied yams all accompanied by some golden french wine he knew of course that gage guthrie was dripping with money but nothing had prepared him for the gothic mansion of a house with its towers and turrets and terraces the next thing to a castle ry had thought when he viewed it from the outside inside it was home rich and elaborate certainly but warm deborah had given him a partial tour down winding corridors up curving steps before they all settled into the enormous dining room with its oxroasting stone fireplace and winking crystal chandeliers it might ry thought have had the flavor of a museum if not for the people in it hed clicked with deborah instantly hed heard she was a tough and tenacious prosecutor she had a softer more vulnerable look than her sister but she had a reputation for being formidable in court it was obvious her husband adored her there were little signsthe quick shared looks the touch of a hand it was very much the same between boyd and cilia ry calculated that theyd been together for a decade or so but the spark was still very much in evidence and the kids were great hed always had a soft spot for children he recognized and was touched by allisons preadolescent crush and obliged her by going over the highlights of the game since cilia had wisely seen to it that her oldest son was across the table and two chairs down from his sister bryant was free to badger deborah about how many bad guys shed locked up since last hed seen her and dinner was a relatively peaceful affair do you ride in a fire truck keenan wanted to know i used to ry told him how come you stopped i told you bryant said rolling his eyes with the disdain only a sibling knows and understands he goes after bad guys now like dad only just bad guys who burn things down dont you thats right id rather ride in a fire truck in a canny move to avoid the asparagus on his plate keenan slipped out of his chair and into rys lap keenan cilia said rys trying to eat hes okay enjoying himself ry shifted the boy onto his knee did you ever ride in one nuhuh he smiled winningly using his big soft eyes can i if your mom and dad say its okay you could come down to the station tomorrow take a look around cool bryant had immediately picked up on the invitation can we dad i dont see why not aunt nat knows where it is ry added as keenan bounced gleefully on his knee make it around ten and ill give you a tour pretty exciting stuff cilia rose and if were going to pull it off id say you three better get washed up and bedded down the kneejerk protest might have been stronger if not for the long day the children had put in cilia merely shook her head looking at boyd slick okay he rose and tossed bryant up and over his shoulder turning whines into giggles lets move out ill give you a hand natalie plucked keenan from rys lap say goodnight pal good night pal he echoed and nuzzled into her neck you smell as good as thea aunt nat thanks honey am i going to get a story swindler she laughed and carried him out nice family ry commented we like them deborah smiled at him youve certainly given them something to look forward to tomorrow no big deal the guys love to show off for kids great meal franks one in a million she agreed a former pickpocket she closed her hand over gages who now uses those nimble fingers to create gastronomic miracles why dont we have coffee in the small salon ill go help frank with it this is some house ry said as he and gage left the dining room and wound their way toward the salon ever get lost ive got a good sense of direction there was a fire burning in the salon and the lights were low and welcoming again ry got the impression of home settled content you used to be a cop didnt you gage stretched out in a chair thats right my partner and i were working on a sting that went wrong all the way wrong it still hurt but the wounds were scarred over now he ended up dead and i was the next thing to it when i came out of it i didnt want to pick up a badge again rough ry knew it was a great deal more than that if he had the story right in his head gage had lingered in a coma for months before facing life again so you picked up the family business instead so to speak we have something in common there youre running the family business too ry gave gage a level look so to speak i checked you out natalies important to deborah and to me i can tell you in advance boyds going to ask if shes important to you he glanced up as boyd walked in that was fast i saw my chance and went over the wall he dropped into a chair crossed his feet at the ankles so piasecki whats going on between you and my sister ry decided hed been polite long enough and took out a cigarette he lit it flipped the match into a spotless crystal ashtray id say anybody who makes captain on the force should be able to figure that out for himself gage smothered a laugh with a cough as boyds eyes narrowed natalies not a tossaway boyd said carefully i know what she is ry returned and i know what she isnt if you want to grill someone on whats going on between us captain youd better start with her boyd considered nodded fair enough give me a rundown on the arson investigation that he could and would do ry related the sequence the facts his own steps and conclusions answering boyds terse questions with equal brevity im betting on clarence he finished i know his pattern and how his warped mind works and ill get him he said and blew out a last stream of smoke thats a promise in the meantime natalie needs to beef up security boyds mouth thinned ill see to that ry tapped out his cigarette i already have i was talking about personal security not business so was i im not going to let anything happen to her he continued as boyd studied him thats another promise boyd let out a snort do you really think shell listen to you yeah shes not going to get a choice boyd paused reevaluated maybe im going to like you after all inspector okay break it up deborah ordered as she wheeled in a cart laden with a huge silver coffee urn and meissen china i know youre talking shop gage rose to take the cart from her and kiss her youre just mad because you might have missed something exactly jacoby boyd tossed at her clarence robert ring any bells her brow furrowed as she poured coffee jacoby also known as jack jacoby she served boyd took another cup to ry skipped bail a couple of years ago on an arson charge i like your wife ry said to gage theres nothing quite like a sharp mind in a firstclass package thanks gage poured a cup for himself i often think the same jacoby deborah repeated focusing on ry you think hes the one thats right wed have a file on him she glanced at her husband the computers in gages hidden room could access everything about jacoby right down to his shoe size im not sure who had the case but i can find out on monday see that you get whatever we have id appreciate it howd he manage bail boyd wanted to know i cant tell you until i see the file deborah began i can tell you about him ry drank his coffee keeping one ear out for natalies return he wasnt sure shed appreciate having her business discussed while she was out of the room his patterns empty buildings warehouses condemned apartments sometimes the owners hire him for the insurance sometimes he does it for kicks we only tried him twice convicted him once there wasnt any loss of life either time clarence doesnt burn people just things so now hes loose boyd said in disgust for the time being ry returned were ready for him he picked up his cup again when he heard natalie and cilia laughing in the hallway youre a softie nat its my duty and my privilege to spoil them they entered together cilia immediately headed for boyd and dropped into his lap they had her jumping through hoops they did not natalie poured her coffee then laughed again not exactly she smiled at ry before settling beside him so she began have you finished discussing my personal and business life a sharp mind ry commented in a firstclass package later as they drove away from the guthrie mansion natalie studied rys profile should i apologize for boyd he didnt pull out the rubber hoses ry shrugged hes okay ive got a couple of sisters i know how it is oh frowning she looked out the window i didnt realize you had siblings im polish and irish and you figured me for an only child he grinned at her two older sisters one in columbus the other down in baltimore and a brother a year younger than me living in phoenix four of you she murmured until you count the nieces and nephews there were eight of them last time i checked and my brother has another on the way which probably explained why he was so easy around children youre the only one who stayed in urbana yeah they all wanted out i didnt he turned down her street slowed am i staying tonight natalie she looked at him again how could he be so much of a stranger she wondered and so much of a need i want you to she said i want you chapter contents prev next can i slide down the pole mr pisessy please can i slide down it ry grinned at the way keenan massacred his name and flipped the brim of the boys baseball cap to the back of his curly head ry cause keenan said big eyes sober and hopeful i never ever did it before no not why ry you call me ry and sure you can slide down it hold it laughing he caught keenan at the waist before the boy could make the leap from floor to pole no flies on you huh keenan looked around grinned nuhuh lets do it this way with keenan firmly at his hip ry reached out to grip the pole ready lets go in a smooth practiced move ry stepped into air keenan laughed all the way down again keenan squealed lets do it again your brother wants a turn ry looked up saw bryants anxious eager face in the opening come on bryant go for it definitely daddy material cilia murmured watching her son zip down the pole shut up cilia natalie slipped her hands into the pockets of her blazer she was itching to try the ride herself just an observation attagirl allison she added cheering her daughter on when allison dropped lightly to the floor hes giving the kids the time of their lives here i know its very sweet of him she smiled as ry obliged keenan with another trip down the pole i didnt know he could be sweet ah hidden qualities cilia glanced over to where boyd was holding a conversation with two uniformed fire fighters often the most attractive kind in a man especially when hes crazy about you hes not it amazed natalie to feel heat rising to her cheeks were just enjoying each other yeah sure with a mothers honed reflexes cilia crouched and caught her youngest as he flew at her look mom its a real actual firemans hat the helmet ry had given keenan to wear slipped down over the boys face inside it smelled mysteriously fascinatingly of smoke and ry says we can go sit in the fire engine now after wriggling down and dancing in place he shouted at his brother and sister lets go accompanied by two fire fighters the children dashed off to check out the engine with a signal to cilia to wait boyd disappeared up the steps with ry well cilia sniffed and shrugged the womenfolk have been dismissed theyll go upstairs to grunt significantly over official business i wish boyd wouldnt worry so much theres really nothing he can do older siblings are programmed to worry cilia slung an arm around natalies shoulder but if it helps hes feeling a lot less worried since hes met ry thats something i suppose relaxed again she walked with cilia toward the back of the engine so hows althea doing around the front the children were barraging the fire fighters with questions the last time i talked to her she claimed she was as big as two houses and miserably bored with desk duty shes the sexiest expectant mother ive ever seen since colt and boyd ganged up on her shes at home on full maternity leave i dropped over to see her one day a couple of weeks ago and caught her knitting knitting natalie let out a fullthroated laugh althea funny what marriage and family can do to you yeah natalies smile faded a bit i suppose thats true upstairs boyd was frowning over rys reports why upstairs in the office he asked why didnt he start the fire in the showroom it seems to me there would have been more damage more quickly the showroom window could have put him off i figure the storeroom would have made more sense if he was just looking to burn the place down its private full of stock and boxes ry set aside his coffee he really had to start cutting down i figure he was following instructions clarence is real good at following instructions whose thats the ticket ry kicked back in his chair and propped his feet on his desk ive got two incendiary fires that are obviously related the target in both cases is a single business and both i believe were started by a single perpetrator so hes on somebodys payroll boyd set the reports aside a competitor were checking it out but its unlikely a competitor would be able to give your pal clarence access to either building you didnt find any sign of forced entry thats right ry lit a cigarette a man couldnt cut down on two vices at once which leads us to natalies organization boyd got up to pace i cant claim to know her staff certainly not in this new project of hers i dont deal with the business end of fletcher unless im backed into a corner he regretted that now only because he would have been more help if hed been familiar with her procedures and personnel but i can get a lot of information from my parents particularly on her top people it couldnt hurt the fact that there was only cosmetic damage at the last fire leads to the conclusion that therell be another if clarence follows his pattern hell hit her again within the next ten days he tossed papers aside well be waiting for him boyd looked back and measured the man tough smart but as he knew from personal experience the job could get sticky when a man found himself involved with a target and while youre waiting for him youll keep natalie out of it thats the idea and while youre doing that youre going to be able to separate the woman youre involved with from the case youre trying to close ry lifted a brow that was going to be a challenge and the difficulty of meeting that challenge had crossed his mind more than once the trouble was he wasnt willing to give up either the woman or the case i know what needs to be done captain with a nod boyd placed his palms on the desk and leaned forward im trusting you with her piasecki on every level if she gets hurton any levelim coming after you fair enough an hour later natalie stood on the curb outside the station waving goodbye you were a big hit inspector hey a shiny red fire truck a long brass polehow could i miss laughing she turned to link her arms around his neck thanks she kissed him lightly for for being so nice to my family it wasnt a hardship i like kids it shows and she kissed him again thats for putting boyds mind at ease i dont know if id go quite that far hes still thinking about punching me out if i make the wrong move with his baby sister well then her eyes danced up at his youd better be careful because my big brother is plenty tough you dont have to draw me a picture he swung her toward the doors come on back up with me i need to get a couple of things all right theyd barely started up the stairs when the bells sounded oh the sound of clattering feet echoed below them im sorry the kids missed this then she stopped wincing thats terrible acting like a fires a form of entertainment its a natural reaction bells whistles men in funny uniforms its a hell of a show they crossed over to his office she waited while he sorted through papers do you ever get cats out of trees yep and kids heads out of the pickets on railings i got someones pet iguana out of a sewer pipe once youre joking hey we dont joke about rescue he looked up and grinned she looked so tidy he thought in her navy blazer and slacks with the cashmere sweater red as one of his engines softly draped at the neck her hair was loose honey gold when she tucked it behind her ear in that fluid unconscious movement he could see the wink of rich blue stones sapphires he assumed only the genuine article would suit natalie fletcher what is it a little selfconscious under his stare she shifted did keenan leave something edible smeared on my face no you look good legs want to go somewhere go somewhere the idea put her off balance apart from the challenge of that first meal they hadnt actually gone anywhere like a movie or he supposed he could handle it a museum or something i yes thatd be nice it shouldnt be so awkward she thought to plan a simple date with someone youd been sleeping with which either okay he stuffed some papers in a battered briefcase the guys should have a newspaper downstairs well check it out fine when they started out natalie glanced first toward the stairs and then back toward the poles she took a deep breath and gave up ry yeah can i slide down the pole he stopped dead and stared down at her you want to slide down the pole amused at herself natalie shrugged her shoulders ry ive got to slide down the pole its driving me crazy no kidding his grin broke out as he put a hand on her shoulder and turned her around okay aunt nat ill go down first in case you lose your nerve im not going to lose my nerve she said huffily ill have you know ive been rockclimbing dozens of times theres that height thing again you get a good grip he continued demonstrating swing yourself forward you can wrap your legs around it as you go down he flowed down smooth and fast frowning she leaned over peering at him through the opening you didnt wrap your legs around it i dont have to he said dryly im a professional come on and dont worryill catch you i dont need you to catch me insulted she tossed back her hair she reached out took a good grip on the brass pole then swung agilely into space it took a matter of seconds her heart had barely had time to settle before her feet hit the floor laughing she looked longingly up again see i didnt need her boast ended on a squeal of surprise as he scooped her up into his arms what youre a natural he was grinning as he lowered his mouth to hers and a constant surprise to him he thought she angled her head settling her arms comfortably around his neck i could do it again if youd do it in red suspenders a pair of those really little shorts and let me take a picture the guys would be very grateful she lifted a brow i think ill just make a cash donation to the department its not the same inspector the dispatcher poked his head out of a doorway his smile spread slowly at the sight of the woman bundled in rys arms suspicious fire over at east newberry they want you tell them im on my way he set natalie back on her feet sorry its all right i know how it is her disappointment was completely out of proportion she lectured herself ive got some work i should be catching up on anyway ill grab a cab ill take you home ry told her on my way he steered her toward the bench where shed left her coat are you just going to be hanging around at the apartment yes there are some spreadsheets i should have looked at yesterday so ill call you as ry helped her on with her coat she glanced over her shoulder all right he turned her completely around and indulged himself with one long hard kiss tell you what ill just come by when im done natalie worked on getting her breath back better she managed thats even better by the middle of the week natalie had discovered that for the first time in memory she was behind on her own personal schedule not only had she blown the previous weekend but she hadnt put in a decent nights work all week how could she when she and ry were spending every free moment together every evening they settled into her apartment ordered dinnerwhich more often than not had to be reheated after theyd feasted on each other she didnt think of work from the time he arrived on her doorstep until she rushed into her office the next morning she didnt think of anything but him besotted was what she was natalie admitted as she stared out her office window fascinated by the man and by what happened every time they got within arms reach of each other it was crazy of course she knew it but it was so wonderful at the moment it didnt seem to matter and she could justify it since she hadnt yet missed any meetings or business deadlines now that ry had given her the goahead shed authorized the cleanup and redecorating at the flagship store the stock there was nearly all in place and the windowdressing was complete it was only a matter of days before the grand opening nationwide and thered been no more incidents that was how she liked to think of the fires now as incidents she should of course be making plans to visit all the branches within the next ten days but the thought of traveling just then seemed so annoying so depressing so lonely she could delegate melvin or donald to make the tour it wouldnt even be outside of proper business procedure to do so but it wasnt her style to delegate what should be done by her maybe if things got settled somehow ry could get a few days off go with her it would be wonderful to have companyhis companyon a quick business trip she could put it off until after the grand opening instead of before and thenturning away from the window she answered the buzzer on her desk yes maureen ms marks to see you ms fletcher thanks send her in with an effort natalie shifted her personal thoughts to the back of her mind and welcomed her accounting executive deirdre have a seat im sorry im so behind deirdre blew her choppy bangs out of her eyes before she dropped a thick stack of files on natalies desk every time we turn around the systems down natalie frowned as she picked up the first file have you called in the engineer hes practically living in my lap deirdre plopped into a chair and set one practical flatheeled shoe on her knee he fixes it we forge ahead and it goes down again believe me running figures has become a challenge weve still got some time before the end of the quarter ill call the computer people myself this afternoon if their equipments unstable theyll have to replace it immediately good luck deirdre said dryly the good news is i was able to run a chart on the early catalog sales i think youll be pleased with the results mmm hmm natalie was already flipping through the files fortunately the fires didnt destroy records youd have a real accounting nightmare on your hands if it had gotten to the files at the flagship youre telling me deirdre rubbed her fingers over her eyes the way the systems been hiccuping id sweat bullets without those hard copies well relax ive got copies of the copies as well as the backup disks tucked away i was hoping to run a full audit by the middle of march she saw the wince before deirdre could mask it but she added leaning back if we keep running into these glitches well have to put it off until after the taxseason rush my life for you solemnly deirdre thumped a fist on her breast now to the nittygritty your outlay is still within the projected parameters barely with the insurance payments well offset some of that natalie nodded and made herself focus on budgets and percentages a few hours later in a seedy downtown motel clarence jacoby sat on his sagging bed lighting matches his hands were pudgy smooth as a girls each time he would strike the match and watch the magic flare waiting waiting until the heat just kissed the tips of his fingers before blowing it out the ashtray beside him was overflowing with the matches that had already flared and burned clarence could entertain himself for hours with nothing more i he thought nearly every night about burning down the hotel it would be exciting to start the blaze right in his own room watch it grow and spread but he wouldnt be alone and that stopped him clarence didnt care overmuch about people or the risk to their lives he simply preferred to be alone with his fires hed learned not to stay overlong after hed ignited them the rippling scars over his neck and chest were daily reminders of how quickly how fiercely the dragon could turn even on one who loved it so he contented himself with merely conceiving the fire basking for a regrettably short time in its heat before fleeing six months before in detroit hed torched an abandoned warehouse that the owner had no longer needed or wanted it was the kind of favor a profitable one on all sides that clarence enjoyed he had stayed to watch that fire burn oh hed been out of the building and deep in the shadows but theyd nearly caught him those cops and arson people scanned the crowds at the scene just for a face like his a worshipful face a happy face with a giggle clarence struck another match but hed gotten away and hed learned another lesson it wasnt smart to stay and watch he didnt need to stay and watch there were so many fires so many fierce and beautiful blazes living in his mind and heart he didnt need to stay he had only to close his eyes and see them feel them smell them he was humming to himself when the phone rang his round childlike face beamed happily when he heard the sound only one person had his number here and that person would have only one reason to call it was time he knew to free the dragon again at his desk ry pored over lab reports it was nearly seven and already dark outside hed given up on cutting down on coffee and drank it hot and black from a chipped mug he needed to quit for the day he recognized the slow process of shutting down in his mind and body somehow or other in the past couple of weeks hed gotten into a routine he was now beginning to depend on no not somehow or other ry reminded himself scrubbing his hands over his face someone he was getting much too used to knocking off for the day and heading for her apartment he even had a key to her front door in his pocket now something that had been given and taken without ceremony as if neither of them wanted to acknowledge what that simple piece of metal stood for theyd have a meal he thought theyd talk maybe watch one of the old movies on televisionsomething theyd discovered by accident they both loved most of what theyd discovered about each other he mused had been by accident or by observation he knew she liked long bubble baths in the evening with the water too hot and a glass of chilled wine sitting on the rim of the tub she stepped out of those anklebreakers she wore the minute she walked in the door and she put everything away in its place she slept in silk and hogged the blankets her alarm went off at seven on the dot every morning and if he wasnt quick enough to delay her she was out of the bed seconds later she had a weakness for strawberry ice cream and bigband music she was loyal and smart and strong and he was in love with her sitting back ry rested his eyes a problem he thought his problem theyd had an unspoken agreement going in and he knew it no ties no tangles he didnt want them god knew he couldnt afford them with her they were opposites on every level but one the physical needs that had brought them together no matter how intense couldnt override everything else not in the long term so there couldnt be a long term he would do what was smart what was right and see her through the arson investigation and that would be that would have to be that and to save them both an unpleasant scene hed start backing away a little starting now he rose and grabbed his jacket he wouldnt go to her place tonight he looked guiltily at the phone thinking of calling her making some excuse with an oath he turned out the lights he wasnt her damn husband he reminded himself he never would be compelled by a nagging sense of unrest like an itch between his shoulder blades ry drove out to natalies plant hed done a great deal of driving around since he left the station it was after ten oclock now moonless windless he sat in his car slumped behind the wheel and tried not to think of her of course he thought of her she was probably wondering where he was he figured shed assume hed gotten a call shed wait up guilt worked at him again it was his least favorite emotion it wasnt right to be inconsiderate to worry her just because hed had a scare and maybe he wasnt in love with her maybe he was just hung up a man could get hung up on a woman without wanting to slit his throat when she walked away couldnt he disgusted ry reached for his car phone the least he could do was call and tell her he was busy it wasnt like checking in he assured himself it was just being polite and since when had he worried about manners cursing he began to dial but the itch came back slowly his eyes scanning the dark he replaced the phone had he heard something a check of his watch told him the patrol hed assigned would make their run by in another ten minutes no harm he decided in taking a look around himself on foot in the meantime he eased his door open and slipped out he could hear nothing now but the faint swish of traffic two blocks away cautious he reached back in the car for his flashlight but he didnt turn it on not yet he thought his eyes were accustomed enough to the dark for him to see where he was going instinct had him heading silently around the back hed already cased the plant himself noting where the exits were located the security the fire doors hed make a circle check each door and window on the main level himself he heard it again the scrape of a foot over gravel ry shifted the flashlight in his hand holding it like a weapon now as he moved closer tensed ready he slipped through the shadows if it was the security guard ry knew he was about to give the man the fright of his life otherwise a giggle faint and delighted the slow moaning whine of a metal door moving on its hinges ry flashed on his light and spotlighted clarence jacoby hows it going clarence ry grinned as the man blinked against the glare ive been waiting for you whos that clarences voice raced up a register whos that hey im hurt ry lowered the light out of clarences eyes and stepped closer dont you recognize your old pal squinting clarence separated the man from the shadows in a moment his baffled face exploded in a wide grin piasecki hey ry piasecki hows it going youre inspector now right i hear youre an inspector now thats right ive been looking for you clarence oh yeah shyly clarence dipped his head how come i put out that little campfire you started the other night you must be losing your touch clarence oh hey still grinning clarence spread his arms out i dont know nothing about that you remember when we got burned piasecki hell of a night wasnt it that dragon was really big almost ate us up i remember clarence moistened his lips scared you bad too i heard the nurses talking in the burn ward about the nightmares i had a few of them and you dont fight fire no more do you dont want to slay the dragon now do you i like squashing little bugs like you better ry swung his light down shone it on the gas cans at clarences feet what do you know clarence you still use premium grade too i didnt do nothing clarence whirled to make a dash into the dark even as ry leapt forward the man jerked back as if on a string staggered ry stared at the darkclad arms that seemed to shoot straight out from the buildings wall and wrap around clarences neck then it was a shadow flowing out of nothing then it was a man flowing out of the shadow i dont believe the inspector was finished talking to you clarence nemesis kept one arm hooked around clarences neck as he faced ry were you inspector no i wasnt ry let out a long breath thanks my pleasure its a ghost a ghosts got me clarences eyes turned up white and he fainted dead away i imagine you could have handled him on your own nemesis passed the limp body to ry waiting until ry had hefted clarence over his shoulder i appreciate it anyway there was a quick flash of teeth as nemesis smiled i like your style inspector same goes you want to explain that little trick when you came out of the wall ry began but he was talking to air before the sentence was finished not bad he muttered and was shaking his head as he carted clarence to the car not bad at all the phone awakened natalie from where shed dozed off on the couch groggy she stumbled toward it trying to read the time on her watch yes hello its ry oh she rubbed the sleep from her eyes its after one i was sorry to wake you no its not that i just weve got him what her irritation that he had yet to let her finish a sentence sharpened the word clarence i picked him up tonight i thought youd want to know now her head was reeling yes of course thats wonderful but when im tied up here natalie ill get back to you when i can all right but she took the receiver away from her ear and glared at the dial tone congratulations inspector she muttered and hung up with her hands on her hips she took several deep breaths to calm herself and to clear her head shed been worried sick her own fault she admitted ry was certainly under no obligation to come to her after work or to call even if he had been doing just that for days and even if she had waited by the phone for hours until simple fatigue spared her the continued humiliation put that aside she ordered herself the important matter here was that clarence jacoby was in custody there would be no more firesno more incidents and in the morning she promised herself as she stomped badtemperedly off to the bedroom shed track ry down and get the whole story in the meantime she thought as she slipped out of her robe all she had to do was teach herself to sleep alone again even as she settled onto the pillow she knew it was going to be a very long night chapter contents prev next since there seemed little point in going home after hed finished at the police station ry dropped down on the sagging sofa in his office and caught three hours sleep before the sirens awakened him following old habit his feet hit the floor before he remembered he didnt have to answer the bell any longer years of training would have allowed him to simply roll over and go back to sleep instead he staggered blearyeyed toward the coffeepot measuring flipping switches his only goal at the moment was to take a giant mug of coffee to the showers with him and to stay there for an hour he lit a cigarette scowling at the pot as it filled drop by stingy drop the brisk knock on his door only made his scowl deepen turning he aimed his bad temper at natalie your secretary isnt in too early he mumbled and rubbed a hand over his face why in hell did she always have to look so perfect go away natalie im not awake yet i wont go away struggling not to be hurt she set her briefcase down put her hands on her hips obviously she told herself hed had little or no sleep shed be patient ry i need to know what happened last night so i can plan what steps need to be taken i told you what happened you werent very generous with details muttering he snatched up a mug and poured the miserly half cup that had brewed we got your torch hes in custody he wont be lighting any fires for a while patience natalie reminded herself and took a seat clarence jacoby yeah he looked at her what choice did he have she was there stunning and polished and perfect why dont you go to work let me pull it together here ill have a report for you nerves jittered up her spine and down again is something wrong im tired he snapped i cant get a decent cup of coffee and i need a shower and i want you to stop breathing down my neck surprise registered first then retreated behind hurt im sorry she said voice cool and stiff as she rose i was concerned about what happened last night and i wanted to make sure you were all right since i can see that you are fine she picked up her briefcase and since you havent had time to put your report together ill get out of your way he swore dragging a hand through his hair natalie sit down please he added when she just stood aloofly in the doorway im sorry im feeling a little raw this morning and you made the mistake of being the first person in the line of fire i was worried about you she said it quietly but didnt step back into the room im fine turning away he topped off his coffee want some of this no i should have waited for you to contact me i realize that it was she thought like suddenly walking on eggshells one night apart shouldnt make them so awkward with each other if you had id have been worried about you he managed a smile it was low he decided real low to lash out at her because all at once he was deathly afraid of where they were heading sit down ill give you the highlights all right while she did he walked around his desk and kicked back in his chair i had an itch a hunch whatever i decided to take a run by your planttake a look around check the security myself he blew out a stream of smoke smiled through it somebody else had the same idea clarence yeah he was there it was a real party hed knocked out the alarm had himself a full set of keys to the rear door keys eyes sharpening natalie leaned forward thats right shiny new copies the cops have them now there wouldnt have been any sign of breakin he also had a couple of gallons of hightest gas a few dozen matchbooks so we started to have a little conversation i guess clarence didnt like the way it was going and he made a break for it ry paused drawing in smoke shaking his head ive never seen anything like it he murmured im still not sure i did see it what impatient natalie rapped a hand on his desk did you chase him didnt have to your pal took care of it my pal baffled she sat back again what pal nemesis her eyes went wide and stunned you saw him he was there yes and no or no and yes im not sure which he came out of the wall ry said half to himself he came out of the damn wall like smoke he wasnt there then he was then he wasnt natalie cocked a brow ry i really think you need some sleep no question about that rubbing the back of his stiff neck he blew out a breath but thats how it went he came out of the wall first his arms i was standing a foot away and i saw arms come out of the wall and grab clarence then he was just therenemesis clarence took one look at him and fainted enjoying the memory ry grinned folded up like a deck chair so nemesis hands him over to me and i haul him over my shoulder then hes gone clarence nemesis keep up she blinked trying to henemesisjust left he just went back into the wall into the air he flicked his fingers to demonstrate i dont know i probably stood there for five minutes with my mouth hanging open before i carried clarence to the truck brow knit natalie spoke slowly carefully youre telling me the man disappeared in front of your eyes just vanished thats exactly what im telling you ry she said still patient thats not possible i was there he reminded her you werent clarence came to and started babbling about ghosts he was so spooked he tried to jump out of the car while i was driving ry sipped at his coffee i had to knock him out you you knocked him out it was another memory he couldnt help but relish one short punch to that moonshaped jaw he was better off anyway hes in custody now hes not talking but im going to interview him in a couple hours and see if we can change that she sat silently for a moment trying to absorb it all and sort it out the business with nemesis was fascinating and not so difficult to explain it had been dark ry was a trained observer but even he could make a mistake in the dark people didnt just vanish rather than argue with him about it she focused on clarence jacoby he hasnt said why then if he was hired or by whom right now hes claiming he was just out for a walk with several gallons of gasoline oh he says i must have brought the gas with me im framing him because i got burned saving his worthless life insulted natalie lunged to her feet no one believes that her instant defense amused and touched him no legs nobodys buying it weve got him cold on this one and it shouldnt take long for the cops to tie him in with the other fires once clarence realizes hes looking at a long stretch hes likely to sing a different tune nobody likes to go down alone natalie nodded she didnt believe in honor among thieves if and when he does name someone ill need to know right away im limited as to the steps i can take in the meantime ry rapped his fingers on the desk he didnt like the possibility that someone in her organization someone who might be close to her could be behind the fires if clarence points the finger at one of your people the cops take the steps and theyre going to be a lot tougher on them than just firing them or taking away their dental plan im aware of that im also aware that even though the man who held the match had been caught and my property is safe its not over but the tension that had knotted her shoulders was smoothing away i appreciate you looking out for whats mine inspector thats what your tax dollars are for he studied her over the rim of his cup i missed being with you last night he said before he could stop himself her lips curved slowly good because i missed being with you we could make up for it tonight celebrate seeing my tax dollars at work yeah if he was sinking ry thought he just didnt have the energy to fight going under for the third time why dont we do that ill let you get that shower she bent down for her briefcase will you let me know what happens when you talk to clarence sure ill be in touch im going to plan on getting home early she said as she headed for the door good plan he murmured when the door shut behind her third time hell he thought hed drowned days ago and hadnt even noticed natalie arrived at work with a spring in her step and called a staff meeting by ten she was seated at the head of the table in the boardroom her department heads lining both sides of the polished mahogany im pleased to announce that the national grand opening of ladys choice will remain as scheduled for this coming saturday as expected there were polite applause and congratulatory murmurs id like to take this opportunity she continued to thank you all for your hard work and dedication launching a new company of this size takes teamwork long hours and constant innovation im grateful to all of you for giving me your best i particularly appreciate all of your help in the past couple of weeks when the company faced such unexpected difficulties she waited until the murmurs about the fires had died down im aware that our budget is stretched but im also aware that we wouldnt be on schedule without the extra effort each one of you and your staff have given therefore ladys choice is pleased to present bonuses to each and every employee on the first of next month this announcement was greeted with a great deal of enthusiasm only deirdre winced and rolled her eyes natalie flashed a grin at her that held more pleasure than apology we still have a great deal of work ahead of us natalie went on im sure deirdre will tell you that ive given her an enormous headache rather than a bonus natalie waited for the laughter to subside i have faith in her and in ladys choice warranting it in addition she paused the smile still in place her gaze sweeping from face to face i want to ease everyones mind last night the arsonist was apprehended hes now in police custody there was applause a barrage of questions natalie sat with her hands folded on the table watching for waiting for some sign that would tell her if one of the people sitting with her had begun to sweat i dont have all the details she said holding up a hand for quiet only that inspector piasecki apprehended the man outside our plant i expect a full report within fortyeight hours in the meantime we can all thank the diligence of the fire and police departments and get on with our jobs was there a fire at the plant donald wanted to know was anything damaged no i do know that the suspect was caught before he entered the building are they sure its the same one who started the fires at the warehouse and the flagship brow furrowed melvin tugged at his bow tie natalie smiled as a sister of a police captain im certain the authorities wont make a statement like that until they have absolute proof but thats the way it looks who is he donald demanded why did he do it again i dont have all the details hes a known arsonist a professional i believe im sure the motive will come to light before too long ry wasnt nearly as certain by noon hed been with jacoby for an hour covering the same ground the interrogation room was typically dull beige walls beige linoleum the wide mirror that everyone knew was twoway glass he sat on a rockhard chair leaning against the single table smoking lazily while clarence grinned and toyed with his own fingers you know theyre going to lock the door on you clarence ry said by the time you get out this round youll be so old you wont be able to light a match by yourself clarence grinned and shrugged his shoulders i didnt hurt nobody i never hurt nobody he looked up then his small pale eyes friendly you know some people like to burn other people you know that dont you ry yeah clarence i know that not me ry i never burned nobody the eyes lit up happily just you but that was an accident you got scars yeah i got scars me too clarence giggled pleased that they shared something wanna see maybe later i remember when we got burned clarence sure sure you do like a dragons kiss right like being in the bowels of hell ry thought the landlord paid you to light the dragon that time remember i remember nobody lived there it was just an old building i like old empty buildings the fire just eats along sniffs up the walls hides in the ceiling it talks to you youve heard it talk havent you yeah ive heard it who paid you this time clarence playfully clarence put the tips of his fingers together making a bridge i never said anybody paid me i never said i did anything you couldve brought the gas ry youre mad at me for burning you suddenly his smile was crafty you had nightmares in the burn ward i heard about them nightmares about the dragon and now you dont slay the dragon anymore the throb behind his eyes had ry reaching for another cigarette clarence was fascinated by the nightmares had probed time and again during the interview for details even if hed wanted to ry couldnt have given many it was all a blur of fire and smoke blessedly misted with time i had nightmares for a while i got over it i got over being mad at you too clarence we were both just doing our job right ry caught the glint in clarences eyes when the match was lit experimentally ry held the small flame between them its powerful isnt it he murmured just a little flame but you and me we know what it can doto wood paper flesh its powerful and when you feed it it gets stronger and stronger he touched the match to the tip of his cigarette still watching clarence ry licked his forefinger and snuffed out the flame douse it with water cut off its air and poof he tossed the broken match into the overburdened ashtray we both like to control it right yeah clarence licked his lips hoping ry would light another match you get paid for starting them i get paid for putting them out who paid you clarence theyre going to send me up anyway yeah so what have you got to lose nothing sly again clarence looked up at ry through thin pale lashes im not saying i started any fire but if we was to suppose maybe i did i couldnt say who asked me to why not because if we was to suppose i did i never saw who asked me to did you talk to him clarence began to play with his fingers again his face so cheerful ry had to grit his teeth to keep himself from reaching out and squeezing the pudgy neck maybe i talked to somebody maybe i didnt but maybe if i did the voice on the phone was all screwed up like a machine man or woman like a machine clarence repeated gesturing toward rys tape recorder maybe it could have been either maybe they just sent me money to a postoffice box before and after howd they find you clarence moved his right shoulder then his left maybe i didnt ask people find me when they want me his grin lit his face somebody always wants me why that warehouse i didnt say nothing about a warehouse clarence said pokering up why that warehouse ry repeated maybe pleased that ry was playing the game clarence scooted forward in his chair maybe for the insurance maybe because somebody didnt like who owned the place maybe for fun theres lots of reasons for fire ry pressed him and the store the same person owned the store there were pretty things in the store pretty girl things forgetting himself clarence smiled in reminiscence it smelled pretty too even prettier after i poured the gas who told you to pour the gas clarence i didnt say i did you just did clarence pouted like a child did not i said maybe the tape would prove different but ry kept his probing steady you liked the girl things in the store clarences eyes twinkled what store biting back an oath ry leaned back maybe i should call my friend back and let him talk to you what friend from last night you remember last night all color drained from clarences face he was a ghost he wasnt really there sure he was there you saw him you felt him a ghost clarence began to gnaw on his fingernails i didnt like him then youd better talk to me or im going to have to go get him panicked clarence darted his eyes around the room hes not here maybe he is ry said enjoying himself maybe he isnt who paid you clarence i dont know his lips began to tremble just a voice thats all take the money and burn i like money i like to burn started on the nice shiny desk in the store with the girl things just like the voice said to coulda done better in the storeroom but the voice said do the desk uneasy he looked around is he in here what about the envelopes where are the envelopes the money came in burned them clarence grinned again i like to burn things natalie very nearly burned the chicken it wasnt that she was incompetent in the kitchen it was simply she told herself that she rarely found the opportunity to use the culinary skills she possessedmeager though they might be with a great deal of cursing and trepidation she removed the browned chicken from the skillet and set it aside as per franks meticulous directions by the time she had the sauce simmering she was feeling smug cooking wasnt really such a big deal she decided if you just concentrated and went stepbystep read the recipe as if it were a contract she thought carefully sliding the chicken into the sauce overlook no clause study the small print and humming to herself she set the cover on the skillet then looked around at the wreck of her kitchen and she decided blowing the hair out of her eyes clean up after yourselfbecause no deal should ever look as though youd sweat over it it took her longer to set the kitchen and herself to rights than it had to prepare the meal after one quick glance at the time she dashed to light the candles and create the mood with a long sigh she dropped onto the arm of the sofa and scanned the room soft lights quiet music the scent of flowers and good food the golden glow of sedate flames in the hearth pleased natalie smoothed a hand down her long silk skirt everything was perfect she decided now where was ry he was pacing the hallway outside her door making too big a deal out of it piasecki he warned himself youre just two people enjoying each other no strings no promises now that clarence was in custody they would start to drift apart naturally no sweat no strain so why in the hell was he standing outside her door nervous as a teenager on a first date why was he holding a bunch of stupid daffodils in his hand he should never have brought her flowers in the first place he decided but if hed had the urge he should have gone for roses at least or orchids something with class just because the yellow blooms had caught his eye and the street vendor had been pushing them that was no reason to dump a bunch of backyard flowers on a woman like natalie he thought seriously about dropping them in front of her neighbors door the idea made him feel even more foolish muttering under his breath he pulled out his key and unlocked the door coming home it was a ridiculous sensation walking into an apartment that wasnt his but it was there as bold as a tenfoot sign as subtle as a peck on the cheek she rose from her perch on the couch and smiled at him hi hi he had the flowers behind his back hardly realizing the move was defensive she looked incredible the thinstrapped flowing dressthe color of ripe peachesskimming down candle and firelight flickering over her when she moved he swallowed the dress sliced open from the ankle to the trio of gold buttons running down her left hip long day she asked and kissed him lightly on the mouth yeah i guess his tongue had tied itself into knots you not too bad the good news has everybody pumped up i have some wine chilling she tilted her head smiling at him unless youd rather have a beer whatever he murmured as she strolled toward the table by the window which she had set for two it looks nice in here you look nice well i thought since we were celebrating she poured two glasses i had planned on doing this after the grand opening on saturday but it seems appropriate now with the glasses on the table behind her she held out a hand i have a lot to thank you for no you dont i did what i was paid to do he trailed off seeing that her gaze had shifted softened with some discomfort he realized it was riveted on the flowers hed used to gesture her thanks away you brought me flowers the simple shock in her voice didnt help his nerves this guy on the corner was selling them and i just daffodils she said with a sigh i love daffodils yeah miserably awkward he thrust them at her well here you go natalie buried her face in the bright trumpets and for reasons she couldnt fathom wanted to weep theyre so pretty so happy she lifted her head again eyes glowing so perfect thank you its no big but the rest of his words were cut off when her mouth closed over his instant desire like a switch flicked on inside him one touch he thought as his arms came hard around her and he wanted her her body molded to his her arms circled he fought back a desperate need to drag her to the floor and release the helpless passion she stirred up inside him youre tense she murmured stroking a hand over his shoulders did something happen with clarence during the interview that you didnt tell me no clarence jacoby and his moonpie face were the last things on rys mind im just wired i guess and in need of some basic control something smells good he said as he eased back besides you franks fricassee franks taking another step back ry reached for his wine guthries cook made us dinner no its his recipe she tucked her hair behind her ear i made us dinner ry snorted into his wine yeah right whered you get it the italian place torn between amusement and insult natalie took her wine i made it piasecki i know how to turn on a stove you know how to pick up the phone and order more relaxed now ry took her hand and pulled her toward the kitchen he walked directly to the skillet and lifted the lid it certainly looked homemade frowning he sniffed at the thick bubbling sauce covering the golden pieces of chicken you cooked this yourself exasperated natalie tugged her hand away and sipped her wine i dont see why that should be such a shock its just a matter of following directions you cooked this he said again shaking his head how come well because i dont know with a little snap of metal on metal she covered the skillet again i felt like it i just cant picture you puttering around the kitchen there wasnt a lot of puttering then she laughed and it wasnt a very pretty sight so no matter what it tastes like youre required to praise lavishly i need to put the flowers in water he waited while she got a vase and arranged the daffodils on the kitchen counter she looked softer tonight he thought all feminine and cozy and she handled each individual bloom as though hed brought her rubies unable to resist he lifted his hand to stroke it gently down her hair she looked up with surprise her uncertainty at the show of tenderness evident is something wrong no cursing himself he dropped his hand to his side i like to touch you her eyes cleared danced i know she turned into his arms inviting the chicken needs to simmer for a while she nipped lightly teasingly at his lip an hour anyway why dont we sit down he finished to keep from exploding he was not he absolutely was not going to drag her down and take her on the kitchen floor okay left uneasy by his withdrawal she nodded and picked up her wine again we should enjoy the fire in the living room she curled up next to him and rested her head on his shoulder obviously he had something on his mind she could wait for him to share it with her it was lovely just sitting here she thought with a sigh watching the fire together as dinner cooked and an old cole porter tune drifted through the speakers it was as if they sat like this every night comfortable with each other knowing there was time all the time in the world simply to be after a long busy day what better end could there be than to sit beside someone you loved and oh god her thoughts had her jerking straight upright loved she loved him whats wrong nothing she swallowed hard fought to keep her voice even just something i forgot i can deal with it later no shoptalk okay no she took a hasty sip of wine fine she couldnt get a decent nights sleep when he wasnt beside her shed had an irresistible urge to cook him a meal her heart turned over every time he smiled at her shed even been rerouting a business trip with him in mind oh why hadnt she seen it before it had been staring her in the face every time she looked in the mirror what was she going to do closing her eyes she ordered her body to relax her emotions were her problem she reminded herself she was a grown woman who had gone into an affair with the rules plain on both sides she couldntwouldntchange the terms in midstream what was needed was some clear and careful thought some time she added concentrating on breathing evenly then a plan she was an excellent planner after all his fingertips brushed lightly over her shoulder her pulse scrambled id better check on dinner it hasnt been an hour he liked the way she was curled against him and wanted to keep her there stupid to be worried about where they were heading he decided letting himself get drunk on the smell of her hair where they were now was exactly the right place to be i was going to make a salad she said uncertainly later he slid his fingers under her chin and turned her face toward his odd he thought it seemed as though his nerves had drained out of him and into her experimentally he dipped his head letting his lips cruise over hers she trembled against him intrigued he drew her lower lip into his mouth bathing it with his tongue while his eyes watched emotions come and go in hers she shuddered why are we always in a hurry he murmured addressing the question as much to himself as to her i dont know she had to get away clear her head before she made some foolish mistake we need more wine i dont think so slowly he brushed the hair back from her face so that he could frame it with his hands he held her there his eyes on hers do you know what i think natalie no she moistened her lips struggling to find her balance i think weve missed a step here i dont know what you mean he pressed his lips to her brow drew back and watched her eyes cloud seduction he whispered chapter contents prev next seduction she didnt need to be seduced she wanted him always wanted him before she realized she loved him she had equated her response to him as a kind of volatile chemical reaction but now couldnt he see her thoughts trailed off into smoke as his lips roamed lazily down her temple ry she put her hand to his chest told herself she would keep her voice light joking disentangle herself long enough to clear her mind and regain her balance but his fingers were stroking along her collarbone and his mouth was nipping closer closer to hers she only said ry again were good at moving straight ahead you and me arent we natalie but now there was something smooth and easy gliding through him fascinated by his own reaction he traced his tongue over her lips fast with no detours thats us i think its time we took a little side trip i think but she couldnt think not after his mouth fit itself to hers hed never kissed her like this before never like this so slow so deep with a lazy kind of possession that shot simmering heat straight to the marrow of her bones her body went lax as fluid as the wax pooling the wicks of the candles around them beneath her palm his heart beat hard and not quite steady and the low helpless sound that vibrated in her throat quickened it yet he continued that slow deep exploration of her mouth as if he would be content with that only that for hours her head fell back he cupped it shifting her slightly to change the angle of the kiss toying with her lips her tongue her breath caught and released caught and released shuddering once when his fingers brushed up over her breast now she knew now would come the speed and the power she understood there would be control again in the sheer lack of control as they rushed to take each other but his fingers simply skimmed up her throat and lay with devastating tenderness on her cheek in defense she reached for him pulling him tight against her not this time he drew back just enough to study her face confusion need and arousal made a beautiful combination however much his own blood was pounding he intended to confuse her more intended to see to each and every need and arouse her until her body was limp i want you she tore hurriedly at the buttons of his shirt now ry i want you now he pulled her down on the floor in front of the fire the light from the flames flickered over her skin danced in her hair she was golden like some exotic treasure a man might spend his life in search of and for now for tonight ry thought she was only his he stretched her arms out to the sides linked his fingers with hers youll have to wait he told her until im finished seducing you i dont need to be seduced she arched up to him offering her mouth her body herself lets see he covered her mouth with his softly dipping in when her lips trembled open under his hands hers flexed and gripped hard how often had he loved her it hadnt been long since theyd met but he couldnt count the number of times hed let his body take control go wild with hers this time hed make love to her with his mind i love your shoulders he murmured taking his mouth from hers for a slow exploration of the curve soft strong smooth with his teeth he caught the thin strap of her dress tugged it down until there was nothing between him and flesh warmth her taste her scent were all warmth absorbing them he trailed his tongue over her shoulder along the elegant line of throat down again until the other strap gave way and this spot here he rubbed his lips just above the silk that curved over her breast teasingly devastatingly he dampened the skin under the silk with his tongue until her body moved restlessly beneath his you should relax and enjoy natalie im going to be a while i cant the gentle brush of lips the solid weight of him were tormenting her kiss me again my pleasure there was a flicker of heat this time bright and hot before he banked the fires again she moaned straining against him wanting release craving the torture he made the choice for her kissing her with a focused intensity until her fingers went limp and her rushed breathing slowed and thickened smoke she could all but smell it she was rising up on clouds of it weightless helpless unable to do more than float and sigh when his mouth left hers to trail down again a gentle nip at the jaw and then light slow kisses down her throat her shoulders his body shifted downward his hands still covering hers inch by inch he tasted her nudging the silk down she felt his hair brush her breast then his mouth traveling around the curve nuzzling at the sensitive underside his tongue slid over her nipple shooting an ache down to her center then he caught the peak between his teeth making her moan his name and her body began to throb to a low primitive beat he wanted her to absorb him and all the pleasure he could give her her eyes were closed her lips just parted and much too tempting he needed to taste them again and when he did he let himself sink into the texture the flavor time spun out there was power here in tenderness hed never felt it before not in himself and certainly not for anyone else but for her he had a bottomless well of tenderness of soft sumptuous kisses of endless sighs he took his hands from hers to shrug out of his shirt to feel the thrill of his flesh against her flesh sliding smooth building heat with a murmur of approval he slipped his hand through the slit of her skirt lightly caressing teasing the edge of some frilly something she wore beneath he flicked open a button then two then the third fascinated by the way the material slid and parted under his hands nuzzling along her bared hip he fought back a sudden vicious urge to take when her hands brushed then pressed at his shoulders more he promised himself there was more for his own pleasure he slipped the silk aside and found more beneath she wore a fancy of silk and lace the same color as the dress that pooled beside them strapless it hugged her breasts rode high up her hips letting out a long breath he sat back on his heels and toyed with one lacy garter natalie weak she was so gloriously weak she could barely open her eyes when she did she saw only him the firelight teasing the red out of his dark hair his eyes nearly black she reached out her arm heavy nearly boneless he merely took her hand and kissed it i wanted to tell you how happy i am youre in the lingerie business her lips curved she nearly managed a laugh before with one quick flick he detached the first garter she could only utter a helpless moan and how beautiful you look flick went the second garter modeling your own products with his eyes on hers he rolled the stocking down thigh and knee and calf her vision hazed she could feel him oh god she could feel himevery brush of fingertip and mouth surrender had come gliding through her like a shadow and had left her completely vulnerable whatever he wanted anything he wanted she would give as long as he never stopped touching her there was the low steady heat from the fire it was nothing nothing compared to the slow bum he had kindled inside her as if down a long velvetlined tunnel she could hear the music still a quiet backdrop to her own trembling breathing the scent of flowers and candle wax the taste of him and the wine that lingered on her tongue all melded together into one stunning intoxication then he slipped a finger under the laceedged hem sliding it slowly toward and then into the heat she erupted her body quaked and reared his name burst from her lips even as the staggering pleasure careened through her system she was wrapped around him as the power of the climax built in force then echoed away and left her drained she wanted to tell him she was empty had to be empty but he was peeling away the silk and lace exposing her with those clever fingers swallowing whatever words she might have spoken with that relentlessly patient mouth i want to fill you natalie his hands werent as steady as they had been but he laid her gently back on the carpet so that he could tug off his clothes all of you with all of me while the blood pounded in his ears he began a slow journey up her legs stroking the fires again waiting watching for that moment before she would flash again he felt her body tense saw the power of what was to come flicker over her face even as she cried out he was inside her it was almost painful to hold himself back and it was very sweet seeing her heavy eyes open seeing the glaze of pleasure cloud them as he fought to keep from racing for the finish swamped by a swirl of sensations all but suffocating in the layers of them she groped for his hands when their fingers locked again her heart was ready to burst her eyes stayed open and looked on his as each thrust rocked them pushed them closer then she was cartwheeling off the edge reeling tumbling free his mouth came to hers his lips forming her name as he leapt with her twice on the elevator ride to her office the next morning natalie caught herself singing both times she cleared her throat shifted her briefcase from hand to hand and pretended not to notice the speculative looks of her fellow passengers so what she thought as the elevator climbed she felt like singing she felt like dancing so what she was in love and what was wrong with that she asked herself as the elevator stopped to let off passengers on the thirtyfirst floor everyone was entitled to be in love to feel as though their feet would never touch the ground again to know the air had never smelled sweeter the sun had never shone brighter it was wonderful to be in love so wonderful she wondered why shed never tried it before because thered never been ry before she thought and grinned how foolish shed been to panic when she realized what she felt for ry how cowardly and ridiculous to be afraid even for a moment of loving if it made a woman vulnerable comical if it dazed and baffled her what was wrong with that love should make you feel giddy and strong and softheaded shed just never realized it before humming to herself she stepped out of the elevator on her floor and all but waltzed toward her office good morning ms fletcher maureen glanced surreptitiously at her clock it wasnt up to her to point out that the boss was late even three minutes late was a precedent for natalie fletcher good morning maureen she all but sang it and thrust out a clutch of daffodils oh thank you theyre lovely everyone should have daffodils this morning absolutely everyone natalie shook back her hair scattering raindrops its a gorgeous day isnt it drizzling and chilly was what it was but maureen found herself grinning back absolutely a classic spring morning youve got a conference call scheduled for ten atlanta chicago i know and ms marks was hoping you could fit her in afterward fine oh and youre due at the flagship at right after your with mr hawthorne no problem you have a lunch with ill be there natalie called out and swung into her office for the first time in recent memory natalie bypassed the coffeepot she didnt need caffeine to pump through her blood it was already swimming she hung up her coat set her briefcase aside then moved to the office safe behind her favorite abstract print taking out a pair of disks she went to her desk to draft a brief memo to deirdre an hour later she was elbowdeep in work making hasty notes as she juggled information and requests from three of her branches on the conference call ill fax authorization for that within the hour she promised atlanta donald see if you can squeeze out the time to go to the flagship with me we can have our meeting on the way ive got an with marketing he told her let me see if i can push it to after lunch id appreciate it id like tear sheets of all the ads and newspaper articles in chicago you can fax copies but id like you to overnight the originals ill be checking in with la and dallas this afternoon and well have a full report for all branches by end of day tomorrow she sat back let out a long breath gentlemen synchronize your watches and alert the troops ten am saturday coast to coast after she closed the conference natalie pressed her buzzer maureen let deirdre know im free for about twenty minutes oh and buzz melvin for me hes in the field ms fletcher oh right annoyed with her lapse natalie glanced at her watch calculated time ill see if i can catch him at the plant later this afternoon leave a memo on his voice mail that i should be by around three yes maam after you buzz deirdre get me the head of shipping at the new warehouse right away by the time deirdre knocked on the door and stepped in natalie was tapping at the keys on her desk computer yes i see that phone tucked at her ear she gestured deirdre to a seat put a trace on that shipment i want it in atlanta no later than am tomorrow she nodded tapped let me know as soon as its located thanks she hung up brushed a stray hair from her cheek theres always a glitch near zero hour deirdres brow wrinkled bad no just a slight delay on a shipment even without it atlantas well stocked for the opening but i dont want them to run low coffee no ive already burned a hole in my stomach lining thanks or you have she aimed a steely look at her boss bonuses bonuses natalie agreed i have the percentages i want you to work with right here salary ratios and so forth she smiled a little i figured you wouldnt be wondering about how best to murder me if i did the preliminaries wrong now natalie laughed deirdre do you know why i value you so highly nope you have a mind like a calculator the bonuses were earned and i also consider them a good investment incentive to keep up the pace during the weeks ahead theres usually a dip after the initial sales in a new business both in profit and in labor i think this will keep that dip from becoming a dive thats all very well in theory deirdre began lets make it reality and since its basically a standard ratio across the board id like you to hand the problem over to your assistant that way you can concentrate on running the audit still smiling she handed over the disks and her memo a great deal of what youll need to run will be parallel with tax preparation take whatever time and however many bodies in accounting you feel youll need with a grimace deirdre accepted the disk you know why i value you so highly natalie nope because theres no budging you and you give impossible orders with such reasonableness its a gift natalie agreed you might want these hard copies deirdre rose hefting the file thanks a lot anytime she glanced up with a smile as donald poked his head in the door im clear until he told her great well head out now take your time natalie repeated to deirdre as she crossed to the closet for her coat as long as i have the first figures on this quarters profit and loss and the totals from each department by the end of next week deirdre rolled her eyes at donald reasonably impossible she set the disks on top of the file youre next she warned him dont let her scare you donald shes just gearing up to pit black ink against red natalie sailed through the door just make sure the black wins quite a mood shes in donald murmured to deirdre shes flying all right deirdre stared down at the files lets hope we can keep it that way perfect isnt it content after their visit to the store natalie stretched out her legs in the back of the car while her driver threaded through the lunchhour traffic youd never know there was a fire a hell of a job donald agreed and the window treatments spectacular the salesclerks are going to be run ragged come saturday im counting on it she touched a hand to his arm a lot of its your doing donald we never would have gotten off the ground like this without you especially after the warehouse damage control he brushed off her thanks with a shrug in six months well barely remember we had damage to control and the profits will bring a smile even to deirdres face he was counting on it that would be a real coup just drop me off at the next corner he told the driver the restaurants only a couple of doors down i appreciate you making time to go with me no problem seeing the flagship back in shape made my day it wasnt pleasant visualizing the office torn up like that that wonderful antique desk ruined the replacements stunning by the way i had it shipped out from colorado natalie said absently as something niggled at her brain i had it in storage well its perfect he patted her hand as the car swung to the curb she waved him off then settled back dissatisfied when the car merged back into traffic then with a shrug she gauged the traffic the distance to her lunch meeting and decided she had time for one quick phone call ry answered himself on the third ring arson piasecki hi the pleasure of hearing his voice wiped out everything else your secretarys out lunch and youre having yours at your desk he glanced down at the sandwich he had yet to touch yeah more or less he shifted making his chair squeak where are you looks like twelfth and hyatt heading east toward the menagerie ah the menagerie he thought highclass no tuna on wheat for lunch there he could see her ordering designer water and a salad with every leaf called a different name look legs about tonight i was thinking about that maybe you could meet me at the goose neck she rolled her shoulders i have a feeling im going to want to unwind he rubbed a hand over his chin i ah come by my place instead okay your place this was new shed stopped wondering why hed never taken her there yeah about seven seventhirty all right do you want me to pick up something for dinner no ill take care of it see you he hung up and sat back in his chair he was going to have to take care of a lot of things he picked up chinese it was nearly seven when ry carried the little white cartons up the two flights to his apartment he took a good look around while he did it wasnt a dump unless of course you compared it with natalies glossy building there was no graffiti on the walls but the walls were thin as he climbed the steps ry could hear the muted sounds of televisions playing children squabbling the steps themselves were worn down in the centers from the passage of countless feet as he turned onto the second floor he heard a door slam beneath him all right all right ill go get the damn beer myself lip curled ry unlocked his door yeah he thought it was a real class joint there was a definite scent of garlic in the hall courtesy of his neighbor he assumed the woman was always cooking up pots of pasta he let himself in flicked on the lights and studied the room it was clean a little dusty maybe he barely spent enough time in it to mess it up it had been nearly three weeks since hed spent a night there the sofa that folded out into a bed needed recovering it wasnt something hed noticed before or would have bothered with but now the faded blue upholstery annoyed him he walked past it taking about half a dozen steps into the alcove that served as his kitchen he got out a beer and popped the top the walls needed painting too he decided chugging the beer as he looked around and the bare floors could have used a carpet but it served him well enough didnt it he thought grimly he didnt need fancy digs just a couple of rooms a short hop from the office hed been content here for nearly a decade that was enough for anyone but it wasnt enough couldnt be enough for natalie she didnt belong here he knew it and hed asked her to come to prove it to both of them the night before had been a revelation to him that she could make him feel the way shed made him feel that she could make him forget as hed forgotten that there was anything or anyone on the planet except the two of them it wasnt fair to either of them to go on this way the longer he let it drift the more he needed her and the more he needed the more difficult it would be to let her walk away his divorce hadnt hurt him oh a couple of twinges he thought now plenty of regrets but no real pain not the deeprooted searing kind of pain he was already feeling at the thought of living without natalie he could keep her there was a good chance he could keep her the physical thing between them was outrageously intense even if it faded by half it would still be stronger than anything hed ever experienced before and he was well aware of his effect on her he could hold her with sex alone it might be enough for her but hed understood when he awakened beside her this morning that it wasnt enough for him no it wasnt enough not when hed started to imagine white picket fences kids in the yardthe kind of things that went with marriage permanence a lifetime that hadnt been the deal he reminded himself and he had no right to change the rules to expect her to settle hed already proven he wasnt any good at marriage and that had been with someone from his own neighborhood his own lifestyle no way was he going to fit in with natalie and the fact that he wanted to needed to scared the hell out of him worse than that even worse was the idea that she would turn him down cold if he asked her to try he wanted all of her or nothing so it made sense didnt it to push her out before he got in any deeper and he would do it here right here where the differences between them would slap her between the eyes at the knock of his door he carried his beer over to answer it it was just as hed thought she stood in the hallway slim golden an exotic fish completely out of water she smiled at him leaning up to kiss him hi hi come on in no trouble finding the place no she skimmed her sweep of hair back looking around i took a cab good thinking if you left that fancy car on the street around here thered be nothing left but the door handles when you went back out want a beer no interested she wandered over to the window not much of a view he said knowing she was looking out at the face of the next building not much she agreed its still raining she added and slipped out of her coat she smiled when she spotted another of his basketball trophies mvp she murmured reading the plaque impressive i say i can outscore you nine times out of ten i wasnt fresh he turned into the kitchen i dont have any wine thats okay mmm chinese she opened one of the cartons hed set on the counter and sniffed im starved all i had was a stingy salad for lunch ive been all over the city today nailing down details for saturday where are the plates very much at home she opened a cabinet herself im really going to have to make a sweep of the branches next week i was thinking she broke off when she turned back and found him staring at her what nothing he muttered and took the plates out of her hands she wasnt supposed to stride right in and start chattering he thought and dumped food on a plate she was supposed to see how wrong it was right from the start she was supposed to make it easy on him damn it do you see where you are he whirled on her taking her back a step she blinked ah in the kitchen look around you incensed he took her by the arm and dragged her into the next room look around this is it this is the way i live this is the way i am all right she pushed his hand away because his fingers hurt trying to oblige she took another survey of the room it was spartan masculine in its very simplicity small she noted but not crowded a table across the room held framed snapshots of a family she hoped to get a closer look at it could use some color she decided after a moment im not asking for decorating advice he snapped out there was something under the anger in his tone something final that had her heart stuttering very slowly she turned back to him what are you asking for cursing he spun into the kitchen for his beer if she was going to look at him with that confused wounded look in her eyes he was a dead man so he would have to be cruel and he would have to be quick he sat on the arm of the couch and tipped back his beer lets get real here natalie you and i started this thing because we were hot for each other she could feel the warmth drain out of her cheeks leaving them cold and stiff but she kept her eyes level and her voice steady yes thats right things happened fast the sex the investigation things got tangled up did they his mouth was dry and the beer wasnt helping youre a beautiful woman i wanted you you had a problem it was my job to fix it for you which you did she said carefully for the most part the copsll track down whoever was paying clarence until they do youve got to be careful but things are pretty much under control on that level and on the personal level he frowned down into the bottle i figure its time to step back take a clearer look natalies legs were trembling she locked her knees to stop it are you dumping me ry im saying weve got to look behind the way things are in bed the way you are he lifted his gaze the way im not weve got plenty of heat natalie the problem with that is you get blinded by the smoke time to clear the air thats all i see she wouldnt beg nor would she cry not in front of him not when he was looking at her so coolly his voice so casual as he cut out her heart she wondered if hed been so gentle so loving and sweet the night before because hed already decided to break things off well i suppose youve cleared it despite her resolve her vision blurred the lamplight refracting in the tears that trembled much too close to the surface the minute her eyes filled he was on his feet dont i wont believe me i wont but the first tear spilled over as she turned toward the door i appreciate you not doing this in a public place she clamped a hand over the doorknob her fingers were numb she realized she couldnt even feel them natalie im all right to prove it to both of them she turned to face him her head up im not a child and this isnt the first relationship ive had that hasnt worked it is the first time for something though and youre entitled to know it you jerk she sniffed and wiped a tear away ive never been in love with anyone before but i fell in love with you i hate you for it she yanked open the door and dashed out without her coat chapter contents prev next for ten minutes ry paced the room convincing himself hed done the right thing for both of them sure shed be a little hurt her pride was bruised he hadnt exactly been a diplomat for the next ten he worked on convincing himself that she hadnt meant what shed said that parting shot had been just that a weapon hurled to hurt as shed been hurt she wasnt in love with him she couldnt be because if she was then he was the worlds biggest idiot oh god he was the worlds biggest idiot he snatched up her coat forgot his own and raced downstairs and out into the rain hed left his car at the station and cursed himself for it praying for a cab he loped to the corner then to the next working his way across town his impatience cost him more time than a simple wait would have by the time he hailed an empty cab he was twelve blocks from his home and soaking wet the cab fought its way through rain and traffic creeping along then sprinting creeping then sprinting until ry tossed a fistful of money at the driver and leapt out hed have made better time on foot nearly an hour had passed by the time he arrived at natalies door maureen gave serious thought to calling security its company policy he gave a oneword assessment of company policy and pulled out his id do you see this im in charge of the arson investigation ive got information ms fletcher requires immediately now if you dont let me know where to reach her ill have to go to my superiors he let that hang and hoped torn maureen bit her lip it was true ms fletcher had ordered her specifically not to divulge her itinerary it was also true that during the harried phone call the night before nothing had been mentioned specifically about information from inspector piasecki and if it was something to do with the fires shes staying at the ritzcarlton atlanta before shed finished the sentence ry was out the door it was best he decided if a man was going to whimper to do it in private fifteen minutes later he burst into his office startling his secretary and slammed the door behind him ritzcarlton atlanta get them on the phone yes sir he paced his office muttering to himself until she signaled him natalie fletcher he barked into the phone connect me yes sir one moment please one endless moment while the line whispered then began to ring ry let out a long relieved breath when he heard natalies voice at the other end nataliewhat the hell are you doing in atlanta i need to then he could only swear as the phone clicked loudly in his ear damn it all to hell and back get that number for me again wideeyed his secretary hurriedly placed the call calm ry ordered himself he knew how to be calm in the face of fire and death and misery surely he could be calm now but when the phone continued to ring and he pictured her coolly looking out the window of her hotel room and ignoring it he nearly ripped the receiver out of the wall he didnt bother to knock but used the key she hadnt thought to demand back from him there was no welcome this time no cozy sense of coming home he knew the minute he stepped inside that she wasnt there denying it he called out for her and began a dripping search through the apartment so hed wait he told himself shed come home sooner or later and hed be there make things right again somehow hed grovel if he had to he decided pacing from the living room to the bedroom shed probably gone to her office maybe he should go there he could call he could send a telegram he could do something good god the woman was in love with him and hed used both hands to shove her out the door he dropped to the side of the bed and snatched up the phone it was then that he saw the note hastily scrawled on the nightstand atlantanational national he thought national airlines the airport ry was out of the apartment and harassing the doorman for a cab in three minutes flat he missed her plane by less than five no inspector piasecki i dont know precisely when ms fletcher expects to return cautiously maureen smiled the man looked wild as though hed spent a very rough night in his clothes things were upended enough with the bosss sudden trip without her having to face down a madman at am where is she ry demanded hed very nearly caught the next flight out to atlanta the night before but then it had occurred to him that he didnt have a clue where to find her im sorry inspector im not allowed to give you that information i will be happy to relay any message you might have when ms fletcher calls in i want to know where she is ry said between his teeth call the airport ry ordered while his secretary goggled at him book me on the next available flight to atlanta she was gone when he got there he couldnt believe it more than ten hours after his rushed departure ry was back in urbana alone he hadnt even managed to see her hed spent hours on planes more time chasing her around atlanta from her hotel to the downtown branch of ladys choice back to her hotel to the airport each time hed missed her by inches it was he thought as he trudged up the stairs to his apartment as if shed known he was behind her he dropped down on the couch rubbing his hands over his face he had no choice but to wait im so glad to see you althea grayson nightshade smiled as she rubbed a hand over her mountain of a belly that goes double natalie laughed literally how are you feeling oh like a cross between the goodyear blimp and moby dick neither of them ever looked so good it was true natalie mused pregnancy had only enhanced altheas considerable beauty her eyes were gold her skin was dewy her hair was a fiery cascade to her shoulders im fat but im healthy altheas lips twitched colts been a demon about seeing that i eat right sleep enough exercise rest he even typed up a daily schedule mr playitbyear went into a tailspin when he found out we were expecting the nurserys wonderful natalie wandered the sunny mintandwhite room running her fingers over the antique crib the fussy dottedswiss curtains ill be glad when its filled any time now althea said with a sigh i feel great really but i swear this has been the longest pregnancy in recorded history i want to see my baby damn it she stopped and laughed at herself listen to me i never thought id want children much less be itching to change the first diaper intrigued natalie looked over her shoulder althea sat in a rocking chair a small poorly knit blanket in her hands no you never wanted to be a mom not with the job and my background she shrugged didnt figure i was cut out for it then along comes nightshade and then this she patted her belly maybe gestating isnt my natural milieu but ive loved every minute of it now im antsy to get on to the nurturing can you see me she said with a laugh sitting here rocking a baby yes i can natalie came back crouched and took altheas hands i envy you thea so much to have someone who loves you to make a baby between you nothing else is as important defenses crumbled her eyes filled oh honey what is it what else disgusted with herself natalie straightened a man a jerk she fought back the tears and stuffed her hands in her pockets would this jerk be an arson investigator althea smiled a little when natalie scowled at her news travels even to denver the fact is your family and colt and i have been biting our tongues trying not to ask what youre doing out here i explained im siting i want to open another branch here i was traveling anyway instead of being in urbana for your opening she resented that laid the blame for it right at rys doorstep i was in dallas for the opening there each of my branches is of equal importance to me yeah and word is it was a smash the tallies for the first weeks sales look promising so why arent you back home basking in it althea inclined her head the jerk im entitled to a little time before i well yes she admitted the jerk he dumped me oh come on cilia said the guy was crazy about you we were good in bed natalie said flatly then pressed her lips together i made the mistake of falling in love with him a real first for me and he broke my heart im sorry concerned althea pushed herself out of the chair ill get over it natalie squeezed altheas offered hands its just that ive never felt this way about anyone i didnt know i could ive managed to get through my whole life without being hurt like this then pow its like being cut into very small pieces she murmured i just havent been able to put them all back together yet well hes not worth it althea said loyally i wish that were true itd be easier hes a wonderful man tough sweet dedicated she moved her shoulders restlessly he didnt mean to hurt me hes called several times while ive been on the road he must want to apologize to make things up with you do you think id give him the chance natalies chin angled im not taking his calls im not taking anything from him he can send me flowers all over the country for all the difference it would make he sends you flowers a smile was beginning to lurk around the corners of altheas mouth daffodils every time i turn around im getting a bunch of idiotic daffodils she set her teeth does he think im going to fall for that again probably well im not one broken hearts enough for me more than enough maybe you should go back let him beg then kick him in the teeth althea winced at the twinge the third one she noted with a glance at her watch in the past half hour im thinking about it but until im ready im not natalie broke off what is it are you all right yeah althea let out a long breath this twinge was lasting longer you know i think i could be going into labor what the blood drained out of natalies face now sit sit down for gods sake ill get colt maybe i will gingerly althea lowered herself back into the chair maybe youd better deirdre was glad shed decided to take the work home with her the miserable cold shed picked up from somewhere was hanging on like a leech at least she could take her mind off her stuffy head and scratchy throat with work she sniffed disinterestedly at the cup of instant chicken soup shed zapped in the microwave and indulged herself with the hot toddy instead nothing like a good shot of whiskey to make a cup of tea sit up and sing if she was lucky very lucky shed have the cold on the run and the preliminary figures in before natalie got back from denver she took another hefty slug of the spiked tea and tapped keys she stopped frowned and adjusted her glasses that couldnt be right she thought and tapped more keys no way in hell could that be right her mouth became drier and a thin line of sweat rolled down her back that had nothing to do with the slight fever she was fighting she sat back and took a couple of easy breaths it was simply a mistake she assured herself shed find the discrepancy and fix it that was all but it didnt take much longer for her to realize it wasnt a mistake or an accident it was a quarter of a million dollars and it was gone she snatched up the phone and rapidly dialed maureen deirdre marks ms marks you sound dreadful i know listen i need to talk to natalie right away who doesnt its urgent maureen shes with her brother right let me have the number i cant do that ms marks its urgent i tell you i understand but shes not there her plane left denver an hour ago shes on her way home a son althea and colt had a son a tiny and beautiful boy it had taken althea twelve hard hours to push him into the world and hed come out howling natalie remembered it now as her plane traveled east it had been a thrill to be allowed in the birthing room to support colt when he was ready to climb the walls to watch him and althea work together to welcome that new life she hadnt wept until it was over until shed left colt and althea nuzzling their new son boyd had left the hospital with her hed either been too deep in the memories of his own childrens births or had sensed her mood either way he hadnt badgered her now she was going home because there was work to do and because it was cowardly to keep jumping from city to city because she was hurt it had been a good trip professionally successful personally soothing she was going to give some thought to moving back to colorado shed found an excellent site and a new branch in denver would benefit from her personal touch if the move would have the added benefit of escape whose business was it but hers she would have to wait of course until they had unearthed whoever had paid clarence jacoby if it was indeed one of her people in urbana that person had to be weeded out once that was done donald could take over that office it would be a simple matter donald had the talent from a business standpoint the change would be little more than having him move from his office to hers his desk to hers desk she thought frowning there was something odd about the desk not her desk she realized all at once the desk that had been damaged at the flagship hed known about that her heart began to thud uncomfortably how had donald known the desk in the managers office was an antique how had he known specifically that it had been damaged cautiously she began to think over the details recalling her movements from the time of the second fire to the day she and donald had visited the flagship he hadnt been in the office there since it had been decorated at least not to her knowledge so how could he have known the desks had been switched because hed been there that was all she tried to assure herself hed swung by at some point and hadnt mentioned it it made sense more sense than believing he had had something to do with the fires yet hed been at the warehouse the morning after it had burned early she remembered had she called him she couldnt be sure didnt recall he could have heard about it on the news had there been reports that early detailed reports she wasnt sure about that either and it worried her why should he do something so drastic to harm a business he was an integral part of she wondered what possible motive could there be for him to want to see stock and equipment destroyed stock equipment and she thought on a jolt of alarm records thered been records at the warehouse and at the flagshipat the point of the fires origin determined to keep calm she thought of the files shed given deirdre of the copies still in the safe at her office shed check them herself the minute she landed just to ease her mind she was wrong about donald of course she had to be wrong she was late it was a hell of a thing ry thought as he paced the gate area at the airport for a woman who was so fixated on being on time now when he was all but jumping out of his skin she had to be late it didnt matter that the plane was late and she just happened to be on it he took it as a personal affront if maureen hadnt taken pity on him he wouldnt have known she was coming back tonight it grated a bit to know that natalies secretary felt sorry for him that she must have seen that he looked like a lovesick mongrel even the men at the station were starting to talk about him behind his back oh he knew it all right the mutters the snickers the pitying looks anybody with eyes in his head could see that the past ten days had been torment for him hed made a mistake damn it one little mistake and shed paid him back bigtime they were just going to have to put that behind them he clutched the daffodils paced and felt like a fool his heart took one frantic leap when her flight was announced he saw her and his palms began to sweat she saw him turned sharply left and kept walking natalie he caught up with her in two strides welcome home go to hell ive been there for the past ten days i dont like it it wasnt hard to keep up with her since she was wearing heels here she glanced down at the daffodils cutting a scathing look up to his face you dont want me to tell you what you can do with those stupid flowers do you you could have talked to me when i called i didnt want to talk to you deliberately she swung into the closest ladies room ry gritted his teeth and waited she told herself she wasnt pleased that he was still there when she came out saying nothing she quickened her pace toward the baggageclaim area how was your trip she snarled at him look im trying to apologize here is that what youre doing with a toss of her head she stepped onto the escalator heading down save it i screwed up im sorry ive been trying to tell you for days but you wont take my calls that should indicate something piasecki even to someone of your limited intelligence so he continued biting back hot words im here to pick you up so we can talk ive ordered a car we canceled it that is he had to choose his words carefully with that icy look in her eyes freezing him i canceled it when i found out you were coming in no need to make maureen fry with him he decided so ill give you a lift ill take a cab dont be so damn stubborn ill get tough if i have to he muttered as they joined the throng at baggage claim i can have you up in a firemans carry in two seconds embarrass the hell out of you either way im driving you home she debated he would embarrass her there was no point in giving him the satisfaction nor was she going to tell him of her suspicions not until she had something solid not until she had no choice but to deal with him on a professional level im not going home i need to go to the office the office is closed its almost nine oclock im going to the office she said flatly and turned away from him fine well talk at the office that one she pointed to a gray tweed pullman and that one a matching garment bag and that another pullman you didnt have time to pack all this before i got to your apartment that night interested despite herself she watched him heft cases i picked up luggage and clothes along the way enough for a damn modeling troupe he muttered i beg your pardon her tone lowered the temperature in the terminal by ten degrees nothing your opening made a real splash he continued as they walked out of the terminal it met our expectations youre getting writeups in newsday and business week he shrugged when she looked at him i heard and womens wear daily she added but whos counting ive been its great natalie really im happy for you proud of you he set her luggage beside his car and his limbs went weak god ive missed you she stepped back evading him when he reached for her he was not going to hurt her again she promised herself she would not allow it okay slowly stunned by the ache that one quick rejection caused he lifted his hands palms out i had that coming ive got plenty coming ill give you the chance to take all the shots you want im not interested in fighting with you she said wearily ive had a long trip im too tired to fight with you let me take you home natalie im going to the office she stepped back and waited for him to unlock the car once inside she sat back and shut her eyes she just sighed when ry laid the bright yellow flowers in her lap they ah havent gotten any more out of clarence he said hoping to chip at the wall shed erected between them i know she couldnt think about her suspicions yet ive kept in touch you moved around fast i had a lot of ground to cover yeah he dug out money for the parking attendant i got the picture after i chased you around atlanta she opened her eyes then excuse me i couldnt get a damn cab he muttered you must have hooked one the minute you walked out of my apartment yes i did figures im running the marathon to your apartment then youre gone when i get there i see the note figure the airport and get there in time to see your plane take off she felt herself softening and stiffened is that supposed to be my fault piasecki no its not your fault damn it its my fault but if you could have sat still in atlanta for five minutes wed have settled this we have settled it not by a long shot turning his head he aimed a deadly look at her i hate it when people hang up on me it was she said with relish my pleasure i might have strangled you for it when i got down there if i could have caught you no ms fletchers at her shop then i get to the shop and its sorry ms fletchers gone back to her hotel i get back to the hotel and youve checked out i get to the airport and youre in the sky i spent hours chasing my tail trying to catch up with you she shrugged she didnt want to be pleased but she couldnt prevent a little frisson of pleasure at the frustration in his voice dont expect an apology still she gathered up the flowers to keep them from sliding from her lap when he braked im trying to give you one theres no need ive had time to think about it and ive decided you were absolutely right i dont like the style you used but the bottom line rings true we had some interesting chemistry thats all we had a lot more than that weve got more than that natalie this is my stop forgetting her luggage she bolted out of the car by the time ry had parked illegally she was waiting for the security guard to open the front door of her building damn it natalie would you hold still i have work good evening ben ms fletcher working late thats right she breezed past the guard with ry at her heels theres no need for you to come up with me ry you said you loved me ignoring the guards speculative look natalie pressed the elevator button i got over it panic spurted through him freezing him in place he barely made it into the elevator before the doors shut in his face you did not i know what i did i know what i didnt she jabbed the button for her floor its all ego with you youre causing a scene because i didnt come back when you called she tossed her hair back her eyes were bright not with tears he saw with some relief but with anger because i dont need you it has nothing to do with ego i was he couldnt admit hed been scared downtothebone scared i was wrong he said that was hard enough but at least it wasnt humiliating it was youthere in my place i asked you to come because it was so obvious what was obvious that it couldnt be real i didnt see how it could be real who you are the way you are and me her eyes sharpened narrowed am i following you here inspector you dumped me because i didnt fit in with your apartment it didnt have to sound that stupid his voice rose in defense with everything with me i cant give you the things the first time i remembered i should give you flowers once in a while you looked at me like id clipped you on the jaw i never take you anywhere i dont think of it youve got friends who live in mansions and look damn it youve got diamonds in your ears right now he tossed up his hands as if that should explain everything diamonds for gods sake her cheeks were hot now she was all but radiating heat as she stepped toward him is this about money is that it you broke my heart over money no its about things how could he explain what made no sense at all anymore natalie let me touch you the hell with you she shoved him back bounding through the elevator the minute the doors open you tossed me aside because you thought i wanted you to get me diamonds or a mansion or flowers furious she tossed the daffodils on the floor i can get my own diamonds or anything else i want what i wanted was you dont walk away dont swearing he rushed after her somewhere down the long corridor a phone rang natalie he grabbed her by the shoulders spun her around i didnt think that exactly she rammed her briefcase hard into his gut and you had the nerve to call me a snob out of patience he rammed her back against the wall it was wrong it was stupid i was stupid what more do you want me to say i wasnt thinking i was just feeling you hurt me i know he rested his brow on hers tried to get his bearings he could smell her feel her and the thought of losing her made him weak in the knees im sorry i didnt know i could hurt you i thought it was just me i thought youd walk so you walked first he drew back a little something like that coward she jerked away go away ry leave me alone i have to think about this youre still in love with me im not going anywhere until you tell me then youll have to wait because im not ready to tell you anything phones were ringing wearily rubbing her temple natalie wondered who would be calling so long after hours im raw dont you understand i realized i loved you and had you break it off almost simultaneously im not going to serve you my emotions on a platter then ill give you mine he said quietly i love you natalie her heart swam into her eyes damn you damn you thats not fair i cant be worried about fair he stepped closer and reached out to touch her hair his hand froze when he saw the flicker of light at the end of the hall it danced through the glass in a pattern he recognized too well take the fire stairs down now call dispatch what what are you talking about go he repeated and dashed down the hall he could smell smoke now and cursed it cursed himself for being so intent on his own needs that hed missed it he saw it the crafty plume under the door that flowed out sucked in oh god ry she was right behind him he had time to see the flames writhing behind the glass time to judge then he turned leapt and knocked natalie to the ground as the window exploded lethal shards of glass rained over them chapter contents prev she felt pain sharp and shocking as her head thudded against the floor and pinpricks of heat from the glass and flame for a terrifying moment she thought ry was unconscious or dead his body was fully spread over hers a shield protecting her from the worst of the blast before she could even sob in the breath to scream his name he was up and dragging her to her feet are you burned she shook her head aware only of the throbbing and the smoke that was beginning to sting her eyes her throat she could barely see his face through it but she saw the blood your face your armyoure bleeding but he wasnt listening he had her hand vised in his and was dragging her away from the flame even as they dashed down the hall another window exploded fire roared out it surrounded them golden and greedy unbelievably hot she screamed once as she saw it race along the floor eating its way toward them spitting like a hundred hungry snakes panic gripped her icy fingers clutching at her stomach squeezing her throat in taunting contrast to the heat pulsing around them they were trapped fire writhing on either side of them terrified she fought him when he pushed her to the floor stay low however grim his thoughts his voice was calm he gripped her hair in one hand to keep her face turned to his he needed her to hold on to control i cant breathe the smoke was choking her making her gasp for air and expel what little she had in gritty coughs theres more air down here we dont have much time he was awaretoo well awareof how quickly the fire would reach them how well it blocked their exit to the stairs he had nothing with which to fight it if the fire didnt kill them the smoke would long before rescue could reach them get out of your coat what her movements were already sluggish he fought back panic and yanked her coat from her shoulders were going through it we cant she couldnt even scream at the next explosion of glass could only huddle racked by coughing her mind was dull stunned by smoke she wanted only to lie down and draw in the precious air that still hovered just above the floor well burn i dont want to die that way youre not going to die tossing the coat over her head he dragged her to her feet when she staggered he lifted her over his shoulder he stood fire lapping on both sides a flaming sea around him in seconds the tidal wave would reach them and theyd drown in it he gauged the distance and sprinted into the wave for an instant they were in hell fire heat the roaring of its anger the quick ravenous licking of its tongues for no more than two heartbeatsan eternityflames engulfed them he felt the hair on his hands singe knew from the intense heat on his back and arms that his jacket would catch he knew exactly what fire did to human flesh he wouldnt allow it to have natalie then they were through it and into a wall of smoke blinded lungs straining he groped for the fire door instinctively he checked it for heat thanked god then shoved it open smoke was billowing up the stairwell rising as if in a chimney that meant fire below as well but they didnt have a choice moving fast he ripped the smoldering coat away from her and leaned her against the wall while he stripped off his own jacket the leather was burning sluggishly dazed by the smoke and teetering into shock natalie slid bonelessly to the floor youre not giving up he snapped at her as he hauled her back over his shoulder hang on damn it just hang on he streaked down the steps one flight then two then a third she was dead weight now her head lolling her arms limp his eyes were watering from the smoke the tears joining the river of sweat rolling down his face the coughing that seized him felt as if it would shatter his ribs all he knew was that he had to get her to safety he counted each level keeping his mind focused the smoke began to thin and he began to hope she never stirred not even when he tested the door at the lobby level found it cool and staggered through he heard the shouts the sirens his vision grayed as two fire fighters rushed toward him god almighty inspector she needs oxygen still holding her ry shoved the offer of assistance aside and carried her outside into clean air lights were swirling all the familiar sounds and scents and sights of a fire scene like a drunk he weaved toward the closest engine oxygen he ordered now another coughing fit battered him as he laid her down her face was black with soot and her eyes were closed he couldnt see if she was breathing couldnt hear someone was shouting raging but he had no idea it was him hands pushed his own fumbling ones aside and fit an oxygen mask over natalies face you need attention inspector keep away from me he bent over her searching for a pulse blood dripped down his arm and onto her throat natalie please is she all right with tears streaming down her face deirdre dropped down beside him is she going to be all right shes breathing was all ry could say shes breathing he repeated stroking her hair mercifully most of the next hour was a blur he remembered climbing into the ambulance with her holding her hand someone pressed oxygen on him bound up his arm they took her away the minute they hit the er his panicked raging came out in hacking coughs then the world turned upside down he found himself flat on his back on an examining table when he tried to push himself upright he was restrained just lie still a small grayhaired woman was scowling at him i like my stitches neat and tidy you lost a fair amount of blood inspector piasecki natalie ms fletchers being tended to now let me do my job will you she stopped what she was doing and eyed him again if you keep shoving at me mister im going to sedate you my job was a lot easier when you were out cold how long he managed to croak not long enough she knotted the suture and snipped we picked the glass out of your shoulder not much damage there but this arms nasty fifteen stitches she granted him a smile some of my best work i want to see natalie his voice was raspy but there was no mistaking the threat underneath now well you cant youre going to stay where i put you until im done then if youre a very good boy ill have someone check on ms fletcher for you ry used his good arm and grabbed the doctor by the coat now she only sighed in his condition she was well aware she could knock him back with a shrug but agitation wasnt going to help him stay she ordered and went to the curtain pushing it aside she called for a nurse after a few brisk instructions she turned back to ry your updates on the way im dr milano and ill be saving your life this evening she was breathing he said as if daring milano to disagree yes she moved back to take his hand you took in a lot of smoke inspector im going to treat you and youre going to cooperate after weve cleaned you out ill arrange for you to see ms fletcher the nurse came back to the curtained opening and milano moved off again to hold a murmured consultation with her smoke inhalation she announced and shes in shock a few minor burns and lacerations i imagine well keep her in our fine establishment for a day or two her face softened when she saw rys eyes close in relief come on big guy lets work together here he might be weak as a baby but he wasnt going to let them shove him into a hospital room over milanos disgusted protests he walked out into the waiting area deirdre sprang up from a chair the moment she saw him natalie theyre working on her they told me shes going to be all right thank god with a muffled sob deirdre covered her face now ms marks why dont you tell me what the hell you were doing outside the office tonight taking a deep breath deirdre levered herself into a chair id be glad to i called natalies brother she added i suppose hes already on his way out i told him she was hurt but i tried to play it down ry merely nodded though he hated the weakness he had to sit nausea was threatening again that was probably wise i also gave him the bare bones of what i found out earlier today she took a long breath i havent been in the office the last couple of daysive been nursing a cold but i took work home including files and a couple of computer disks natalie gave me before she went on the road i was running figures and i found some discrepancies some very large discrepancies the kind that equals embezzlement money ry thought it almost always came around to money who i cant say for sure he interrupted her in a tone that made her shiver who im telling you i cant be sure i can only narrow it down considering how and where the money was siphoned off and im not giving you a name so you can go off and beat somebody to a pulp which was exactly what he had in mind she was certain despite the fact that he looked like a survivor of a quick trip to hell there was murder in his eyes i could be wrong i need to talk to natalie she said half to herself as soon as i was sure of what id found i tried to contact her in colorado but shed already left i knew shed go by the office before heading home its the way she works so i decided id meet her there tell her what id found out she tapped the briefcase at her feet show her when i parked outside i glanced up i sawshe shut her eyes knew she would relive it over and over again i saw these crazy lights in some of the windows at first i didnt know then i realized what it was i called on the car phone unnerved by the memory she pressed a hand to her mouth i ran inside told the security guard and we heard like an explosion she was crying now quietly i knew she was up there i just knew it but i didnt know what to do yes you did and you did it ry patted her awkwardly on the shoulder inspector milano strode out the usual scowl on her face i got you a pass to see your lady not that youll bother to thank me for it he was on his feet shes okay shes stabilized and sedated but you can look at her since that seems to be your goal in life he glanced back at deirdre are you going to wait yes if youd just let me know how she is ill be back he headed off after the quickstepping doctor natalies room was private and dimly lit she lay very still very pale but her hand when he took it in his was warm are you planning on spending the night here milano asked from the doorway are you going to give me a hard time about it ry returned without looking around who me i aim to serve its not likely shell wake up but thats not going to stop you neither is trying to sleep in that hideously uncomfortable chair im a fireman doc i can sleep anywhere well fireman make yourself at home ill go tell your friend in the waiting room that alls well yeah he never took his eyes from natalies face thatd be good oh youre more than welcome milano said sourly and closed the door behind her ry pulled the chair up to the side of the bed and sat with natalies hand in his he dozed once or twice occasionally a nurse came into the room and scooted him out it was during one of those short restless breaks that he saw boyd rushing down the corridor piasecki captain shes sleeping ry gestured toward the door there without another word boyd moved past him and inside ry walked into the waiting lounge poured a cup of muddy coffee and stared out the window he couldnt think it seemed better that way just to let the night drift if he focused he would see it again the terror on her face the fire around her and he would remember how hed felt carrying her down flight after flight not knowing if she was alive or dead the burning on his hand made him look down he saw hed crushed the paper cup into a ball and spilled the hot coffee over his bandaged hands want another boyd said from behind him no ry tossed the cup away and wiped his hand on his jeans you want to go outside and pound on me awhile with a short laugh boyd poured coffee for himself have you taken a look in a mirror why you look like hell experimentally boyd sipped it was even more pathetic than precinct coffee worse than hell it wouldnt look good for me to start swinging at a guy in your condition i heal quick when boyd said nothing ry shoved his hands in his pockets i told you i wouldnt let her get hurt i damn near killed her you did i lost it i knew it wasnt just clarence i knew there was somebody behind it but i was so wrapped up in her i never thought about him getting another torch or trying something himself the phones damn it i heard the phones ringing intrigued boyd sat back which means a delaying device ry shot back whirling around its a classic matchsticks soaked in accelerant tape them to the phone call the number the phone rings the ringer sparks the match clever but you know you cant think of everything all the time its my job to think of everything and to have a crystal ball his voice was raw from the abuse his throat had taken tight with the emotion he couldnt afford to let loose i was supposed to take care of her yeah acknowledging that boyd sipped again i made a lot of calls on the flight from denver one of the perks of fletcher industries is having a private plane at your disposal i talked to the fire marshal to the doctor who treated natalie to deirdre marks you got her out carried her down every damn step in that building how many stitches have you got in that arm thats hardly the point the point is the fire marshal gave me some idea of what you were facing up there on the fortysecond floor and what kind of shape you were in when you got her outside her doctor told me that if shed been in there another ten minutes it isnt likely shed be sleeping right now so do i want to punch you i dont think so i owe you my sisters life ry remembered how she had looked when he laid her on the ground next to the engine how she looked now pale and still in a hospital bed you dont owe me anything natalies as important to me as she is to you boyd set his coffee aside and rose what did you do to tick her off ry grimaced were working it out well good luck boyd held out a hand after a moment ry clasped it with his thanks i figure youre going to be here awhile ive got a little job to do ry tightened his grip and narrowed his eyes deirdre told you whos responsible thats right i also spoke with my counterpart here in urbana while i was in the air its being taken care of he saw the look in rys eyes understood it this parts up to my team ry you and yours just make damn sure you hang him for the arson who ry said between his teeth donald hawthorne i got it down to four likely suspects two days ago he smiled a little some background checks bank and phone records sometimes it pays to be a cop and you didnt pass the information along to me i intended to when i narrowed it down a bit further now i have and i am boyd knew what it was to love to need to protect and to live with the terror of seeing your woman fight for her life listen he said briskly if you kill himhowever much it might appeal to both of us right nowid have to arrest you id hate to throw my brotherinlaw in a cell ry unfisted his hands long enough to stick them in his pockets im not your brotherinlaw not yet go on in with her get some sleep youd better put hawthorne somewhere where i cant find him i intend to boyd said as he walked away natalie stirred at dawn ry was watching the way the slats of light through the blinds bloomed over her when her lashes fluttered he bent over her talking softly quickly so that her first clear thoughts wouldnt be fearful ones natalie youre okay we got out okay you just swallowed some smoke everythings all right now youve been sleeping im right here i dont want you to talk your throats going to be miserable for a while youre talking she whispered her eyes still closed yeah and it felt as though hed swallowed a flaming sword thats why i dont recommend it she swallowed and winced we didnt die doesnt look like it gently he cupped her head and held a cup of water so that she could sip through the straw just take it easy there was a fear lurking deep inside her but she had to know are we burned badly were not burned a couple of singes maybe relief made her shiver i cant feel anything except she reached up to touch the bruise on her forehead sorry he pressed his lips to the lump felt himself begin to tremble and drew back again you got that when i tackled you she opened her eyes then they felt weighted her whole body felt weighted hospital she asked then her breath caught as she focused on him scratches on his face a bandage at his temple and a larger one that started just below his shoulder and nearly reached the elbow his hands his beautiful hands were wrapped in gauze oh god ry youre hurt cuts and bruises he smiled at her singed my hair a little you need a doctor ive had one thanks i dont think she likes me now shut up and rest what happened youre going to have to move your office when she started to speak again he held up a hand ill tell you what i know if you keep quiet otherwise ill just leave you to stew deal satisfied he sat on the edge of the bed deirdre tried to call you in colorado he began when he finished her head was throbbing impotent fury ate away at the remnant of the sedative until she was wide awake and aching anticipating her ry laid his hand over her mouth theres nothing you can do until youre on your feet not much you can do then its up to the departmentsfire and police and its being handled now im going to ring for the nurse so they can take a look at you i dont her protest turned into a spasm of coughing by the time shed regained control a nurse was gesturing ry out of the room she didnt see him again for more than twentyfour hours you could use another day here nat boyd crossed his feet at the ankles as he watched natalie pack the small overnight case hed brought her i hate hospitals youve made that clear i need your word youre taking a full week off at home or im calling in the troops and not just cilia but mom and dad theres no need for them to fly all the way out here thats up to you pal she pouted three days off a full week anything less is a dealbreaker i can be just as tough a negotiator as you he said with a grin its in the blood fine fine a week what difference does it make she snatched up the water glass and drank it seemed she could never get enough to drink these days everythings in shambles half my buildings destroyed one of my most trusted executives is responsible i dont even have an office to go to youll take care of that next week hawthorne has a lot to answer for the fact that he didnt know you and ry were in the building isnt going to save him all for greed too angry to pack the few things boyd had brought her she paced her body still felt weak but there was too much energy boiling within to allow her to keep still draining a little here a little there losing it on speculative stocks then draining more and more until he was so desperate he risked burning down entire buildings just to destroy records and delay the audit records she whirled back how frustrated he must have been when i told him i had duplicates of everything that was lost in the warehouse fire and he wasnt sure where you kept them fire destroys everything boyd pointed out so hed take one of the buildings and hope if he didnt hit the confusion in the aftermath would keep everyone so busy you wouldnt get around to the audit until he hoped hed managed to replace the siphoned funds so he thought he doesnt know you like i do you always get things done on time the office was his last shot and the most desperate since he had to do it himself when we picked him up and he found out you and ry had been in there and that he was facing attempted murder charges he gave us everything i trusted him natalie murmured i cant stand knowing i could be so wrong about anyone i thought i knew she glanced up as the door opened good to see you ry boyd said and rose this looked like his cue to make a quick and discreet exit ry nodded at boyd then focused on natalie why arent you in bed ive been discharged youre not ready to leave the hospital excuse me boyd slipped toward the door i have a sudden urge for a cup of bad coffee neither natalie nor ry bothered to say goodbye they only continued to argue in raspy croaks do you have a medical degree now inspector i know what shape you were in when you got here well if youd bothered to check in since youd have seen that im recovered i had a lot of details to tie up he told her and you needed to rest id rather have had you he held out the flowers im here now she sighed should she let him off the hook so easily when shed been pining for him for so long and why shouldnt she make him pay a bit for dumping her for the most ridiculous reason why dont you go take those daffodils to someone who needs them he tossed them on the bed im going to go talk to the doctor you certainly will not talk to my doctor i dont need your permission to leave the hospital you didnt ask me for mine and i did not need rest i needed to see you i was worried about you were you encouraged he lifted a hand to her face i wanted you here ry dozens of other people came but obviously you didnt see the need i had work he shot back i wanted to get the evidence on that sonofabitch as soon as possible its all i can do id kill him if i could get to him she started to snap back then felt an icy chill at the look on his face stop that unnerved she turned her back on him away from the murder in his eyes and tossed a robe in her case i dont want to hear you talk that way i didnt know if you were alive he spun her around his fingers digging into her shoulders i didnt know you werent moving i didnt know if you were breathing suddenly he dragged her against him and buried his face in her hair god natalie ive never been so scared all right she brought her arms around him to soothe dont think about it i didnt let myself until you woke up yesterday since then i havent been able to think about anything else struggling for composure he eased away im sorry sorry for saving my life for risking your own to keep me from being hurt you shielded me from the explosion you carried me through fire she shook her head quickly before he could speak dont tell me you were doing your job i dont give a damn whether you want to be a hero or not youre mine i love you natalie her heart softened and swelled carefully she turned and picked up the daffodils it was foolish to waste their emotions on anger they were alive you mentioned that before we were interrupted theres something else i should have mentioned why i pushed you away staring down she flicked a finger over a bright yellow trumpet you listed the reasons i listed the excuses not the reason maybe you could look at me while i grovel she turned back trying to smile its not necessary ry yeah it is you havent decided whether youre going to give me another chance yet he reached out tucked her hair behind her ear i could wear you down eventually because youre crazy about me but you deserve to know what was going on in my head she stiffened automatically i dont think arrogance is very appropriate so why dont you i was scared he said quietly and watched the heat fade from her eyes of you of me of us he let out a long breath when she said nothing i didnt think i could say it admit it not until i realized what it was to be really scared downtothebone scared it makes being afraid of being in love pretty stupid then it looks like we were both stupid because i was scared too her mouth curved a little you were more stupid of course my whole life he said quietly ive never felt anything like what i feel for you not for anyone i know her breath trembled out i know its the same with me and it just keeps getting bigger and scarier are you going to give me another chance she looked at himthe bony face the dark eyes the unruly hair i probably owe you that much seeing as youve saved my life and come clean groveled and apologized her smile spread i suppose i could give us both another chance want to marry me the flowers drifted to the floor as her fingers went numb excuse me with you feeling generous it seemed like a good time to push my luck feeling foolish he bent down and gathered up the daffodils but it can wait she cleared her aching throat accepting the flowers again would you mind repeating the question his eyes shot back to hers it took him a moment to find his voice again it was a risk he realized one of the biggest risks hed ever faced and he had to leave his fate in her hands will you marry me i could do that she said and let out the breath shed been holding even as ry let out his own yes i could do that laughing she launched herself into his arms ive got you dazzled ry buried his face in her hair ive got you legs from now on and kissed her i want babies she told him the minute her mouth was free no kidding with a grin he pushed her hair back so that he could read her face what he saw made his heart leap me too that makes it handy he scooped his arms under her legs and lifted her what do you say we get out of here and get started she managed to snag her overnight case before he headed to the door thatll make it nine months from today she kissed his cheek as he carried her from the room and im always on time in this case she managed to be eight days early
