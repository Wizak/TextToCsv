 going some a romance of strenuous affection by rex beach suggested by the play by rex beach and paul armstrong illustrated by mark fenderson chapter i four cowboys inclined their bodies over the barbedwire fence which marked the dividingline between the centipede ranch and their own staring mournfully into a summer night such as only the far southwestern country knows big yellow stars hung thick and lowso low that it seemed they might almost be plucked by an upstretched handand a silent air blew across thousands of open miles of land lying crisp and fragrant under the velvet dark and as the four inclined their bodies they inclined also their ears after the strained manner of listeners who feel anguish at what they hear a voice shrill and human pierced the night like a needle then with a wail of a tortured soul died away amid discordant raspings the voice of a phonograph it was their own or had been until one overconfident day when the flying heart ranch had risked it as a wager in a footrace with the neighboring centipede and their own man had been too slow as it had been their pride it remained their disgrace dearly had they loved and dearly lost it it meant something that looked like honor and though there were ten thousand thousand phonographs in all the world there was not one that could take its place the sound ceased there was an approving distant murmur of mens voices and then the song began jerusalem jerusalem lift up your voice and sing higher and higher the voice mounted until it reached again its first thin earsplitting pitch still bill stover stirred uneasily in the darkness why n ell dont they keep her wound up he complained gallaghers got the soul of a warthog its criminal the way he massacres that hymn from a rod farther down the wire fence willie answered him in a boys falsetto i wonder if he does it to spite me he dont know youre here said stover the other came out of the gloom a little stoopshouldered man with spectacles i aint noways sure he piped peering up at his lanky foreman why do you reckon he allus lets mrs melby peter out on my favorite record he done the same thing last night it looks like an insult its nothing but ignorance stover replied he dont want no trouble with you none of em do id like to know for certain the small man seemed torn by doubt if i only knew he done it apurpose id git him i bet i could do it from here stovers voice was gruff as he commanded forget it aint it bad enough for us fellers to hang around like this every night without advertising our idiocy by a gunplay they aint got no right to that phonograph willie averred darkly oh yes they have they won it fair and square fair and square do you mean to say humpy joe run that footrace on the square i never said nothin like that whatever i mean we bet it and we lost it listen there goes cararas piece out past the corral floated the announcement in a mans metallic syllables the baggage coach ahead as sung by helena mora for the echo phonograph of new york and paaaris from the dusk to the right of the two listeners now issued soft spanish phrases madre de dios the baggage car in front tadora mora god bless er during the rendition of this affecting ballad the two cowmen remained draped uncomfortably over the barbedwire barrier lost in rapturous enjoyment when the last note had died away stover roused himself reluctantly its time we was turnin in he called softly hey mex si senor come on you and cloudy vamos its ten oclock he turned his back on the centipede ranch that housed the treasure and in company with willie made his way to the ponies two other figures joined them one humming in a musical baritone the strains of the song just ended cut that out mex theyll hear us stover cautioned caramba this ting is brek my eart said the mexican sadly it seem like the senorita mora is sing that song to me mebbe she knows im set out ere on cactus an listen to her ah i love that senorita ver much the little man with the glasses began to swear in his high falsetto his ear had caught the phonograph operator in another musical mistake that horntoad let mrs melby die again tonight said he its sure comin to a runnacaboo between him and me if somebody dont kill him pretty soon hell wear out that machine before we git it back humph it dont look like wed ever get it back said stover one of the four sighed audibly then vaulting into his saddle went loping away without waiting for his companions cloudys sore because they didnt play navajo said willie well i dont blame em none for omittin that wardance it aint got the class of them other pieces while its devised to suit the intellect of an injun perhaps it aint in the runnin with the holy city which tune is the sweetest and sacredest ever sung carara paused with a hand upon the neck of his cayuse eet is not so fine as the baggage car in front he declared its got it beat a mile willie flashed back harshly here you exclaimed stover no arguments we all have our favorites and it aint up to no individual to force his likes and dislikes down no other fellers throat the two men he addressed mounted their broncos stiffly i repeat said willie the holy city as sung by mrs melby is the swellest tune that ever hit these parts carara muttered something in spanish which the others could not understand theyre all fine pieces stover observed placatingly when fairly out of hearing of the ranchhouses you boys have each got your preference cloudy bein an injun has got his and i rise to state that i like that monologue silas on fifth avenoo better than all of em which aint nothin aginst my judgment nor yours when silas says the girl opened her valise took our her purse closed her valise opened her purse took out a dime closed her purse opened her valise put in her purse closed her valise give the dime to the conductor got a nickel in change then opened her valise took out her purse closed her valise stover began to rock in his saddle then burst into a loud guffaw followed by his companions gosh thats awful funny si si acknowledged carara his white teeth showing through the gloom an its just like a fool woman tittered willie thats sure one ridiclous line of talk still bill wiped his eyes with the back of a bony hand i know that hull monologue by heart but i cant never get past that spot to save my soul right there i bog down complete again he burst into wild laughter followed by his companions i dont see how folks can be so dam funny he gasped its natural to em like warts said willie theyre born with it the same as i was born to shoot straight with either hand and the same as the mex was born to throw a rope he dont know how he does it and neither do i some folks can say funny things some can sing like missus melby some can run footraces like that centipede cook carara breathed an eloquent mexican oath do you reckon he fixed that race with humpy joe inquired stover names skinner willie observed it sure sounds bad im sorry humpy left us so sudden said still bill wed ought to have questioned him if we only had proof that the race was crooked you can so gamble it was crooked the little man averred them centipede fellers never done nothin on the square they got humpy joe and fixed it for him to lose so they could get that talkinmachine thats why he pulled out id hate to think it said the foreman gloomily then after a moment during which the only sound was that of the muffled hoofbeats well what we goin to do about it humph ive laid awake nights figurin that out i reckon well just have to git another footracer and beat skinner he aint the fastest in the world that takes coin were broke mebbe mr chapin would lend a helpin hand no chance said stover grimly hes sore on footracin says it disturbs us and upsets our equalubrium carara fetched a deep sigh its ver bad ting senor i don feel no worse wen my granmother die the three men loped onward through the darkness weighted heavily with disappointment affairs at the flying heart ranch were not all to jack chapins liking ever since that memorable footrace more than a month before a gloom had brooded over the place which even the presence of two smith college girls not to mention that of mr fresno was unable to dissipate the cowboys moped about like melancholy shades and neglected their work to discuss the disgrace that had fallen upon them it was a task to get any of them out in the morning several had quit the rest were quarrelling among themselves and the bunkhouse had already been the scene of more than one encounter altogether too sanguinary to have originated from such a trivial cause as a footrace it was not exactly an auspicious atmosphere in which to entertain a houseful of college boys and girls all unversed in the ways of the west the master of the ranch sought his sister jean to tell her frankly what was on his mind see here sis he began i dont want to cast a cloud over your little houseparty but i think youd better keep your friends away from my men why what is the matter she demanded things are at a pretty high tension just now and the boys have had two or three rows among themselves yesterday fresno tried to kid willie about the holy city said it was written as a coon song and wasnt sung in good society if he hadnt been a guest i guess willie would have murdered him oh jack you wont let willie murder anybody not even berkeley while the people are here will you coaxed miss chapin anxiously what made you invite berkeley fresno anyhow was the rejoinder this is no gilded novelty to him he is a western man miss chapin numbered her reasons sagely in the first place helen then there had to be enough men to go around last and best he is the most adorable man i ever saw at a houseparty hes an angel at breakfast sings perfectly beautifully you know he was on the stanford glee club humph jack was unimpressed if you roped him for helen blake to brand why have you sent for wally speed well you see berkeley and helen didnt quite hit it off and mr speed is a friend of culvers miss chapin blushed prettily oh i see i thought myself that this affair had something to do with you and culver covington but i didnt know it had lapsed into a sort of matrimonial roundup suppose miss blake shouldnt care for speed after he gets here oh but she will thats where berkeley fresno comes in when two men begin to fight for her shell have to begin to form a preference and im sure it will be for wally speed dont you see the brother looked at his sister shrewdly it seems to me you learned a lot at smith jean tossed her head how absurd that sort of knowledge is perfectly natural for a girl to have then she teased but you admit that my selection of a chaperon was excellent dont you jack mrs keap and i are the best of friends jack averred with supreme dignity im not in the market and a man doesnt marry a widow anyhow its too old and experienced a beginning nonsense roberta keap is only twentythree why she hardly knew her husband even it was one of those sudden impulsive affairs that would overwhelm any girl who hadnt seen a man for four years and then he enlisted in the spanish war and was killed considerate chap roberta you know is my best friend after helen do be nice to her jack miss chapin sighed it is too bad the others couldnt come yes a small houseparty has its disadvantages bytheway whats that gold thing on your frock its a medal culver sent it to me another yes he won the intercollegiate championship again miss chapin proudly extended the emblem on its ribbon i wish to goodness covington had been here to take humpy joes place said the young cattleman as he turned it over the boys are just brokenhearted over losing that phonograph ill get him to run and win it back jean offered easily her brother laughed take my advice sis and dont let culver mix up in this game the stakes are too high i think that centipede cook is a professional runner myself and if our boys were beaten again well you and mother and i would have to move out of new mexico thats all no wed better let the memory of that defeat die out as quickly as possible you warn fresno not to joke about it any more and ill take mrs keap off your hands she may be a widow she may even be the chaperon but ill do it i will do it promised jack for my sisters sake chapter ii helen blake was undeniably bored the sultry afternoon was very long longer even than berkeley fresnos autobiography and quite as dry it was too hot and dusty to ride so she took refuge in the latest best seller and sought out a hammock on the vineshaded gallery where jean chapin was writing letters while the disconsolate fresno banished wandered at large vaguely injured at her lack of appreciation absentmindedly the girls dipped into the box of bonbons between them jean finished her correspondence and essayed conversation but her companions blond head was bowed over the book in her lap and the effort met with no response lulled by the somniferous droning of insects and lazy echoes from afar miss chapin was on the verge of slumber when she saw her guest rapidly turn the last pages of her novel then with a chocolate between her teeth read wideeyed to the finish miss blake closed the book reluctantly uncurled slowly then stared out through the dancing heatwaves her blue eyes shadowed with romance did she marry him queried jean no no helen blake sighed blissfully it was infinitely finer she killed herself i like to see them get married naturally you are at that stage but i think suicide is more glorious in many cases miss chapin yawned openly speaking of suicides isnt this ranch the deadest place oh i dont think so at all miss blake picked her way fastidiously through the bonbons nibbling tentatively at several before making her choice oh yes you do and you neednt be polite just because youre a guest well then to be as truthful as a boarder it is a little dull not for our chaperon though the time doesnt seem to drag on her hands jack certainly is making it pleasant for her if you call taking her out to watch a lot of bellowing calves get branded entertainment miss chapin sighed i wonder what makes widows so fascinating observed the youthful miss blake i hope i never find out jean clutched nervously at the gold medal on her dress wouldnt that be dreadful my dear culver seems perfectly healthy why worry i i wish he were here miss blake leaned forward and read the inscription on her companions medal oh isnt it heavy feeling it reverently pure gold like himself you should have seen him when he won it why at the finish of that race all the men but culver were making the most horrible faces they were simply dead miss blakes hands were clasped in her lap they all make faces said she have you told roberta about your engagement no she doesnt dream of it and i dont want her to know im so afraid shell think now that mother has gone that i asked her here just as a chaperon perhaps ill tell her when culver comes i adore athletes i wouldnt give a cent for a man who wasnt athletic does mr speed go in for that sort of thing rather the day we met at the yale games he had medals all over him and that night at the dance he used the most wonderful athletic language we could scarcely understand him mr covington must have told you all about him they are chums you know miss chapin furrowed her brows meditatively i have heard culver speak of him but never as an athlete have you and mr speed settled things between you helen i mean has he said anything miss blake flushed not exactly she adjusted a cushion to cover her confusion then leaned back complacently but he has stuttered dangerously several times a musical tinkle of silver spurs sounded in the distance and around the corner of the cookhouse opposite came carara the mexican his wide spangled sombrero tipped rakishly over one ear a cornhusk cigarette drooping from his lips evidently his presence was inspired by some special motive for he glanced sharply about and failing to detect the two girls behind the distant screen of vines removed his cigarette and whistled thrice like a quail then leaning against the adobe wall curled his black silken mustaches to needlepoints its that romantic spaniard whispered helen what does he want its his afternoon call on mariedetta the maid said jean they meet there twice a day morning and afternoon a lovers tryst breathed miss blake eagerly isnt he graceful and picturesque can we watch them shh there she comes from the opposite direction appeared a slim swarthy mexican girl an indian waterjug balanced upon her shoulders she was clad in the straighthanging native garment belted in with a sash her feet were in sandals and she moved as silently as a shadow during the four days since miss blakes arrival at the flying heart ranch she had seen mariedetta flitting noiselessly here and there but had never heard her speak the pretty expressionless face beneath its straight black hair had ever retained its wooden stolidity the velvety eyes had not laughed nor frowned nor sparkled she seemed to be merely a part of this far southwestern picture a bit of inanimate yet breathing local color now however the girl dropped her jug and with a low cry glided to her lover who tossed aside his cigarette and took her in his arms from this distance their words were indistinguishable how perfectly romantic said the eastern girl breathlessly i had no idea mariedetta could love anybody she is a volcano jean answered why its like a play and it goes on all the time how gentle and sweet he is i think he is charming he is not at all like the other cowboys is he while the two witnesses of the scene were eagerly discussing it joy the chinese cook emerged from the kitchen bearing a bucket of water his presence hidden from the lovers by the corner of the building carara languidly released his inamorata from his embrace and lounged out of sight around the building pausing at the farther corner to waft her a graceful kiss from the ends of his fingers as with a farewell flash of his white teeth he disappeared mariedetta recovered her waterjug and glided onward into the court in front of the cookhouse her face masklike her movements deliberate as usual joy spying the girl grinned at her she tossed her head coquettishly and her step slackened whereupon the cook with a sly glance around tapped her gently on the arm and said nice lil gally the idea indignantly exclaimed miss blake from her hammock but mariedetta was not offended instead she smiled over her shoulder as she had smiled at her lover an instant before me like you fine you like pie joy nodded toward the door to the culinary department as if to make free of his hospitality at the instant that carara who had circled the building came into view from the opposite side a fresh cigarette between his lips his languor vanished at the first glimpse of the scene and he strode toward the whiteclad celestial who dove through the open door like a prairie dog into its hole carara followed at his heels it serves him right cried miss blake rising i hope mr carara a din of falling pots and pans issued from the cookhouse mingled with shrill cries and soft spanish imprecations then with one longdrawn wail the pandemonium ceased as suddenly as it had commenced and carara issued forth black with anger ha said he scowling at mariedetta who had retreated her hand upon her bosom he exhaled a lungful of cigarette smoke through his nostrils fiercely you play wit me eh no no mariedetta ran to him and seizing his arm cooed amorously in spanish bah vamos carara flung her from him and stalked away well of all the outrageous things said miss blake why she was actually flirting with that chinaman mariedetta flirts with every man she can find said jean calmly but she doesnt mean any harm shell marry carara some time if he doesnt kill her kill her miss blakes eyes were round he wouldnt do that indeed yes he is a mexican and he has a terrible temper miss blake sank back into the hammock how perfectly dreadful and yetit must be heavenly to love a man who would kill you miss chapin lost herself in meditation for an instant culver is almost like that when he is angry hello here comes our foreman stover a tall gangling cattleman with drooping grizzled mustache came shambling up to the steps his weatherbeaten chaps were much too short for his lengthy limbs the collar of his faded flannel shirt lacked an inch of meeting at the throat its sleeves were shrunken until his hairy hands hung down like tassels he was loose and spineless his movements tempered with the slothfulness of the far southwest his appearance gave one the impression that readymade garments are never long enough he dusted his boots with his sombrero and cleared his throat evening miss jean is mr chapin around i think youll find him down by the springhouse can i do anything for you nope stover sighed heavily and got his frame gradually into motion again youre not looking well stover are you ill inquired miss chapin not physical said the foreman checking the movement which had not yet communicated itself the entire length of his frame i reckon my sperrets broke thats all havent you recovered from that footrace i have not and i never will so long as that ornery centipede outfit has got it on us nonsense stover what have they done inquired miss blake curiously i havent heard about any footrace you tell her said the man with another sigh and a hopeless gesture that told the depth of his feelings why stover hired a fellow a couple of months ago as a horsewrangler the man said he was hungry and made a good impression so we put him on here stover slowly raised one booted foot and kicked his other calf the boys nicknamed him humpy joe why poor thing was he humpbacked inquired helen no answered still bill humpback is lucky we called him humpy joe because when it came to running he could sure get up and hump himself soon after joseph went to work jean continued the centipede outfit hired a new cook you know the centipede ranch the one you see over yonder by the foothills it wasnt soon after it was simuletaneous said stover darkly were beginnin to see plain at last he went on as if to air the injury that was gnawing him one day we hear that this grubslinger over yonder thinks he can run which same is as welcome to us as the smell of flowers on a spring breeze for humpy joe had amused us in his idle hours by running jackrabbits to earth not really said miss blake well no but from what we see we judge hed ought to limp a hundred yards in about nothing and threefifths seconds so we frame a race between him and the centipede cook as a matter of fact there has been a feud for years between the two outfits jean offered with tumulchous joy we bet our wages and all the loose gear we have and in a burst of childish enthusiasm we put up the talkingmachine a phonograph yes an echo phonograph said miss chapin of new york and paris added stover our boys won it from this very centipede outfit at a broncobusting tournament in cheyenne wyoming stover made the location definite the centipede crowd took their defeat badly on frontier day and swore to get even and was humpy joe defeated asked helen was he still bill shook his head sadly and sighed for a third time it looked like he was running backward miss but really he was only beaten a foot it was a wonderful race i saw it said jean it made me think of the races at college miss blake puckered her brows trying to think joseph she said no i dont think i have seen him stovers lips met grimly i dont reckon you have miss since that race he has been hard to descry he passed from view hurriedly so to speak headed toward the foothills and leaping from crag to crag like the hardy shamrock of the swiss yelps miss blake giggled what made him hurry so us stover gazed at her solemnly we aint none of us been the same since that footrace you see it aint the financial value of that echo phonograph nor the doublecross that hurts its the fact that the mangiest outfit in the territory has trimmed us out of the one thing that stands for honor and excellence and scientific attainment as the judge said when we won it that talkingmachine meant more to us than you eastern folks can understand i reckon if i were you i would cheer up said miss blake kindly and with some importance miss chapin has a college friend coming this week and he can win back your trophy stover glanced up at jean quickly is that right miss chapin he can if he will jean asserted can he run he is the intercollegiate champion declared that young lady with proud dignity and do you reckon hed run for us and the echo phonograph of new york and paris if we framed a race its an honor but miss chapin suddenly recalled her brothers caution of the day before and hesitated i i dont think he would you see he is an amateur he might be out of training the idea exclaimed miss blake indignantly if culver wont run i know who will she closed her lips firmly and turned to the foreman you tell your friends that well see you get your trophy back helen i i mean it declared miss blake with spirit stover bowed loosely thank you miss the very thought of it will cheer up the gang life round here is blacker n a spade flush i think ill tell willie he shambled rapidly off around the house helen dear i dont want culver to get mixed up in this affair explained miss chapin as soon as they were alone its all utterly foolish jack doesnt want him to either very well if culver doesnt feel that he can beat that cook running i know who will try mr speed will do anything i ask its a shame the way those men have been treated but mr speed isnt a sprinter indeed miss blake bridled perhaps culver covington isnt the only athlete in yale college i happen to know what im talking about naturally the two boys have never competed against each other because they are friends mr speed isnt the sort to race his roommate oh he wouldnt tell me he could run if it were not true i dont think he will consent when he learns the truth i assure you said miss blake sweetly he will be delighted chapter iii it was still early in the afternoon when jack chapin and the youthful chaperon found the other young people together on the gallery heres a telegram from speed began jack its terribly funny said mrs keap that mexican brought it to us down at the springhouse miss blake lost her bored expression and sat up in the hammock mr jack chapin read the owner of the flying heart ranch dear jack i couldnt wait for covington so meet with brassband and fireworks this afternoon have flowers in bloom in the little park beside the depot and see that the daisies nod to me j wallingford speed park eh said fresno dryly telegraph office watertank and a cattlechute where does this fellow think he is here is a postscript added chapin i have a valet who does not seem to enjoy the trip divide a kiss among the girls well well hes stingy with his kisses observed berkeley who is this humorous party he was a freshman at yale the year i graduated explained jack too bad he never got out of that class it was evident that mr speeds levity made no impression upon the glee club tenor he hates to talk about himself doesnt he i think he is very clever said miss blake warmly how well do you know him not as well as id like to fresno puffed at his little pipe without remarking at this well who wants to go and meet him queried jack wont you asked his sister i cant ive just got word from the eleven x that im wanted the foreman is hurt i may not be back for some time nigger mike met me observed fresno darkly then nigger mike for speed laughed the cattleman ive told carara to hitch up the pintos for me i must be going ill see that you are safely started said the young widow and leaving the trio on the gallery they entered the house when they had gone jean smiled wisely at helen robertas such a thoughtful chaperon she observed whereupon miss blake giggled as for mrs keap she was inquiring of jack with genuine solicitude do you really mean that you may be gone for some time i do it may be a week it may be longer i cant tell until i get over there im sorry mrs keaps face showed some disappointment so am i i shall have to look out for these young people all by myself what a queer little way you have of talking as if you were years and years old i do feel as if i were i i well i have had an unhappy experience you know unhappiness builds months into years when jean got up this houseparty young chapin began absently i thought i should be bored to death but i havent been you know i dont want to go over there he nodded vaguely toward the south i thought perhaps it suited your convenience his companion watched him gravely are you quite sure that your sisters guests have not had something to do with this sudden determination i am quite sure i never liked the old flying heart so much as i do today i never regretted leaving it so much as i do at this moment we may be gone before you return young chapin started you dont mean that really mrs keap nodded her dark head it was all very well for me to chaperon helen on the way out from the east but it isnt exactly regular for me to play that part here with other young people to look after but you understand of course jean must have explained to you mother was called away suddenly and she cant get back now you surely wont leave you cant chapin added hopefully why you would break up jeans party you see theres nobody around here to take your place but nonsense this is an unconventional country whats wrong with you as a chaperon anyway nobody out here even knows what a chaperon is and ill be back as soon as i can do you really think that would help robertas eyes laughed humorously im not thinking of the others im thinking of myself declared the young man boldly i dont want you to go before i return you must not if you go i i shall follow you he grasped her hand impulsively oh exclaimed the chaperon this makes it even more impossible go go she pushed him away her color surging go to your old eleven x ranch right away but i mean it he declared earnestly then as she retreated farther its no use i shant go now until you have known me less than a week that is long enough roberta mrs keap spoke with honest embarrassment listen dont you see what a situation this is if jean and helen should ever discover jean planned it all even this mrs keap stared at him in horrified silence you do love me roberta chapin undertook to remove the girls hands from her face when a slight cough in the hall behind caused him to turn suddenly in time to see berkeley fresno passing the open door there you see mrs keaps face was tragic you see she turned and fled leaving the master of the ranch in the middle of the floor bewildered but a bit inclined to be happy a moment later the plump face of berkeley fresno appeared cautiously around the doorjamb he coughed again gravely i happened to be passing said he youll pardon me this is the most thickly settled spot in new mexico chapin declared with an artificial laugh choking his indignation fresno slowly brought his round body out from concealment i came in to get a match why dont you carry matches fresno puffed complacently upon his pipe this he mused as his host departed eliminates the chaperon and that helps some still bill stover lost no time in breaking the news to the boys theres something comin off he advised willie weve got another footrunner if he had hoped for an outburst of rapture on the part of the little gun man he was disappointed for willie shifted his holster smiled evilly through his glasses and inquired with ominous restraint where is he being the one man on the flying heart who had occasion to wear a gun willie seldom smiled from a sense of humor here it may be said that deceived at first by his scholarly appearance his fellowlaborers had jibed at willies affectation of a swinging holster but the custom had languished abruptly when it became known who he was the other ranchhands had volubly declared that this was a free country where a man might exercise a wide discretion in the choice of personal adornment and as for them they avowed unanimously that the practice of packing a colts was one which met with their most cordial approbation in time willies sixshooter had become accepted as a part of the local scenery and like the scenery no one thought of remarking upon it least of all those who best knew his lack of humor he had come to them out of the nowhere some four years previously and while he never spoke of himself and discouraged reminiscence in others it became known through those vague uncharted channels by which news travels on the frontier that back in the texas panhandle there was a limping marshal who felt regrets at mention of his name and that farther north were other men who had a superstitious dread of undersized cowmen with spectacles there were also stories of lonesome runins which owing to willies secretiveness and the permanent silence of the other participants never became more than intangible rumors but he was a good ranchman attended to his business and the sheriffs office was remote so willie had worked on unmolested this here is a real footrunner said stover exactly agreed the other where is he hell be here this afternoon nigger mikes bringin him over from the railroad hes a guest oh yep hes intercollegit champeen of yale yale repeated the nearsighted man dont knows i ever been there much of a town i aint never travelled east myself but miss jean and the little yallerhaired girl say hes the fastest man in the world i figgered we might rib up something with the centipede still bill winked sagely see here do you reckon hed run sure hes a friend of the boss and hell run on the level too he cant be nothin like humpy if he is ill git him said the cowboy oh ill git him sure guest or no guest but how about the phonograph the centipede will put it up quick enough there aint no sentiment in that outfit then it sounds good an itll work gallaghers anxious to trim us again some folks cant stand prosperity willie spat unerringly at a grasshopper lord said he its too good it dont sound possible well it is and our man will be here this evenin watch out for nigger mike and when he drives up lets give this party a welcome thatll warm his heart on the jump theres nothin like a good impression ill be on the job assured willie but i state right here and now if we do get a race there aint agoin to be no chance of our losin for a second time and stover went on his way to spread the tidings it was growing dark when the rattle of wheels outside the ranchhouse brought the occupants to the porch in time to see nigger mike halt his buckboard and two figures prepare to descend its mr speed cried miss blake then she uttered a scream as the velvet darkness was rent by a dozen tongues of flame while a shrill yelping arose as of an apache warparty its the boys said jean what on earth has possessed them but stover had planned no ordinary reception and the pandemonium did not cease until the men had emptied their weapons then mr j wallingford speed came stumbling up the steps and into the arms of his friends the tails of his dustcoat streaming really this is more than i expected he gasped then turning doffed his straw hat to the halfrevealed figures beyond the light and cried gayly thank you gentlemen thank you for missing me yow ee responded the cowboys how do you do miss chapin speed shook hands with his hostess and in the radiance from the open doorway she saw that his face was round and boyish and his smile peculiarly engaging she welcomed him appropriately then said this reception is quite as startling to us as to you you know mr speed that we have with us a friend of yours she slightly drew helen forward and this is mrs keap who is looking after us a bit while mother is away roberta may i present mr covingtons friend and ask you to be good to him dont forget me said fresno pushing into the light mr berkeley fresno of leland stanford university hello frez speed thrust out his hand warmly not so the californian he replied with hauteur fresno fresno and allowed the newcomer to grasp a limp moist hand ah go to the head of the class im sorry you broke your wrist however the eastern lad spoke lightly and gave the palm a hearty squeeze then turned to jean i dare say you are all disappointed miss chapin that culver didnt come with me but hell be along in a day or so i simply couldnt wait he avoided glancing at helen blake whose answering blush was lost in the darkness i did think when you drove up that might be mr covington with you miss chapin remarked wistfully oh no thats my man speed glanced around him and bytheway where is he the sound of angry voices came through the gloom then out into the light came still bill stover willie and carara dragging between them a globular person who was rebelling loudly stover what is this questioned miss chapin stepping to the edge of the veranda this gent stampedes in the midst of our welcome explained the foreman so we have to rope him before he gets away it was seen now that cararas lariat was tightly drawn about the new arrivals waist then the valet broke into coherent speech but he spoke a tongue not common to his profession nix on that welcome stuff he burst forth in husky alcoholic accents that goes on the doormat it was plain that he was very angry if that racket means welcome i dont want it take that clothesline off of me carara loosened the noose and his captive rolled up the steps mopping his face with his handkerchief what made you run away demanded speed any time a bunch of bandits unhitch their gats im on my way sputtered the fat man im gunshy see and when this holdup comes off i beat it till that cuban rummy with the medals on his dicer rides a live horse up my back you dont appreciate the honor explained his employer then turning to the others he announced will you allow me to introduce mr lawrence glass he isnt really a valet you know miss chapin and he doesnt care for the west yet it is his first trip i have heard my brother speak of larry glass said jean graciously mr glass courtesied awkwardly and swinging his right foot back of his left tapped the floor with his toe you were a trainer at yale when jack was there thats me mr glass wheezed im there with the big rub too wally said he was going to train during vacation so he staked me to a trip out here and i came along to look after him come into the house said jean stover will see to your baggage as they entered mr berkeley fresno saw the late arrival bend over helen blake and heard him murmur the same unforgettable eyes of italian blue and mr fresno decided to dislike wally speed even if it required an effort chapter iv it was on the following morning that miss blake made bold to request her favor from j wallingford speed they had succeeded in isolating themselves upon the vineshaded gallery at the rear of the house and the conversation had been largely of athletics but this judging from the rapt expression of the girl was a subject of surpassing interest speed quick to take a cue plunged on i would have made the varsity basketball team myself if i hadnt been so tiny said helen i have always wanted to be tall like roberta i shouldnt care for that said the young man you know she was a wonderful player so ive heard do you know mused helen i have never forgotten what you told me that first day we met i think it was perfectly lovely of you what was that now it must be admitted that j wallingford speed in his relations with the other sex frequently found himself in a position requiring mental gymnastics of a high order but as a rule his memory was good and he seldom crossed his own trail so to speak in this instance he was utterly without remembrance however and hence was noncommittal what you told me about your friendship for mr covington i think it is very unselfish of you oh i wouldnt say that ventured the young man vainly racking his brain nobody could help liking culver yes but how many men would step aside and let their best friend win prize after prize and never undertake to compete against him speed blushed faintly as any modest man might have done did i tell you that he inquired indeed you did then please dont speak of it to a mortal soul i must have said a great deal that first day but but i have spoken of it and i said i thought it was fine of you you have spoken of it yes i told jean the yale man undertook to change the conversation abruptly but miss blake was a determined young lady she continued of course it was very magnanimous of you to always step aside in favor of your best friend but it isnt fair to yourself it really isnt and so i have arranged a little plan whereby you can do something to prove your prowess and still not interfere with mr covington in the least speed cleared his throat nervously tell me he said what it is and miss blake told him the story of the shocking treachery of humpy joe together with the miserable undoing of the flying heart why those poor fellows are brokenhearted she concluded their despair over losing that talkingmachine would be funny if it were not so tragic i told them you would win it back for them and you will wont you please she turned her blue eyes upon him appealingly and the young man was lost ill take ten chances he said where does the raffle come off oh it isnt a raffle its a footrace you must run with that centipede cook i run a race exclaimed the young college man aghast yes ive promised that you would you see this isnt like a college event and culver isnt here yet but hell be here in a day or so speed felt as if a very large man were choking him he decided his collar was too tight oh ive talked it all over with jean she doesnt want culver to run anyhow why not inquired he suspiciously i dont know im sure if miss chapin doesnt want culver to run you surely wouldnt want me to not at all if mr covington knew the facts of the case he would be only too happy to do it and you see you know the facts speed was about to shape a gracious but firm refusal of the proffered honor when still bill stover appeared at the steps doffed his faded stetson and bowed limply mornin miss blake to the rear speed saw three other men an indian tall swart and saturnine who walked with a limp a picturesque mexican with a spangled hat and silver spurs evidently the captor of lawrence glass on the evening previous and an undersized little man with thickrimmed spectacles and a heavyhanging holster from which peeped a gunbutt all were smiling pleasantly and seemed a bit abashed goodmorning mr stover said helen pleasantly this is mr speed of whom i spoke to you yesterday stover bowed again and mumbled something about the honor of this meeting and miss blake cast her eyes over the other members of the group saying graciously im afraid i cant introduce your friends i havent met them the loquacious foreman came promptly to the rescue rejoicing in an opportunity of displaying his oratorical gifts then ill make you acquainted with the best brandin outfit in these parts he waved a long bony arm at the mexican who flashed his white teeth this greaser is aurelio maria carara need i say hes mex and a preemeer roper carara bowed and swept the ground with his highpeaked headpiece the maduro gent yonder is mr cloudy his mother being a navajo squaw named him accordin to the rights and customs of her tribe selecting the title of cloudybutthesunshines which same has proved a misnomer him bein a pessimist for fair miss blake and her companion smiled and nodded at which stover encouraged beyond measure elaborated hes had a histry too when he reaches mans realestate the injun agent ropes throws and hogties him then sends him east to be cultivated he spends four years kickin a football speed interrupted with an exclamation of genuine interest oh its true as gospel the foreman averred when he goes lame in his off leg they ship him back and in spite of them handicaps he has become one rustlin savage at a roundup what college did you attend inquired speed politely the question fell upon unresponsive ears cloudy did not stir nor alter the direction of his sombre glance he don talk none stover explained conversation which i esteem as a gift deevine is a lost art with him i reckon he dont average a word a week what language he did know he has forgot and what he aint forgot he distrusts turning to the nearsighted man who had been staring at the college youth meanwhile the spokesman took a deep breath and said simply yet proudly as if describing the piece de resistance of this exhibition the foureyed gent is willie plain willie a born rangerider and the best hip shot this side of the santa fe trail speed beheld an undersized man of indeterminate age hollowchested thinfaced gravely benignant it was not alone his glasses that lent him a scholarly appearance he had the stooped shoulders the thoughtful intensity of gaze the gentle hesitating backwardness of a bookraised man there were tutors at yale quite as colorless characterless and indefinite and immensely more forceful in place of the revolver at his belt it seemed as if willie should have carried a geologists pick a butterflynet or a magnifyingglass one was prepared to hear him speak learnedly of microscopy or even perhaps of settlement work as a cowboy he was utterly out of place and it was quite impossible to take stovers words seriously nevertheless speed acknowledged the introduction pleasantly while the benevolent little man blinked back of his lenses stover addressed himself to miss blake i told the boys what you said miss and we four has come as a delegation to find out if it goes mr speed and i were just talking about it when you came said helen im sure he will consent if you add your entreaties to mine it would sure be a favor said the cowman at which the others drew nearer as if hanging on speeds answer even cloudy turned his black eyes upon the young man the object of their cooperate gaze shifted his feet uncomfortably and felt minded to flee but the situation would not permit of it besides the affair interested him his mind was working rapidly albeit his words were hesitating i im afraid im not in shape to run he ventured but stover would have none of this modesty admirable as it might appear oh i talked with your trainer just now i told him you was tipped off to us as a sprinter what did he say inquired speed with alarm he said no at first till i told him who let it out then he laughed and said he guessed you was a runner but you didnt work at it regular i asked him how good you was and he said none of the college teams would let you run thats good enough for us mr speed but im not in condition objected the youth with a sigh of gratitude at glasss irony i reckon he knows more about that than you do we covered that point too and mr glass said you was never better than you are right now anyhow you dont have to bust no records to beat this cook he aint so fast it would sure be a kindhearted act if youd do it for us said the little man in his high boyish voice it was a shock to discover that he spoke in a dialect theres a heap of sentiment connected with this affair you see outside of being a prize that we won at considerable risk there goes with this phonograph a set of records among which we all have our special favorites have you ever heard madamosella melby sing the holy city i didnt know she sang it said speed take it from me she did and youve missed a heap you bet stover agreed in a hushed awed tone well you must have heard missus heleney moray in the baggage coach ahead queried the scholarly little man at mention of his beloved classic carara the mexican murmured softly ah the baggage car teadora mora god bless er i must confess ive never had the pleasure said speed whereupon the speaker regarded him pityingly and stover jealous that so much of the conversation had escaped him inquired can it be that you never heard that monologue silas on fifth avenoo again speed shook his head as if the very memory were hilariously funny still bills shoulders heaved and stifled laughter caused his adams apple to race up and down his leathern throat swallowing his merriment at length he recited in a choking voice as follows silas goes up fifth avenoo and climbs into a bus there is a girl settin opposite he says the girl opened her valise took out her purse closed her valise opened her purse took out a dime closed her purse opened her valise put in her purse closed her valise handed the dime to the conductor got a nickle in change opened her valise took out her purse closed her valise opened her purse at this point the speaker fell into ungovernable hysteria and exploded rocking back and forth slapping his thighs and hiccoughing with enjoyment willie followed him as did carara even cloudy showed his teeth and the two young people on the porch found themselves joining in from infection it was patent that here lay some subtle humor sufficient to convulse the far western nature beyond all reason for stover essayed repeatedly to check his laughter before gasping finally gosh lmighty i never can get past that place he he he whoohoo thats sure ridiclous for fair he wiped his eyes with the back of a sunbrowned hand and his frame was racked with barking coughs i know the whole blame thing by heart buti cant recite it to you i bog down right there seems like some folks is the darndest fools speed allowed this goodhumor to banish his trepidation and assured the foreman that silas on fifth avenue must indeed be a very fine monologue its my favorite said still bill but we all have our picks cloudy here likes navajo which i agree is attuned to please the savage year but to my mind it aint in the runnin with silas you see what the phonograph means to these gentlemen said miss blake i think its a crying shame that they were cheated out of it dont you speed began to outline a plan hastily in his mind i assured them that you would win it back for them and we sure hope you will said willie earnestly amen breathed the lanky foreman his cheeks still wet from his tears of laughter but his face drawn into lines of eagerness please for my sake urged helen placing a gentle little hand upon her companions arm speed closed his eyes so to speak and leaped in the dark all right ill do it yowee yelled stover we knew you would willie was beaming benignantly through his glasses while both carara and cloudy showed their heartfelt gratitude thank you miss blake now well show up that shavetail centipede crowd for what it is wait speed checked the outburst ill consent upon conditions ill run provided you can arrange the race for an unknown what does that mean helen asked it means that i dont want my name known in the matter instead of arranging for mr whateverthecooksnameis to run a race with j w speed he must agree to compete against a representative of the flying heart ranch name unknown i dont think that is fair cried the girl think of the honor yes but im an amateur id lose my standing that goes for us said stover we dont care what name you run under well frame the race lordy but this is a glorious event we cant thank you enough willie piped youre a true sport mr speed and we aim to see that you dont get the worst of it in no way this here race is goin to be on the squareyou hear me talkin no doublecross this time unconsciously the speakers hand strayed to the gun at his belt while his smile was grim speed started what day shall we set inquired stover wally rapidly calculated the date of culvers arrival and said a week from saturday covington would soon be en route and was due to arrive a few days thereafter wed like to make it tomorrow ventured willie oh but i must have a chance to get in trim said the college man one week from saturday goes announced stover and we thank you again turning to carara he directed rope your buckskin and hike for the centipede tell em to unlimber their coin ill draw a months wages in advance for every sonofagun on the flying heart and well arrange details tonight si agreed carara i go and dont waste no time neither directed willie you tear like a jackrabbit ahead of a hot wind carara tossed his cigarette aside and the sound of his spurs was lost around the corner of the house this makes a boy of me the last speaker continued i can hear the plaintiff notes of madamosella melby once again chapter v larry glass discovered his protege on the rear porch engrossed with miss blake and signalled him from afar but the young man ignored the signal and the trainer strolled up to the steps hello larry whats on your mind inquired speed id like to see you glass clad in his sportiest garments seemed utterly lacking in the proper appreciation of a valets position he treated his employer with a tolerant goodnature miss blake excused herself and went into the house whereupon her companion showed his irritation see here larry dont you know better than to interrupt me in the midst of a hammock talk oh thats all right wheezed the trainer as long as you didnt spill her out shell be back well what is it i had a stomachlaugh slipped to me just now he began to shake so you broke up my teteatete to tell me a funny story listen here these cowboys have got you touted for a footrunner this time glass laughed aloud hoarsely they have framed a race with a ginny down the block all right ill run mr glasss face abruptly fell into solemn lines quit your kiddin wally you couldnt run a hundred yards in twenty minutes these guys are on the level theyve sent general garcia over to cook it yes the race comes off in ten days glass allowed his mouth to drop open and his little eyes to peer forth in startled amazement then its true i guess this climate is too much for you he said when did you feel this comin on speed laughed i know what im doing with an effort at restraint the trainer inquired whats the idea ill tell you how it came up larry i im very fond of miss blake thats why i broke the record getting out here as soon as i was invited well she believes from something i said one of those odd moments you know that im a great athlete and she told those cowboys that id gladly put on my spiked shoes and carry their colors to victory youve heard about the phonograph glass smiled wearily i cant hear nothing else the gang is daffy on grand opera when i was accused of being an athlete i couldnt deny it could i i see you was stringin the gal and she called you eh i wouldnt express it in quite those terms i may have exaggerated my abilities slightly glass laughed she is such a great admirer of athletics it was quite natural any man would have done the same she got me committed in front of the cowboys and i had to accept or be a quitter glass nodded appreciatively all the same said he youve got more nerve than a burglar how you goin to sidestep i made the match for an unknown speed winked covington will be here in a day or two ill wire him to hurry up fortunately i brought a lot of athletic clothes with me so ill go into training under your direction when covington gets here ill let him run the fat man sighed with relief now im hep i was afraid youd try to go through with it hardly ill sprain an ankle or something shell be there with the sympathy see covington will run the race the cowboys will get their phonograph and ill get well if i can beat out this native son tenor singer ill invite you to the wedding there wasnt any other way out glass mopped his brow you had me wingin for a while but i plugged your game with the cowboys pawnee bill and his congress of rough riders think youre a cyclone its the first chance i ever had to wear that silk runningsuit who knows maybe i can run nix now dont kid yourself too far this thing is funny enough as it stands oh i dare say it looks like a joke to you but it doesnt to me larry if i dont marry that girl i ill go off my balance thats all and im not going to overlook any advantage whatever fresno sings lovesongs and hes got a mint of money well im going to work this athletic pose to death im going into training im going to talk eat sleep live athletics for a week and when im unexpectedly crippled on the eve of the race it is going to break my heart understand i am going to be so desperately disappointed that ill have to choose between suicide and marriage the way i feel now i think ill choose marriage but you must help leave it to me bo in the first place i want some trainingquarters thats right dont be a piker and i want you to boost im there when do we begin right away unpack my runningsuit and rub some dirt on it its too new i think ill limber up and let her get a look at the clothes its a bright idea but dont let these animaltrainers see you run or the stuff will be cold in a minute fine well have secret practice that suits me perfectly speed laughed with joy from inside the house came the strains of dearie sung in a sympathetic tenor and upon the conclusion berkeley fresnos voice inquiring miss blake did i ever tell you about the time i sang dearie to the mayors daughter in walla walla miss blake appeared on the gallery with her musical admirer at her elbow yes said she sweetly you told me all about the mayors daughter a week ago then spying speed and his companion she exclaimed mr fresno has a fine voice hasnt he he sings with the stanford glee club indeed sure the native son of the golden west shook up a hammockcushion for the girl tenor said he sententiously say no more speed remarked its all right with us fresno looked up whats wrong with my singing oh ive just told the girls that youre going to run that footrace helen interposed hurriedly at which fresno exploded whats wrong with my running inquired speed i can beat you larry glass nudged his employer openly and seemed on the verge of hysteria let him go said he let him go hes funny speed addressed helen with a magnanimous smile suppose we allow frez to sing this footrace well pull it off in the treble cleff oh i mean it maintained the tenor stubbornly i dont want to run skinner the cook but ill run you to see who does meet him speed shrugged his shoulders indulgently im afraid youre a little overweight ill train down perhaps if you wait until i beat this cook ill take you on glass broke out in husky indignation sure get a rep cull get a rep then to his employer come on wally youve got to warm up he mounted the steps heavily with his protege when they had gone miss blake clapped her hands im so excited she exclaimed you see its all my doings oh how i adore athletes most young girls do fresno smiled sourly my taste runs more to music after a moments meditation he observed speed doesnt look like a sprinter to me i ill wager he cant do a hundred yards in fifteentwo fifteentwo is cribbage said miss blake fifteen and twofifths seconds is what i mean is that fast fresno smiled indulgently this time jeans friend covington can go the distance in nine and fourfifths seconds hes a real sprinter i think this fellow is a joke indeed he is not if mr covington can run as fast as that mr speed can run faster he told me so oh fresno looked at her curiously the worlds record is nine and threefifths thats the limit of human endurance i hope he doesnt injure himself breathed the girl and the tenor wandered away disgusted beyond measure when he was out of hearing he remarked aloud ill bet he runs so slow well have to wind a stopwatch on him anyhow i think ill find out something more about this race once in his room mr j wallingford speed made a search for writing materials while larry glass overhauled a trunk filled with athletic clothing of various descriptions there were runningsuits rowingsuits baseball and football suits sweaters jerseys and bath robes all of which were new and unstained at the bottom glass discovered a box full of bronze and neargold emblems heres your medals said he good ill wear them nix you cant do that those gals will get wise he selected one and read on the reverse side clerk of the course another was engraved starter all were official badges of some sort or other you always were strong on the reception committee stuff theres six of them said he speed pointed to the bureau try a nailfile see if you cant scratch off the lettering hows this he read what he had written for the wire culver covington and so forth come quick first train native son making love to jean wally ten words and it tells the whole story i can hardly explain why i want him can i he expects to stop off in omaha for a day or two but hell be under way in an hour after he gets this i hate to spoil his little visit but he can take that in on his way home now ill ring for somebody and have this taken over to the station by the first wagon say you better scratch this fresno said larry why hes hep to you nonsense glass looked up at a sound to discover mariedetta the mexican maid who had come in answer to speeds call in the doorway the trainer said under his breath pipe the cuban queen you call inquired mariedetta of the younger man yes i want this telegram to go to the depot as soon as possible mariedetta took the message and turned silently but as she went she flashed a look at glass which caused that shortwaisted gentleman to wink at his companion some frill eh im for her shes strong for me too how do you know we talked it over i gave her a little kiss to keep for me careful larry she may have a cowboy sweetheart glass grunted disparagingly them ginnys is jokes to me as speed talked he clad himself in his silken uniform donned his spiked shoes and pinned the medals upon his chest how do i look he queried immense if she likes athletes its a walkaway for you then give me the babyblue bath robe with the monogram well go out and trot around a little but his complacency received a shock as he stepped out upon the veranda not only helen blake awaited him but the other girls as well while out in front were a dozen or more cowboys whom fresno had rallied goin to take a little run eh inquired stover we allowed wed lay off a few minutes and watch you thanks yes fresno spoke up i told the boys wed better hold a stopwatch on you and see what shape youre in a stopwatch said glass sharply yes i have one not today said speeds trainer no he admonished as his protege turned upon him some other time mebbe youre just off a long trip and i cant risk gettin you stove up tomorrow perhaps urged fresno i wouldnt promise then the next day ive timed lots of men the watch is correct lets see it glass held out his hand oh its a good watch it cost me one hundred and twentyfive dollars as glass reached for the timepiece an unfortunate accident occurred speed struck his elbow and the watch fell fresno dove for it then held it to his ear and shook it youve broken it he cried accusingly oh im sorry my fault speed apologized if it was your fault maybe youll fix it suggested the tenor gladly speed turned to his trainer buy a new alarm clock for our little friend he stripped off his bath robe and handed it to his trainer is she looking at me he whispered both eyes big as saucers speed settled his spikes into the dirt as he had seen other sprinters do set himself for an instant then loped easily around the house and out of sight to the cowboys this athletic panoply was vastly impressive with huge satisfaction they noticed the sleeveless shirt the loose runningtrunks and above all the generous display of medals with a wild yell of delight they broke out upon the trail of their champion only to have glass thrust his corpulent body in their path with an upflung arm he stemmed the tide its no use boys he cried hes a mile away chapter vi this doesnt look much like our storehouse does it jean paused in her task and seating herself upon the summit of a stepladder scrutinized with satisfaction the transformation wrought by a myriad of college flags sofa cushions colored shawls and bunting roberta keap dropped her hammer with an exclamation of pain ouch she cried ive hurt my thumb i cant hit where i look when people are talking why dont you pin them up queried miss blake sweetly a hammer is so dangerous mrs keap mumbled something but her enunciation was indistinct owing to the fact that her thumb was in her mouth helen finished tying a bow of ribbon upon the leg of a stool patted it into proper form then said it looks cheerful and restful added jean i think a gymnasium should be restful above all things agreed helen most of them are so bare and strenuouslooking they give one a headache she spied a whiteley exerciser fastened against the wall the one bit of gymnastic apparatus in the room oh the puller she cried i mustnt forget the puller she selected a pink satin ribbon and tied a chic bow upon one of the wooden handles there we can let him in now oh dear jean descended from her precarious position and admitted im tired out all that morning the three had labored busily transforming the storeroom into trainingquarters for speed who had declared that such things were not only customary but necessary to be sure it adjoined the bunkroom where the cowboys slept and there were no gymnastic appliances to give it character but it was the only space available and what it lacked in horizontal bars dumbbells and indian clubs it more than compensated for by a coseycorner a windowseat and many cushions speed had expressed his delight with the idea and agreed to wait for a glimpse of it and the atmosphere at the flying heart ranch was clearing the gloom of the cowboys had given way to a growing excitement a part of which communicated itself to the occupants of the house the lassitude of previous days was gone the monotony had disappeared and miss chapin had cause to rejoice at the presence of her latest guest for speed was like a tonic he was everywhere he inspired them all laughter followed in his wake even in the bunkhouse the cowboys retailed his extravagant stories with delight the flying heart had come into its own at last the centipede most scorned and hated of rivals was due for lasting defeat even cloudy the indian relaxed and spoke at rare intervals while willie worked about the place gleefully singing snatches of sam bass in a tuneless falsetto carara had come back from the centipede with news that gladdened the hearts of his hearers not only would that despicable outfit consent to run a footrace but they clamored for it they did not dicker over details nor haggle about terms but consented to put up the phonograph again and all the money at their disposal as well the cook was in training of all the denizens of the flying heart but two failed to enter fully into the spirit of the thing berkeley fresno looked on with a cynicism which he was too wise to display before miss blake seeing the lady of his dreams monopolized by a rival however inspired him to sundry activities and he spent much of his time among the cowboys whom he found profitable to the point of mystery mrs keap the youthful chaperon seemed likewise mastered by some private trouble and puzzled her companions vaguely helen reported that she did not sleep and once jean found her crying softly she seemed moreover to be apprehensive in a tremulous reasonless ways but when with friendly sympathy they brought the subject up she dismissed it in spite of secret tears she had lent willing hands to the decoration of the gymnasium and now nursed her swollen thumb with surprising good nature shall we let them in she inquired we have done all we can yes we have finished in a flutter of anticipation jean and helen put the final touches to their task while mrs keap stepped to the door and called speed he came at once followed by larry glass who upon grasping the scheme of decoration smote his brow and balanced dizzily upon his heels speed was lost in admiration its wonderful ejaculated the young athlete those college flags give it just the right touch and see the coseycorner glass regained his voice sufficiently to murmur sarcastically say aint this a swelllooking drum weve used every bit of bunting on the ranch said jean see the mexican shawls mrs keap added and look cried miss blake i brought you my prayerrug she displayed a small persian rug worn and faded evidently a thing of great age at which speed uttered an exclamation i always carry it with me and put it in front of my bed wherever i happen to be berkeley fresno drawn by the irresistible magnetism of miss blakes presence wandered in and ran his eyes over the room speed took the rug and examined it curiously its an oldtimer isnt it must be one of the first settlers yes its thousands and thousands of years old father picked it up somewhere in asia how does it work queried glass feeling of it gingerly its a very holy thing helen explained the mohammedan stands on it facing the east and cries allah alley repeated the trainer no allah allah is the mohammedan divinity explained speed ive got you glass was greatly interested then he makes his prayer it is such a sacred thing that when ones feet are on it no harm can come to one well what dyou think of that murmured the trainer fresno laughed pleasantly its too bad it isnt long enough to run this footrace on do you believe in the charm inquired speed of helen of course i do she answered he laughed sceptically whereupon larry glass broke in with husky accents nix on the comedy i bet its a wizard his employer gazed warmly at the owner of the priceless treasure and taking the rug tenderly pressed his lips to it fresno shook his head in disgust the brazen methods of this person were unbearable why all the colors asked he you can sing best where there is a piano i can train best under the shadow of college emblems i am a temperamental athlete youll be a dead athlete if you dont beat this cook the californian was angry indeed exclaimed his rival airily thats what i remarked did they tell you what happened to humpy joe your predecessor it must have been an accident judging from his name at which miss blake tittered she was growing to enjoy these passages at arms they thrilled her vaguely the only accident connected with the affair was that still bill and willie didnt have their guns glass started nervously did these rummies want to shoot him he inquired certainly said fresno he lost a footrace in spite of his assurance j wallingford speed felt a tremor of anxiety but he laughed it off saying one would think a footrace in this country was a pearl necklace these cowboys aint good losers eh queried glass its win or die out here during the ensuing pause mrs keap took occasion to call speed aside i have something to contribute to the trainingquarters if you will help me bring it out said she the young man bowed most gladly well be back in a little while the chaperon announced to the others and a moment later when she and speed had reached the veranda of the house she paused i i want to speak to you she began hesitatingly it was just an excuse wally looked at her with concern for it was plain that she was deeply troubled what is it i have been trying to get a word alone with you ever since i heard about this footrace the young man chilled with apprehension as mrs keap turned her dark eyes upon him searchingly why do you want to run to win back the cowboys treasure my heart is touched he declared boldly mrs keap smiled i believe the latter but are you sure you can win absobloominglutely i didnt know you were a sprinter speed shrugged his shoulders have you had experience oceans of it mrs keap mused for a moment tell me said she finally at what intercollegiate game did you run last i didnt run last i ran first it was impossible to resent the boys smile then at what game did you last run i hope im not too curious oh no not at all speed stammered or if it is easier at what college games did you first run mrs keap was laughing openly now why the clear ringing rippling laughter asked the young man to cover his confusion because i think it is very funny oh you do speed took refuge behind an attitude of unbending dignity but the young widow would have none of it i know all about you said she you are a very wonderful person of course you are a delightful fellow at a houseparty and a most suitable individual generally but you are not an athlete in spite of those beautiful clothes in your trunk who told you culver covington i didnt know you two were acquainted mrs keap flushed he told me all about you long ago you wear all the athletic clothes you know all the talk you have tried to make the team a dozen times but you are not even a substitute you are merely the varsity cheerleader culver calls you the headyeller columbus has discovered our continent said speed you are a very wise chaperon and you must have a corking memory for names but even a headyeller is better than a gleeclub quarterback he nodded toward the bunkhouse whence they had come you havent told anybody not yet yet he quoted the futurity implied in that word disturbs me suppose you and i keep it for a little secret secrets are very delightful at houseparties dont you consider your action deceitful not at all my motto is we strive to please think of helen thats it i cant think of anything else shes mad about athletics and i had to do something to stand off this weightlifting tenor is it any wonder a woman distrusts every man she meets mused the chaperon helen might forgive you i couldnt oh its not that bad i know what im doing you will cause these cowboys to lose a lot more money not at all when culver arrives oh that is what i want to talk over with you mrs keap broke in nervously then it isnt about the footrace you are not angry speed brightened amazingly im not exactly angry im surprised and grieved of course i cant forgive deceit i dare say i am more particular than most people but you wont tell mrs keap indicated in some subtle manner that she was not above making terms whereupon her companion declared warmly im yours for life ask me for my watch my right eye anything ill give it to you i assure you i shant ask anything so important as that but i shall ask a favor name it and it is yours speed wrung the hand she offered and perhaps i can do more than keep silent although i dont see what good it will do perhaps i can help your suit gracious lady all i ask is that you thrust out your foot and trip up berkeley fresno whenever he starts toward her put him out of the play and i shall be the happiest man in the world agreed now in what way can i serve you mrs keap became embarrassed while the same shadowy trouble that had been observed of late settled upon her i simply hate to ask it she said but i suppose i must there seems to be no other way out of it turning to him suddenly she said in a low intense voice i im in trouble mr speed such dreadful trouble oh im so sorry he answered her with genuine solicitude you neednt have made any conditions i would have done anything i could for you thats very kind for i dont like our air of conspiracy but mrs keap was wringing her slender hands i just cant tell the girls you you can help me speed allowed her time to grow calm when she continued i i am engaged to be married felicitations not at all said the young widow wretchedly that is the awful part of it i am engaged to two men she turned her brown eyes full upon him they were strained and tragic speed felt himself impelled to laugh immoderately but instead he observed in a tone to relieve her anxiety nothing unusual in that it has been done before even i have been prodigal with my affections what can i do to relieve the congestion please dont make light of it it means so much to me i im in love with jack chapin with jack yes when i came here i thought i cared for somebody else why i wanted to come here just because i knew that that somebody else had been invited too and we could be together and he couldnt come wait and then when i got here i met jack chapin that was less than a week ago and yet in that short time i have learned that he is the only man i can ever love the one man in all the world and you cant accept because you have a previous engagement i see jove its quite dramatic but i dont see why you are so excited if the other chap isnt coming but he is that is what makes it so dreadful if those two men should meet mrs keap buried her face in her hands and shuddered there would be a tragedy they are both so frightfully jealous she began to tremble and speed laid a comforting hand upon her shoulder i think you must be exciting yourself unduly said he jeans other friends didnt come theres nobody due now but culver cov thats who it is roberta raised her pallid face as the young man fell back culver great scott why hes engaged what nothing i i speed paused at an utter loss for words you see hell discover the truth does he know you are here no i intended to surprise him i was jealous i couldnt bear to think of his being here with other girls men are so deceitful thats why i consented to act as chaperon to helen and now to think that i should have met my fate in jack chapin i see you want me to break the news to culver no no mrs keap was aghast if he even suspected the truth hed become a raging lion oh ive been quite distracted ever since jack left well what am i to do you must have some part laid out for me i have a desperate situation demands a desperate remedy ive lost all conscience thats why i agreed to protect you if youd protect me go ahead culver is your friend were closer than a chord in g then you must wire him i have not to come what j wallingford speed started as if a wasp had stung him you must wire him at once not to come i dont care what excuse you give but stop him stop him speed reached for a pillar he felt that the porch was spinning slowly beneath his feet oh see here now i cant do that you promised cried mrs keap fiercely i have tried to think of something to tell him but im too frightened yes but but i want him here for this footrace wally swallowed bravely footrace stormed the widow indignantly would you allow an insignificant thing like a footrace to wreck a human life two human lives three cant you wire him mrs keap stamped her foot if he dreamed i was here he would hire a special train no it must come from you you are his best friend what can i say demanded the bewildered speed unhappily i dont care what you say i dont care what you do only do something and do it quickly before he has time to leave chicago then sensing the hesitation in her companions face or perhaps you prefer to have helen know the deceit you have practiced upon her and i fancy these cowboys would resent the joke dont you what do you think would happen if they discovered their champion to be merely a cheerleader with a trunkful of new clothes who cant do a single outdoor sport not one wait speed mopped his brow with a redandblue silk handkerchief ill do my best then i shall do my part and mrs keap who could not bear deception turned and went indoors while j wallingford speed a prey to sundry misgivings stumbled down the steps his head in a whirl chapter vii berkeley fresno was devoting himself to miss blake what do you think of our decorations she inquired they are more or less athletic he declared was it mr speeds idea yes he wanted trainingquarters its a joke isnt it i dont think so mr fresno why do you dislike mr speed fresno bent a warm glance upon the questioner dont you know helen shook her head with bland innocence then you do dislike him no indeed i like him he makes me laugh helen bridled loyally did you see those medals he wore yesterday the young man queried of course and i thought them beautiful how were they inscribed he wouldnt let me examine them naturally if i had trophies like that i would guard them too fresno nodded musingly i gave mine away oh are you an athlete no but i timed a footrace once they gave me a beautiful nearlybronze emblem so that i could get into the infield and did you win no no i didnt run dont you understand i was an official fresno was vexed at the girls lack of perception im not an athlete miss blake im just an ordinary sort of a chap he led her to a seat while jean enlisted the aid of larry glass and completed the finishing touches to the decorations athletics dont do a fellow any good after he leaves college im going into business this fall have you ever been to california miss blake admitted that she had never been so far and fresno launched himself upon a glowing description of his native state but before he could shape the conversation to a point where his hearer might perchance express a desire to see its wonders still bill stover thrust his head cautiously through the door to the bunkhouse and allowed an admiring eye to rove over the transformation looks like a bazaar he exclaimed whats the idea traininquarters said glass mr speed goin to live here inquired the foreman bringing the remainder of his lanky body into view no indeed jean corrected he will merely use this room to train in how do you train in a room stover asked her why you just train i suppose miss chapin turned to glass how does a person train in a room why he just trains thats all a guy cant train without traininquarters can he we thought it would make a nice gymnasium offered miss blake looks like business stovers admiration was keen i rode over to gallaghers place last night and laid our bets how much have you wagered asked fresno moren we can afford to lose but you arent going to lose miss blake said enthusiastically i got gallagher to play some records for me silas on fifth avenue sure and the holy city too willie stayed out by the barbwire fence he didnt dast to go in when i come out i found him ready to cry that desperado has sure got the heart of a woman i reckon hed commit a murder for that phonograph hes so full of sentiment fresno spoke sympathetically its a fortunate thing for you fellows that speed came when he did im anxious for him to beat this cook and i hate to see him so careless with his training careless cried helen whats he done inquired stover nothing so far thats the trouble hes sure he can win but fresno shook his head doubtfully theres such a thing as overconfidence no matter how good a man may be he should take care of himself whats wrong with his trainin demanded glass i think he ought to have more rest its too noisy around the house he cant get enough sleep nor anybody else agreed glass meaningly theres too much singin thats funny said stover music soothes me no matter how bad it is last night when we come back from the centipede mr fresno was singin dearie but i dozed right off in the middle of it an its the same way with cattle they like it its part of a mans duty when hes nightridin a herd to pizen the atmosphere with melody what i mean to say is this fresno hastened to explain we keep late hours at the house whereas an athlete ought to retire early and arise with the sun i thought it would be a good scheme to have mr speed sleep out here until the race is over where he wont be disturbed nine oclock is bedtime for a man in training oh i dont think that is at all necessary said miss blake quickly we cant afford to spoil his chances argued the young man there is too much at stake am i right mr glass now like most fat men lawrence glass was fond of his rest and since his arrival at the flying heart his sleepinghours had been shortened considerably so for once he agreed with the californian no question about it said he and ill sleep here with him if youll put a couple of cots in the place but suppose mr speed wont do it questioned miss blake you ask him and he wont refuse said jean we dont want to see him defeated urged helens other suitor at which the girl rose saying doubtfully of course ill do my best if you think its really important thank you said stover gratefully while fresno congratulated himself upon an easy victory ill ask him at once but you must come along jean and you too mr glass the two girls took speeds trainer with them and went forth in search of the young man its up to you fellows to see that he gets to bed early said fresno when he and stover were alone leave it to us and as for gettin up we turn out at daylight i dont reckon he could sleep none after that if he tried stover pointed to the striped elastic coils of the exerciser against the wall i didnt want to speak about it while they was here said he but one of them young ladies lost her garters thats not a pair of garters thats a chestweight jest wait for what chestweight chestdeveloper oh stover examined the device curiously i thought a chestdeveloper came in a bottle fresno explained the operation of the apparatus at which the cowman remarked admiringly that young feller is all right aint he think so sure dont you fresno explained his doubts by a crafty lift of his brows and a shrug i thought so at first stover wheeled upon him abruptly whats wrong oh nothing after a pause the foreman remarked vaguely hes the intercollegit champeen of yale oh no hardly that or i would have heard of him aint he no champeen champion of the running broad smile and the halfmile talk perhaps aint he a footrunner perhaps ive never seen him run but i have my doubts good lord moaned stover weakly he may be the best printer in the country mind you but ill lay a little bet that he cant run a hundred yards without sustenance without what sustenance something to eat well weve got plenty for him to eat said the mystified foreman you dont understand however time will tell but we aint got no time weve made this race pay or play a week from saturday and the bets are down we was afraid the centipede would welsh when they seen who we had so we framed it thataway whats to be done again fresno displayed an artistic restraint that was admirable its none of my business said he with a careless shrug i i guess ill tell willie and the boys vouchsafed bill apprehensively no no dont breathe a word ive said to you he may be a crackerjack and i wouldnt do him an injustice for the world all the same i wish he hadnt broken my stopwatch dyou think he broke it apurpose what do you think stover mopped the sweat from his brow cant we time him with a ordinary watch sure we can take yours it wont be exact but i aint got no watch i bet mine last night at the centipede willies got one though mind you he may be all right fresno repeated reassuringly then hearing the object of their discussion approaching with his trainer the two strolled out through the bunkroom stover a prey to a newborn suspicion fresno musing to himself that diplomacy was not a lost art youre a fine friend you are speed exploded when he and glass were inside the gymnasium what made you say yes i had to rot larry you played into fresnos hands deliberately now ive got to spend my evenings in bed while he sits in the hammock and sings dearie he shook his head gloomily who knows what may happen it will do you good to get some sleep wally but i dont want to sleep cried the exasperated suitor i want to make love do you think i came all the way from new york to sleep i can do that at yale take it from me bo youve got plenty of time to win that dame eight hours is a workin day anywhere my dear fellow the union hours for courting dont begin until pm ive got myself into a fine mess havent i just when night spreads her sable mantle and dan cupid strings up his bow i must forsake my ladylove and crawl into the hay oh youre a good trainer youd better can some of this lovetalk and think more about footracin it cant be done nine oclock the middle of the afternoon its rather funny though isnt it speed was not the sort to cherish even a real grievance for any considerable time if it had happened to anybody else id laugh myself sick glass chuckled the whole thing is a hit look at this joint for instance he took in their surroundings with a comprehensive gesture it looks about as much like a gymnasium as i look like a contortionist why dont you get a morris chair and a mandolin there are two reasons said speed facetiously first it takes an athlete to get out of a morris chair and second a mandolin has proved to be many a young mans ruin glass examined the bow of ribbon upon the lonesome piece of exercising apparatus it looks like the traininstable for the colonial dames what a yelp this place would be to covington or any other athlete it is not an athletic gymnasium speed smiled as he lighted a cigarette it is a romantic gymnasium as socrates once observed socrates im hep to him glass interrupted quickly i trained a greek professor once and got wised up on all that stuff socrates was the the hemlock kid exactly as socrates the hemlock kid deftly put it in hoc signature vintage i dont get you that is archaic scandinavian and translated means love cannot thrive without her bower no answer to that telegram yet eh hardly time better wire covington again hadnt you mebbe he didnt get it i promised mrs keap that i would but speed lost himself abruptly in speculation for he did not know exactly how to manage this unexpected complication of one thing only was he certain it would require some thought say wally suppose covington dont come then i shall sprain my ankle said the other hello what in the world still bill stover and willie came into the room carrying an armful of lumber behind them followed carara with a huge wooden tub and cloudy rolling a kerosene barrel where do you want it gents inquired the foreman where do we want what the showerbath shower i didnt order a showerbath no but we aim to make it as pleasant for you as we can if there is anything i abhor its a showerbath exclaimed the athlete you just got to have one mr fresno said all this gymnasium lacked was a showerbath a pair of scales and a bulletinboard he said youd sure need a bath after workin that chestdeveloper we aint got no scales nor no board but well toggle up some sort of a bath for you the blacksmiths makin a squirter to go on the barl very well put it wherever you wish i shant use it i wouldnt overlook nothin if i was you said willie in even milder tones than stover had used you overwhelm me with these little attentions retorted mr speed where you goin to run today inquired the first speaker i dont know why we thought you might do a hundred yards agin time nix interposed glass hurriedly i cant let him overdo at the start besides we aint got no stopwatch i got a reglar watch said willie and i can catch you pretty close wed admire to see you travel some mr speed but glass vowed that he was in charge of his proteges health and would not permit it once outside however he exclaimed thats more of fresnos work wally i tell you hes jerry hell rib them pirates to clock you and if they do well youd better keep runnin thats all you can do me a favor said speed buy that watch theres other watches on the farm buy them all and bring me the bill before setting out on his daily grind speed announced to his trainer that he had decided to take him along for company and when that corpulent gentleman rebelled on the ground that the day was too sultry his employer would have none of it so together they trotted away later in the morning speed in his silken suit glass running flatfooted and with great effort but once safely hidden from view they dropped into a walk and selecting a favorable restingplace paused speed lighted a cigarette glass produced a deck of cards from his pocket and they played sevenup having covered five miles in this exhausting fashion they returned to the ranch in time for luncheon both ate heartily for the exercise had agreed with them chapter viii lawrence glass was beginning to like new mexico not only did it afford a tinge of romance discernable in the deep haunting eyes of mariedetta the maid but it offered an opportunity for financial advancement as for instance the purchase of willies watch this timepiece cost the trainer twentyone dollars and he sold it to speed for double the amount believing in the luck of even numbers nor did young speed allow his trainers efforts to cease here for in every portable timepiece on the ranch he recognized a menace and not until lawrence had cornered the market and the whole collection was safely locked in his trunk did he breathe easily this required two days during which the young people at the ranch enjoyed themselves thoroughly they were halcyon days for the yale man for fresno was universally agreeable and seemed resigned to the fact that helen should prefer his rivals company to his own even when speed had regretfully dragged himself off to bed in the evening the plump tenor amused miss blake by sounding the suitors praises as an athlete reports of which pleased wally intensely mr fresno was a patient person who realized fully the fact that a fall is not painful unless sustained from a considerable height as for glass he recounted tales of mariedettas capitulation to his employer and wheezed merrily over the discomfiture of the mexican girls former admirers shes a swell little dame he confided to speed one afternoon as they lounged luxuriously in the shade at their customary restingplace yes and im aces with her too they had set out for their daily run and were now contesting for the sevenup supremacy of the catskill mountains already glass had been declared the undisputed champion of the atlantic coast while speed on the day previous had wrested from him the championship of the mississippi valley but mariedetta is dark said the college man as he cut the cards she is almost a mulatto naw shes no dinge shes an aztec an them aztecs is swell people say she can play a guitar like a barber miss blake told me she was in love with carara glass grunted contemptuously ive got it on that insurrects four ways why im learning to talk spanish myself if he gets flossy ill cross one over his bow the trainer made a vicious jab at an imaginary mexican he aint got a good wallop in him like all new yorkers no matter what their station lawrence cherished a provincial contempt for such people as are not of manhattan while he was woefully timid in the presence of firearms and the flash of steel reduced him to a panic he was a past master at the manly art and carried a punch in which he reposed unlimited faith the deference with which the cowboys treated him their simple childlike faith in his every utterance combined to exaggerate his contempt for them even carara disappointed in love treated him with a smiling backward sort of courtesy which the trainer misconstructed as timidity i thought cowboys was tough guys continued he but its a mistake that little willie for instance is a lamb he packs that mauser for protection hes afraid some farmer will walk up and poke his eye out with a corncob one copper with a nightstick could stampede the whole outfit but theyre all right at that he acknowledged magnanimously theyre a nice bunch of fellers when you know how to take em the flies are awful today speed complained they bite my legs ill bring out a bath robe tomorrow and well hide it in the bushes i wish there was some place to keep this beer cool glass shifted some bottles to a point where the sunlight did not strike them im getting tired of training larry acknowledged the younger man with a yawn it takes so much time glass shook his head in sympathy seems like wed ought to hear from covington said he hes on his way no doubt isnt it time to go back to the ranch glass consulted his watch no we aint done but three miles here goes for the rubber it was berkeley fresno who retreated cautiously from the shelter of a thicket a hundred yards up the arroyo and started briskly homeward congratulating himself upon the impulse that had decided him to follow the training partners upon their daily routine he made directly for the corral which i dont consider theres no consideration comin to him whatever said willie that evening he aint acted on the level now see here objected stover he may be just what he claims he is simply because he dont go skallyhootin around in the hot sun aint no sign he cant run what about them empty beer bottles demanded willie no feller can train on that stuff i went out there myself and seen em there was a dozen mebbe glass drank it what i claim is this we aint got no proof fresno is stuck on miss blake and hes a knocker then lets git some proof and dam quick si senores agreed carara who had been an interested listener i agree with you but we got to be careful willie grunted with disgust we cant go at it like we was killin snakes mr speed is a guest here again the little gun man expressed his opinion this time in violettinted profanity and the other cowboys joined in all the same he is a guest and no rough work goes im in charge while mr chapin is away and im responsible senor bill carara ventured the fat vaquero he is no guest he is one of us thats right seconded willie hes told us all along that mr speed was a mercryfooted wonder and if the young feller cant run he had ought to have told us mr cloudy showed his understanding of the discussion by nodding silently well put it up to him in the morning said stover if mr speed cannot rrrun wat you do eh questioned the mexican nobody answered still bill seemed at a loss for words mr cloudy stared gloomily into space and willie ground his teeth on the following morning speed sought a secluded nook with helen but no sooner had he launched himself fairly upon the subject uppermost in his mind than he was disturbed by a delegation of cowboys consisting of the original four who had waited upon him that first morning after his arrival they came forward with grave and serious mein requesting a moments interview it was plain there was something of more than ordinary importance upon their minds from the manner in which stover spoke but when helen quickly volunteered to withdraw speed checked her stay where you are i have no secrets from you said he then noting the troubled face of the foreman quoted impatiently you may fire when ready gridley still bill shifted the lump in his cheek and cleared his throat before beginning formally mr speed while we honor you a heap for your accomplishments and while we believe in you as a man and a champeen we kind of feel that it might make you stretch your legs some if you knew just exactly what this footrace means to the flying heart outfit i assured you that the centipede cook would be beaten said the college man stiffly isnt mr speeds word sufficient inquired the girl stover bowed it had sure ought to be and we thank you for them new assurances you see our spiritual onrest is due to the fact that humpy joes getaway left us broke and we banked on you to pull us even that first experience strained our credulity to the bustin point and well in words of one syllable we come from joplin missouri said willie my dear sirs i cant prove that you are going to win your wagers until the day of the race however if you are broke to start with i dont see how you can expect to lose a great deal you aint got the right angle on the affair stover explained outside of the onbearable contumely of losin twice to this centipede outfit which would be bad enough we have drawn a months wages in advance and we have put it up moreover i have bet my watch which was presented to me by the officials of the santa fe for killin a pair of roadagents when i was depity sheriff miss blake uttered a little scream and speed regarded the lanky speaker with new interest its a waltham movement solid gold case eighteen jewels and engraved with my name no wonder you prize it said wally i bet my saddle informed carara in his slow soft dialect stamp leather wit silver filagree it is more dear to me than well i love it ver much senor seems like willie has made the extreme sacrifice stover followed up while all our boys has gone the limit willie has topped em all hes bet his gun indeed is it a good weapon its been good to me said the little man dryly i took it off the quivering remains of a sheriff in dodge city up to that time the best hip shot in kansas speed felt a cold chill steal up his spine while miss blake went pale and laid a trembling hand upon his arm you see it aint intrinsic value so much as association and sentiment that leads to this interview stover continued it aint no joke we dont joke with the centipede and weve relied on you the mex here would do murder for that saddle carara nodded and breathed something in his own tongue i have parted with my honor and willie is gamblin just as high but i notice mr willie still has his revolver sure i got it willie laughed abruptly and i dont give it up till we lose neither thats the understandin his voice was surprisingly harsh for one so highpitched he looked more like a professor than ever willie has reasons for his caution which we respect explained the spokesman j wallingford speed face to face with these seriousminded gentlemen began to reflect that this footrace was not a thing to be taken too lightly i cant understand he declared with a touch of irritation why you should risk such priceless things upon a friendly encounter friendly cried willie and stover in a tone that made their listeners gasp the centipede and the flying heart is just as friendly as a pair of wild boars you see its a good thing we wised you up added the latter carara muttered fiercely senor i works five year for that saddle i am a good gambler si si but i keel somebody biffore i lose it to the centipede and is that echo phonograph worth all this inquired helen we won that phonograph at risk of life and limb said willie doggedly from the centipede and twenty other outfits senor its a trophy declared the foreman and so long as it aint where it belongs the flying heart is in disgrace even the leven x treats us scornful cried the smallest of the trio angrily were a joke to the whole state i know just how these gentlemen must feel declared miss blake tactfully at which stover bowed with grateful awkwardness and its really a wonderful instrument said he i dont reckon theres another one like it in the world leastways in these parts youd ought to hear it clear as a bell and sweet said willie god its sure sweet why we was a passel of savages on this ranch till we got it no sentiment no music no nothin in our souls except profanity and thirst then everything changed stover nodded gravely we got gentle that music mellered us up we got so we was as full of brotherly love as a basket of kittens some of the boys commenced writin home cloudy begin to pay his poker debts youd scarcely hear enough profanity to make things bearable i tell you it was refined it got so that when a man came steamin in after a weeks high life and low company in town his wages gone and his stummick burnin like hed swallered all his cigarbutts it didnt make no difference if he found a herd of purple crocodiles in his blankets or the bunkhouse walls acrawlin with gila monsters little things like that wouldnt phaze him hed switch on the echo phonograph and doze off like a babe in arms for the tender notes of madamosella melby in the holy city would soothe and comfort him like the caressin hand of a young female woman i begin to feel your loss said speed gravely gentlemen i can only assure you i shall do my best then you wont take no chances inquired willie mildly you may rely upon me to take care of myself thank you the delegation moved away what dyou think of him inquired stover of the little man in glasses when they were out of hearing i think hes all right willie hesitated only kind of crazy like all eastern boys it dont seem credible that no sane man would dast to bluff after what weve said hed be flyin in the face of providence but this comforting conclusion wavered again when berkeley fresno who had awaited their report scoffed openly he cant run if he could run hed be running i tell you he cant run as fast as a sheep can walk senor you see those beautiful medal he have expostulated carara sure agreed willie his brisket was covered with em he had one that hung down like a dewlap phony ive killed men for less muttered the stoopshouldered man did you see his legs fresno was bent upon convincing his hearers couldnt help but see em in that runninsuit nice and soft and white werent they they didnt look like dark meat stover agreed reluctantly but you cant go nothin on the looks of a fellers legs well then take his wind a runner always has good lungs but ill bet if you snapped him on the chest with a rubber band hed cough himself to death mebbe he aint in good shape yet fresno sneered no and hell never get into good condition with those girls hanging around him all the time dont you know that the worst thing in the world for an athlete is to talk to a woman thats the worst thing in the world for anybody said willie with cynicism but how can we stop it make him eat as well as sleep in his trainingquarters dont let him spend any time whatever in female company keep your eyes on him night and day willie spoke his mind deliberately im in favor of that if this is another humpy joe affair im agoin to put one more notch in my gunhandle and it looks like a cub bear had chawed it already there aint but one thing to do stover announced firmly weve got to put it up to mr glass and learn the truth youll find him in the bunkhouse directed fresno i think ill trail along and hear what he has to say chapter ix glass had gone to the cowboys sleepingquarters in search of his employer and was upon the point of leaving when the delegation filed in he regarded them with careless contempt and removed his clay pipe to exclaim cheerfully b zoo gents wheres my protege i dont know where did you have it last i mean speed my trainin partner thats a french word oh we just left him think ill hunt him up wait a minute willie came forward lets talk all right well visit let her go professor youve been handlin him for quite a spell havent you sure its my trainin that put him where he is ask him if it aint then hes a good athlete is he is he good huh glass grunted expressively how fast can he do a hundred yards larry yawned as if this conversation bored him oh about eight seconds at this amazing declaration willie paused as if to thoroughly digest it eight seconds repeated the little man at length sure depends on how he feels of course berkeley fresno in the corner snickered audibly at which the trainer scowled at him think he cant do it eh well hes there four ways from the ace seeing no evidence that his statement failed to carry conviction in other quarters at least glass went further it was so easy to string these simpleminded people that he could not resist the temptation didnt you never hear about the killin he made at saratoga he queried willie started and his hand crept slowly backward along his belt killin is that his game now get me right explained the former speaker he breaks trainin and goes up to saratoga for a little rest while hes there he wins eight thousand dollars playin diabolo playin what queried stover diabolo he backs himself of course glass took an imaginary spool from his pocket spun it by means of an imaginary string then sent it aloft and pretended to catch it dexterously the cowboys watched him with grave uncomprehending eyes he starts with a case five and runs it up to eight thousand dollars thats all stover uttered an exclamation of astonishment whereupon the newyorker grew even bolder the next week he hops over to bar harbor and wins the furturity pingpong stakes from scratch thats worth twenty thousand if its worth a lead nickel oh i guess hes there all right he searched out a match and relighted his pipe i suppose hes a great croquetplayer too observed fresno whose face was purple sure glass winked at him glad to see that the californian enjoyed this kind of sport we dont care nothin about his skill at sleightofhand tricks said the man in spectacles seriously and we wouldnt hold his croquet habits agin him some men drink some gamble some do worse every man has his weakness and croquet may be his what we want to know is this can he win our phonograph surest thing you know then you vouch for him do you willies eyes were bent upon the fat man with a look of searching gravity that warned glass not to temporize with my life exclaimed the trainer youre on said the cowboy with unexpected grimness what dyou mean but before the other could explain berkeley fresno who had sunk weakly into a chair at larrys extravagant praise of his rival afforded a diversion the tenor had leaned back convulsed with enjoyment when losing his balance he came to the floor with a crash the sudden sound brought a terrifying result for with a startled cry the undersized cowman leaped as if touched by a living flame like a flash of light he whirled and poised on his toes his long evillooking revolver drawn and cocked his tense face vulturelike and fierce his eyes glared through his spectacles his livid features worked as if at the sound of his own deathcall his whole frame was tense a galvanic current had transformed him his weapon darted toward the spot whence the noise had come and he would have fired blindly had not stover yelled dont shoot willie paused and the breath crept audibly into his lungs who done that he asked harshly still bill brought his lanky frame up above the level of the table god lmighty dont be so sudden willie he cried it was a accident but the gun man seemed unconvinced with catlike tread he stole cautiously to the door and stared out into the sunlight then seeing nobody in sight he replaced his weapon in its restingplace and sighed with relief i thought it was the marshal from waco he said hell never git me alive stover addressed himself to fresno who had gone pale and was still prostrate where he had fallen get up mr berkeley but dont make no more moves like that behind a mans back he most got you fresno arose in a daze and mopped his brow murmuring weakly ii didnt mean to carara and mr cloudy came out from cover whither they had fled at willies first movement i dreamed about that feller agin last night apologized the little man im sort of nervous and any sudden noise sets me off as for glass that corpulent individual had disappeared as if into thin air only a stir in one of the bunks betrayed his hidingplace at the first sight of willies revolver he had dived for a refuge and was now flattened against the wall a pillow pressed over his head to deaden the expected report hey called the foreman but glass did not hear him seems to be gunshy observed willie gently stover crossed to the bunk and laid a hand upon the occupant at which a convulsion ran through the trainers soft body and it became as rigid as if locked in death come out mr glass its all over larry muttered in a stifled voice go way it was a mistake he opened his tightshut lids rolled over and thrust forth a round pallid face he saw stover laughing and beheld the white teeth of carara the mexican who said perhaps the senor is sleepy finding himself the object of what seemed to him a particularly senseless joke the newyorker crept forth his face suffused with anger strangely enough he still retained the pipe in his fingers say are youse guys tryin to kid me he demanded roughly now that no firearm was in sight he was master of himself again and seeing the cause of his undignified alarm leaning against the table he stepped toward him threateningly if you try that again young feller ill chip you on the jaw and give you a long dreamy nap he thrust a short square fist under willies nose that scholarly gentleman straightened up and edged his way to one side glass following aggressively youre a husky aint you said the little man squinting up at the red face above him am i glass snorted take a good look with deliberate menace he bumped violently into the other it was with difficulty he could restrain himself from crushing him stover gasped and retreated while carara crossed himself then sidled back of a bunk mr cloudy stepped silently out through the open door and held his thumbs you start to kid me and ill wallop you one moment willie was transfigured suddenly an instant since he had been a stoopshouldered shortsighted insignificant person more gentle mannered than a child but in a flash he became a palpitating fury an evil atom surcharged with such terrific venom that his antagonist drew back involuntarily dont you make no threatnin moves in my direction or youll go east in an icebath he was panting as if the effort to hold himself in leash was almost more than he could stand gwan said glass thickly youre deluded with the idea that the constitution made all men equal but it didnt it was mr colt with a movement quicker than light the speaker drew his gun for the second time and buried half the barrel in the newyorkers ribs look out glass barked the words and undertook to deflect the weapon with his hand let it alone or itll go off glass dropped his hand as if it had been burned and stared down his bulging front with horrified fascinated eyes now listen weve stood for you as long as we can youve made your talk and got away with it but from now on youre working for us weve framed a footrace and put up our panga because you said you had a champeen now we aint sayin you lied cause if we thought you had id gutshoot you here now willie paused while glass licked his lips and undertook to frame a reply the black muzzle of the weapon hovering near his heart however stupefied him mechanically he thrust the stem of his pipe between his lips while willie continued to glare at him balefully youre boss is a guest but you aint we can talk plain to you y yes of course you said just now youd answer for him with your life well we aim to make you we aint agoin to lose this footrace under no circumstances whatever so we give you complete authority over the body health and speed of mr speed its up to you to make him beat that cook sssuppose he gets sick or sprains his ankle glass undertook to move his body from in front of the weapon but it followed him as if magnetized there aint agoin to be no accidents or excuses its pay or play money at the tape youre his trainer and its your fault if he aint fit when he toes the mark understand willie lowered the muzzle of his weapon and fired between the legs of glass who leaped into the air with all the grace of a gazelle it was due to no conscious action on his part that the trainer leaped his muscles were stimulated spasmodically and propelled him from the floor at the same time his will was so utterly paralyzed that he had no control over his movements he did not even hear the yell that burst from his throat as his lungs contracted he merely knew that he was in the supremest peril and that flight was futile therefore he undertook to steady himself every tissue of his body seemed to creep and crawl the flesh inside his legs was quivering the closecropped hair of his thick neck rose and prickled and his capacious abdomen throbbed and pulsated like a huge bowl of jelly he laid his hands upon it to still the disturbance then he became conscious that he had bitten his pipestem in two and swallowed the end he felt it sticking in his throat did you hear what i said demanded willie in a voice that sounded like the sawing of a meat bone glass opened his mouth and when no sound issued nodded and you understand again the trainer bobbed his head the pipestem had cut off all power of speech and he knew himself dumb for life then i guess thats all its up to you willie replaced his gun and the fat man threatened to fall come on boys the cowboys filed out silently but on the threshold willie paused and darted a venomous glance at his enemy dont forget what i said about mr colt and the equality of man yes sir yes maam ejaculated the frightened trainer nervously when they were gone he collapsed they are rather severe arent they ventured fresno severe cried the unhappy man why speed cant he was about to explain everything when the memory of willies words smote him like a blow that fiend had threatened to kill him lawrence glass without preliminary if it became evident that a fraud had been practiced manifestly this was no place for hysterical confidences larrys mouth closed like a trap while the californian watched him intently at length he did speak but in a strangely softened tone and at utter variance with his custom say mr fresno which direction is new york that way fresno pointed to the east and the other man stared longingly out through the bunkhouse window its quite a walk aint it walk berkeley laughed its two or three thousand miles glass sighed heavily why do you ask oh nothin jest gettin homesick he calmed himself with an effort entered the gymnasium as if in search of something and then set forth to find speed that ecstatic young gentleman wrenched his gaze away from the blue eyes of miss blake to see his trainer signalling him from afar what is it lawrence got to see you presently nix i got to see you now glasss ruddy face was blotched and he seemed to rest in the grip of some blighting malady beneath his arm he carried a tightrolled bundle sensing something important back of this unusual demeanor speed excused himself and followed larry who did not trust to speech until they were alone in the gymnasium with the doors closed then he unrolled the bundle he carried spread it upon the floor and stepped into its exact centre are you standing on my prayerrug demanded his companion angrily i am and from this on im goin to make it work itself to death she said a feller couldnt get hurt if he stood on it and said allah well im goin to wear it out whats wrong do you know whats goin to happen to me if covington dont get here and beat this cook happen to you yes me these outlaws have put it up to me to win this bet for them well covington can beat anybody but covington isnt here yet not yet but the young man smiled youre not frightened are you scared to death thats all acknowledged the other then when his employer laughed openly he broke out at a whiteheat joke eh well youd better have a good laugh while you can because humpy joes finish will be a tencourse dinner to what youll get if covington misses his train how easily frightened you are yes well any time people start shooting shots im too big for this earth the hole in a gun looks as big as a gastank to me but nobody is going to shoot you exclaimed the mystified college man they aint hey i missed the golden stairs by a lip not half an hour ago i got a pipestem crossways in my gullet now and it tickles he coughed loudly then shook his head no use it wont come up with feverish intensity he told of his narrow escape from destruction the memory bringing a sweat of agony to his brow and the worst of it is he concluded im marked with guns ive always been that way tut tut dont alarm yourself if covington shouldnt come the race will be declared off no chance announced the trainer with utter conviction these thugs have made it pay or play and the bets are down you know i cant run if he dont come youll have to absurd i shall be indisposed if you mean youll get sick or sprain an ankle or break a leg or kill yourself guess again im responsible for you now something may go wrong with me that pipestem is liable to gimme a cancer but nothin is goin to happen to you my only chance to make a live of it is to cough up that clay and get some one to outrun this cook youre the only chance ive got if culver dont show and the first law of nature aint never been repealed selfprotection eh exactly glass coughed thrice without result stepped off the prayerrug rolled it up tightly then hugging it beneath his arm went on that foureyed guy slipped me a whole lot of feedbox information why hes a killer wally and hes got a cashregister to tally his dead notches on his gunhandle i suppose so many that it looks like his wife had used it to hang pictures with i tell you hes the most deceitful rummy i ever seen whats more hes got the homicide habit and the habit has got its eye on me glass was in deadly earnest and his alarm contrasted so strongly with his former contemptuous attitude toward the cowboys that speed was constrained to laugh again its the most amusing thing i ever heard of yes said the trainer with elaborate sarcasm it would be awful funny if it wasnt on the square he moistened his lip nervously you alarm yourself unnecessarily well hear from culver soon either by wire or in person hes never failed me yet but if i were you larry id leave that mexican girl alone mary yes mariedetta now theres something to be afraid of if these cowboys are in love with her and have their eyes on you oh willie aint her steady and hes the only one im leary of marys beau is that egyptian with the funny clothes and i can lick any guy with tight pants a gentle knock sounded at the door at which speed called come in senor aurelio maria carara entered he was smoking his customary cornhusk cigarette but his dark eyes were grave and his silken mustachios were pointed to the fineness of a bristle chapter x buenos dias senor carara bowed politely to speed goodmorning again said wally turning to the trainer carara eyed him from top to toe removed his cigarette and flipped the ashes daintily from it then smiling disdainfully said buenos dias senor fat glass started you talkin to me yes carara leaned languidly against the wall took a match from his pocket and dextrously struck it between the nails of his thumb and finger he breathed his lungs full of smoke and exhaled it through his nose i would have spik to you biffore but the senor fat is he shrugged his shoulders frighten so bad he will not understan so i come back whos scared said glass gruffly carara turned his palm outward in gentle apology you been talk a gret deal to my senorita to mariedetta eh oh the cuban queen glass winked openly at speed sure i slip her a laugh now and then she is not cubana she is mexicana said carara politely well what dyou think of that i thought she was a cuban glass began to chuckle senor fat broke in the mexican sharply while larry winced at the distasteful appellation she is my senorita is she well i cant help it if she falls for me the speaker cast an appreciative glance at his employer and you can cut out that senor fat because it dont go then he gasped for carara slowly drew from inside his shirt a long thinbladed knife bearing marks of recent grinding and his black eyes snapped his face had become suddenly convulsed while his voice rang with the tone of chilled metal glass retreated a step a shudder ran through him and his eyes riveted themselves upon the weapon with horrified intensity listen pig if you spik to her again i will cut you the gaze of the mexican pierced his victim i will not keel you i will just cut you speed who had sat in openmouthed amazement during the scene pinched himself like larry he could not remove his gaze from the swarthy man he pulled himself together with an effort however undertaking to divert the present trend of the conversation w where will you cut him he asked pleasantly more to make conversation than from any lingering question as to the precise location here carara turned the blade against himself and traced a cross upon his front whereupon the trainer gurgled and laid protecting hands upon his protruding abdomen you spik spanish no glass shook his head but you understan wat i try to say yes oh yes im hep all right and the senor fat will rrremember sure glass sighed miserably and tearing his eyes away from the glittering blade rolled them toward his employer i dont want her mr speed knows i dont want her carara bowed and the fat senor will not spik wit her again no gracias senor i thank you youre welcome agreed the new yorker with repressed feeling adios adios senor speed goodbye exclaimed the two in chorus carara returned the knife to its hidingplace swept the floor gracefully with his sombrero then placing the spangled headpiece at an exact angle upon his raven locks lounged out his silver spurs tinkling in the silence glass took a deep breath he doesnt mean to kill you just cut you said speed i got it declared the other fervently again he laid repressing hands upon his bulging front and looked down at it tenderly theyve all got it in for my pad havent they i told you to keep away from that girl humph glass spoke with soulful conviction take it from me bo ill walk around her as if she was a lake whod ever think that chorusman was a killer surely you dont care for her seriously not now i i love my cuban but he quivered apprehensively ill bet that rummy packs a shiv in every pocket from outside the bunkhouse came the low musical notes of a quail and glass puckered his lips to answer then grew pale thats her he declared in a panic ive got a date with her are you going to keep it not for a nosebag full of gold nuggets take a look wally and see what shes doing speed did as directed shes waiting let her wait breathed the trainer here comes stover and willie more bad news glass unrolled his prayerrug and stepped upon it hastily say whats that word quick you know the password quick allah thats her the fat man began to mumble thickly it was plain that his spirit was utterly broken but this call was prompted purely by solicitude it seemed willie had little to say and stover ignoring all mention of the earlier encounter he had witnessed exclaimed theres been some queer goinson round here mr speed have you noticed em no what sort well the other mornin i discovered some tracks through one of miss jeans flowerbeds tracks sure strange tracks mans tracks what does that signify we aint altogether certain carara says he seen a stranger hangin around night before last and jest now we found where a hoss had been picketed out in the ravine looks like hed stood there moren once why this is decidedly mysterious we figured wed ought to tell you it has nothing to do with me i aint sure it looks to us like its somebody from the centipede theyre equal to any devilment speed showed an utter lack of comprehension so willie explained understand weve made this race pay or play mebbe they aim to cripple you me speed started good heavens oh theyd do it quick enough i wouldnt put it past em to drop a through your winder if it could be done safe shoot me you mean allah said glass devoutly from his corner stover and willie nodded if i was you id keep the lamp between me and the winder every night why this is abominable exclaimed the young college man stiffly i i cant stand for this its getting too serious there aint nothin to fear said willie soothingly remember i told you at the start that wed see there wasnt no crooked work done well im goin to ride herd on you constant mr speed he smiled in a manner to reassure if theres any shootin comes off ill be in on it s say whats to prevent us being murdered when were out for a run queried glass me declared the little man ill saddle my bronc an lope along with you well keep to the open country instantly speed saw the direful consequences of such a procedure and summoned his courage to say no its very kind of you but i shall give up training what i mean training on the road i ill run indoors not a bit like it declared stover youll get your daily run if we have to lay off all the punchers on the place and put em on as a bodyguard but i dont want a bodyguard cried the athlete desperately we cant let you get hurt youre worth too much to us larry and i will take a chance not for mine firmly declared the trainer i dont need no mineral in my system im for the house then i shall run alone youre game said willie admiringly and his auditor breathed easier but we cant allow it i id rather risk my life than put you to so much trouble its only a pleasure nevertheless i cant allow it ill run alone if they kill me for it oh they wont try to kill you theyll probably shoot you in the legs thats just as good and its a heap easier to get away with speed felt his kneecaps twitching ive got it said he at last ill run at night stover hesitated thoughtfully i dont reckon you could do yourself justice thataway but you might do your trainin at daylight the centipede goes to work the same time we do and the chances is your assassin wont miss his breakfast good i ill do that i sure admire your courage but if you see anything suspicious let us know well git em said willie thank you the two men went out whereupon glass chattered w what did i tell you its worsen suicide to stick around this farm im going to blow where are you going new york lets beat it never exclaimed the college man stubbornly well hear from covington before long besides i cant leave until i get some money from home lets walk dont be a fool then ive got to have a drink glass started for the livingquarters but at the door ducked quickly out of sight shes there he whispered tragically she seen me too mariedetta was squatting in the shade opposite her eyes fixed stolidly upon the trainingquarters then youve got to lay low till she gives up declared wally were in trouble enough as it is for nearly an hour the partners discussed the situation while the mexican maid retained her position then when glass was on the verge of making a desperate sally cloudy entered silently although this had been an unhappy morning for the trainer here at least was one person of whom he had no fear and his natural optimism being again to the fore he greeted the indian lightly well hows the weather cloudy mr cloudy to you said the other both glass and his protege stared it was the first word the indian had uttered since their arrival lawrence winked at his companion all right if you like it better hows the weather mister cloudy he snickered at his own joke whereupon the aborigine turned upon him slowly and said in perfect english your humor is misplaced with me dont forget mr glass that the one yale football team you trained i dropped a goal on from the fortyfiveyard line glass allowed his mouth to open in amazement the day was replete with surprises he said while the light of understanding came over him youre cloudybutthesunshines yes carlisle cloudy threw back his head and pointed with dignity to the flag of his alma mater hanging upon the wall by jove i remember that exclaimed speed so will yale so long as she lives predicted the indian grimly you crippled me in the second half he stirred his withered leg but i dropped it on you and i have not forgotten he ground the last sentence between his teeth see here bo mr cloudy you dont blame us for that cloudy grunted and threw a yellow envelope on the floor at speeds feet there is something for you said he while his lips curled he turned and limped silently to the door and i tried to kid him breathed glass with disgust when the visitor had gone i aint been in right since garfield was shot its a telegram from covington cried speed tearing open the message at last thank the lord glass started forward eagerly whenll he be here quick then he paused j wallingford speed had gone deathly pale and was reeling slightly whats wrong the college man made uncertainly for his bed murmuring incoherently i im sick im sick larry he fell limply at full length and groaned call the race off glass snatched the missive from his employers nerveless fingers and read with bulging eyes as follows j wallingford speed flying heart ranch kidder new mexico dont tip off am in jail omaha looks like ten days culver covington the trainer uttered a cry like that of a wounded animal call it off larry moaned the hope of the flying heart ive been poisoned poisoned eh said the fat man tremulously poisoned nix not with me he walked firmly across the room flung back the lid of speeds athletic trunk and began to paw through it feverishly one after another he selected three heavy sweaters then laid strong hands upon his protege and jerked him to his feet sick eh here get into these what do you mean lawrence inquired his victim if you get sick i die glass opened the first sweater and halfsmothered his protege with it hurry up youre going into training chapter xi that was a terrible hour for j wallingford speed as for larry once he had grasped the full significance of the telegram he became a different person some fierce electric charge wrought a chemical alteration in his every fibre he became a domineering ironwilled autocrat obsessed by the one idea of his own preservation and not hesitating to use physical force when force became necessary to lessen his peril repeatedly speed folded his arms over his stomach rocked in the throes of anguish and wailed that he was perishing of cramps the trainer only snorted with derision when he refused to don the clothes selected for him glass fell upon him like a raging grizzly you wont eh well see then speed took refuge in anger but the other cried never mind the hysterics bo youre going to run off some blubber today but i have to go riding not a chance i tell you ill run when i come back maintained the youth almost tearfully beseeching theyre waiting for me let em gallop you can run alongside with all these sweaters id have a sunstroke its the best thing for you i never thought of that as glass forced his protege toward the house the other young people appeared clad for their excursion their horses were tethered to the porch and it was an ideal day for a ride warm bright and inviting over to the northward the hills mysteriously purple invited exploration to the south and east the golden prairie undulated gently into a hazy realm of infinite possibilities the animals themselves turned friendly eyes upon their riders champing and whinnying as if eager to bear them out into the distances we are ready called jean gayly what in the world helen paused at sight of the swathed figure are you cold mr speed climb on your horses and get a start panted the burly trainer hes goin to race you ten miles im going to do nothing of the sort im going to but glass jerked him violently crying and no talkin to gals neither youre trainin now get a move speed halted stubbornly hit her up wally gwan now faster no loafing bo or ill wallop you nor did he cease until they both paused from exhaustion even then he would not allow his charge to do more than regain his breath before urging him onward see here wally stormed at last whats the use i cant whats the use thats the use glass pointed to the north where a lone horseman was watching them from a knoll dyou know who that is the rider was small and stoopshouldered willie thats who hes following us with knees trembling beneath him speed jogged feebly on down the road glass puffing at his heels when after covering five miles they finally returned to the flying heart it was with difficulty that they could drag one foot after another wally speed was drenched with perspiration and glass resembled nothing so much as a steaming pudding rivulets of sweat ran down his neck his face was purple his lips swollen yyoull have to run alone this afternoon panted the tormentor this afternoon havent i run enough for one day the victim pleaded glass old man i im all in i tell you im ready to die got to fry off some more leaflard declared the trainer with vulgarity he lumbered into the cookhouse radiating heat waves puffing like a tractionengine while his companion staggered to the gymnasium and sank into a chair a moment later he appeared with two bottles of beer one glued to his lips both were evidently ice cold judging from the fog that covered them speed rose with a cry gee that looks good but the other thrusting him aside without removing the neck of the bottle from his lips gurgled no booze wally youre trainin but im thirsty shouted the athlete laying hands upon the full bottle and trying to wrench it free have a little sense if youre thirsty hit the sink glass still maintained his hold mumbling indistinctly waters the worst thing in the world wait ill get you some he stepped into the bunkroom to return an instant later with a cup half full rinse out your mouth and dont swallow it all all there isnt that much ugh its lukewarm i want a bucket of icewater icewater nothing doing i wont stand to have your epictetus chilled my what never mind now off with them clothes and get under that shower i guess itll feel pretty good today speed obeyed instructions sullenly while his trainer reclining in the coseycorner uncorked the second bottle from behind the blanket curtains where the barrel stood the former demanded what did you mean by saying id have to run again this afternoon starts said glass shortly starts fast work we been loafing so far you got to get some ginger rats whats the use no use at all you couldnt outrun a steamroller but if you wont duck out ive got to do my best id as lief die of a gunshotwound as starve to death in the desert do you suppose we could run away could we glass propped himself eagerly upon one elbow leave it to me no wally resumed rubbing himself down i cant leave without looking like a quitter fresno would get her sure whats the difference if youre astraddle of a cloud with a gold guitar in your lap oh they wont kill us i tell you these cowpersons is desprate if you stay here and run that race next saturday shell tiptoe up on sunday and put a rose in your hand sure i can see her now all in black take it from me wally we aint goin to have no luck in this thing my dear fellow the simplest way out of the difficulty is for me to injure myself here glass hopped to his feet and dove through the blankets none of that have a little regard for me if you go lame its my curtain all that day the trainer stayed close to his charge never allowing him out of his sight and when late in the afternoon speed rebelled at the espionage glass merely shrugged his fat shoulders but i want to be alone with her cant you see i can but i wont go as far as you like ill close my eyes or ill close them for you the lad scowled his companion laughed mirthlessly dont start nothin like that id ruin you gals is bad for a man in trainin anyhow i suppose im not to see her you can see her but i want to hear what you say to her no emotion till after this race wally youre an idiot this whole affair is preposterous ridiculous and yet it dont make us laugh does it glass mocked if these cowboys make me run that race theyll be sorry mark my words theyll be sorry speed lighted a cigarette and inhaled deeply but only once the other lunged at him with a cry and snatched it give me that cigarette ive had enough of this foolishness wally stormed you are discharged i wish i was you are not i say you are fired glass stared at him oh i mean it i wont be bullied very well glass rose ponderously ill wise up that queen of yours mr speed you arent going to talk to miss blake wait speed wilted miserably she mustnt know i i hire you over again suit yourself you see dont you my love for helen is the only serious thing i ever experienced said the boy i cant lose her youve got to help me out and so it was agreed that evening when the clock struck nine j wallingford speed was ready and willing to drag himself off to bed in spite of the knowledge that fresno was waiting to take his place in the hammock he was racked by a thousand pains his muscles were sore his back lame he was consumed by a thirst which glass stoutly refused to let him quench and possessed by a fearful longing for a smoke when he dozed off regardless of the snores from the bunkhouse adjoining berkeley fresnos musical tenor was sounding in his ears and helen blake was vaguely surprised for the first time in their acquaintance mr speed had yawned openly in her presence and she wondered if he were tiring of her it seemed to speed that he had barely closed his eyes when he felt a rough hand shaking him and heard his trainers voice calling in a halfwhisper come on cull get up when he turned over it was only to be shaken into complete wakefulness hurry up its daylight where come now you got to run five miles before breakfast speed sat up with a groan if i run five miles he said i wont want any breakfast and laid himself down again gratefully he was very sore whereat his companion fairly dragged him out of bed as yet the room was black although the windows were grayed by the first faint streaks of dawn from the adjoining room came a chorus of distress snores of every size volume and degree of intensity from the last harrowing gasp of strangulation to the bold trumpetings of a bull moose there were long drawn sighs groans of torture rumbling blasts speed shuddered they sound like a troop of trained sealions said he dont wake em up here glass yawned widely and tossed a bundle of sweaters at his companion ugh these clothes are all wet and cold and it feels like blood nothin but the mornin dew its perspiration well a little sweat wont hurt you nasty word speed yawned in turn perspiration i cant wear wet clothes and would have crept back into his bed this time glass deposited him upon a stool beside the table and then lighted a candle by the sickly glare of which he selected a pair of runningshoes why didnt you leave me alone grumbled the younger man the only pleasure i get is in sleep i forget things then yes retorted the former sarcastically and you also seem to forget that these are our last days among the living saturday the big thing comes off forget i dreamed about it the boy sighed heavily it was the hour in which hope reaches its lowest ebb and vitality is weakest he was very cold and very miserable you aint got no edge on me the other acknowledged mournfully im too young to die and thats a bet suddenly the pandemonium in the bunkhouse was pierced by the brazen jangle of an alarmclock whereat a sleepy voice cried cloudy kill that damn clock the indian uttered some indistinguishable epithet and the next instant there came a crash as the offending timepiece was hurled violently against the wall in silence glass shoved his unsteady victim ahead of him out into the dawn in the east the sun was rising amid a riotous splendor at any other time under any other conditions speed could not have restrained his admiration for the whole world was a glorious sparkling panoply of color the tumbled masses of the hills were blazing at their crests the valleys dark and cool in the east the limb of the sun was just rearing itself the air was heady with the scent of growing things and so clear that the distances were magically shortened a certain wild intoxicating exuberance surcharged the outofdoors but to the stiff and wearied eastern lad it was all cruelly mocking when he halted listlessly to view its beauties he was goaded forward ever forward faster and faster until finally amid protests and sighs and complaining joints he broke into a heavy flatfooted jogtrot that jolted the artistic sense entirely out of him chapter xii it was usually a procedure not alone of difficulty but of diplomacy as well to rout out the ranchhands of the flying heart without engendering hostile relations that might bear fruit during the day this morning still bill stover had more than his customary share of trouble for they seemed pessimistic carara for instance breathed a spanish oath as he combed his hair and when the foreman inquired the reason replied i don sleep good i been tink mebbe i lose my saddle on this footrace cloudy whose toilet was much less intricate grunted from the shadows i thought i heard that phonograph all night it was the natif son singin to his gal explained one of the hands hes gettin on my nerves too if he wasnt a friend of the boss id sure take a surcingle and abate him considerable vat you tank i dream mr speed is ron avay an broke his leg volunteered murphy the swede whose name new mexico had shortened from bjorth kjelliser run away yaas i dream hes out for little ron ven piece of noosepaper blow up in his face an mak him ron avay yust same as horse he snort an yump an ron till he step in prairiedog hole and broke his leg strange said willie what my rest was fitful and disturbed and peopled by strange fancies a whole lot i dreamp he throwed the race a chorus of oaths from the bunks what did you do inquired stover i woke up all of a tremble with a gun in each hand i dont take no stock in dreams whatever said some one well im the last person in the world to be superstitious still bill observed but ive had simlar visions lately maybe its a omen what is a omen carara inquired a omen explained willie is a kind of a nut salted omens is served at swell restaurants with the soup in the midst of it joy the cook appeared in the doorway and spoke in his gentle ingratiating tones morning gelmum i see im again who no savvy who stlange man i go down to splinghouse for bucket water see im lide way velly stlange i bet its gallagher vat you tank he vants queried murphy hes layin to get a shot at our runner declared stover while mr cloudy forgetting his indian reserve explained in classic english his own theory of the nocturnal visits do you remember humpy joe well they didnt cripple him but he lost i dont think gallagher would injure mr speed but he might bribe him caramba exclaimed the mexican god lmighty willie cried in shocked accents i believe youre right but stover meditated briefly before announcing with determination well do a little nightridin ourselves willie you watch this young feller daytimes and the rest of usll take turns at night an dont lose sight of the fat man neither he might carry notes if you dont like the looks of things you know what cards to draw sixes murmured the nearsighted cowman dont worry if you see anything suspicious burn it up and well take a shot at anything we see movin after pm then berkeley fresno came hurriedly into the bunkhouse with a very cheery goodmorning im glad i found you up and doing he said blithely i thought of something in my sleep it was evident that the speaker had been in more than ordinary haste to make his discovery known for underneath his coat he still wore his pajama shirt and his hair was unbrushed what is it your man speed isnt taking care of himself what did i tell you said willie to his companions it seems to me that in justice to you boys he shouldnt act this way fresno ran on now for instance the water in his showerbath is tepid there was an instants silence before stover inquired with ominous restraint whos been monkeying with it its warm oh it was a sigh of relief a man cant get in shape taking warm showerbaths warm water weakens a person mebbe youall will listen to me next time again cried willie triumphantly i said at the start that a bath never helped nobody when theyre hot they saps a mans courage and when theyre cold they no no you dont understand for an athlete the bath ought to be cold the colder the better its the shock that hardens a fellow has he weakened himself much inquired the foreman undoubtedly but what if we only had some ice we got ice plenty of it we got a load from the railroad yesterday then our only chance to save him is to fill the barrel quickly we must freeze him and freeze him well before it is too late by jove im glad i thought of it stover turned to his men four of youall hustle up a couple hundred pounds of that ice pronto crack it an fill the barl there was a scramble for the door and theres something else too went on berkeley hes being fed wrong for his last days of training the idea of a man eating lambchops fried eggs oatmeal and all that debilitating stuff those girls overload his stomach why he ought to have something to make him strong fierce name it said willie shortly something like like bear meat we aint got no bear willie looked chagrined this aint their habitat added stover apologetically well he ought to have meat and it ought to be wild raw if possible there aint nothin wilder n a longhorn we can git him a steer you are sure the meat isnt too tender its tougher n a night in jail there aint no sausagemill thatll dent it good the rarer it is the better some raw eggs and a good strong vegetable onions fine well save him yet well get the grub and hell eat it willie nodded firmly stover issued another order this time to carara you n cloudy butcher the wildest fouryearold you can find if you cant get close enough to rope him shoot him and bring in a hind quarter its got to be here in time for breakfast si senor the mexican picked up his lariat the indian took a winchester from an upper bunk and filled it with cartridges of course hell have to eat out here they spoil him up at the house sure thing id hate to see him lose it would be a terrible blow to miss blake fresno shook his head doubtfully what about us oh you can stand it but shes a girl ah well the speaker sighed i hope nothing occurs between now and saturday to prevent his running it wont stover grimly assured the californian nothin whatever is goin to occur he was speaking yesterday about the possibility of some business engagement the small man in glasses interrupted nothin but death shall take him from us mr fresno if i think of anything else offered berkeley kindly ill tell you we wish you would fresno returned to the house humming cheerily it was still an hour until his breakfasttime but he had accomplished much in the midst of his meditation he came upon miss blake emerging upon the rear porch goodmorning he cried she started a trifle guiltily what are you doing at this hour oh i just love the morning air she answered and you same here honesty goes to bed early and industry rises betimes thats me then you have been working fresno nodded he was looking at four cowboys who were entering the gymnasium staggering beneath dripping gunnysacks then he turned his gaze searchingly upon the girl were you looking for speed he asked accusingly the idea miss blake flushed faintly if you are he has gone for a run i dearly love to see him get up early and run he enjoys it so to give pleasure to others is one of my constant aims that is why i learned to sing i have been baking a cake said helen displaying the traces of her occupation upon hands arms and apron while fresno at sight of the blue apron tied at her throat and waist felt that he himself was as dough in her hands i had a dreadful time to make it rise early rising is always unpopular how clever you are this morning if i were a cake i would rise at your lightest word the cook said it wouldnt be fit to eat declared helen jealousy she hadnt been up long and i did leave a lot of dishes to wash after i had finished miss blake admitted i should love to eat your cooking once in a while perhaps but not every day every day always and always you know what imean miss blake helen the young man bent a lovers gaze upon his companion until he detected her eyes fastened with startled inquiry upon his toilet remembering he buttoned his coat but ran on this is the first chance ive had to see you alone since speed arrived theres something i want to ask you i i know what it is stammered helen you want me to let you sing again please do i love morning music and your voice is so tender life said berkeley is one sweet what is going on here demanded a voice behind them and mrs keap came out upon the porch eying the pair suspiciously it was evident that she like fresno had dressed hurriedly mr fresno is going to sing to us explained the younger girl quickly really i am like the bird that greets the morn with song laughed the tenor awkwardly what are you going to sing demanded the chaperon still suspiciously dearie dont you know any other song oh yes but they are all sad im getting a trifle tired of dearie lets have one of the others mrs keap turned her eyes anxiously toward the trainingquarters and it was patent that she had not counted upon this encounter noting her lack of ease fresno said hopefully if you are going for a walk ill sing for you at some other time is mr speed up yet up and gone hell be back soon then mrs keap sank into the hammock and with something like resignation said proceed with the song along the road toward the ranch buildings plodded two dusty pedestrians one a blond youth bundled thickly in sweaters the other a fat man who rolled heavily and paused now and then to mop his purple face both were dripping as if from an immersion while the air about the latter vibrated with heat waves they both stumbled as they walked and it was only by the strongest effort of will that they propelled themselves as they neared the corner of the big lowlying ranchhouse already reflecting the hot glare of the morning sun a mans clear tenor voice came to them the volley was fired at sunrise just at the break of day did you get that one of the two exclaimed hoarsely theyre practising a deathmarch and its ours and as the echoes lingered his soul had passed away thats you wally wheezed the trainer into the arms of his maker there to learn his fate speed broke into a run a tear a sigh a last goodbyethe pardon came too late here what are you singing about angrily protested speed as he rounded into view oh its mr speed goodmorning chorused helen and the chaperon welcome to our city fresno greeted glass tottered to the steps them songs he puffed is bad for a man when hes trainin they get him all worked up we had no idea you would be back so soon apologized helen soon speed measured the distance to a wicker chair gave it up and sank beside his trainer we left yesterday weve run miles and miles and miles you cant be in very good shape volunteered the singer oh is that so glass retorted i say hes great he got my goat and im some runner and id be obliged to you if youd cut out those deeply appealing songs speed glowered at his rival it was helen who hastened to smooth things its all my fault i asked mr fresno to sing something new bah that was written by william cromwell no more of them battlehymns glass ordered they dont do mr speed no good all i want is a drink panted that youthful athlete and helen rose quickly saying that she would bring icewater but the trainer barked sharply nix ive told you that twenty times wally itll put hobnails in your liver he rose with difficulty swaying upon his feet and where he had sat was a large irregular shaped sweatdampened area come on dont get chilled id give twenty dollars for a good chill exclaimed the overheated college man longingly i would like to see you a moment mr speed roberta rose from the hammock oh and ive forgotten my helen checked her words with a startled glance toward the kitchen it will be burned to a crisp she hastened down the porch and fresno followed while speed looked after them he must be an awful nuisance to a nice girl think of a fat sandyhaired husband in a fiveroom flat with pink wallpaper and a colored janitor run along muldoon to glass ill be with you in a moment when the trainer had waddled out of hearing mrs keap inquired eagerly have you heard from culver didnt you know about it speed swallowed roberta shook her dark head hes in hes detained at omaha for ten days i fixed it the overwrought widow dropped back into the hammock crying weakly oh you dear good boy yes im all of that i i suppose id be missed if anything happened to me how ever did you manage it never mind the details it took some ingenuity mrs keap wrung her hands i was so terribly frightened you see jack will be back tomorrow and i was afraid there was a call from glass from the trainingquarters how can i ever do enough for you you have averted a tragedy dont let helen know thats all if she thought id been the head yeller i wont breathe a word and i hope you win the race for her sake mrs keap pressed the hand of her deliverer who trudged his lonely way toward the gymnasium where glass was saying the volley was fired at sunrise that means saturday bo larry youre the best crepehanger of your weight in the world larry bent a look of open disgust upon his employer and youre a good runner you are said he why i beat you this morning the younger man glanced up hopefully couldnt you beat this cook youre the only man in this world i can outrun a tear a sigh a last goodbye shut up as glass consented to do this the speaker mused bitterly early to bed and early to rise i wish i had the nightwatchman who wrote those words didnt you never see the sun rise before certainly not i dont stay up that late well aint it beautiful the stout man turned admiring eyes to the eastward and his husky voice softened all them colors and tints and shades and stuff and new york on the other end im too tired to see beauty in anything as if mindful of a neglected duty glass turned upon him what are you waiting for get those dogbeds off your back he seized the slack of a sweater and gave it a jerk dont be so rough ill come you might care to remember youre working for me i am working glass dragged his protege about the room regardless of complaints that were muffled by the thickness of the sweaters for my life and ill be out of a job saturday now get under that shower chapter xiii do you know larry im beginning to like these warm showers they rest me as he spoke wally took his place beneath the barrel and pulled the cord that connected with the nozzle the next instant he uttered a piercing shriek and leaped from beneath the apparatus upsetting glass who rose in time to fling his charge back into the deluge let me out yelled the athlete and made another dash at which his guardian bellowed stand still or ill wallop you whats got into you anyhow the heads of stover and willie thrust through the door nodded with gratification its got him livened up considerable quoth the former listen to that it seemed that a battle must be in progress behind the screen for mingled with the gasping screams of the athlete and the hoarse commands of the trainer came sounds of physical contact the barrel rocked upon its scaffold the curtains swayed and flapped violently stand still its its as cccold as ice nix youre overheated thats all owww ooohh im dying itll do you good hes certainly trainin him some said stover larry ive got a cramp it did harden him acknowledged willie whats wrong with you anyhow demanded glass its not me its the wwwater evidently speed made a frantic lunge here and escaped for the flow of water ceased it froze ddduring the night ohh im cold cold eh get onto that rubbingboard ill warm you an instant later the cowmen heard the sounds of a violent slapping mingled with groans go easy i say ill be black and blue all look out not so much in one spot ow turn over hes spankin him said stover admiringly again the spatting arose this time like the sound of a musketry fusilade during which berkeley fresno entered by the other door dont be so brutal wailed the patient to his masseur im pretty near through there now get up and dress ordered the trainer who pushing his way out through the blankets halted at sight of the onlookers how is he demanded stover he hes trained to the minute im doin my share gents sounds that way acknowledged stovers companion say does it look like wed win well he just breezed a mile in forty with his mouth open a mile fresno queried yes a regular mile seven thousand five hundred and thirty feet is forty good queried willie good why salvator never worked no faster here he is now look for yourselves speed appeared partly clad and glowing with a rich salmon pink goodmorning said fresno politely i came in to see how you liked the cold water so that was one of your california jokes eh well ill speed moved ominously in the direction of the tenor but willie checked him we put the ice in that barl mr speed you willie and stover nodded then let me tell you i expect to have pneumonia from that bath the young man coughed hollowly thats the way i caught it once before and it wouldnt surprise me a bit if id be too sick to run by saturday oh no you dont get pneumony but once and besides fresno added it wouldnt have time to show up by saturday get that icechest out of my room thats all it makes the air damp no indeed said still bill were goin to see that you use it reglar then of glass he inquired what do you do to him next i give him a nerve treatment a jackrabbit jumped at him this morning and he bolted to the outside fence larry forced his employer to a seat then securing a firm hold of the flesh began to discourse learnedly upon anatomy and hygiene the while his victim writhed it was evident that the cattlemen were intensely interested well sir when i first got him his sploven was in terrible shape said larry in fact i never saw such a what was in terrible shape ventured the tenor his sploven sploven is that a locality or a beverage glass glowered at the cause of the interruption its a nervecentre of course then to the others he ran on glibly the treatment was simple but it took time you see i had to first trace his bedildo to its source like this he thrust a finger into wallys back and ploughed a furrow upward you see he paused triumphantly a foreshortened bedildo it aint well yet can a man run fast with one of them inquired willie certainly certainly provided of course that the percentage of spelldiffer in the blood offsets it both cowboys came closer now and hung eagerly upon every word and does it do that they questioned while fresno suggested that it was not easy to tell without bleeding the patient no no you can hear the spelldiffers glass motioned to willie put your ear to his chest hear anything hearts poundin like a calfs at a brandin which proves it proudly asserted the trainer barrin accidents mr speed will be in the pink of condition by saturday the cowmen beamed benignantly thats fine we are sure pleased and weve got something for you mr speed come on mr fresno and give us a hand well bring it in its a present exclaimed the athlete brightly when the three had gone out they seem more friendly this morning yes glass laughed mirthlessly they think youre going to win well how do you know i cant win you never saw this cook run i dont have to ive seen you just the same im in pretty good shape maybe i could run if i really tried send yourself along kid it wont harm you none the speaker fanned himself and took a seat in the coseycorner ah here they come bearing gifts speed rose in pleased expectancy i wonder what it can be the three who had just left reentered the room carrying a trayload of thick railroad crockery weve brought your breakfast to you explained stover wed like you to eat alone till after the race still bill began to whittle what appeared to be a bloodrare piece of flesh while willie awkwardly arranged the dishes you want me to eat as well as sleep here exactly oh i cant do that im sorry but dont make us insist willie looked up from his tray and glass raised a moist hand and said dont make em insist with fascinated stare speed drew nearer to stover and examined the meat bone why why thats raw he exclaimed does look rar agreed the foreman then take it out and build a fire under it ill consent to eat here but i wont turn cannibal even to please you im sorry stover did not interrupt his carving your diet aint been right explained willie you aint wild enough to suit us speed searched one serious face then another fresno was nodding approval his countenance impassive is this a joke we aint never joked with you yit have we no but this breakfast goes as she lays glass broke abruptly into smothered merriment when i laugh nowadays its a funny joke he giggled that grown men could be so stupid was unbelievable and wally seeing himself the object of a senseless prank was roused to anger lawrence get my coat said he ive been bullied enough im going up to the house when stover only continued whittling methodically he burst out stop honing that shinbone if you like it you can eat it im going now to swallow a stack of hot cakes with maple syrup mr speed willie impaled him with a steady glare youll eat what we tell you to and nothin else if we say grass grass itll be youre goin to beat one skinner if it takes a human life and if that life happens to be yours you got nobody but yourself to blame indeed you heard me ive been set to ride herd on you daytimes the other boysll guard you nights we been doublecrossed once it wont happen again then it amounts to this does it im your prisoner more of a prized possession offered stover if you aint got the loylty to stand by us we got to make you this diet is part of the programme now if you think beef is too hearty for this time of day tear into them eggs you intend to make me eat this disgusting stuff whether i want to or not even yet the youth could not convince himself that this was other than a joke no willie shook his head we just aim to make you want to eat it then larry glass made his fatal mistake say why dont you let mr speed buy you a new phonograph and call the race off he inquired stover stricken dumb paused knife in hand willie stared as if bereft of motion then the former spoke slowly looks like wed ought to smoke up this fat party will willie nodded and glass realized that the little mans steelblue eyes were riveted balefully upon him ive had a hunch it would come to that the nearsighted one replied every time i look at him i see a bleedin bullethole in his abominable regions about here he laid a finger upon his stomach and glass felt a darting pain at precisely the same spot it was as agonizing as if willies spectacles were huge burningglasses focussing the rays of a tropic sun upon his bare flesh he folded protecting hands over the threatened region and backed toward the prayerrug mumbling allah allah no matter whither he shifted the eyes bored into him thats where you hit the gambler at ogden he heard stover say it might have been from a great distance but i aim for the bridge of the nose the belly aint so sudden as the eyesocket but its more lingerin and a heap painfuller explained the gun man and speed was moved to sympathy larry only wanted to please you eh larry he said nervously but glass made no reply his distended orbs were frozen upon willie it was doubtful if he even heard our honor aint for sale still bill declared here berkeley fresno spoke of course not and you mustnt think that speed is trying to get out of the race he wants to run and if anything happened to prevent his running hed be brokenhearted i know he would willies hypnotic eye left the trainers abdomen and travelled slowly to speed what could happen questioned he nnothing that i know of you dont aim to leave certainly not oh you fellows take it too seriously fresno offered carelessly he might have to willies upper lip drew back showing his yellow teeth they dont sell no railroad tickets before saturday and the walkin is bad theres your breakfast mr speed when youve et your fill you better rest and dont talk to them ladies neither it spoils your train of thought chapter xiv now that the possibility of escape from the flying heart was cut off the young man felt agonizing regret that he had not yielded to his trainers earlier importunities and taken refuge in flight while there was yet time it would have been undignified perhaps but once away from these singleminded cattlemen his life would have been safe at least and he could have trusted his ingenuity to reinstate him in miss blakes good graces everything was too late now even if he made a clean breast of the whole affair to jean or to her brother when he arrived what good would that do he doubted jacks ability to save him in the light of what had just passed for men like willie cared nothing for the orders of the person whose payroll they chanced to grace and willie was not alone either the rest of the crew were equally desperate what heed would these nomads pay to jack chapins commands once they learned the truth they were arabs who owed allegiance to no one but themselves the country was wild the law was feeble it was twenty miles to the railroad and besides the thought of confession was abhorrent physical injury no matter how severe was infinitely preferable to helen blakes disdain he cast about desperately for some saving loophole but found himself trapped completely hopelessly trapped there were still however two days of grace and to youth two days is an eternity therefore he closed his eyes and trusted to the unexpected how the unexpected could get past that grim watchful sentry just outside the door he could not imagine but when the breakfastbell reminded him of his hunger he banished his fears for the sake of the edibles his custodians had served dont you want anything to eat he inquired when larry made no move to depart for the cookhouse no not hungry eh im hungry enough to eat a plush cushion but what mary mariedetta sure shes been chasin me again if somebody dont sidetrack that cuban ill have to lick carara he sighed i told you wed ought to tincan it out of here now its too late willie thrust his head in through the open window inquiring well hows the breakfast goin and withdrew humming a favorite song sam bass was born in indiany it was his natif home at the early age of seventeen young sam commenced to roam fine voice said lawrence with a shudder it was perhaps a halfhour later that helen blake came tripping into the gymnasium radiant sparkling her crisp white dress touched here and there with blue that matched her eyes in her hands a sunshade a novel and a mysterious little bundle we were so sorry to lose you at breakfast she began wally led her to the coseycorner and seated himself beside her i suppose it is a part of this horrid training i would never have mentioned that footrace if i had dreamed it would be like this here at least was a soul that sympathized the only hardship is not to see you he declared softly miss blake dropped her eyes i thought you might like to go walking its a gorgeous morning you see ive brought a book to read to you while you rest you must be tired after your run i am and i will this is awfully good of you miss blake speed rose overwhelmed with joy but the look of glass was not to be passed by iim afraid its impossible however the blue eyes flew open in astonishment why the girl questioned they wont let me i im supposed to keep to myself they who glass miss blake turned indignantly upon larry do you mean to say mr speed cant go walking with me i never said nothing of the sort declared the trainer he can go if he wants to just the same i oughtnt to do it there is a strict routine a lift of the brows and a courteous smile proclaimed miss blakes perfect indifference to the subject just as willie sauntered past the open window and spoke to glass beneath his breath git her out im so sorry may i show you a surprise i brought for you she unwrapped her parcel and proudly displayed a pallid anaemic cake garlanded with wild flowers speed was honestly overcome for me for you it isnt even cold yet see i made it before breakfast and it looks even better than the one i baked at school thats what i call fine declared the youth by jove and im so fond of cake have a care breathed larry rising nervously but speed paid no attention break it with your own hands please besides its too hot to cut miss blake broke it with her own hands during which operation the brown face of the man outside reappeared in the window at sight of the cake he spoke sharply and lawrence lumbered swiftly across the floor and laid a heavy hand upon the cake mr speed he cried warningly here take your foot off my angelfood fiercely ordered the youth but the other was like adamant bo you are about to contest for the honor of this ranch that cake will make a bum of you oh h gasped the author of the delicacy stop before it is too late glass held his hungry employer at a distance striving to make known by a wink the necessity of his act there is absolutely nothing in my cake to injure any one helen objected loyally with lifted chin whereupon the corpulent trainer turned to her and said cake would crab any athlete cake and gals is the limit really i had no idea i was the least bit dangerous miss blake turning to her host smiled frigidly im so sorry i intruded now dont say that speed strove to detain her please dont be offended i just have to train of course and will you pardon me for interrupting your routine you see i had no idea i wasnt wanted but you are and i do want you i goodbye she nodded pleasantly at the door and left her lover staring after her when she had gone he cried in a trembling voice youre a fine yap you are she got up early to do something nice for me and you insulted her you wouldnt even let me sit and hold her hand no palmreadin speed turned to behold his trainer ravenously devouring the cake and dashed to its rescue its heavier than a frog full of buckshot you wont like it cul its perfectly delicious came the choking answer then get back of them curtains willied shoot on sight all that morning the prisoner idled about the premises followed at a distance by his guard wherever he went he seemed to see the sun flash defiance from the polished surface of those lenses and while he was allowed a certain liberty he knew full well that this espionage would never cease night or day until what he could not bear to read the future anything seemed possible time and again he cursed that spirit of braggadocio that thoughtless lack of moral scruple which had led him into this predicament he vowed that he was done with false pretences henceforth the strictest probity should be his no more false poses praise won by dissimulation and deceit was empty anyhow and did he escape this once henceforth the world should know j wallingford speed for what he was an average individual with no uncommon gifts of mind or body courage or ability yet it was small comfort to realize that he was getting his just deserts and it likewise availed little to anathematize fresno as the cause of his misfortune at noon wally went through the mockery of a second bloodrare meal with no cake to follow and that afternoon glass dragged him out under the hot sun and made him sprint until he was ready to drop from exhaustion his supper was wretched and his fatigue so great that he fell asleep at miss blakes side during the evening with the first hint of dawn he was up again and friday noon found him utterly hopeless when true to his prediction the unexpected happened in one moment he was raised from the blackest depths to the wildest transports of delight it came in the shape of a telegram which jean summoned him to the house to receive he wondered listlessly as he opened the message then started as if disbelieving his eyes the marks of a wild emotion spread over his features he burst into shrill hysterical laughter do tell us begged roberta covington covington is coming wally felt his head whirl and failed to note the chaperons cry of surprise and see the paling of her cheeks covington is coming dont you understand he shouted after all the gods were not deaf good old culver who had never failed him was coming as a deliverer even in the face of his extraordinary outburst the attention of the beholders was drawn to lawrence glass who caused the porch to shake beneath his feet who galloped to his employer and seizing him by the hands capered about like a hippopotamus i told you allah was some guy he wheezed when does covington arrive wally reread the message it says noon friday why thats today hes here now rah rah rah covington bellowed the trainer and mrs keap sank to a seat with a stifled moan why all the oh joy oh rapture stuff questioned berkeley fresno as socrates the hemlock kid would put it snatched from the shadow of the grave quoth glass then paused abruptly say you dont think nothin could happen to him on the way over from the depot im so sorry we didnt know in time to meet him lamented miss chapin and i could have run over to the railroad to bid him welcome laughed speed twenty miles would do me good still bill and willie approached the gallery curiously and in subdued tones inquired whats the matter mr speed you aint been summoned away willie stared questioningly upward no no my running partner is on his way here thats all running pardner culver covington oh we was afraid something had happened you see gabby gallagher has just blowed in from the centipede to raise our bets we think its a bluff and wed like to call him do so by all means cried the excited athlete come on lets all talk to him the entire party with the exception of mrs keap trooped down from the porch and followed the foreman out toward the sheds where in the midst of a crowd of ranchhands a burly loudvoiced texan was discoursing i do wish jack were here said jean nervously on the way gabby gallagher seemed a fitting leader for such a desperate crew as that of the centipede for he was the hardestlooking citizen the easterners had beheld thus far he was thickset and burned to the color of a ripe olive his long drooping mustaches tobaccostained at the centre were bleached at the extremities to a hempen hue his bristly hair was cut short and stood aggressively erect upon a bullet head his clothes were soiled and greasy beneath a gray coating of dust a pair of alert leadblue eyes and a certain facility of movement belied the drawl that marked his nativity he removed his hat and bowed at sight of miss chapin goodevenin miss jean said he i hope i find yall well quite well gallagher and you tolable thank you these are my friends from the east the centipede foreman ran his eyes coldly over jeans companions until they rested upon speed where they remained he shifted a lump in his cheek spat dexterously and directed his remark at the yale man i rode over to see if yall would like to lay a little mo on this yere footrace i allow you are the unknown speed nodded and stover took occasion to remark thems our inclinations but weve about gone our limit i dont blame you none said gallagher allowing his gaze to rove slowly from top to toe of the eastern lad no i caint blame you none whatever but im terrible grieved at them tidins though we centipede punchers has ever considered yall a cheap an povertyridden outfit we gives you credit for bein game till now he spat for a second time and regarded stover scornfully a murmur ran through the cowboys we are game retorted stover and for your own good dont allow no belief to the contrary to become a superstition of a sudden the gangling spineless foreman had grown taut and forceful his long face was hard dont let a centipede bluff you exclaimed speed cover anything they offer give em odds anything you dont want ill take pay or play money at the tape we cant lose i got no more money said carara removing his handsome bespangled hat but i bet my sombrero es wort two hondred pesos murphy the swede followed quickly aye ban send may vages home to may ole moder but aye skall bat you some havent you boys risked enough already ventured miss chapin remember it will go pretty hard with the losers harder the better came a voice yall dont have to bet jest because im hyar gibed gallagher god i wish i was rich exclaimed willie but miss chapin persisted you are two months overdrawn all of you my brother wont advance you any more then my man lawrence will take what they cant cover offered speed thats right clean em good brothers croaked the trainer if youll step over to the bunkhouse gabby well dig up some personal perquisites and family heirlooms stover nodded toward his mens quarters and gallagher grinned joyously that shore listens like a band from where i set we aim to annex the wages hopes and personal ambitions of yall along with your talkinmachine excuse me willie pushed his way forward hows she gettin along fine you muleskinners aint broke her no we plays her every evenin the little man shifted his feet then allowed himself to inquire as if regarding the habits of some dear departed friend have you chose any favorite records we all has our picks speakin personal im stuck on that baggage coach song of mrs mores moray willie corrected mora heleney moray is the ladys name mebbe so our footrunner likes that injun wardance best of all carara smiled at cloudy who nodded as if pleased by the compliment then it was that the flying heart spokesman made an inquiry in hushed hesitating tones how do you like the holy city he removed his hat as did those back of him as sung by madamosella melby rotten gallagher said promptly thats a bum for fair during one breathless instant the wizened man stood as if disbelieving his ears the enormity of the insult robbing him of speech and motion then he uttered a snarl and stover was barely in time to intercept the backward fling of his groping hand no voylence willie theres ladies present stovers captive ground his teeth and struggled briefly then turned and made for the open prairie without a word its his first love said stover simply the other foreman exploded into hoarse laughter saying i didnt reckon i was treadin on the toes of no bereafed relatifs but them church tunes aint my style however were wastin time gents wheres that bunkhouse nothin but money talks loud enough for me to hear goodday white folks gallagher saluted miss chapin and her friends with a flourish and moved away in company with the cowboys i never said glass seen so many tough guys outside of a streetcar strike gallagher has been in prison jean informed him hes a wonderful shot i knew it speed spoke up brightly well lets go back to the house and wait for covington but you were getting ready to go running said helen no more running for me im in good enough shape eh larry great barring the one thing whats that queried fresno a little trouble with one of his nervecentres thats all but even if it got worse during the night covington could run the race for him the californian started at last all was plain he had doubted from the first now he was certain but with understanding came also a menace to his own careful plans if covington ran in speeds place how could he effect his rivals exposure on the way back to the house he had to think rapidly mrs keap was pacing the porch as the others came up and called speed aside then when they were alone broke out with blazing eyes you said you had stopped him and i thought i had i did my best but hes coming hell be here any minute i suppose he learned you were here wally laughed then you must have told him no i didnt mr speed robertas cheeks were pallid and her voice trembled you didnt send that telegram at all oh but i did you wanted him to get here in time to run in your place i see it all now you arranged it very cleverly but you will pay the penalty you surely wont tell helen this minute you wretched deceitful man before he could say more from the front of the house came the rattle of wheels a loud whoa then jeans voice crying culver culver while mrs keap clutched at her bosom and moaned her companion bolted into the house and down the hall shouting the name of his roommate out through the front door he dashed headlong in time to behold fresno and the two girls assisting the new arrival toward the veranda they were exclaiming in pity and had their arms about the athlete for culver covington intercollegiate onehundredyard champion was hobbling forward upon a pair of crutches the yell died in speeds throat he felt himself grow deadly faint crippled he gasped and leaned against the door for support chapter xv in a daze speed saw his friend mount the porch painfully in a daze he shook his hand subconsciously he beheld lawrence glass come panting into view throw up his hands at sight of covington and cry out in a strange tongue when he regained his faculties he broke into the conversation harshly what have you done to yourself i broke a toe explained the athlete you broke a toe he broke a toe wailed glass faintly if its nothing but a toe it wont hurt your running speed seized eagerly upon the faintest hope no ill be all right in a few weeks covington spoke carelessly his eyes bent upon jean chapin youve ggot to run tomorrow what covington dragged his glance away from the cheeks of his sweetheart i im sick youll have to dont be an idiot wally i cant walk helen explained with the pride of one displaying her own handiwork mr speed defends the flying heart tomorrow you are just in time to see him when did you learn to box wally covington was genuinely amazed im not going to box its a footrace im training been training ever since i arrived in his first bewilderment the latecomer might have unwittingly betrayed his friend had not jean suddenly inquired where is roberta roberta covington tripped over one of his crutches roberta who why roberta keap of course shes chaperoning us while mother is away the hero of countless fielddays turned pale and seemed upon the point of hobbling back to nigger mikes buckboard you and she are old friends i believe helen interposed yes oh yes culver flashed his chum a look of dumb entreaty but speed was staring roundeyed into space striving to read the future helen started to fetch her just as the pallid chaperon was entering the door she shook hands with covington she observed that he was too deeply affected at sight of her to speak and it awakened fresh misgivings in her mind hhow dy do i didnt know you were here he stammered i thought it would surprise you roberta smiled wanly amazed at her own selfcontrol then froze in her tracks as jean announced jack will be home tonight culver hell be delighted to see you j wallingford speed offered a diversion by bursting into a hollow laugh now that the world was in league to work his own downfall it was time someone else had a touch of suffering to this end he inquired how the toe had come to be broken i broke it in omaha automobile accident culver was fighting to master himself omaha did you stop in omaha inquired jean a city of beautiful women speed reflected audibly somebody step on your foot at a dance no of course not i dont know anybody in omaha i went motoring joyride not at all who was with you miss chapins voice was ominously sweet n nobody i knew does that mean that you were alone yes i stopped off between trains to view the city and took a seeing omaha ride the yap wagon upset and i broke my toe you left chicago ten days ago said speed accusingly of course but when i broke my toe i had to stay its a beautiful city lots of fine buildings how did you like the jail what in the world are you boys talking about queried miss blake mr speed seems amused at culvers accident roberta gave him a stinging look now wed better let culver go to his room and freshen up a bit i want to talk to you helen and speed drooped at the meaning behind her words but it was time for a general conference events were shaping themselves too rapidly for him to cope with once the three were alone he lost no time in making his predicament known the while his friend listened in amazement but is it really so serious the latter asked finally its life or death theres a homocidal maniac named willie guarding me daytimes and a pair of renegades who keep watch at my window all night the cowboys bathe me in icewater to toughen me and feed me raw meat to make me wild in every corner there lurks an assassin with orders to shoot me if i break training every where i go some lowbrowed criminal feels my biceps pinches my legs and asks how my wind is i tell you im going mad and the worst part of it is spoke glass sympathetically theyll bump me off first its a pipe but wally you cant run dont i know it dont i seconded the trainer then why attempt the impossible call the race off its too late dont you understand the bets are made and its pay or play the cowboys have mortgaged their souls on me he was makin a play for that little doll dont you call miss blake a doll larry i wont stand for it well skirt then why dont you cut it theres a train east at midnight and leave helen like that her faith in me has weakened already shed hate me if i did that no ive got to face it out theyll be singin hymns for both of us predicted the fat man i dont care they can boil me in oil i wont let her think im a coward larry doesnt have to stay of course not he can escape not a chance said the trainer they watch me closer n they do him covington considered for a moment it certainly looks bad but perhaps the other fellow cant run either who is he a cook named skinner happy name well twothirds of a sprint is in the start how does wally get in motion lawrence like a sacred ox glass could not conceal his contempt ill give him some pointers it will all help but speed was nervous and awkward so awkward in fact that the coach finally gave it up as a bad job saying its no use wally youve got fool feet i have eh well i didnt break them getting out of jail the less said about that jail the better im in trouble myself speed might have explained that his chums dilemma was by no means so serious as he imagined had not watchman willie thrust his head through the open window at that moment with the remark time to get busy well be right with you glass seized his protege by the arm and bore him away muttering stick it out brother were nearin the end again speed donned his runningsuit and took to the road for his farewell practise again willie followed at a distance on horseback watching the hills warily but all hope had fled from the yale man now and he returned to his trainingquarters disheartened resigned he was not resigned however to the visit he received later from miss helen blake that young lady rushed in upon him like a miniature cyclone sweeping him off his feet by the fury of her denunciation allowing him no opportunity to speak until with a halfsob she demanded why why did you deceive me i love you wally said as if no further explanation were necessary that explains nothing you made sport of me you couldnt love me and do that helen i thought you were so fine so strong but you lied yes that is what you did you fibbed to me the first day i met you and youve been fibbing ever since i could never never care for a man who would do that who has told you these things roberta for one she opened my eyes to your baseness well roberta has a grudge against my sex shes engaged to all the men she hasnt already married marriage is a habit with her it has made her suspicious but you did deceive me didnt you will you marry me asked j wallingford speed the idea miss blake gasped will you please dont speak that way when a man cares for a woman he doesnt deceive her he tells her everything you told me you were a great runner and i believed you ill never believe you again of course i shall behave to you in a perfectly friendly manner but underneath the surface i shall be consumed with indignation miss blake commenced to be consumed see you dont acknowledge your perfidy even now whats the use if i said i couldnt run and then beat the cook youd believe i deceived you again and suppose that i cant beat him then i shall know they have told me the truth and if on the other hand i should win miss blakes eyes fell helen would you marry me speed started toward her but she had fled out into the twilight dusk was settling over stretches of purple land and already the room was peopled by shadows work was over there were sounds of cheerful preparations for supper from the house came faint chords of laughter a spanish song floated in as carara told his love to the tune of mariedettas guitar adios adios adios por siempre adios coqueta mi amor adios adios adios por siempre adios coqueta mi amor it was the hush that precedes the evening as it does the dawn the hour of reverie in which all music is sweet and forgotten faces arise to haunt speed stood where the girl had left him miserable hopeless helpless the words of the spanish song seemed sung for a lost love of his and certainly his love was lost he had stayed on in the stubborn superstitious belief that something would surely happen to relieve him from his predicament fortune had never failed him before and instead every day every incident had served to involve him deeper now she knew it was her golden heart that had held her true thus far but could any devotion survive the sight of humiliation such as he would suffer on the morrow already he heard the triumphant jeers of the centipede henchmen the angry clamor of the flying heart the mocking laughter of his rival he groaned aloud forsooth a broken toe of all the countless tens of thousands of toes in christendom the one he had hung his salvation upon had proven weaker than a reed what cruel jest of fate was this if fate had wished to break a toe why had she not selected out of all the billions at her disposal that of some other athlete than culver covington even his own j wallingford speed started suddenly and paled he had remembered that no one could force a crippled man to run by jove he exclaimed ill do it he crossed quickly to the bunkhouse door and looked in the room was empty the supperbell pealed out and he heard the cowmen answer it now was the appointed moment he might have no other with catlike tread he slipped into the sleepingquarters returning in a moment with a revolver he stared thankfully at the weapon better this than dishonor why didnt i think of it before its perfectly simple ill accidentally shoot myself in the foot but even as he gazed at the gun he saw that the muzzle was as large as a gopherhole a bullet of that size would sink a ship he meditated in a panic and as for his foot what frightful execution it would work but it were better to lose a foot than a footrace under present conditions so he began to unlace his shoe then realizing the value of circumstantial evidence he paused no his disability must bear all the earmarks of an accident he must guess the location of his smallest and least important toe and trust the rest to his marksmanship visions of bloodpoisoning beset him and when he pressed the muzzle against the point of his shoe his hand shook with such a palsy that he feared he might miss he steeled himself with the thought that other men had snuffed out life itself in this manner then sat down upon the floor and cocked the weapon a second time he wondered if the shock might by any chance numb him into unconsciousness if so he might bleed to death before assistance arrived but he had nothing to do with that the only question was which foot he regarded them both tenderly they were nice feet and had done him many favors he loved every toe they were almost like innocent children it was a dastardly deed to take advantage of them thus but he advanced the revolver until it pressed firmly against the outside of his left foot then closed his eyes and called upon his courage there came a great roaring in his ears how long he sat thus waiting for the explosion he did not know but he opened his eyes at length to find the foot still intact and the muzzle of the weapon pointing directly at his instep he altered his aim hurriedly when without warning of any sort a mans figure appeared silhouetted against the window the figure dropped noiselessly to the floor inside the room and cried in a strange voice lock those doors quick finding that it was no hallucination speed rose calling out who are you shhh the stranger darted across the room and bolted both doors while the other felt a chill of apprehension at these sinister precautions he grasped his revolver firmly while his heart thumped the fellows appearance was anything but reassuring he was swarthy and sunbrowned his clothes were ragged his overalls were patched instead of a coat he wore a loosely flapping vest over a black sateen shirt long since rusted out to a nondescript brown ive been trying to get to you for a week announced the mysterious visitor hoarsely wwhat do you want who are you im skinner cook for the centipede the man i race not so loud skinner was training for the faintest sound from the direction of the messhouse ill kill him exulted the eastern lad but the other forestalled a murder by running on rapidly listen now humpy and i jobbed this gang last month were pardners see hes got another race framed at pocatello and i want to make a getaway yes yes yyou neednt stay here on my account now dont lets take any chances tomorrow see were both out for the coin what do you want to do win or lose skinner jumped back to the door and listened what dont stall the stranger cried impatiently will i win or will you whats it worth he clipped his words short his eyes darted furtive glances here and there can i win gasped speed you can if theres enough in it for me im broke see you bet five hundred and well cut it two ways ii havent that much with me borrow it dont be a boob meet me in albuquerque sunday and well split there is that all i have to do certainly whats the matter with you anyhow skinner cast a suspicious glance at his companion ii guess im rattled its all so sudden of course youll have to run fast enough so we dont tip off how fast is that oh tenfour carelessly thats what humpy and i did ten and fourfifthsseconds certainly dont kid me theyre liable to break in on us skinner stepped to the window but speed halted him with a trembling hand and a voice of agony mr skinner ii cant run that fast ffifteen is going some for me what skinner stared at his opponent strangely thats right im a lemon aint you the yale champ the guy that goes under even time wally shook his head im his chum i couldnt catch a cramp the brown face of the centipede sprinter split into a grin his eyes gleamed then ill win said he im the sucker but ill make good get your money down and ill split with you no no not you me i must win speed clutched his caller desperately all right ill frame anything but i cant run any slower than i did with joe and make a live of it theyd shoot us both but theres a girl in thisa girl i love it means more than mere life skinner was plainly becoming nervous at the length of the interview couldnt you fall down inquired the younger man timidly the cook laughed derisively i could fall down twice and beat you in fifteen after an instants thought say theres one chance if we dont run straight away theres a corral out where we race you insist on running around it see theres nothing in the articles about straightaways thatll kid em on the time if i get too far ahead ill fall down bbut will you stay down till i catch up sure leave it to me you wont forget or anything like that certainly not but no rough work in front of the cowboys understand shh skinner vaulted lightly through the window landing in the dirt outside without a sound somebody coming he whispered understand merchants hotel albuquerque noon sunday and the next instant he had vanished into the dusk leaving behind him a youth half hysterical with hope out of the blackest gloom had come j wallingford speeds deliverance and he did not pause to consider the ethics involved if he had he would have told himself that by skinners own confession the centipede had won through fraud at the first race if they were paid back in their own coin now it would be no more than tardy justice with light heart he hastened to replace the borrowed revolver in the bunkroom just as voices coming nearer betokened the arrival of his friends from the house as he stepped out into the night he came upon jack chapin hello wally hello jack they shook hands while the owner of the flying heart continued ive just got in and theyve been telling me about this footrace what in the deuce is the matter with you anyhow why didnt you let me know the girls drew closer and speed saw that miss blake was pale i wouldnt have allowed it for a minute now of course im going to call it off oh jack dear you simply cant exclaimed his sister youve no idea the state the boys are in theyll never let you chapin supplemented fresno the master laughed shortly they wont eh who is boss here id like to know theyve bet a lot of money and you know how they feel about that phonograph its the most idiotic thing i ever heard of whatever possessed you wally if the men make a row ill have to smuggle you and glass over to the railroad tonight im for that came the voice of larry i suppose its all my fault miss blake began wretchedly whereat the object of their general solicitude took on an aspect of valor say what is all this fuss about i dont want to be smuggled anywhere thank you i may not be able to square my men chapin reiterated it may have gone too far square square why should you do any squaring im not going to runaway miss blake clasped her hands and breathed a sigh ive got to stay here and run a footrace tomorrow dont be a fool wally covington added his voice to the others speed whirled angrily i dont need your advice convict the champion hobbled hastily out of range i know what im doing im going to run tomorrow and i stand a good chance to win mr fresno if he had been a girl would have been said to have giggled all right dearie ill bet you five hundred dollars as there emerged from the darkness whence they had approached unseen stover and behind him the other men evenin whats all the excitement greeted the leader softly the master of the ranch stepped forward see here bill im sorry but i wont stand for this footrace why not queried the foreman i just wont thats all youll have to call it off im sorry too you refuse the owner spoke ominously you bet he does willie pushed himself forward this footrace is ordained and it comes off on time i make bold to inquire if youre talkin for our runner gentlemen i can only say to you that for myself i want to run declared speed then youll run i refuse to allow it chapin declared and instantly there was an angry murmur but before it could take definite form speed spoke up with equal decisiveness you cant refuse to let me run jack there are reasons he searched miss blakes countenance why i must run and win and win i shall turning he stalked away into the darkness and there followed him a shout of approbation from the ranchmen jack chapin threw up his hands ive done my best the mans mad cried covington but fresno was nearer the truth nothing of the sort he remarked and struck a match hes bluffing as for helen blake she shook her fair head and smiled into the night you are all wrong she said i know chapter xvi the day of the race dawned bright and fair without a cloud to mar its splendor as the golden morning wore on a gradual excitement became apparent among the cowboys increasing as the hours passed and as they prepared with joy to invade their rivals territory nevertheless the vigilant watch upon their champion did not relax theirs was an attitude of confidence tinged with caution it was some time after midnight that lawrence glass had been the cause of a wild alarm that brought the denizens of the ranch out in night apparel jack chapin awakened by a cry for help had found him in the hands of carara and cloudy who had been doing night duty in accordance with stovers orders what with the trainers loud complaints the excited words of his captors and the confusion resulting when the bunkhouse emptied itself of men half clad it had taken the ranchowner some time to discover that glass had been surprised in the act of escaping it seemed that the sentries seeing a figure skulking past the white adobe walls of the house had called upon it to halt there had been a dash for liberty then a furious struggle before the intruders identity became clear and but for chapins prompt arrival upon the scene violence would inevitably have resulted as it was the owner had difficulty in restraining his men who saw in this significant effort a menace to their hopes i tell you im walkin in my sleep declared glass for the twentieth time caramba you try for get away stormed the mexican pig not a bit like it ive been a sonnambulust ever since im a baby why didnt you answer when we called cloudy demanded how can i talk when im sound asleep if you couldnt hear us call why did you run now have a little sense pal a sleepwalker dont know what hes doin since theres no harm done youd better all go back to bed chapin advised mr glass has the liberty of the ranch boys night or day asleep or awake looks to me like he was tryin to elope some stover balanced upon one bare foot and undertook to remove a sandburr from the other in the darkness he seemed supernaturally tall so that glass hastened to strengthen his story i was walkin in my sleep as nice as you please when those rummies lep on me say you know thats dangerous you can kill a guy wakin him up so sudden theres easier ways than that spoke willie from the gloom its a yap trick just the same i was in the middle of a swell dream too come come stover get your boys back to bed well have the whole ranch up with this noise chapin himself led glass around the house while that gentleman made no offer to explain the dream which had prompted him to pack his suitcase before letting himself out of the trainingquarters once safely back in the gymnasium he sat up till dawn a prey to frightful visions which the comfortable morning light did not serve to dissipate wally speed slept serenely through the whole disturbance and was greatly amused at the story when he awoke he was sorely tempted to make known his agreement with skinner and put an end to his trainers agony of mind but he recalled skinners caution and reflected that the slightest indiscretion might precipitate a tragedy for the first time since the beginning of the adventure he was perfectly at ease and the phenomenon added to his trainers dismay others beside lawrence glass were apprehensive culver covington for instance was plainly upset while roberta keap pleaded headache and had her breakfast served in her room it was shortly afterward that she appeared in the gymnasium doorway and cried in an accusing voice well mr speed yes quite well you traitor you modern borgia didnt you go and tell helen everything didnt you promise to stop culver i did i had him thrown in jail at omaha what more could i do you did try honestly mrs keap allowed her indignation to abate slightly if i had known that i wouldnt have told helen im sorry you didnt explain i was angry furious and i was frightened so she broke down suddenly what shall i do about them i can see what they want to say and yet i darent let either speak a word mrs keap are you sure culver loves you horribly and he suspects the truth i saw him change the moment he found me here roberta began to weep two limpid tears stole down her cheeks she groped for a chair and wally hastened to her assistance as he supported her she gave way completely and bowed her head upon his shoulder it was in perfect keeping with the luck of things that miss blake should enter at the moment she had come with jack and his sister to inquire regarding the fitness of her champion and to nerve him for the contest and she stood aghast chapin stepped forward with a look of suspicion inquiring whats going on here miss blake spoke brightly tinkling ice in her voice theres no necessity for an explanation is there it seems time for congratulations oh see here now mrs keaps really engaged to culver you know culver culver both the young ranchman and his sister stared at the chaperon with growing horror while she undertook to explain but the blow had fallen so swiftly that her words were incoherent and in the midst of them her hostess turned and fled from the room now dont begin to aviate until you understand the truth speed continued while shes engaged to that brokentoed serpent she doesnt love him do you see he smiled i do not see it was simply a habit mrs keap had got into i should say it was an impulsive engagement that she has repented of no doubt she was repenting when we interrupted you said miss blake bitterly then chapin added helplessly but culver is engaged to my sister jean jean mrs keap exposed her tragic face then he deceived me ohh what wretches men are the widow commenced to sob outside came miss chapins voice so here you are mr covington and the next moment she reappeared dragging the crippled champion behind her thrusting him toward roberta she pouted there mrs keap i give him back to you perhaps youd better go on with your explanations chapin suggested coldly to speed how can i when you wont listen to me hear ye hear ye culver was engaged to marry mrs keap but she discovered what a reprobate he is there was indistinguishable dissent of some sort from mr covington and she learned to detest him mrs keap likewise dissented in accents muffled well she would have learned to detest him in a short time because shes in love with jack chapin so she came to old doctor speed in her troubles and he promised to fix it all up now i guess you four can do the rest of the explaining let this be a lesson to all of you if you ever get in trouble come to the matchmaking kid ill square it they were four happy young people and they lost no time in escaping elsewhere when they had gone their benefactor said to miss blake wouldnt you like to make that a triple wedding we might get club rates for answer miss blake hurried to the door and was gone over at the centipede there was a great activity and yet a certain idleness also as if it had been a holiday the men hung about in groups listening to the peripatetic phonograph a dozen or more outsiders had ridden over from the postoffice to witness the contest out by the corral which stood close to the first break of the foothills skinner was superintending the laying out of a course selecting a stretch of level ground worn smooth and hard by the tread of countless hoofs makes a pretty good track eh he said to gallagher i wonder how fast this feller is ever heard they seem to think hes a whirlin ball of fire but that dont worry you none does it gallagher bent his leadblue eyes upon the cook who shrugged carelessly and gallagher smiled he was forced to admit that his man did not appear to be one easily frightened skinners face was hard his lips thin his jaw was not that of a weakling he had dressed early then wrapped a horseblanket about his shoulders and now casting this aside sprinted down the dirt track for a few yards to test the footing while gallagher watched him with satisfaction a thing of steel and wire as tough as agile and as spirited as a rangeraised cowpony he was unshaven his runningtrunks were cut from a pair of overalls held up at the waist by a section of windowcord and his chest was scantily covered by an undershirt from which the sleeves had been pulled but when he returned to pick up his blanket gallagher noted approvingly that he was not even breathing heavily with a knowledge confined mainly to livestock the foremen inquried hows your laigs i like to see em hairy thataway its a sign of strenth i bet this college boy is as pink as a maidens palm he dont look to me like he could run they fool you sometimes said skinner bytheway what have you bet we laid the phonograph agin their treasures an trappins but how much money we got three hundred pesos down but they sent word they was comin loaded for bar so we rustled five hundred more skinners eyes gleamed i wish i had a couple of hundred to bet on myself broke eh im as clean as a hounds tooth im sorry yall tossed off your wages but gallagher started suspiciously say i reckon that wont affect your runnin none will it skinner admitted that he could run best when he had something to run for you might advance me a months wages he reflected ill do it hello say aint that one of them flyin heart city visitors from the direction of the ranch buildings berkeley fresno was approaching goodafternoon you are mr gallagher i believe i rode over with our crowd just now fresno looked back lets step around to the other side of the corral i want to talk to you he led the way then inquired is this your runner thats him his names skinner and thats a promisin title to bet on gallagher slipped a roll of banknotes from his pocket unhook ill bet you no no i think myself mr skinner will win thats why im here strip your hand son i dont savvy and fresno explained you see im a guest over there but theres no sentiment with me in money matters he produced a wallet and took from it five onehundreddollar bills bet this for me and dont let on where it came from ill see you after the race mind you not a word im dumb as the egyptian spinks this race means a lot to me mr skinner the guest of the flying heart ranch turned to its enemy theres a girl in it understand the cook showed the gleam of his teeth if you win ill send you some weddingcake and a box of cigars thanks said the other but ive got a bum tooth and i dont smoke as fresno left there approached in a surging group the opposing side goodevenin gabby stover called loudly as he came within speaking distance here we come en massay and with ladies to further embarrass and degrade you in the hour of your defeat we aint defeated yit how do mr chapin did you get our message yes but we aint seen the color of yalls money mr speed borrowed five hundred dollars from me and said he might want more chapin volunteered is that all all jeered still bill why this mangy layout aint never saw that much money upon which gallagher carelessly displayed a corpulent roll of bills remarking count a thousand bill it all goes on skinner i aint heard of no trainrobbery muttered the lanky foreman of the flying heart nor i dont aim to handle no tainted money and stover and gallagher faced each other hard before turning jean saw it and whispered to chapin oh jack dear im terribly frightened but helen blake who overheard left her companions and went straight to gallagher i should like she said to wager a few dollars on mr speed and the honor of the flying heart both skinner and his foreman stared at her nonplussed you dont look like a bettin lady the latter managed to remark jocularly im not i never made a wager before in all my life but you see mr gallagher i believe in our man gallagher lowered his eyes how much do you aim to risk miss i dont know what the rules are but i think our side ought to bet as much as your side that is the way it is done isnt it you mean that you aim to cover what mr speed dont the girl nodded gallagher spoke admiringly youre right game miss but i reckon we dont want your money why not i suppose there aint no particlar reason if mr speed can beat mr covington who is the best runner at yale im sure he can defeat mr skinner who never went to college at all they have all turned against him and hehe is so brave miss blakes indignation was tearful and gallagher spoke hurriedly he may be brave all right miss but he cant win unless skinner dies you save your money to buy chocolates an bonmots miss why listen the stock man softened his voice in a fatherly manner this fresno party is wise five hundred of this coin is his helen uttered a cry do you mean he is betting against mr speed nothin else despicable breathed the girl wait a moment please helen hurried back to chapin while gallagher muttered something like i aint takin no orphans money jack the girl was trembling with excitement you told me on the way over that you had five hundred dollars with you let me have it please ill give you my check when we get home my dear girl you arent going to bet it yes i am dont do that for answer she snatched the pocketbook from his hand mr gallagher she called skinner watched from afar some class to that gal was what he said which proved that he was a person not wholly without sentiment chapter xvii speed leaped down from the buckboard in which carara had driven him and glass over to the centipede corral i told you to jump out when we crossed that bridge was larrys reproach to him you could have broke your arm now its too late but speed joined his friends with the most cheerful of greetings they responded nervously shocked at his flippant assurance this mr speed is the scene of your defeat gallagher made the introduction and this is mr skinner no doubt wally shook hands with the centipede runner who stared at him refused to recognize his knowing wink and turned away you think pretty well of yourself dont you suggested gallagher unpleasantly and speed laughed there was no reason why he should not laugh either way his hour had come i spose that satchel is full of money gallagher pointed to the suitcase on the contrary it is full of clothes it is i who contain the money he thrust a cold palm into his pocket as covington dragged him aside to advise him not to be an utter idiot to throw his money away if he must but to throw it to charity or to his friends yes glass seconded lugubriously and hold out enough to buy me a gates ajar in immortelles but he said also as if to himself he may be wrong in the burr but hes a game little guy as the centipede foreman counted the money helen came forward announcing youll have to win now wont you mr speed ive wagered five hundred dollars on you i bet against mr fresno fresno so hes out from cover at last eh i havent been under cover spoke up the californian ive been wise all along chapin wheeled does it seem to you quite the thing to bet against our man fresno he inquired his glance full in the others eyes why not theres no sentiment in financial affairs speed shrugged our tenor friend will sing his way back to california he turned with his thanks to helen the talkin machine interrupted still bill suddenly a group of men was approaching who bore the phonogragh upon a drygoods box and deposited it in state beside the racecourse say gabby spose you give us a tune just to show shes in good order suspicious eh you bet theres a monologue id admire to hear its called well have the holy city said willie positively its more appropriate so with clumsy fingers gallagher fitted a record then wound up the machine under the jealous eyes of the flying heart cowboys drawn by the sound skinner wrapped to the chin in his blanket idled toward the crowd affording glass a sight of his face for the first time the latter started as if stung and crying under his breath salted carhorse drew his employer aside say he said pointing a finger whos that skinner the man i run glass groaned his name aint skinner thats whiz long six years ago i saw him win the sheffield handicap from scratch in ninethree then as speed did not seem to be particularly pressed dont you understand wally hes a pro this is his game to which the younger man replied serenely and happily its fixed whats fixed the race it s all arranged framed who framed it how when shh i did yesterday by stealth i fixed it you win from whiz long and you cant run under fifteen wally nodded i told him that its all right you told him glass staggered its all right say dont you know hes the fastest crookedest cheatingest doublecrossingest why he just came to feel you out and speed turned dizzy and you fell for that old stuff larrys voice was trembling with anger and disgust why thats part of his work hes doublecrossed every runnin mate he ever had hed cheat his mother wait skinner had left the crowd and was seated now in the shade of the corral fence he glanced upward from beneath his black brows as larry reached and greeted him hello whiz i just made you then he shook his head i havent got you my name is skinner nix on that monaker glass smiled indulgently i had a man in that sheffield handicap six years ago youre in bad asserted the cook steadily but assuming that my name is long i didnt say your name was long i called you whiz glass chuckled at the point as he scored it now come in be good skinner darted a look toward gallagher and the centipede men gathered about the shrilling phonograph stooped and tied his shoes and breathed softly spiel this little feller im trainin does he win without an upward glance skinner inquired did the man you trained for the sheffield handicap win never mind that does this frameup go through it happened that speed drawn irresistibly had come forward to hang upon every word and now chose this moment to interrupt its all right mr skinner but skinner leaped to his feet dont try anything like that he cried in a terrible voice that brought gabby gallagher striding toward them whats goin on here are they try in to fix you skinner not a bit like it glass protested stoutly i only asked him which side hed rather run on and now he calls for police protection dont try it again thats all the cook warned sullenly i reckon ill take a hand in this gallagher was in a fine rage and would have fallen upon the offender had not stover stepped in his path i reckon you wont he said easily the two glared at each other and were standing thus when speed and his trainer moved gently off they made their way to the house in comparative silence i i made a mistake said wally youve been jobbed like you was a baby said glass there aint but one thing to do now go into the house and change your clothes and when you get ready to run get ready to run for your life and mine over on the racecourse gallagher was inquiring whos goin to send these yere athaletes away i am announced willie without hesitation bein perhaps the handiest man present with a weepon im goin to start this journey he looked his foes squarely in the eyes has anybody got objections to me the silence was nattering and more loudly now so that skinner might hear he added if your man tries to beat the gun ill have him wingin his way to lands celestial before he makes his second jump gallagher acknowledged the fairness of this proposition this race is goin to be squar said he were ready when yall are j wallingford speed stepped out of his clothes and into his silken runningsuit he was numb and cold his hands performed their duties to be sure but his brain was idle all he knew was that he had been betrayed and all was lost he heard glass panting instructions into his ear but they made no impression upon him in a dull trance he followed his trainer back to the track his eyes staring his bones like water not until he heard the welcoming shout of the flying heart henchmen did he realize that the worst was yet to come he heard larry still coaching earnestly if you cant bite him trip him up and some one said are we ready glass held out his hand goodbye mr speed chapin came forward and spoke with artificial heartiness goodluck wally beat him at the start and covington followed remember he cautioned sadly what i told you about the start its your only chance why dont you fellows think about the finish of this race faltered the runner then in a voice broken with excitement helen blake spoke holding out her hand for a goodbye clasp dear mr speed she said will you try to remember this remember to run before he does and dont let him catch up to you if you do that i just know youll win this magnificent display of confidence nerved the athlete and he smiled at her he wished to speak but dared not trust himself gallagher was calling so he went to the startingpoint whence he surveyed the course there it lay no more than a lane leading down between ranks of brownfaced men whose eyes were turned upon him on the top rail of the corral perched willie revolver in hand the babble of voices ceased the strident laughter stilled speed heard the nervous tustle of feminine skirts skinner was standing like a statue his toe to the mark his eyes averted youll start here and run a hundred yards out yonder to the tape gallagher announced i refuse said speed firmly for one breathless instant there was a hush of amazement then a cry of rage still bill stover hurled the nearest man out of his path and stode forward his lean face ablaze he wheeled and flung up his hand as if to check some hidden movement of willies no voylence yet will what dyou mean mr speed speed uttered what he knew was his final joke on earth i mean that i refuse to run straightaway im an allaround athlete and i must run all around something amid shouts of confusion those who had taken positions along the course came crowding back to the startingpoint willie wrapped his legs about the top rail of the fence and drew a second revolver while the two foremen bellowed indistinguishable threats at each other chapin lost no time in withdrawing his guests out of the turmoil but helen kept her place her face chalky but her eyes very bright what are you tryin to hand us roared gallagher still bill was quick to take a cue dont get hectic said he theres nothin in the articles about runnin straight let em run around the corral but at this suggestion every voice seemed to break out simultaneously humpy joe ran straightaway declared gallagher yes an he kept at it piped willie i favor the idea of them runners comin back where they start from listen all of you speed announced i am going to run around and around and around this corral if mr skinner chooses to accompany me he may trail along otherwise i shall run alone never heerd of such a thing gallagher was dancing in his excitement but skinner calmed him by announcing curtly ill beat him any way he wants to run you couldnt beat a rug retorted wally and glass suddenly smote his palms together crying blankly i forgot the rug we dont want no argment afterwards does the centipede accept its fate still bill glared at the faces ringed about him we do if skinner says so twice around the corral agreed skinner but no accidents understand if he falls i keep going instantly there ensued a scramble for grandstand seats the cowboys swarmed like insects upon the stout fence of the corral then youll start and finish here once yall pass well stretch a string to yonder post and the first man to bust it wins whos got a string mr gallagher wont you use my sash helen quickly unfastened the long blue bow of ribbon from her cotton gown and gallagher thanked her adding moreover the winner gets it for the first time then skinner addressed miss blake hadnt you better make that the loser miss the winner gets the coin and the assent came in a flashing smile from skyblue eyes then the loser gets the ribbon gallagher announced loudly and made one end fast to the corral which i call hansome treatment for mr speed an only wish we might retain it at the centipede as a remembrance are the runners ready those near the startingline gave room skinner stepped quickly out from his blanket and stamped his spikes into the soil he raised and lowered himself on his toes to try his muscles speed drew his bathrobe from his shoulders and thrust it toward his trainer who shook his head give it to covington bo i wont be here when you come back get on your marks the starter gave his order speed set his spikes into the dirt brought his weight forward upon his hands he whispered something to skinner that gentleman straightened up whereupon willie cried for a second time on your marks and again skinner crouched get set the crowd filled its lungs and waited helen blake buried her nails in her rosy cold palms chapin and his friends were swayed by their heartbeats while even fresno was balanced upon his toes his plump face eager the click of willies gun sounded sharp as he cocked it into the ear close by his cheek speed again whispered an agonized dont forget to fall down this time the cook of the centipede leaped backward with an angry snarl while the crowd took breath make him quit talking to me cried skinner gallagher uttered an imprecation and strode forward only to have his way once more barred by still bill stover he can talk if he wants to there is nothing speed pointed out with dignity in the articles to forbid talking if i wished to i could sing yes or whistle if i felt like it on your marks came the rasping voice of willie as wally murmured to skinner remember i trust you skinner ground his teeth the tendons in his calves stood out rigidly get set once more the silence of death wrapped the beholders and willie raised his arm speed cast one lingering farewell glance to the skies and said devoutly what a beautiful beautiful day now the starter was shaking in an ague of fury listen you he chattered shrilly im goin to shoot twice this time once in the air and the next time at the nearest footrunner now get set and the speaker pulled trigger whereupon speed leaped as if the bullet had been aimed at him instantly a fulllunged roar went up that rolled away to the foothills and the runners sped out of the pandemonium their legs twinkling against the dustcolored prairie down to the turn they raced speed was leading fright had acted upon him as an electric charge his terror lent him wings he was obsessed by a propelling force outside of himself naturally strong lithe and active he likewise possessed within him the whitehot flame of youth and now with a nameless fear to spurn him on he ran as any healthy frightened young animal would run at the second turn skinner had not passed him but the thud of his feet was close behind this unparalleled phenomenon surprised lawrence glass perhaps most of all he had laid his plans to slip quietly out of the crowd under cover of the first confusion and lay his own course eastward but when he beheld his protege actually in the lead he remained rooted to his tracks was this a miracle he turned to covington to find him dancing madly his crutches waving over his head in his eyes the stare of a maniac his mouth was distended and glass reasoned that he must be shouting violently but could not be sure suddenly covington dashed to the turn whence the runners would be revealed as they covered the last half lap for nothing was distinguishable through the fence burdened by human forms and larry lumbered after him ploughing his way through the crowd and colliding with the box upon which stood the echo phonograph of new york and paris he hurled mariedetta out of his path with brutal disregard but even before he could reach his point of vantage the sprinters burst into the homestretch larry glass saw it all at a glance speed was weakening while skinner was running easily nature had done her utmost she could not work the impossible as they tore past skinner was ahead the air above the corral became blackened with hats as if a flock of vultures had wheeled suddenly the shriek of triumph that rose from the centipede ranks warned the trainer that he had tarried too long heavily he set off across the prairie for new york the memory of that race awakened speed from his slumbers many times in later years when he found the brown shoulder of his rival drawing past he realized that for him the end of all things was at hand and yet be it said to his credit he held doggedly to his task and began to fight his waning strength with renewed determination down through the noisy crowd he pounded at the heels of his antagonist then out upon the second lap but now his fatigue increased rapidly and as it increased so did skinners lead at the second turn wally was hopelessly outdistanced and began to sob with fury in anticipation of the last long terrible stretch back toward the final turn they came the college man desperately laboring the cook striding on like a machine wally saw the rows of forms standing upon the fence but of the shouting he heard nothing skinner was twenty yards ahead now and flung a look back over his shoulder as he turned into the last straightaway he looked back again and grinned triumphantly then j wallingford speed gasped and calling upon his uttermost atom of strength quickened the strides of his leaden legs skinner had fallen a shriek of exultation came from the flying heart followers it died as the unfortunate man struggled to his feet and was off again before his opponent had overtaken him down the alley of human forms the two came then as their man drew ahead for an instant or two such a bedlam broke forth from gallaghers crew that lawrence glass well started on his overland trip judged that the end had come but skinner wavered his ankle turned for a second time he seemed about to fall once more then he righted himself but he came on hobbling the last thirty yards contained the tortures of a lifetime to wally speed his lungs were bursting his head was rolling every step required a separate and concentrated effort of will he knew he was wobbling and felt his knees ready to buckle beneath him but he saw the blue tightstretched ribbon just ahead and continued to lessen the gap between himself and skinner until he felt he must reach out wildly and grasp at the other mans clothing helens face stood out from the blur and her lips cried to him he plunged forward his outflung arm tore the ribbon from its fastening and he fell but skinner was behind him chapter xviii the only thing in the world that the victorious speed wanted was to lie down and stretch out and allow those glowing coals in his chest to cool off but rough hands seized him and he found himself astride of stovers shoulders and gyrating about the echo phonograph in the midst of a wardance he kicked violently with his spiked shoes whereat the foreman bucked like a wild horse under the spur and dropped him and he staggered out of the crowd where a girl flew to him oh wally she cried i knew you could he sank to the ground and she knelt beside him skinner was propped against the corral fence opposite his face distorted with suffering and gallagher was rubbing his ankle taint broke i reckon said gallagher rising i wish to hell it was he stared disgustedly at his fallen champion and added we dont want yall for a cook no more skinner you never was no good nohow he turned to helen and handed her a double handful of banknotes as berkeley fresno buried his hands in his pockets and walked away heres your coin miss if ever you get another hunch let me know an heres yours mr speed its a weddinpresent from the centipede he fetched a deep sigh thank the lord well git somethin fit to eat from now on speed staggered to skinner who was still nursing his injury and held out his hand whereat the cook winked his left eye gravely the best man won said skinner and say theres a parson at albuquerque then he groaned loudly and fell to massaging his foot there came a fluttering by his side and miss blakes voice said to him with sweetness and with pity im so sorry you lost your position mr skinner youre a splendid runner never mind the job miss ive got something to remember it by he pointed to a sash which lay beside him the loser gets the ribbon miss he explained gallantly off to the right there came a new outcry and far across the level prairie a strange sight was revealed to the beholders a fat man in white flannels was doubling and dodging ahead of two horsemen and even from a considerable distance it could plainly be seen that he was behaving with remarkable agility for one so heavy repeatedly his pursuers headed him off but he rushed past them seemingly possessed by the blind sense of direction that guides the homing pigeon or the salmon in its springtime run he was headed toward the east why its larry ejaculated speed and cloudy and carara wally your man has lost his reason chapin called at that instant the watchers saw the mexican thunder down upon glass his lariat swinging about his head lazily the rope uncoiled and settled over the fleeing figure then amid a cloud of dust cararas horse set itself upon its haunches and the whiteclad figure came to the end of its flight there was a violent struggle as if the cowboy had hooked a leaping tuna cactus plants and sagebrush were uprooted then the pony began to back away always keeping the lariat taut but glass was no easy captive as his threshing arms and legs betrayed and even when he was dragged back to the scene of the race panting grimy dishevelled the rope still about his waist he seemed obsessed by that wild insanity for flight he was drenched with perspiration his collar was dangling one end of a suspender trailed behind him at sight of speed he uttered a cry then plunged through the crowd like a bull but the lariat loop slipped to his neck and tightened like a hangmans noose larry cried his employer sharply have you lost your head aint they gggot you yet queried the trainer in a strangling voice you idiot i won what i won easy you won larrys eyes were starting from his head he sure did said stover didnt you think he could glass apprehended that look of suspicion certainly said he didnt i say so all along now take that clothesline off of me ive got to run some more that evening j wallingford speed and helen blake sat together in the hammock and much of the time her hand was in his the breath of the hills wandered to them idly fragrant with the odors of the open fields the heavens were bright with dancing stars the night itself was made for romance from the bunkhouse across the courtyard floated the voice of the beloved echo phonograph now sad now gay now shrilling the peaceful air with mme melbas holy city now waking the echoes with the rasping reflections of silas on fifth avenue to the spellbound audience gathered close beside it it was divine but deep as was their satisfaction it could not compare with that of the tired young son of eli ineffable peace and contentment were his the whole wide world was full of melody and now that ive told you what a miserable fraud i am you wont stop loving me he questioned helen nestled closer and shook her head there was no need for words jack chapin came out upon the porch with the chaperon well fresno caught his train he told them and we had such a glorious drive coming back the night is splendid yes so nice and moonlight wally agreed pleasantly whereat jack chapin laughed its as black as pitch why so it is then as a fresh song burst forth from the very heart of the machine he murmured affectionately by jove there goes the baggage coach ahead once more that makes ten times its a beautiful thing isnt it miss blake sighed dreamily i i believe im learning to like it myself her lover agreed poor frez the bridesmaids wore white organdie and carried violets
