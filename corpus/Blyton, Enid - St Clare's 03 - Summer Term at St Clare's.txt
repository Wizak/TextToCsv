 going back to school four weeks holiday said pat osullivan as she sat up in bed the first morning of the easter holidays how lovely i hope its good weather her twin yawned and turned over how nice not to have to get up as soon as the schoolbell goes she said sleepily im going to have another snooze well im not said pat hopping out of bed oh isabel its a simply perfect day do get up and lets go round the garden but isabel was asleep again pat dressed and ran downstairs she felt happy and excited the first day of the holidays was always grand everything at home looked so new and exciting and welcoming even the staid brown hens in the yard seemed to cluck a welcome school is lovelybut holidays are grand too thought pat oh there s the first daffodil coming out and look at those scyllas exactly the colour of the april sky both the twins enjoyed the first day of the holidays in their own way isabel lazed round peaceful and happy pat rushed here there and everywhere seeing everybody and everything their mother laughed to see the different ways in which they enjoyed themselves youre as like as two peas to look at she said but you often act in quite the opposite way i hope this lovely weather goes onyoull be quite nice and brown well make the most of it my dears because your four weeks will soon go oh mother four weeks is a lovely long time simply ages said pat but although it seemed ages at first it began to slip by very quickly after the first few days the twins were astonished to find that a week had gone byand then ten daysand then a fortnight cousin alison is coming to spend the last two weeks with us isnt she mother said pat when is she coming this week on thursday said mrs osullivan by the way her mother said to me on the telephone yesterday that she is much better for being a term at st claresnot nearly so vain and silly thats quite right said isabel thinking of the teasing and scolding her featherheaded cousin had had at st clares the last term she learnt quite a lot of lessons well so did we the first term too im glad you sent us there mother its a fine school im already beginning to look forward to going back summer term ought to be grand two more weeks said pat i saywont it be fun to play tennis again i wonder if well play any matches isabel and i were tennis captains at redroofs our old school but i expect st clares tennis is a pretty high standard lets mark out the court and play a few games said isabel eagerly but mrs osullivan shook her head not in april she said you would spoil the lawn ring up katie johnston and see if you can fix up a four on her hard court it was all because of poor isabels eagerness to have a few practice games at tennis that the rest of the holidays were spoilt i they went over to katie johnstons and played a tennis four there with another girl winnie ellis winnie played a very poor game and quite spoilt it for the others katie apologized for winnie when she had the twins alone for a minute cant think what has happened to her today she said she usually plays such a good game shes sending everything into the net she says her head aches so maybe she isnt very well poor winnie was certainly not well she went down with mumps that evening and her mother rang up katies parents at once im so very sorry she said but winnie has mumps i hope katie has had it otherwise she will be in quarantine im afraid yes katies had it thank goodness said mrs johnston but i dont know about the other two girls who were here playing tennis todaythe osullivan twins i must ring up their mother and tell them the telephone rang that evening as the twins were having supper with their parents mrs osullivan went to answer it she soon came back looking a little worried whats the matter asked mr osullivan that was mrs johnston said the twins mother pat and isabel went over to katies to play tennis todayand the fourth girl was winnie ellis she has just developed mumps this eveningand the twins havent had it well mother we didnt breathe her breath or anything said pat we shall be all right i hope you will dear said her mother but the thing isyoull both be in quarantine nowand the quarantine for mumps is rather long you wont be able to go back to school at the beginning of the term im afraid the twins stared at her in dismay oh mother dont lets miss the beginning of term its one of the nicest parts cant we possibly go back in time well you certainly cant of course if you get the mumps said mother ill see the doctor and find out exactly how long you will have to be away alas for the twins the doctor said firmly that they could not go back to school for just over a week after the beginning of term pat and isabel could have cried with disappointment well wellanyone would think you liked school the way you are looking said their father laughing at their gloomy faces i should have thought you would have been pleased at the chance of an extra weeks holiday not when everyone else is back at school bagging the best desks and hearing all the holiday news and seeing if there are any new girls said pat the first week is lovely settling in together oh blow winnie ellis what did she want to go and have mumps for and spoil things for us well these things do happen said mother never mind try to enjoy your extra week keep out in the open air as much as you can and lets hope you dont develop the mumps either of you during their quarantine time the twins could not go out to tea and could have no one in to play with them so they felt rather dull they were glad to have each other especially when the day came for all the girls to return to st clares for the summer term i wonder if theyll miss us said pat of course they will said isabel our cousin alison will tell them whats happened to us lucky for alison she didnt come and stay with us before we were in quarantine or shed have been caught like this too oh blow blow blow whats the time theyll all be catching the train now and gabbling like anything in the carriages wonder if there are any new girls said pat or any new teachers oh deardo you remember the tricks that janet played on poor old mamzelle last term i nearly died of laughter we shant be able to share the tuckboxes said isabel gloomily all the cakes and things will be eaten before we get back oh how i wish we were back today old janet will be thereand hilaryand dorisand kathleenand lucy and margerythough they may have gone up into the second or third form i supposeand sheila will be back and tessie lets not think about it said pat do you feel as if you are getting the mumps isabel have you got a headache or a pain in the jaw or neck or anything not a thing said isabel i say wouldnt it be perfectly awful if we got mumps on the very last day of our quarantine and couldnt go back even then anyone would think you disliked your home thoroughly said mrs osullivan coming into the room well its nice to think you look forward to school so much but do be sensible girls and make the most of this last week i dont think you will get the mumps so just be happy and look forward to going back next week they tried to take their mothers advice it was lovely weather and they were out in the garden all day long helping the gardener or lazing in the hammock but the time went very slowly and each night the twins looked anxiously at each other to see if they had any sign of the mumps at last the final day of their quarantine came and in the evening the doctor arrived to make quite sure they could go back to school he smiled cheerfully at them as he examined them and then made their hearts sink with his next words well my dearsim afraidim very much afraidthat youll have to go back to school tomorrow the twins had looked full of dismay at his first words but as he finished the sentence they beamed and yelled with delight hurrah we can go to school tomorrow hurrah i mother can we go and pack its all done said mrs osullivan smiling i thought you were quite all rightso i packed today for you yeseven your tuckboxes so the next day up to london went the twins with their mother and were put into the train for st clares they were happy and excited they would soon see all their friends again and be lost in the excitements of schoollife they would sit in class under mamzelles stern eye they would giggle at janets tricks and they would hear all the latest news what fun i the train sped away from the platform it seemed to take ages to get to the station that served st clares at last it drew up and out got the two girls shouting to the porter to get their luggage usually the mistresses saw to the luggage and looked after everything tickets includedbut as they were by themselves the twins had to do all this they quite enjoyed it they got a taxi had their luggage put in and set off to the big white building in the distance whose tall twin towers overlooked the beautiful valley good old st clares said pat as she saw the building coming nearer and nearer its nice to see you again i wonder what all the girls are doing isabel they were at tea when the twins arrived it was strange to arrive alone and to have the great front door opened to them by jane the parlourmaid looking very smart indeed halo jane i cried the twins wheres every one having tea miss answered jane youd better go along in before everythings eaten up the twins ran to the big dininghall and opened the door a great babel of sound came to their earsthe girls all talking together happily no one saw them at first then janet happened to glance up and saw the twins standing at the door still in their coats and hats pat isabel she yelled look hilary look kathleen theyre back hurrah she jumped up and rushed to greet them with a look at the astonished miss roberts the mistress who was at the head of the firstform table kathleen and hilary did the same they dragged the twins to their table and made room for them miss roberts nodded at them and smiled glad youre back she said you can take off your hats and coats and hang them over your chairs for now i dont know if these greedy firstformers have left much for you to eat but ive no doubt we can get more from the kitchen if not how good it was to be back among the girls once more what fun to have questions hurled at them and to call back answers how friendly every one was dapping them on the back and smiling with welcoming eyes the twins felt very happy indeed how are the mumps so youve turned up at last your cousin alison told us the news bad luck you couldnt come back the first day mamzelle has missed you terriblyhavent you mamzelle ah ma chкre pat the french class is no longer the same without you and isabel there is now no one to shout at and say cest abominable said mamzelle in her deep voice its good to be back said isabel helping herself to bread and butter and jam i sayweve got our tuckboxes with us we must open them tomorrow weve finished all that was in ours said hilary never mindtwo or three of us have birthdays this term and you can have a double share of birthday cake to make up for missing our tuckboxes only four or five girls around the big table said nothing they were all new girls and they did not know the twins they stared at them in silence thinking that the two must be very popular to get such a welcome pat and isabel took a quick look at the strange girls but had no time to size them up for they were so busy exchanging news and eating plenty of time to know the new girls afterwards thought pat my its good to be back at st clares again settling down again it really was lovely to be back at school again and to hear the familiar chattering and laughing to see the piles of books everywhere and to hear the familiar groans of whos taken my pen or gracious ill never get all this prep done it was good to see the smiling mistresses and to catch a glimpse of winifred james the dignified headgirl it was fun to have a word with belinda towers the sports captain the twins greeted her with beaming smiles for they liked her immensely she was one of the top formers but because she arranged all the matches for the whole school she was much better known to the lower forms than the other big girls hallo twins she said stopping to greet them after tea what about tennis this term i hope youre good we want to play st christophers and oakdene and beat them hollow have you played any in the hols only once said pat we used to be good at our old school but i dont expect we shall shine much at st clares my word havent you changed since you first came two terms ago said janet with a sly smile the stuckup twins would at once have said that they were champions at tennis shut up janet said pat uncomfortably she never liked being reminded of the way she and isabel had behaved the first term they had arrived at st clares they had been called the stuckup twins then and had had a very difficult time dont mind janets teasing said lucy oriell slipping her arm through pats you know her bark is worse than her bite pat i shant see as much of you this term as id like because ive been moved up into the second form i thought you would be said pat sadly she and isabel were very fond of lucy lucys father had had an accident the term before which meant he could no longer do his usual work and for a while every one had thought that the popular merryeyed lucy would have to leave but there was a chance that she could win a scholarship and stay on at st clares for she was very clever and quick so she had been moved up and would now work with the scholarship girls margerys been moved up too said lucy margery came up at that moment a tall olderlooking girl she gave the twins a slap on the back hallo she said did lucy tell you the sad news im in the second form too and i feel very superior indeed to you tiddlers and goshim working hard arent i lucy you are said lucy margery was her friend and the two had been glad to be moved up together who else has been moved up asked isabel as they all went to the common room together vera johns but thats all said janet otherwise our form is the sameexcept for the new girls of course by the way your cousin alison has palled up with one of theman american girl stiffrich called sadie greene there she is over there the twins looked for sadie there was no mistaking her although she wore the school uniform it was plain that her mother had got the very best material possible and had had it made by the very best dressmaker i it was plain too that her hair was permed and her nails were polished so highly that each small fingertip shone like a little mirror golly said pat staring what a fashionplate whats she been sent to st clares for cant imagine said janet she thinks of nothing but her appearance and nearly drives poor mamzelle mad she has the most atrocious french accent you ever heard and her american drawl is worst hollywood you should hear her say twentyfour the best she can manage is twennyfourrrrrrr no matter how many times miss roberts makes her repeat it honestly weve had some fun in english classes i can tell you sadies not a bad sort thoughawfully goodtempered and generous really but shes jolly bad for that silly cousin of yours they walk together whenever we go out and talk of nothing but dresses and perms and filmactresses well have to take alison in hand said pat firmly i thought she looked a bit more featherbrained than usual when i saw her just now i saywhos that what a wildlooking creature thats our carlotta said hilary with a grin shes halfspanish and has a fiercer temper than mamzelles and thats saying something i she speaks very badly and has the most awful ideasbut shes pretty good fun i can see a firstclass row boiling up between her and mamzelle someday oh it is good to be back said pat thoroughly enjoying hearing all this exciting news the new girls sound thrilling i did hope there would be some but im sorry the other three have gone up into the second form i shall miss lucy and margery especially pat and isabel had no prep to do that night but they had to unpack and put away their things instead they left the noisy common room and went upstairs to their dormitory hilary called after them youre in number six twins im there and janet and prudence arnold a new girl and carlotta brown and kathleen and sheila are there too youll see which are your cubicles the twins went up the broad stairway and made their way to the big dormitory it was divided into eight cubicles which had white curtains hung around them that could be pulled back or drawn round just as the girls wished pat found their cubicles at once they were side by side come on lets be quick said pat i want to get down and have a talk again there are still three new girls to hear about i rather liked one of themthe one with the turnedup nose and crinkly eyes yes i liked her too said isabel she looked a monkey i noticed she and janet ragged each other a lot i bet shes good at tricks too i sayit looks as if well have some fun this term pat they unpacked happily and stowed their things away in the drawers of their chests they hung up their dresses and coats in the cupboard and set out the few things they had for their dressingtable they put out the pictures of their father and mother and their brushes and mirrors i expect wed better go and see matron and miss theobald said pat when they had finished so down they went and made their way to matrons room she was there sorting out piles of laundry come in she called in her cheerful voice she looked up and beamed at the twins two bad eggs back again she said dear dear and ive had such a peaceful time without you for a whole week of term why couldnt you get the mumps and give me a little longer spell wellall i say isdont you dare to go down with the mumps now and start an epidemic of it the twins grinned every one liked matron she was full of common sense and funbut woe betide any one who lost too many hankies tore their sheets or didnt darn their stockings at once matron descended on them immediately and many a time the twins had had to go to matrons room and try in vain to explain away missing articles were glad to be back said pat were looking forward to tennis and swimming matron well remember that your bathingcostumes have to be brought to me after swimming said matron no screwing them up and stuffing away into drawers with dry things now run away both of youunless you want a dose out of a nice new bottle of medicine the twins laughed matron had the largest bottles of medicine they had ever seen anywhere there was a big new one on the mantelpiece matron picked it up and shook it try it she said but the twins fled downstairs they went to see miss theobald the wise and kindly head mistress they knocked at the drawingroom door come in said a voice and in they went miss theobald was sitting at her desk writing she took off her glasses and smiled at the blushing twins they liked the head mistress very much but they always felt nervous in front of her well twins she said i still dont know which is which are you patricia she looked at isabel as she said this and isabel shook her head no im isabel she said with a laugh ive got a few more freckles on my nose than pat has thats about the only way to tell us at present miss theobald laughed well thats an easy way to tell one from the other when you are both in front of me she said but it wouldnt be very helpful when there was only one of you now listen twinsi want you to work hard this term because miss roberts thinks you should go up into the second form next term so just see what you can do i should like you to try for top places this term you both have good brains and should be able to do it the twins felt proud of course they would try what fun it would be to go up into the next formand how pleased their parents would be they went out of the room determined to work hard and to play tennis hard and swim well thank goodness we didnt get the mumps said pat happily as they went back to the common room wouldnt it have been awful to have missed more weeks of the summer term it was suppertime when they reached the common room and the girls were pouring out to go to the dininghall chattering loudly janet was arminarm with the new girl the one with the turnedup nose and crinkly eyes hallo pat hallo isabel she said come and be introduced to the bad girl of the formbobby ellis bobby grinned and her eyes became more crinkled than ever she certainly looked naughtyand there was a sort of dontcare air about her that the twins liked at once is your name really bobby asked pat its a boys name i know said bobby but my name is roberta and the short name for robert is bobby you knowso im always called bobby too ive heard a lot about you two twins good things i hope not bad said isabel laughing wouldnt you like to know said bobby with a twinkle and went off with janet it was fun to sit down at suppertime again and hear the familiar chatter going on fun to take big thick slices of bread and spread it with potted meat or jam fun to drink the milky cocoa and yell for the sugar everything was so friendly and jolly and the twins loved it all afterwards the girls returned to the common room and put on the wireless or the gramophone some of the girls did their knitting some read and some merely lazed by the time that bedtime came the twins felt as if they had been back at school for weeks it seemed quite impossible to think they had only been there a few hours they went upstairs yawning whats the work like this term asked pat poking her head into janets cubicle as they undressed fierce said janet it always is in the summer term dont you think so i suppose it seems extra difficult because we all so badly want to be out in the sunshinebut honestly miss roberts is driving us like slaves this term some of us will have to go up into the second form next term and i suppose she doesnt want us to be backward in anything my goodness the maths weve had the last week you just wait and see but not even the thought of miss roberts being fierce with maths could make the twins feel unhappy that first night they cuddled down into their narrow beds and fell asleep at once looking forward to the next day with enjoyment back in miss robertss class the twins awoke before the dressingbell went the next morning they lay whispering to each other whilst the may sunshine shone warmly in at the window then the bell went and the eight girls got out of bed some with a leap like carlotta and the twins some with a groan like sheila who always hated turning out of her warm bed winter or summer they met their cousin alison coming out of her dormitory arminarm with the american girl sadie greene they stared at her because she had done her hair in quite a different way alison what have you done to your hair said pat it looks awful do you think you are a filmstar or something sadie says i look grand like this said alison setting her little mouth in an obstinate line sadie says thats all alison can say nowadays remarked janet shes like a gramophone record always set to say sadie says sadie says sadie says every one laughed its sure a wunnerful way of fixing the hair said doris with a very good imitation of sadies american accent sadie laughed she was very good tempered i dont know what miss roberts will say though went on doris she isnt very keen on fancy hair styles alison well but sadie says began alison in an injured sort of voiceand at once all the girls took up the refrain sadie says sadie says sadie says they chanted in a sort of chorus whilst doris jumped up on to a nearby chair and beat time for the chanting alisons eyes filled with the easy tears she always knew how to shed you can see your cousin can turn on the watertap just as easily as last term said janet in her clear voice alison turned away to hide her face she knew that the girls had no patience with her tears sadie slipped her arm through hers aw come on sugarbaby she said youre a cute little thing and i wont let them tease you i cant think how your cousin can make friends with that vulgar american girl said a soft voice at pats side its a good thing youve come sadie has a very bad influence on the class pat turned and saw the girl called prudence arnold she didnt know whether she liked the look of her or not prudence was pretty but her mouth was hard and her eyes set too close together were a pale brown the breakfastbell went and saved pat the bother of answering she ran down the stairs with the others and whispered to janet is that prudence she looks awfully goodygoody yes youd better mind your ps and qs with her said janet shes so good shell burst with it one day and as for playing a trick on anyone well the thought of it would send her into a fit you should have seen her face one day last week when i flipped a rubber at hilary in class it was enough to turn the milk sour oh and by the wayaccording to her shes related to half the lords and ladies in the kingdom get her on to the subjectshes funny no talking now please said miss roberts as the girls stood for grace to be said pat took a quick look at prudence the girl was standing with her head bent and her eyes shut the very picture of goodness now lucy oriell is really good thought pat glancing at lucy and i like her awfully and did from the first and yet i dont take to prudence at all and she sounds good too perhaps it is because she hasnt any sense of fun and lucy has i wonder if shes as clever as lucy at lessons well we shall soon see that morning miss roberts read out the classmarks for the week and the last new girl pamela boardman was top with ninetythree marks out of a hundred prudence arnold was only halfway down the list sadie alison carlotta and doris vied for places at the bottom pamela you have done very well for the first week said miss roberts i can see you set yourself a high standard and you work steadily in each subject considering that you are the youngest in the formnot yet fourteenthis is very good all the girls stared at pamela who was sitting upright in her desk red with pleasure the twins looked at her curiously they were nearly fifteen and it seemed marvellous to them that a thirteenyearold should be top of their form shes very small even for thirteen thought pat and shes pale now that shes not red any more she looks as if she worked too hard pamela was not very attractivelooking she wore big glasses and her straight hair was tightly plaited down her back she had a very earnest face and paid the greatest attention to everything miss roberts said miss roberts had some more to say she flipped at the marks list with her first finger and then looked firmly at alison sadie doris and carlotta you are all bottom she said well we know some one has to be bottombut nobody needs to be quite so very lowdown as all of you are sit up sadie carlotta there is no need to grin round the class like that it isnt funny to get so few marks in any and every subject carlotta stopped grinning round and scowled she looked like a fiery little gypsy with her black curls deepbrown eyes and creamybrown skin not even her school uniform could make her look ordinary she glared at miss roberts miss roberts took no notice of the scowl or the glare but went calmly on doris you have been in my form for four terms now and im really tired of seeing you at the bottom still you will have extra coaching this term because you really mustnt stay in my form much longer yes miss roberts murmured poor doris the girls glanced at her trying to cheer her up doris was a real dunce and knew itand yet of all the girls in the school she could be the very funniest sending the class into squeals of laughter by her imitations of mistresses and other girls every one liked her even the mistresses who laboured so hard trying to teach her now you alison began miss roberts again looking at the twins cousin with the intention of telling her that she also could do better flow you alison then she stopped and looked at the girl carefully alison she said there is something very strange about you this morning it seems to me that you have forgotten to do your hair oh no miss roberts began alison eagerly sadie showed me a new way she said i had the kind of face that alison you dont really mean to tell me that your hair is done like that on purpose said miss roberts in pretended horror alison subsided at once and the girls giggled alison really did look a little silly with her hair all piled in floppy curls on top of her head miss roberts never could stand what she called frippery in dress or hair style much as i hate you to lose any part of my lesson alison she said i must ask you to go and do something to your hair that will make you look a little less amazing i thought shed be sent out to do her hair properly whispered janet to pat miss robertss sharp ears caught the whisper no talking she said well now get on with the lesson open your maths books at page sixteen pat and isabel bring your books up to my desk please and i will try and explain to you what the class did last week when you were away the rest of you get on with what you began yesterday in a little while all was silence as the class applied itself to its work edison slipped back into the room quietly her cheeks flaming her hair was now taken down and brushed back properly and she looked what she was a fourteenyearold schoolgirl sadie sent her a look of sympathy prudence and pamela bent their heads almost to their desks so concentrated were they on their task they sat next to each other prudence took a quick look at pamelas book to see if her own sums showed the same answers janet nudged hilary our pious little prudence isnt above having a peep at pains work she whispered opening her desk to hide the fact that she was speaking hilary nodded she was about to open her own desk and make a remark but miss robertss eye caught hers and she decided not to miss roberts didnt seem to be standing any nonsense that term she meant her class to do well and to make a good showing when most of it went up into miss jenkss form the next term pat and isabel stood beside miss roberts struggling to understand what she was explaining their five weeks holiday had made them rusty and it was difficult to get back the habit of concentration again but at last they understood and went back to their places to work miss roberts got up to go round the class a suppressed giggle made her look round bobby ellis had balanced a sheet of blottingpaper on the bent head of the unsuspecting prudence it sat there moving slightly whenever prudence turned her head a little to refer to her textbook then it floated gently to the ground much to prudences surprise i imagine that as you find time to play about with blottingpaper roberta you have also found time to do every one of the sums set said miss roberts in a cold sort of voice bobby said nothing she hadnt done even half the sums glanced at her trying to cheer her up doris was a real dunce and knew itand yet of all the girls in the school she could be the very funniest sending the class into squeals of laughter by her imitations of mistresses and other girls every one liked her even the mistresses who laboured so hard trying to teach her now you alison began miss roberts again looking at the twins cousin with the intention of telling her that she also could do better now you alison then she stopped and looked at the girl carefully alison she said there is something very strange about you this morning it seems to me that you have forgotten to do your hair oh no miss roberts began alison eagerly sadie showed me a new way she said i had the kind of face that alison you dont really mean to tell me that your hair is done like that on

not to miss roberts didnt seem to be standing any nonsense that term she meant her class to do well and to make a good showing when most of it went up into miss jenkss form the next term pat and isabel stood beside miss roberts struggling to understand what she was explaining their five weeks holiday had made them rusty and it was difficult to get back the habit of concentration again but at

i imagine that as you find time to play about with blottingpaper roberta you have also found time to do every one of the sums set said miss roberts in a cold sort of voice bobby said nothing she hadnt done even half the sums well if you havent done all the sums and got them right too by the time i get round to you you will stay in at break and do them then said miss roberts prudence pick up the blottingpaper and put it on my desk miss roberts i didnt know anything about what bobby was doing said prudence anxiously i was quite lost in my work i quite so prudence said miss roberts now pick up the blottingpaper please and get lost again poor bobby lost her time at break there was no doubt about itmiss roberts was on the warpath that term what did i tell you said janet when the morning ended at last and the girls trooped out to wash for lunch what a morning alison sent out to do her hair again most of us scoldedbobby kept in for breakjanet ticked off for talking twicedoris pulled up for dreaming in geographycarlotta sent out of the room for answering backand double the amount of prep we usually have golly this is going to be a term the five new girls in a day or two the twins had settled down so well again that no one even remembered they had been late in coming back they felt that it was a little unfair that the teachers so soon forgot this for once or twice they were scolded for not knowing things that the rest of the class had been taught during the first week but the twins had good brains and soon caught up with the others they had always loved the summer term at their old school and they found that it was just as nice at st clares there was no lacrosse that term of course but instead there were tennis and swimmingand they were grand i there were eight courts at st clares and belinda towers who had charge of them drew up a careful timetable so that every girl could have her turn at tennis practice miss wilton the sports mistress was an excellent coach and soon picked out the girls who would do well margery fenworthy one of the old firstformers who had gone up into the second form was brilliant at tennis as she was at all sports miss wilton was delighted with her shes so strong she told belinda and she has a lovely style watch her serve belinda see how she throws the ball up high and gives it just the right smack when it comes downand skims it over the top of the net you know i shouldnt be surprised if she wins the school championship this term and beats all you top formers i dont mind if she does i said belinda so long as she wins the matches against the other schools we play oakdene and st christophers are both running singles championships you know this term perhaps we can put margery in for our player shes better than i am well theres not much to choose between you said the sports mistress except that margery is immensely strong the twins were quite good at tennis and miss wilton was pleased with their style practise well and you may be in the tennis team for the first form she said we shall be playing plenty of matches this term so youll have some fun if you get into the team the twins flushed with pleasure and made up their minds to practise every minute they could they loved their school and were very anxious to do everything they could to bring it fame among other schools but miss wilton was not so pleased with their cousin alison alison did not like games they make me get hot and messy she always complained i hate running about especially in the hot weather my hair gets all wet at the back of my neck alison you make me feel sick said bobby ellis who always said straight out what she was thinking she was a bit like janet that way without janets hot temper youre nothing but a little peacock always hoping some ones going to admire you alison got much better last term said pat trying to stick up for her cousin she really did try to get on with lacrosse well sadie says began alison quite forgetting what the girls thought about this refrain of hers at once the girls nearby took up the chorus sadie says sadie says sadie sayswhat does sadie say they chanted alison turned away in a temper she was usually quite a goodtempered girl but she hated being teased and she certainly was getting a lot of it that term she flew off to find her precious sadie sadie didnt care about games either it was difficult to find out what she did care about with the exception of clothes hair nails complexionand the cinema sadie frankly didnt try at tennis or swimming she hated the water so did alison alison couldnt bear going in its so icycold she complained as she stood at the top of the steps leading down into the deliciously green water she would stand there shivering until one of the girls gave her an exasperated push and sent her in with a gasp and a flop then she would come up spluttering in fury and glare round for the girl who bad pushed her in but bobby or janet or whoever it was would be well away at the top of the swimming pool only one of the new girls really took to tennis and swimming that was bobby ellis she was a good sport and so daring that she even pushed miss wilton unexpectedly into the pool a thing that no other girl would have dared to do nobody ever knew what dontcarebobby would do next she really seemed to care for nothing and nobody and went her own sweet way regardless of rules or punishments she was good at tennis and a fast swimmerbut not one of the other new girls was any good at sports prudence was no sport she thought games were a waste of time but only because she was no good at them she fancied herself at clever conversation and was always trying to get the other girls to argue about such things as should women rule the world instead of men and should girls be given exactly the same education as boys oh shut up janet would say keep that sort of thing for the debating hour for goodness sake if you took a bit more interest in the jolly things of life and did something instead of always talking and prating and airing your wonderful opinions youd get on better i consider youre a silly little emptyhead for all your talk golly you cant even play a simple game of cards my father says cards lead to gambling said prudence her father was a clergyman and the girl had been brought up very strictly my aunt who married sir humphrey bartlett there was a groan at this the girls were getting heartily sick of prudences grand relations who were brought into the conversation whenever possible let me see said bobby pretending to be interested was that the aunt who always had blue silk sheets on the beds or was it the one who threw a fit because the houseparlourmaid dared to give her a hotwater bottle with a cover that didnt match the eiderdown or was it the one who kept tablenapkins embroidered with every letter in the alphabet so that no matter what the names of her guests were there was always a napkin with the right initial prudence flushed she had once boasted about an aunt who had blue silk sheets for her beds but she hadnt said anything about hotwater bottles or table napkins those were clever makeups on bobbys part she said nothing well go on tell us i said bobby were all eager to hear the latest society news but prudence had sense enough not to be drawn into an argument with bobby clever as she was at debating things she was no match for the quickwitted bobby who got all the laughs whenever she argued with any one pamela boardman was very earnest over her tennis and swimming but she was no good at them at all you see i always had a governess before i came here she explained to the girls and my governess didnt play games anyway i was never interested in them i loved working at lessons all work and no play makes jack a dull boy said pat youre much too clever for thirteen i think it would do you good to be bottom of the form for once and really enjoy yourself out in the open air youre always stewing over a book carlotta had never played tennis before and she was quite wild at it miss wilton said that she really thought carlotta imagined the tennis net to be about two miles high the way she hit the ball into the air skyhigh carlotta when i was small i played a game with my brothers called chimneypot tennis she said solemnly to the fiery little girl we sent the ball up to the roof and tried to get it down a chimney well it seems to me you would be very good indeed at that game but as you are not playing with chimneypots i really would be very glad if you could have a look at the net over there and see if you can get the ball anywhere near it when you serve nowthrow it into the airand hit it straight towards the net there would be a shriek of laughter from the watching girls as carlotta hit wildly at the ball and as likely as not sent it over the wall into the kitchengarden her swimming was much the same though she liked the water and was quite at home in it but as belinda complained she swam just like a dog splashing out with legs and arms just anyhow you swim like my dog binks said kathleen he sort of scrabbles along in the water and so do you carlotta sadie couldnt swim at all and though she didnt mind the cold as alison did she hated having to put her carefullyset hair under a tight bathingcap and complained that the water ruined her complexion so with the exception of bobby ellis the firstformers voted the new girls a complete failure at sports its a pity our form have lost margery fenworthy said isabel as she watched the straightlimbed girl swimming the whole length of the pool under water she would win the championship for the school and wouldnt we firstformers be proud may was a glorious month that year warm and sunny swimming was in full swing and daily tennis made the grass become worn at the service lines a good many of the girls had school gardens and these patches were soon full of growing seedlings of all kinds gardening was the one outdoor thing that pamela really seemed to like she took a big patch and sowed many packets of seeds there she bought little plants too gay double daisies velvet pansies and pretty polyanthus to make the borders of her patch gay there were naturewalks over the hills and through the woods sadie and carlotta knew nothing about nature it seemed and made some curious mistakes when pat exclaimed at the amount of frogs in the pond sadie looked at them with interest i got some early frogspawn in the spring said pat and i got heaps of tadpoles from it most of them have turned into tiny little frogs now theyre sweet do tadpoles turn into frogs then said sadie in the greatest surprise the girls laughed at her they couldnt imagine bow it was that sadie knew so little about the most ordinary things didnt you ever go to school before said pat well i lived mostly in hotels in america with my mother said sadie i had a sort of governess but she didnt know much you see most of the time my mother was fighting a lawcase whats that asked isabel well when my father died he left a funny sort of will said sadie and it seemed as if all his money would go to his sisters so mother had to go to law about it and it took years to settle she won in the endand im to have the money when im twentyone its a proper fortune so youre an heiress said prudence admiringly no wonder you have such nice clothes and things it was the first time that prudence had heard of sadies fortune after that every one noticed that the girl hung around sadie continually see dear prudence sucking up to the rich heiress said janet scornfully shes made friends with pamela so that she can pick her brainsand now shes making friends with sadie because one day shell be rich nasty little humbug thats a bit unkind said pat after all sadies kind and generous and we all like to be friends with her because of those things not because shes welloff and pam was a nice little thing though shes such a swotter j m not friends with her because i want to pick her brains but because theres something rather nice about her in spite of her head always being inside a book well stick up for prudence if you like said janet i think shes a humbug i cant stick her goodygoody ways can you bobby bobby agreed there was no humbug about bobby you always knew where you were with her she was warm friendly and sincere for all her dontcare attitude to every one and everything were a mixed bunch this term said pat to isabel as she gazed round her form one morning a very mixed bunch therell be a few bustsup before we all shake down together after two or three weeks the first form began to work quite well the girls saw that miss roberts meant to have her way about the work and they soon found that it was quicker to prepare work thoroughly than to have it all to do again after the lesson because it was carelessly prepared beforehand janet badly wanted to go up with the others the next term so she worked bard but bobby ellis who had become her firm friend could not work hard for more than a few days at a time after that she became bored and then the class had some fun for when bobby was bored with work she found relief in tricks and jokes janet had always been marvellous at these but bobby was ten times more ingenious bobby always found the maths lesson far too long she hated maths and could never see the use of them i wish i could make the lessons ten minutes shorter she sighed as she dressed one morning miss roberts said she was going to give us an oral test at the end of maths today and i know i shall be bottom i cant even think what seven times eight are well cant you think of some way of making the lesson short said janet i dont like oral maths tests any more than you do if only we could put the clock on when miss roberts isnt looking shes got eyes at the back of her head said bobby no good doing it when shes there if only shed go out of the room for a minute but she never does cant you make her said pat youre always full of ideas go oni dare you to make her bobby always took on any dare she looked at pat and grinned right she said ill bet you a stick of toffee to a peppermint drop that miss roberts disappears from our classroom during the maths lesson all the girls began to feel excited bobby was such fun they knew she would do something unusual she did she sat lost in thought at breakfasttime and forgot to have any marmalade with her toast between breakfast and the first class which was geography bobby disappeared she went to the common room which was empty for the girls were now tidying their cubicles and making their beds she got down her writingpad and pen and in neat mature writing penned two lines kindly attend at the mistresses common room in the lesson after break she added a squiggle at the bottom that looked like anybodys initials popped the note into an envelope and printed miss robertss name on it then she placed the note inside her writingpad in readiness for when she meant to use it thought of a plan yet asked janet when bobby rejoined the girls upstairs ive made your bed for you what have you been doing wait and see said bobby with a grin maths was the first lesson after break the girls waited impatiently for it wondering what was going to happen at break they begged bobby to tell them what she was going to do but she wouldnt she slipped off to the common room whilst the others were out in the garden she took the note she had written and went into miss jenkss classroom next to miss roberts she laid the note on miss jenkss desk and then making sure that no one had seen her she slipped out again and went into the garden miss jenks will see the note and think it has been left in the wrong classroom by mistake grinned bobby to herself shell send one of her girls in with it to miss robertsand then maybe well see our miss roberts trotting off to the mistresses common room and if i dont move the hands of the clock on whilst shes gone my name isnt roberta henrietta ellis all the girls trooped back when the schoolbell rang they went to their classrooms and waited for the mistresses to come and take the next lesson hilary stood at the door watching for miss roberts sssst here she is warned hilary the girls stood up at once and became silent miss roberts came in and went to her desk sit she said and the girls sat down with clatters and scrapes of their chairs now today said miss roberts briskly we will try to do a little better than yesterday when pamela was the only one who got even one sum right at the end of the lesson there will be a ten minutes oral testand i warn you no one is to get less than halfmarks or there will be trouble alison please sit up i dont like to see you draped over your desk like that you are here to do maths not to act like the sleeping beauty and go to sleep for a hundred years oh miss roberts must we have an oral test on a hot day like this said alison whose brains worked slowly in the hot weather this hot sun does make me feel so sleepy at the end of the morning well i shall wake you up thoroughly if you seem sleepy in your oral test said miss roberts grimly nowpage twentyseven please bobby why do you keep looking at the door bobby had had no idea that her eyes were continually on the door waiting for it to open and a secondformer to appear she jumped erwas i looking at the door she said at a loss what to say for once you were said miss roberts now for a change look at your book begin work every one bobby looked at page twentyseven but she didnt see the sums there she was wondering if miss jenks had seen the note what a pity if she hadnt the whole joke would be spoilt but miss jenks had she had not noticed it at first because she had put her books down on it then she had written something on the blackboard for the class to do and had gone round the form to make sure they all understood what she had written it was not until she sent tessie to her desk to fetch a book that the note was discovered tessie lifted up the booksand the note was there underneath tessie glanced at it and saw that miss robertss name was printed on it theres a note here on your desk for miss roberts miss jenks she said do you suppose it was left here by mistake bring it to me said miss jenks tessie took it to her yes some one thought this was the firstform i suppose said miss jenks take it straight in to miss roberts tessieand come straight back tessie took the note and left the room she knocked at the door of miss robertss classroom all was complete silence inside bobbys heart jumped when she heard the knock she looked up eagerly come in said miss roberts impatiently she always hated interruptions to her classwork tessie opened the door and came in excuse me miss roberts she said politely but miss jenks told me to come and give you this this was better than bobby had hoped now it sounded as if miss jenks herself had sent the note miss roberts wouldnt suspect a thing miss roberts took the note nodded to tessie and opened the envelope she read what was inside and frowned it was a nuisance to have to leave her class in the middle of a difficult maths lesson well she would slip along straightaway whilst the form was hard at work and see why she was wanted she put the note back on her desk and stood up go on with your work please she said i shall be away a minute or two no talking of course finish what you are doing and work hard all the girls looked up astonished for they guessed that bobby somehow had been the cause of miss robertss disappearancebut how could she have made miss jenks send in a note to get her away they gaped round at bobby who grinned back in delight how did you do it bobby said janet in a whisper as soon as the door was shut bobby you didnt write that note did you said pat amazed bobby nodded and leapt to her feet she ran quietly to the mantelpiece and opened the glass covering of the big schoolroom clock in a trice she had put the hands on more than ten minutes she shut the glass with a click and returned to her place you really are a monkey said hilary thrilled even pamela was amused only prudence looked disapproving it seems rather a deceitful thing to do she murmured sadie gave her a push aw dont be a ninny she said in her american drawl cant you ever see a joke i wonder what poor miss roberts is doing said janet what did you say in the note bobby how clever of you to leave it in the wrong classroom so that tessie had to bring it in miss roberts is probably waiting all alone in the mistresses common room said bobby with her wide grin i dont know how long shell wait miss roberts was feeling very puzzled she had hurried to the common room belonging to the junior mistresses and had found no one there thinking the others would come in a minute or two she went to the window and waited but still nobody came miss roberts tapped her foot impatiently on the floor she hated leaving her class at any time there were too many mischiefmakers in it that term they couldnt safely be left for two minutes what they would be up to now she couldnt think ill go and see if miss jenks knows what its all about she thought so she went to the second form and was soon questioning a surprised miss jenks about the supposed meeting i dont know anything about it said miss jenks i just sent the note in by tessie because it was left on my desk for you by mistake how funny miss roberts miss roberts very much puzzled went back to her class she took a quick look round but every head was bent and it seemed as if every girl was hard at work too good to be true thought miss roberts disbelievingly half the little monkeys have been playing about and the other half talking its impossible to realize that when they are topformers they will all be thoroughly trustworthy more dignified than the mistresses even and so responsible that we could probably trust the whole running of the school to them who would have thought that winifred james our worthy headgirl was sent out of my class three times in one morning for playing noughts and crosses with her best friend miss roberts was for once too engrossed in her thoughts to look at the clock she began to go round the class to see what work had been done when she came to the last girl she stood up and gave an order time for the oral test shut your books please then she took a glance at the clock and stared in surprise why it was the end of the lesson already how quickly the time had gonebut of course she had had to waste some of it waiting about for nothing in the common room good gracious look at the time she said we cant have the oral test after all put away your books quickly please mamzelle will be here in a moment with grins of delight and secret nudges the girls put away their books quickly miss roberts went out of the room to the fourth form where she was due to give a maths lesson also they were filled with surprise to see her arrive so early oh bobby good for you youve let us off that awful oral test said alison i do think youre a marvel yes you really are said pat it acted like clockwork wonderful oh it was nothing said bobby modestly but secretly very thrilled at the admiration she was getting other girls loved to be praised for their work or their games but bobby revelled in admiration for her jokes and tricks only prudence again disapproved somehow it doesnt seem quite honest she said well go and sneak about it to miss roberts then said bobby at once little miss goodygoody arent you wheres your sense of fun what prudence wants is a few jokes played on her said janet shes just too good to be true lets see if your wings are growing yet prudence she pretended to feel down prudences thin back and the girl squirmed away angrily for janets fingers were sharp the budding angel said janet tell me when you feel your wings sprouting wont you miss roberts was very much puzzled about the note and the fact that she was unexpectedly early for her next class but this time she did not suspect a trick of any sort she simply thought that some mistake had been made and dismissed it from her mind she would never have thought of it again if bobby and janet made bold by the success of the first trick hadnt tried another of the same kindfar too soon janet in trouble the girls were allowed to go down to the town together either out to tea in a teashop to the shops or to the cinema no girl was allowed to go alone unless she was a topformer the younger ones loved to slip off together they went to buy sweets hairribbons or cakes and if there was anything good on at the cinema it was fun to go that week there was a fine film being shown about clive of india and as the first form were then doing the same period with miss lewis in the history lesson they all made up their minds to see it miss lewis encouraged them you should certainly go she said it will make your history lesson come alive for you i will give a special prize to the best criticism written of the film by any first or secondformer it was more difficult for the first form to go that week than for the second form the first form had every afternoon full and four of its evenings were taken up by meetings of some sort or other i shant be able to go until friday sighed janet ive got to clean out the art cupboard for miss walker tonight when most of you others are going oh why did i offer to do it the kindness of my heart runs away with me well its not likely to run very far said bobby so cheer up janet threw a rubber at bobby they were in the common room with the others and there was a terrific noise going on the wireless was on at one end of the room some one had set the gramophone going at the other and sheila and kathleen were arguing at the tops of their voices about something need we have both the wireless and the gramophone on together when nobody is listening to either pleaded pamelas voice im trying so hard to read and remember what im reading and i simply cant well pam you shouldnt be working now said pat looking up from her knitting you should slack off like the rest of us why you were saying history dates in your sleep last night sadie said bobby book me a seat for friday night said janet looking everywhere for her rubber i shall have an awful rush i know unless i can get miss roberts to let me off prep that night she let me off said hilary i went last night and miss roberts was an awful bricklet me off half an hour early so that i could see the picture well ill ask her if shell be a sport and let me off too said janet oh blow where is my rubber why did i throw it at bobby what a waste of a rubber the next day was thursday and that evening the rest of the first form went to the cinema except janet who kept her promise and turned out the untidy art cupboard for miss walker ill ask miss roberts to let me off early tomorrow thought janet as she threw all sorts of peculiar things out of the cupboard on to the floor golly what a collection of things the art classes get i dont believe this cupboard has been turned out for years the next day janet was unlucky she had to do the flowers for the classroom that week and miss roberts discovered that there was very little water in the vases she looked disapprovingly at janet no wonder our flowers look sorry for themselves this week janet she said poking a finger into the nearest vase this bowl is almost empty i do think you should attend to your responsibilities better even the little ones janet flushed usually she was good at remembering small things as well as big but the flowers had just slipped her memory that day she muttered an apology and went to get a jug of water she came into the classroom with it and was just about to pour water into a vase on the windowsill when the school cat jumped in at the window janet was startled she jumped violently and jerked the jug of water a stream flew into the airand landed very neatly on the back of prudences head it dripped down her neck at once and the girl gave a loud squeal miss roberts looked up annoyed whats the matter prudence janet what have you done oh miss roberts janet has soaked me complained prudence she deliberately poured the water down my neck i didnt cried janet the cat sprang in through the window and made me jump thats all miss roberts eyed janet coldly she had seen too much of janets mischief to believe that it was entirely an accident prudence go and dry yourself in the cloakroom she said janet prudence was engaged in writing out that list of geography facts for future reference as she will not be able to finish it now i would be glad if you would take her book and write the facts out for her during prep this evening janet stared in dismay remembering that she had meant to ask for early leave miss roberts it really and truly was an accident she said ill write out what prudence was doing but may i do it in break not in prep you will do it in prep said miss roberts now will you kindly finish playing about with that water and do a little work janet pursed up her lips and took the water out of the room it looked as if she wouldnt be able to see the picture now as she went to the cloakroom to put away the jug she met prudence who had dried herself quickly for she was not really very wet prudence i you know jolly well it was a complete accident said janet stopping her i want to leave prep early tonight to see clive of india i shant be able to unless youre decent and go and tell miss roberts you know it was an accident and ask her to let me off i shant do anything of the sort said prudence you and bobby are always playing silly tricks im not going to get you out of trouble she marched back to the classroom janet stared after her angry and hurt she stuck the jug back into the cupboard and slammed the door shut janet had a hot temper and would willingly have poured a dozen jugs of icycold water all over prudence at that moment when break came she told bobby what had happened and bobby snorted in disgust prudence makes out shes so goodygoody she said and yet she wont do a little thing like that nowlets seeis there any way of getting you off early to the pictures janet in spite of everything no said janet dolefully miss roberts is taking the first and second form together for prep tonight if miss jenks was taking it id take a chance and slip out hoping she wouldnt notice but miss roberts will have her eye on me tonight i wonderi just wonderif i cant get miss roberts out of the room again said bobby her eyes beginning to gleam dont be an ass bobby said janet she cant be taken in twice that wayso soon after too wellwhat about doing it a bit differently said bobby getting you called out for instance oooh said janet and her eyes danced that is an idea yeswe might work it that way but what about that beastly stuff ive got to write out for prudence ill do that for you said bobby i can make my writing like yours in case miss roberts wants to see it all right said janet well nowhow are we going to work it ill ask miss roberts if i can go and fetch a book from the library said bobby and when i come back ill say please miss roberts mamzelle says can janet go to her for some extra coaching and i bet miss roberts will let you go like a lamband you can slip off in time to see the whole of the picture its a bit dangerous said janet but its worth a try hope i shant be caught dontcarebobby grinned nothing venture nothing have she said well ill do my best for you so when the first and second form were all sitting quietly doing their prep that evening bobby put up her hand please miss roberts may i just slip along and get a book from the library be quick then said miss roberts who was busy correcting books and hardly looked up bobby grinned at janet and slipped out of the room she arrived back with a book under her arm and went to miss robertss desk please miss roberts may janet go to mamzelle now for a little extra coaching she said janet went red with excitement well said miss roberts rather astonished mamzelle didnt say anything to me about it when i saw her in the common room i suppose she forgot yes janet you had better goand you can write out those geography facts later on this evening when you are in the first form common room thank you miss roberts murmured janet and scuttled out of the room like a rabbit she rushed to the cloakroom got her hat flew out of the gardendoor went to the bicycle shed and was soon cycling down to the town as fast as she could go how she hoped she would not meet any mistress or topformer who would see that she was alone she slipped into the cinema unseen and was soon lost in the picture whilst the first form went on silently doing their prep for the next day only prudence was suspicious for she had seen the looks that passed between janet and bobby she was even more suspicious when she could not see janet in the common room that night after prep janet is having a very long lesson with mamzelle she said to bobby really said bobby how nice for them both bobby had copied out the geography for prudence trying to make her writing as like janets as possible she laid the book down on prudences desk when the girl was out of the common room for a minute prudence found it there when she came back at first she thought janet had written out the pages and she looked round for her but janet was still not there how strange prudence looked closely at her book she saw that the writing was not really janets and she stared at bobby who was lying in a chair unconcernedly reading her feet swung over the arm this isnt janets writing said prudence to bobby bobby took no notice but went on reading bobby i said this isnt janes writing said prudence annoyed did you really say so said bobby well say it again if you like i dont know if any one is interested im not i believe you and janet made up a plot between you said prudence suddenly i dont believe mamzelle wanted janet at alland i believe you wrote out these pages shut up im reading said bobby prudence felt angry and spiteful so janet had managed to slip off to the cinema after all well she would see that miss roberts knew it anyway i so the next morning when miss roberts asked to see her geography book to make sure that janet had written out what she had been told prudence gave the game away she went up to miss robertss desk with her book and held it out miss roberts gave a quick glance at it and nodded all right she said not noticing anything wrong with the writing bobby has written it out very nicely hasnt she said prudence in a low soft voice miss roberts glanced sharply at the book and then at prudence she knew at once what the girl meant to tell her you can go to your place she said to the girl for she disliked sneaking prudence went pleased that miss roberts had guessed what she meant miss roberts spoke to mamzelle when next she saw her did you by any chance give janet robins any extra coaching last night she asked mamzelle lifted her eyebrows in astonishment i was at the cinema she said and so was janet i saw her why do you ask me such a question i do not give coaching in the evenings thank you said miss roberts and beckoned to a passing girl go and find janet robins and ask her to come to me she said grimly the girl sped off and found janet on the tenniscourt wow said janet when she got the message now im for it the cats out of the bagbut who let her out bobby say goodbye to me for everive got to face miss roberts in a rageand i shant come out alive bobby grinned poor old janet she said good luck to you ill wait for you here old thing janet bobbyand prudence janet went quickly to find miss roberts when there was trouble brewing janet faced up to it at once she didnt run away from it or make excuses she wasnt looking forward to the interview with miss roberts but she thought the sooner it was over the better miss roberts was in the firstform classroom correcting books she looked up as janet came in her face was very cold and stern come over here janet she said janet went to her desk miss roberts finished correcting the book she had before her and then put down her pencil so you didnt go to mamzelle for extra coaching last night she said no miss roberts i didnt said janet i went to see clive of india at the pictures bobby had booked me a seat the night before and who wrote out prudences geography lists then asked miss roberts well miss roberts i didnt said janet after a pause ii cant tell tales i dont want you to tell tales said miss roberts there is nothing that i detest more i merely wanted to make sure you hadnt done the lists yourself i suppose prudence split on me said janet her goodtempered face suddenly flushing well im not telling tales either said miss roberts but it wont be difficult for your own common sense to tell you how i found out about your gross disobedience janet im not going to have you behaving like this you have plenty of character you are plucky just and kind though you have too quick a temper and too rough a tongue sometimesbut you and roberta have got to pull yourselves together and realize that i am not here to play tricks on but to make you work and really learn something especially this term which should be your last one with me i really feel ashamed of you janet went red again she hated being scolded but she knew it was just that she should be she looked miss roberts straight in the face im sorry she said i didnt feel it was fair having to miss going to the cinema when i really didnt mean to spill that water on prudence it was a pure accident if id done it deliberately then i wouldnt have minded being punished you will leave it to me to judge whether or not a punishment is just said miss roberts coldly now as you used a bit of trickery to go down to the town last night i feel you are not to be trusted for some time you will not go down again unless you come to me say why you want to go and get my permission even so i shall not grant any for a week or two you will also do what i told you to do yesterday and write out the geography facts yourselfin prudences book as i said oh need i do it in her book said janet in dismay after all the geography is already written out there once prudence will grin like anything if i go and ask her for her book youve brought it on yourself said miss roberts and just remember this my dear janetthat much as i admire many things in your character there is still plenty of improvement to be madeespecially in your classwork i feel very much inclined to go into the matter of that note i had the other day which resulted in my leaving the maths classit seems to me that that episode and this have a certain likeness that makes me feel very suspicious any more of that kind of thing from either you or roberta will be instantly punished please tell roberta this from me yes miss roberts said janet seeing from miss robertss face that the teacher was in no mood to be generous or softhearted miss roberts hated being tricked and usually prided herself on the fact that her firstformers never did get the best of her she was annoyed to think that her class might be laughing up their sleeves at her you can go she said to janet and reached out for another book to correct janet hesitated she badly wanted to get back into miss robertss good books again but somehow she felt this was no time to try and make amends she must find a chance some other time and bear her punishment as gracefully as she could she left the room and went gloomily back to the tennis court where bobby was anxiously awaiting her bobby slipped her arm in janets was it very bad she asked sympathetically beastly said janet i feel as small as that beetle on the grass down there i cant go down to the town for a week or two and after that ive got to go to miss roberts and beg for permission whenever i want to go its so humiliating and oh bobbyive got to write out those hateful geography lists againin prudences book thats too bad said bobby feeling at once that prudence would crow over janet in delight how did old roberts find out about you theres only one way she could have said janet fiercely that rotten prudence must have split on me ill jolly well tell her what i think of her thats all the twins came up at that moment and heard with sympathy all that had happened to janet i heard that sneak of a prudence say bobby has written it out very nicely hasnt she when she showed miss roberts one of her books this morning said pat i didnt know what she meant of course i just thought she was being nice about bobbys writing i didnt realize it was her horrid way of splitting on poor old janet the beast said bobby her eyes flashing and her cheeks flaming she was very fond of janet ill pay her out all right ill make her squirm the nasty little telltale she always pretends to be so goodygoody too i think shes a hypocrite ill go and get her beastly book for you jan you shant have to go and do that anywayand if she dares to say a single word to me in that soft sneering way she has ill slap her on the cheek no bobby dont do that said janet its never any good to do things like that leave that to our carlotta every one grinned carlotta was a really fierce little monkey when she was in a temper and had actually given alison a hard slap the day before because alison had pointed out that carlottas two hairribbons did not match were very dirty and needed their frayed edges cutting carlotta had listened with a wild expression on her face and had then given alison a resounding slap which had of course made alison dissolve into tears you find fault with me again and i will give you two slaps threatened carlotta carlotta we dont slap each other in this country hilary had said maybe you do in spainbut you cant do it here it just isnt done carlotta made a rude explosive sort of noise pah if i want to slap i slap what right has this silly little peacock to talk about my hairribbons see how she cries the baby she does not even slap me back alison was not even thinking of such a thing she was very hurt and upset especially when sadie greene gave a laugh my alison youre just catsmeat to that little savage cheer up dont you see she wanted to make you howl the twins janet and bobby remembered this episode as they stood on the tennis court listening to bobbys suggestion that she should treat prudence in the same way that carlotta had treated alison they all knew that such things as slapping and pinching were out of the question i but nevertheless each one of them would dearly have loved to give prudence a resounding smack its what she wants said pat with a sigh howeverwell see shes made to feel what a little beast she is somehow she wont get away with this ill go and get the geography book from her said bobby and marched off she sent to the common room thinking that prudence might be there she was like pam always to be found indoors she was sitting doing a jigsaw puzzle bobby went up to her wheres your geography book she said i want it oh have you got to write something else in it said prudence in her clear soft voice poor bobby are you going to do it again for janet what will miss roberts say look at me you nasty little sneak said bobby in such a peculiar threatening voice that prudence was alarmed she raised her eyes and looked at bobby bobby was white with rage and her eyes glinted angrily youre going to be sorry for this said bobby still in the same peculiar voice as if she was talking with her teeth clenched i hate sneaks worse than anything if you dare to tell tales again ill make you very sorry prudence was frightened without a word she got up went to her shelf and fetched her geography book she gave it to bobby with a trembling hand bobby snatched it from her and went out of the room i say said a small voice from the corner of the room i say wasnt bobby in a rage prudence whatever have you done it was from pain boardman curled up with a book as usual she looked through her big glasses her eyes very large ive done nothing said prudence nothing at all i havent sneaked or told any tales but bobby has got her knife into me because i think her tricks are a silly waste of time dont you think they are pam well im not very fond of games or jokes or tricks said pamela ive always liked my work better but some of bobbys jokes and janets do make me laugh still i agree with miss robertsif most of the first form have got to go up next term tricks and things are a silly waste of time youre such a sensible girl pam said prudence going over to her and so brainy i wish youd be my friend i like you and sadie better than any one else in the form pam flushed with pleasure she was a shy girl who found it very difficult to make friends because she could not play games well and found it impossible to think of funny things to say or do as the others did she did not see that prudence wanted to make use of her of course ill be friends she said shyly youve got such brains said prudence admiringly id be so glad if youd help me sometimes i wish that sadie would be friends with you tooit would do her good to think of something besides her hair and skin and nails i like sadie dont you well im a bit afraid of her said pam honestly shes got such grand clothes and she does look so lovely sometimes and she seems so very grownup to me i always feel small and dowdy when she comes along i dont know whether i like her or not prudence tried to forget bobbys unpleasant words to her but it was difficult she wondered what had happened had miss roberts made janet write out those geography things all over again what punishment would she give the girl when her book was returned to her prudence looked with curiosity inside the pages yesthere were the geography lists neatly written for the second timethis time in janets rather sprawly writingand miss roberts had ticked it so she had to do it after all thought prudence good serves her jolly well right now perhaps she and bobby will leave me alone for a bit in case miss roberts gets after them again carlotta is surprising the five new girls shook down at st clares each in their different ways sadie greene sailed through the days taking no notice of anything except the things she was really interested in miss robertss cold remarks passed right over her head mamzelle made no impression on her at all she thought her own thoughts looked after her appearance very carefully and took an interest in alison because the girl was really very pretty and dainty prudence and pam settled down too though prudence was careful not to come up against bobby and janet more than she could help bobby settled in so well that the old firstformers it seemed as if she had belonged to st clares for years carlotta too settled down in some sort of fashion though she was a bit of a mystery to the girls she seems such a common little thing in most ways aid pat overhearing carlotta talking to pam in her curious halfcockney halfforeign voice and shes so untidy and hasnt any manners at all yet shes so natural and truthful and outspoken that i cant help liking her im sure shell come to blows with mamzelle one day i they just cant bear each other mamzelle was not having an easy time with the first form that term the girls who were to go up into the second form were not up to the standard she wanted them to be and she was making them work very hard indeed which they didnt like at all pam was excellent at french though her accent was not too good sadie greene was hopeless she didnt care and she wasnt going to try prudence seemed to try her hardest but didnt do very well bobby was another one who didnt careand as for carlotta she frankly detested poor mamzelle and was as nearly rude to her as she dared to be so mamzelle had a bad time do you wonder we called her mamzelle abominable the first term we were here said pat to bobby she has called you and your work abominable and insupportable about twenty times this morning bobby and as for carlotta she has used up all the awful french names she knows on her but i must say carlotta deserves them when she puts on that fierce scowl and lets her curls drip all over her face and screws up her mouth till her lips are white she looks like a regular little gypsy carlotta was really rather a surprising person sometimes she gave the impression that she was really doing her best to be good and to try hardand then at other times it seemed as if she wasnt in the classroom at all she was away somewhere else dreaming of some other days some other life that would make mamzelle furious carlotta what is there so interesting out of the window today mamzelle would inquire sarcastically ahi see a cow in the distance is she so enthralling to you do you wait to hear her moo no carlotta said in a careless voice im waiting to hear her bark mamzelle then the class would chuckle and wait breathlessly for mamzelles fury to descend on carlottas black head it was in gym that carlotta was really surprising since margery fenworthy had gone up into the second form there had been nobody really good at gym left in the first form carlotta had done the climbing and jumping and running more or less as the others had done though with less effort and with a curious supplenessuntil one day in the third week of the term the girl had been restless all the morning the sun had shone in at the classroom window and a steady wind had been blowing up the hill carlotta could not seem to keep still and paid no attention at all to the lessons miss roberts had really thought the girl must be ill and seriously wondered if she should send her to matron to have her temperature taken carlottas eyes were bright and her cheeks were flushed carlotta what is the matter with you this morning said miss roberts you havent finished a single sum what are you dreaming about horses said carlotta at once my own horse terry its a day for galloping far away well i think differently said miss roberts i think its a day for turning your attention to some of the work you leave undone carlotta pay attention to what i say fortunately for carlotta the bell went for break at that moment and the class was free to dismiss after break it was gym carlotta worked off some of her restlessness in the playgrounds but still had plenty left by the time the bell went for classes again miss wilton the sports mistress was gym mistress also she had to call carlotta to order several times because the girl would climb and jump out of her turn or do more than she was told to do carlotta sulked her eyes glowing angrily it is such silly baby stuff we do she said dont be stupid said miss wilton you do most advanced things considering you are the lowest form i suppose you think you could do all kinds of amazing things that nobody else could possibly do carlotta yes of course i could said carlotta and to the astonishment of the entire class the darkeyed girl suddenly threw herself over and over and performed a series of the most graceful cartwheels that could be imagined round and round the gym she went throwing herself over and over first on her hands then on her feet as easily as any clown in a circus the girls gasped to see her miss wilton was most astonished that will do carlotta she said you are certainly extremely good at cartwheelsbetter than any girl i have known watch me climb the ropes as they should be climbed said carlotta rather beside herself now that she saw the plain admiration and amazement in the eyes of every one around and before miss wilton could say yes or no the little monkey had swung herself up a rope to the very top then she turned herself completely upside down there and hung downwards by her knees to miss wiltons complete horror carlotta come down at once what you are doing is extremely dangerous ordered miss wilton terrified that the girl would fall and break her neck you are just showing off come down at once carlotta slid down like lightning turned a double somersault went round the gym on hands and feet again and then leapt lightly upright her eyes shone and her cheeks were blazing it was plain that she had enjoyed it all thoroughly the girls gazed openmouthed they thought carlotta was marvellous and every one of them wished that she could do as carlotta had done miss wilton was just as surprised as the girls she stared at carlotta and hardly knew what to say shall i show you something else said carlotta breathlessly shall i show you how i can walk upside down watch me thats enough carlotta said miss wilton in a firm voice its time the others did something you certainly are very supple and very cleverbut i think on the whole it would be best if you did the same as the others and didnt break out into these queer performances the gym class went on its usual way but the girls could hardly keep their eyes off carlotta hoping she would do something else extraordinary but the girl seemed to sink into her dreams again and scarcely looked at any one else after the class was over the girls pressed round her carlotta show us what you can do walk on your hands upsidedown but carlotta wasnt in the mood for anything more she pushed her way through the admiring girls and suddenly looked rather depressed i said i wouldntand i have she muttered to herself and disappeared into the passage the girls looked at one another did you hear what she said said pat i wonder what she meant wasnt she marvellous it seemed to have done carlotta good she was much better in her next classes after her curious performance in the gym quieter and happier she lost her scowl and was not at all rude to mamzelle in french conversation the girls begged her to perform again when the gym was empty but she wouldnt no she said no dont ask me to carlotta wherever did you learn all that asked isabel curiously you did all those things just as well as any clown or acrobat in a circus the way you shinned up that rope we always thought margery fenworthy was marvellousbut youre far better perhaps carlotta has relations who belong to a circus said prudence maliciously she didnt like the admiration and attention suddenly given to the girl and she was jealous she thought carlotta was common and she wanted to hurt her shut up prudence said bobby sometimes you make me think how lovely it would be to spank you hard with a hairbrush prudence flushed angrily the other girls grinned they liked seeing prudence taken down a peg or two come on to the tenniscourt said pat to bobby seeing that a quarrel was about to begin weve got to practise our serving miss wilton said let me serve twenty balls to you and you serve back to me next month there are going to be matches against st christophers and oakdene and jolly well want to be in the team from the first form well ill come and let you practise on me said bobby with a last glare at prudence but its not a bit of good me hoping to be in any tennis team come on lets leave old sourmilk behind how prudence hated that name but whenever she made one of her unkind remarks some one was sure to whisper sourmilk prudence would look round quickly but every one would look most innocent as if they hadnt said a single word prudence hated bobby because she had begun the nickname but she was afraid of her she would dearly have loved to give bobby a clever unkind name toobut she couldnt think of one and in any case bobby was bobby to the whole school even the mistresses presently ceased calling her roberta and gave her her nickname much to prudences anger bobby was one of the most popular girls in the form prudence makes a discovery two or three quite exciting things happened during the next week or two and all of them had to do with carlotta the first happened at the swimmingpool carlotta was no swimmer but she adored diving and jumping she was excellent on the springboard too that jutted out over the water most of the girls could run lightly along the board and dive off the end of it but carlotta could do far more than that she could run along it leap high into the air turn two or three somersaults and land in the water with her body curled up into a ballsplash she could stand at the end of the board bounce herself up and down till the board almost touched the water and then with one last enormous bounce send herself like a stone from a catapult into the air turning over and diving in beautifully as she came down she jumped or dived from the topmost diving platform and she came down the waterchute in every possible position even standing which was a quite impossible feat for any other girl her swimming was always peculiar but for acrobatic feats in the water no one could possibly beat carlotta she didnt show off she did all these things perfectly naturally and with the utmost enjoyment prudence who was a bad swimmer and disliked the water never joined in the general praise and admiration that the other girls gave to carlotta shes just showing off prudence said in a loud scornful voice as carlotta did a beautiful somersault into the water near her prudence herself was shivering at the top of the steps not yet having gone in the water was cold that morning and courage was not prudences strong point alison was beside her also shivering shes not showing off said janet who overheard what prudence said its just natural to her to do all those things youre jealous my dear prue what about going down another step and getting your knees wet youve been shivering there for the last five minutes prudence took no notice of janet carlotta climbed up to the topmost diving platform and did a graceful swallow dive that made even miss wilton clap in admiration there she goes showing off again said prudence talking to alison why people encourage her i cant imagine shes conceited enough as it is thats just the one thing carlotta isnt said bobby hold that horrid tongue of yours prudence its difficult to believe you were brought up in a vicarage when we hear you talk like that well its quite plain our dear carlotta was not brought up in any vicarage said prudence spitefully carlotta overheard this and grinned she never seemed to mind remarks of this sort though it made the others angry for her when prudence said them bobby pursed up her mouth and looked at prudences white shivering back with distaste what about a dip dear prue she said suddenly and gave the girl a violent push into the pool went the surprised prue with a loud squeal she came up angry and spluttering she looked round for bobby but bobby had dived in immediately behind her and was now under the water groping for prudences legs i in half a second prudence felt somebody getting tight hold of the calf of her left leg and puffing her under the water i down she went with another agonized squeal and disappeared below the surface gasping and spluttering she came up again almost bursting for breath but no sooner had she got her wind again than once more bobby caught hold of her leg and pulled her under prudence struggled away and made for the side of the pool at once calling to miss wilton miss wilton oh miss wilton bobby is almost drowning me miss wilton call bobby out miss wilton looked round in surprise at the yells from prudence bobby by this time had got to the other end of the pool and was almost dying of laughter what do you mean saying that bobby is drowning you said miss wilton impatiently bobbys right at the other end of the pool dont be an idiot prudence pull yourself together and try to do a little swimming you seem to spend most of your time standing on the steps like a scared threeyearold there were a few titters from the girls nearby prudence was so angry that she fell back into the water and swallowed about two pints all at once ill pay you out for that she called to bobby but bobby merely waved her hand and grinned perhaps youll keep your tongue off carlotta a bit if you think youre going to have bobby after you for it remarked janet who was nearby enjoying the fun prudence unburdened her mind to pamela boardman as they walked back to the school building that afternoon its so bad for that common little carlotta to have us all staring at her openmouthed and thinking shes wonderful said prudence i dont see why people like carlotta should be allowed to come to a goodclass school like this do you pam i mean its not fair on girls like us is it who come of good families and have been well brought up why carlotta might have a very bad influence on us indeed perhaps her parents think that we might have a good influence on carlotta suggested pam in her soft voice she is queer agreebut shes quite fun prudence i dont think the things she does are really clever said prudence spitefully i dont think shes fun either i think theres a decided mystery about our carlottaand id dearly like to know what it is pam was younger than prudence and although she was a clever girl at her work she was very easily influenced by prudence soon she was agreeing to all that the older girl said and even when prudence said things that were plainly untrue and unkind about others pam listened to her respectfully and nodded her head it was pam and prudence who discovered carlotta doing something extraordinary not long after the episode at the swimmingpool the two of them were going for a nature walk together taking with them their notebooks and their nature specimen cases they set off over the hill and went across the fields that lay behind the school the country swept upwards again after a little and big fields lay behind high hedges it was a beautiful day for a walk and pam who seldom went out was quite enjoying herself prudence would not have gone out at all for a walk if she hadnt seen carlotta making off by herself the girls were not allowed to go out alone unless they were top formers and two or three times prudence bad suspected that carlotta was disobeying the rules today she had seen carlotta slipping off through the school grounds to the little gate that was set in the garden wall a good way behind the school prudence had been in the dormitory and her sharp eyes picked out the girl at once i wonder what she does when she goes off alone thought prudence spitefully where does she go i bet shes got some common town friends that nobody knows anything about id like to follow her and find out prudence was cunning she knew it would be no good to go to pam boardman and suggest spying on carlotta because pain though having a great respect for prudence shied away from anything underhand so prudence ran downstairs and found pam curled up as usual reading hallo pam she cried lets go out for a naturewalk the fields look lovely behind the school this afternoon do come with me it will do you good pam was goodnatured she shut up her book and went to get her hat and notebook the two girls set off down through the grounds they went out of the gate and then across the fieldpaths prudence kept a sharp lookout for carlotta and soon caught sight of the figure in the school blazer a good way off going up the hill opposite i wonder who that is she said carelessly to pam well keep her in sight and perhaps join up with her on our way home we cant do that said pam shes alone so it must be one of the topformers she wouldnt want to walk home with us oh i forgot that said prudence well we may as well go the same way as she does she probably knows the right paths so the two girls kept carlotta in sight the girl made her way over the top of the hill and then down into the next valley here there was a big camp for a circus had come to the next town in a vast field many caravans and cages were arranged and in the centre an enormous tent towered up there must be a circus at trenton said prudence but carlotta cant be going to it because the show wont be on now how do you know its carlotta said pam in surprise it cant be shes not allowed out by herself however can you tell who it is so far away prudence was annoyed with herself she hadnt meant to let pam know she knew it was carlotta oh ive got wonderful eyesight she said you have to wear glasses so probably your eyes dont see as far as mine but im pretty sure its carlotta isnt that just like herslipping out and breaking the rules yes it is rather like her said pam who however could not help rather admiring the fiery little girl for her complete disregard of rules and regulations when she wanted to do something very badly carlotta always went straight for a thing riding over objections and obstacles as if they were not there they followed carlotta to the big field they saw her speak to an untidyhaired roughlooking groom he smiled at carlotta and nodded the girl left him and went into the next field where there were some beautiful circus horses in half a minute the girl had caught one leapt on to its back and was galloping round the field riding beautifully although it was bareback pam and prudence stared in the utmost surprise whatever prudence had imagined carlotta might be going to do she certainly hadnt thought of this i she could hardly believe her eyes the two girls watched carlotta on the beautiful horse which first galloped swiftly round the field and then fell to a canter the man she had spoken to came to watch her he called out something to her and pointed to another horse this was more the carthorse type broadbacked and staid carlotta called something back to the man she leapt off her horse and ran to the one he had pointed out to her in a trice she was up on its back calling to it it began to run round the field and then carlotta did something that made the two hidden girls gape even more she stood up on the horses back and keeping her balance perfectly made the horse trot round and round as if it were in a circus ring prudences mouth shut in a straight line i always thought there was something queer about carlotta she said to pam now we know what it is im sure shes nothing but a jumpedup circusgirl how could miss theobald have her here its wicked i whatever will the others say dont lets sneak prudence begged pam timidly please dont this is carlottas secret not ours wed better say nothing well well bide our time said prudence in a spiteful voice well just bide our time come onwed better get back before she sees us watching so the two girls made their way back to the school mostly in silence prudence was gloating because she had discovered something so peculiar about carlottaand pam was puzzled and worried fearful that prudence would give away carlottas secret and drag her pain into the unpleasantness too they arrived back at school just in time for tea pat and isabel saw them going indoors and called to them in surprise i say you dont mean to say you two have actually been for a naturewalk i thought neither of you could be dragged out of doors we had a lovely walk said prudence and we saw some very interesting things what have you brought back pain asked hilary seeing that pam had her naturespecimen case slung over her shoulder pam flushed she had nothing and neither had prudence it seemed as if the whole walk had been nothing but following carlotta spying on her and then thinking about her all the way back prudence certainly hadnt spoken a word about nature and pam hadnt liked to ask her to stop when she saw anything that she herself was interested in prudence saw that pam was uncomfortable because they had brought nothing back for the natureclass so she lied glibly weve heaps of things she said well keep them till after tea were hungry nowand theres the teabell prudence knew that no one would be interested enough to ask to see any naturespecimens after tea she pushed pam in the direction of the cloakroom so that they might wash their hands pam was silent as she washed she was a truthful person herself and it puzzled her when prudence told fibs for the girl was always condemning others who did wrongand yet here she was lying quite cheerfully perhaps it was because she didnt want to say wed seen carlotta said pam to herself she was just shielding her carlotta arrived late for tea she muttered an apology to miss roberts and sat down she was red with running and although she had brushed her unruly dark curls she looked untidy and hot wherever have you been carlotta said pat i looked all over the place for you this afternoon it was your turn to play tennis didnt you know i forgot said carlotta taking a piece of bread and butter i went out for a walk who with said janet by myself said carlotta honestly lowering her voice so that miss roberts could not hear i know its breaking the rulesbut i couldnt help it i wanted to be by myself youll get caught one of these days you monkey said bobby i break a good few of the rules myself at timesbut you seem to act as if there werent any at all you be careful carlotta but carlotta only grinned she had a secret which she meant to keep to herself she didnt know that somebody else found it out an uproar in mamzelles class the next thing that happened was an uproar in mamzelles french class the term was getting on and many of the firstformers seemed to have made no progress in french at all the weather was very hot just then and most of the girls felt it and were disinclined to work hard girls like pam boardman and hilary wentworth both of whom had brains a steady outlook on their work and a determination to get on worked just as well as ever but the twins slacked and as for sadie and bobby they were the despair of all the teachers but it was carlotta who roused mamzelles anger the most when carlotta disliked any one she did not hide it neither did she hide her liking for any girl or teachershe would do anything for a person she liked the twins and janet and bobby found her generous and kind willing to do anything to help them but she thoroughly disliked alison sadie prudence and one or two others carlottas idea of showing her dislike for any one was childish she would make faces turn her back even slap she would stamp her foot call rude names and often lapse into some foreign language letting it flow out in an angry stream from her crimson lips the girls rather enjoyed all this though hilary as head of the form often took the girl to task carlotta you let yourself down when you act like this she said after a scene in which carlotta had called alison and sadie a string of extraordinary names you let your parents down too we are all more or less what our parents have made us you know and we want them to be proud of us dont let your people down carlotta turned away with a toss of her head i dont let my parents down she said theyve let me down i wouldnt stay here if i hadnt made a promise to some one do you suppose i would ever choose to be in a place where i had to see people like alison and sadie and prudence every day pah the girl almost spat in her rage she was trembling and hilary hardly knew what else to say we cant like every one she said at last you do like some of us carlotta and we like you but cant you see that you only make things worse for yourself when you act like this when you live in a community together you have to behave as the others do im head of the form and i just cant let you go around behaving like a fouryearold after all you are fifteen carlottas rage vanished as suddenly as it had appeared she genuinely liked the steady responsible hilary she put out her hand to her i know youre right hilary she said but i havent been brought up in the same way as you havei havent learnt the same things dont dislike me because im different idiot i said hilary giving her a clap on the shoulder we like you because you are so different youre a most exciting person to have in the form but dont play into the hands of people like prudence who will run to miss roberts if you bring out some of your rude names if you really want to let off steam let it off on people like me or bobby who wont mind thats just it said carlotta i cant go for you youre too decent to me hilary ill try to be calmer i really will im getting on a bit better with miss roberts nowbut mamzelle always drives me into a rage ill have to be extra careful in her class it was bobby who really began the great uproar in mamzelles class one morning bobby was bored she hated french verbs which had an irritating way of having different endings in their past tenses just as if it was done on purpose to muddle us thought bobby with irritation and i never can remember when to use this stupid subjunctive ugh nearby bobby was a vivarium kept by the first formers it was a big cagelike structure with a glass front that could be slipped up and down in it lived a couple of large frogs and a clumsy toad with them lived six large snails the firstformers regarded these creatures with varying ideas kathleen who loved animals was really attached to the frogs and toad and vowed she could tell the difference between the six snails which she had named after some of the dwarfs in the story of snowwhite the rest of the form could only recognize dopey who never seemed to move and who had a white mark on the spiral of his shell the twins liked the frogs and toad and isabel often tickled the frog down his back with a straw because she liked to see him put his front foot round with its funny little fingers and scratch himself some of the class were merely interested in the creatures the rest loathed them sadie and alison couldnt bear them and prudence shuddered every time she saw the frogs or toad move doris disliked them intensely too bobby neither liked nor disliked them but she had no fear of the harmless creatures as prudence and the others seemed to have and she handled them fearlessly when their vivarium needed to be cleaned or rearranged on this morning bobby was bored the french class seemed to have been going on for hours and seemed likely to continue for hours too though actually it was only a lesson lasting threequarters of an hour a movement in the vivarium caught the girls eye one of the frogs had flicked out its tongue at a fly that had ventured in through the perforated zinc window at the back bobby took a quick look at mamzelle she was writing french sentences on the blackboard quite engrossed in her task the girls were supposed to be reading a page of french ready to translate it when she was ready bobby nudged janet janet looked up watch me whispered bobby with a grin bobby slid the glass front of the vivarium to the back and put in her hand she took one of the surprised frogs out and then shut the glass lid lets set him hopping off to prudence whispered bobby itll give her an awful fright no one else had noticed bobbys performance mamzelle was irritable that morning and the class were feverishly reading over their page of french anxious not to annoy her more than they could help bobby reached over to set the frog on prudences desk but the poor creature leapt violently out of her hands on to the floor near carlotta the girl caught the movement and turned she saw the frog on the floor and bobby nodding and pointing to show her that it was meant for the unsuspicious prudence carlotta grinned she had been just as bored as bobby in the french class and the page of french had meant nothing to her at all she hardly understood one word of it she picked up the frog and deposited it neatly on the edge of prudences desk the girl sat next to her so it was easy prudence looked up saw the frog and gave such a scream that the whole class jumped in fright mamzelle dropped her chalk and the book she was holding and turned round with an angry glare prudence what is this noise the frog liked prudences desk it hopped over her book and sat in the middle of it staring with unwinking brown eyes at the horrified girl she screamed loudly again and seemed quite unable to move she was really terrified the frog took a leap into the air and landed on prudences shoulder it slipped down to her lap and she leapt up in horror shaking it off mamzelle its the frog ugh i cant bear it i cant bear it i oh you beast carlotta you took it out of the vivarium on purpose to give me a fright how i hate you cried prudence quite beside herself with rage and fright most of the class were laughing by now for prudences horror was funny to watch mamzelle began to lose her temper the frog leapt once more and prudence screamed again taisezvous prudence cried mamzelle be silent this class is a garden of bears and monkeys i will not have it it is abominable more giggles greeted this outburst prudence turned on carlotta again and spoke to her with great malice in her voice you hateful creature nothing but a nasty little circusgirl with circusgirl ideas oh you think i dont know things about you but i do i saw you take the frog out of the vivarium to make him leap on me i saw you taisezvous prudence almost shouted mamzelle rapping on her desk carlotta leave the room you will go straight to miss theobald and report what you have done that such things should happen in my class it is not to be believed carlotta did not hear a word mamzelle said she had sprung up from her seat and was glaring at prudence her eyes were flashing and she looked very wild and very beautiful like a beautiful gypsy isabel thought she began to speakbut not one of the girls could understand a word for carlotta spoke in spanish the words came pouring out like a torrent and carlotta stamped her foot and shook her fist in prudences face prudence shrank back afraid mamzelle furious at being entirely disregarded by carlotta advanced on her with a heavy tread the whole class watched the scene breathless there bad been one or two big rows as they were called in the first form at times but nothing to equal this mamzelle took carlotta firmly by the arm vous кtes insupportable she said separating the syllables of the word to make it even more emphatic carlotta shook off mamzelles hand in a fury she could not bear to be touched when she was in a rage she turned on the astonished french mistress and addressed her in a flow of violent spanish some of which mamzelle unfortunately understood the mistress went pale with anger and with difficulty prevented herself from giving carlotta a box on the ears in the middle of this the door opened and miss roberts came in it was time for the lesson to end but every one had been far too engrossed in the scene to think of the time miss roberts had been surprised to find the classroom door shut as usually it was held open for her coming by one of the class she was even more astonished to walk in and see mamzelle and carlotta apparently about to have a free fight mamzelle recovered herself a little when she saw miss roberts ah miss roberts she said her voice quite weak with all the emotion she had felt during the last few minutes you come in good time i this class of yours is shockingyes most shocking and wicked that girl carlotta she has defied me she has called me names she hasoh la la there is the frog again every one had forgotten the frogbut it now made a most unexpected appearance again and leapt on to mamzelles large foot mamzelle had no liking for frogs all insects and small creatures filled her with horror she gave a squeal and stumbled backwards falling heavily on to a chair miss roberts had taken everything in at a glance her face was extremely stern she looked at mamzelle she knew mamzelle s hot temper and she felt that the best thing to do was to get the angry french mistress out of the class before making any inquiries herself mamzelle your next class is waiting for you she said in her clear cool tones i will look into this matter for you and report to you at dinnertime you had better go now and leave me to deal with everything mamzelle could never bear to be late for any class she got up at once and left the room giving carlotta one look of fury before she went miss roberts nodded to hilary to shut the door and then went to her own desk there was a dead silence in the room for there was not a girl there who did not dread miss roberts when she was in this kind of mood carlotta was still standing her hair rumpled over her forehead her fists clenched miss roberts glanced at her she knew carlottas fiery nature by now and felt that it was of no use at all to attack her in that mood she spoke to her firmly and coldly carlotta please go and do your hair wash your inky hands too the girl stared at her teacher halfmutinous but the direct order calmed her and she obeyed it she left the room and there was a sigh of relief carlotta was excitingbut this time she had been a little too exciting now please understand that i am not encouraging any talebearing said miss roberts looking round her class with cold blue eyes but i am going to insist on finding out what this extraordinary scene is about perhaps you hilary as head of the class can tell me miss roberts let me tell you began prudence eager to get her word in before any one else carlotta opened the vivarium and took out the frog and i dont want any information from you until i ask for it prudence said miss roberts in such a cutting tone that the girl sank back into her seat flushing now hilarytell me as shortly as you can well apparently some one took a frog out of the vivarium and put it on prudences desk said hilary reluctantly bobby got up red in the face excuse me interrupting miss roberts she said i took the frog out it was that beast carlotta who played the trick on me exclaimed prudence youre shielding her prudence youll leave the room if you speak again said miss roberts go on bobby i was bored said bobby honestly i took out the frog to make it jump on to prudence for a bit of fun because shes scared of frogs but it leapt out of my hand on to the floorand so i nodded to carlotta to pick it up and put it on the deskand she did but i was the one to blame bobby sat down now you go on with this extraordinary tale hilary said miss roberts wondering if her class could really be in its right senses that morning well miss roberts there isnt much else to tell except that prudence got an awful fright and screamed and mamzelle was angry and prudence blamed it all on to carlotta and said some pretty horrid things to her and carlotta flared up as she doesand when mamzelle ordered her from the room she wouldnt goi really think she didnt even hear mamzelle then mamzelle was furious because carlotta didnt obey her and went over to herand carlotta turned on her and said something in spanish that made mamzelle even more furious and then you came in finished hilary and spoilt your fun i suppose said miss roberts in the sarcastic voice that the class hated a very entertaining french lesson i must say you appear to have begun it all bobbycarlotta certainly had a hand in itand the rest of the tale appears to be composed of bad tempers on the part of several people i imagine that every one was simply delighted and watched with bated breath im disgusted and ashamed bobby come to me at the end of the morning yes miss roberts said bobby dismally prudence looked round at bobby with a pleased expression delighted that the girl had a punishment coming to her miss roberts caught sight of the look she could not bear prudences meanness nor her habit of talebearing and gloating over others misfortunes she snapped at her so suddenly that prudence jumped prudence you are not without blame either if you can make trouble for others you invariably do if you had not made such a stupid fuss none of this would have happened prudence was deeply hurt oh miss roberts she said in an injured tone thats not fair really i since when have i allowed you to tell me what is fair and what is not inquired miss roberts hold your tongue and sit down and while i think of it your last essay was so bad that i cannot pass it you will do it again this evening prudence flushed she knew that miss roberts definitely meant to be unkind at that moment and she felt that all the girls except perhaps pam silently approved of miss robertss sharp tongue and were pleased at her tickingoff her thoughts turned to carlotta and she brooded with bitterness over the fiery girl and what she had said miss roberts had said nothing about punishing that beast carlotta surely she wasnt going to let her go scotfree think of the things she had said to mamzelle carlotta was queer and badsee how she broke the rules of the school and went off riding other peoples horses the class was in a subdued mood for the rest of that morning bobby went to miss roberts and received such a scolding that she almost burst into tearsa thing that bobby had not done for years she also received a punishment that kept her busy for a whole weeka punishment consisting of writing out and learning all the things that miss roberts unaccountably appeared to think that bobby didnt know it is safe to say that at the end of that week bobby knew a good deal more than at the beginning carlotta appeared to receive no punishment at all which caused prudence much anger and annoyance actually as pat and isabel knew carlotta had been sent to the head miss theobald and had come out of that dread drawingroom in tears looking very subdued and unlike herself she told no one what had passed there and nobody dared to inquire mamzelle received a written apology from bobby and from carlottaand much to prudences anger one from prudence herself too miss roberts had demanded it and would not listen to any objections on prudences part so the girl had not dared to disobey but bad written out her apology too ill pay carlotta out for this she thought ill go and find that man she was talking to and ask him all about that horrid beast of a carlotta i im sure theres something funny about that carlottas secret the first chance that prudence had of going for a walk over to the circuscamp was two days later she sought out pam and asked her to go with her oh prudence i did so badly want to finish reading this book said pam who was in the middle of a historical novel dealing with the classs period of history it was quite a joke with the first form that pam never read any book unless it had to do with some of the classwork pam do come begged prudence slipping her hand under pams arm pam had had very little affection shown to her in her life and she was always easily moved by any gesture on prudences part she got up at once her shortsighted eyes beaming behind their big glasses she put away her book and got her hat the two girls set off going the same way as before in half an hours time they reached the camp why weve come the same way that we came last week said pam yes said prudence pretending to be astonished too and lookthe circus camp is still thereand those lovely horses are still in the field lets go down to the camp and see if we can see any elephants or exciting things like that pam wasnt at all sure that she wanted to find elephants for she was nervous of animals but she obediently followed prudence they went into the field where the caravans and cages were arranged no one took any notice of them after a while prudences sharp eyes found the untidyhaired man that she had seen carlotta talking to she went up to him does it matter us looking round the camp a bit she asked with her sweetest smile no you go where you like missy said the man are those the circushorses in that field over there asked prudence pointing to the field where she had seen carlotta riding they are said the man and he went on polishing the harness that lay across his knees i wish we could ride them like carlotta said prudence gazing at the horses with an innocent expression the man looked at her sharply ay shes a fine rider he said fine girl altogether i say have you known her long then said prudence still looking very innocent indeed since she was a baby said the man shes had an awfully interesting life hasnt she said prudence pretending that she knew far more than she did i love to hear all her stories pam stared at prudence openmouthed this was news to her she wondered uncomfortably if prudence was telling one of her fibsbut why should she do that oh shes told you about her life has she said the man looking rather surprised i thought she wasnt he stopped short prudence felt excited she really was discovering something now she looked at the untidy man her eyes wide open with a most honest expression in them no one could beat prudence at looking innocent when she wasnt yes im her best friend said prudence she told me to come over here and look round the camp she said you wouldnt mind pam was now quite certain that prudence was telling dreadful untruths in great discomfort the girl went off to look at a nearby caravan she felt that she could not listen any more she could not imagine what prudence was acting like this for she had so little spite in her own nature that it did not occur to her to think that prudence was trying to find out something that might damage carlotta prudence was pleased to see pam go off now she could get on more quickly i she felt certain somehow that carlotta really had been connected with circus life in some way so she took the plunge and asked the man the question i expect carlotta loved circuslife didnt she the man apparently saw nothing queer about the question he plainly thought that carlotta had told prudence a great deal about herself he nodded his head she oughtnt to have left it he said my brother who was in the same show as carlotta was said it would break her heart that girl knew how to handle horses better than a man i was glad to let her have a gallop when she came over here the other day we move tomorrowso you tell her when you get back that if she wants another gallop shell have to come along pretty early tomorrow morning like she did two weeks ago prudence was almost trembling with excitement she had found out all she wanted to know that nasty little carlotta was a circusgirla horrid common lowdown little circusgirl how dare miss theobald accept a girl like that for her school did she really expect girls like prudence daughter of a good family to mix with circus girls she called pam and the two set off to go back to the school both were silent pam was still feeling very uncomfortable about prudences untruths to the man in the campand prudence was thinking how clever she had been she did not realize that it was not real cleverness only shameful cunning she wondered how she could get the news round among the girls should she drop a hint here and there if she could get hold of that foolish alison she would soon bleat it out everywhere she went to find alison that evening in the common room the girl was sitting doing a complicated jigsaw she loved jigsaws although she was very bad at them and usually ended in losing half the pieces on the floor it was an interesting jigsaw four or five girls came to see how alison was getting on bobby picked up a piece doesnt that go there she said and tried it then hilary picked up another piece and in trying to make it fit pushed the halffinished picture crooked oh cried alison exasperated if theres one thing i hate more than anything else its having people help me with a jigsaw puzzle first its bobby then its hilary then its somebody else i could finish it much more quickly if only people didnt help me ive never seen you finish a jigsaw puzzle yet alison said pat teasingly why dont you do it properly said doris who however poor she was at lessons was astonishingly quick at jigsaws you always begin by putting little bits together here and there what you should do is to begin with the outside pieces you see theyve got a straight edge and i know all that said alison impatiently but sadie says immediately the chorus was taken up in the greatest delight by the girls around sadie saysoh sadie sayssadie sadie sadie says the girls at the back of the room took up the chorus too and sadie goodnaturedly lifted her pretty head dont you mind them alison she said but alison did she never could take teasing well she muddled up her halfmade jigsaw in peevishness piled it into its box dropped two or three pieces on the floor and went out of the room prudence followed her thinking she might drop a few words into alisons ear alison she called what a shame to tease you like that come out into the garden with me its a lovely evening no thanks said alison halfrudely for she did not like prudence im not in the mood to hear nasty things about half the girls in the form prudence flushed it was true that she lost no chance of telling tales about the girls trying to spread mischief among thembut she had not realized that the girls themselves knew it it was plainly no use trying to get alison to listen to tales about carlotta ill have to think of some other way said prudence to herself but she did not have to thinkfor the whole thing came out that same evening far more quickly than prudence had ever expected she went back into the common room carlotta was there laughing as she told some joke in her halfforeign voice which was rather fascinating to listen to the girls were grouped around her and prudence felt a sharp twinge of jealousy as she saw them her face was so sour as she looked at carlotta that bobby laughed loudly here comes old sourmilk she said and every one giggled sourmilk said carlotta that is a very good name why have you gone sour prudence prudence was suddenly full of spite its enough to make any one go sour when they have to live with a low down circusgirl like you she said her tone so full of hate that the girls glanced at her in astonishment carlotta laughed id like to see you in a circus she said cheerfully the tigers would like you for their dinner and i dont believe any one would miss you be careful carlotta said prudence i know all about you allaboutyou how interesting said carlotta though her eyes began to gleam dangerously yesvery interesting said prudence the girls would soon despise you if they knew what i know you wouldnt have any friends then no one would want to knowa common little circusgirl shut up prudence said bobby afraid that carlotta might lose her temper dont tell silly lies its not silly lies said prudence its the truth the whole truth theres a circuscamp over near trenton and i talked to a man thereand he told me carlotta was a circusgirl and knew how to handle horses and was nothing but a common little girl from a circus belonging to his brother and we have to put up with living with a girl like her there was a complete silence when prudence had finished carlotta looked all round the girls with flashing eyes they stared at her then pat spoke carlottadid you really live in a circus prudence watched every one pleased with her bombshell now carlotta would see what decent wellbrought up girls would say to her she prudence would have a fine revenge she waited impatiently for the downfall of the fiery little carlotta at pats question carlotta looked towards the twins she nodded her head yes she said i was a circusgirl and i loved it the girls looked in amazement and delight at carlotta her eyes were glowing and her cheeks were red they could all imagine her quite well riding in a circusring they pressed round her eagerly carlotta how marvellous i say carlotta how simply wonderful carlotta you simply must tell us all about it i always knew there was something unusual about you oh carlotta to think you never told us why didnt you you wretch welli promised miss theobald i wouldnt said carlotta you seeits a funny story reallymy father married a circusgirland she ran away from him taking me with her when i was a baby she died soon after and i was brought up by the circusfolk they were grand to me she stopped remembering many things go on said kathleen impatiently do go on welli loved horses just as my mother did said carlotta so i naturally rode in the ring well not long ago my father whod been trying to find me and my mother for years suddenly discovered that mother was dead and i was in a circus father is a rich manand he made me leave the circus and when he found how little id had he thought he would send me to school oh carlottahow awfully romantic said alison its like a book i always thought you looked unusual carlotta but why are you so foreign my mother was spanish said carlotta and some of folk in the circus were spanish too though many of them came from half europe they were grand people i wish i could go back to them i dont fit in here i dont belong i dont think like you do our ideas are differentand ill never never learn she looked so woebegone that the girls wanted to comfort her dont you worry carlotta youll soon fit inbetter than ever now we know all about you why didnt miss theobald want us to know youd been a circusgirl well i suppose she thought maybe you might look down on me a bit said carlotta the girls snorted look down on you were thrilled carlotta show some of the things you can do i promised miss theobald i wouldnt do any of my tricks said carlotta in case i gave the show away i broke my promise the other day in the gymbut somehow i simply couldnt help it id been thinking and dreaming of all the old circusdaysand of my darling beautiful horse terryand i just went mad and did all those things in the gym i can do much more than i showed you then carlotta walk on your hands upsidedown begged bobby golly what fun youre going to be youre a fierce creature with your flyaway tempers and ready tonguebut youre natural and kind and we shall all like you even better now we understand the kind of life youve lived before its a wonder youve fitted in as well as you did what a mercy you were honest about itwe wouldnt have admired you nearly so much if youd been afraid to own up afraid to own upwhy im proud of it said carlotta with sparkling eyes why should i be ashamed of knowing how to handle horses why should i be ashamed of living with simple people who have the kindest hearts in the world the girl threw herself lightly over and stood on her hands her skirt fell over her shoulders as she began to walk solemnly round the room on her strong supple little hands the girls crowded round her laughing and admiring my wordthe second form will be jealous when they hear about carlotta said bobby they certainly will said sadie who was just as full of astonishment and admiration as any one else it all seemed most surprising and unreal every one was pleased and thrilledsave for one girl that girl of course was prudence she could not understand the attitude of the girls it was completely opposite to what she had expected it was hard to believe prudence stood in silence listening to the squeals of delight and admiration her heart was very bitter within her the bombshell she had thrown had certainly explodedbut the only person it had harmed had been the thrower instead of making the girls despise carlotta and avoid her she had only succeeded in making them admire her and crowd round her in delight now carlotta would show off even moreshe would get more friends than ever how could every one like a nasty common little girl like that who even at times dropped her hs no one took any notice of prudence for one thing they were so excited about carlottaand for another thing they despised her for her mean attempt to injure another girl for something she couldnt help bobby elbowed her a little roughly and prudence almost burst into tears of rage and defeat she slipped out of the room it was more than she could bear to see carlotta walking on her hands cheered on by the rest of the firstformers the last words she heard were lets get the secondformers in where are they in the gym do lets go and tell them to come and see carlotta shes marvellous i meant my news to hurt herand its only brought her good luck and friendship thought prudence bitterly whatever shall i do about it bobby gets a shock carlotta was a very popular person after this upheaval her complete honesty and frankness had disarmed every one and to most of the girls she suddenly appeared as a most surprising and romantic person even the secondformers were thrilled though as a rule they professed rather to turn up their noses at anything that happened in the first form but tessie queenie and the rest of the second form were just as persistent as the lower form in begging carlotta to show off her circus tricks and accomplishments it must have been a bit of a shock to that sneak of a prudence to find that instead of looking down on our carlotta we looked up to her and admired her instead said pat i bet dear darling prudence thought wed be shocked to the back teeth to hear she was a circusgirl i vote we punish her by not taking a scrap of notice of her and not listening to anything she says i think we ought to do the same to pam then said bobby pams prudences friend you know and she was with her when they spied on carlotta shes a silly little creature and thinks the world of prudence it will do her good to feel that we dont approve of prudences ways and dont particularly want to be pleasant to prudences friends well im rather sorry for pam said isabel shes a nervous little thing and awfully hardworking dont lets be too hard on her prudence didnt at all like the treatment meted out to her by the firstformers the girl was very fond of the sound of her own voice and it was most annoying to her to find that whenever she began to air her views about anything all the girls around either suddenly disappeared or else began to talk nonsense to one another at the tops of their voices prudence would perhaps address herself to hilary and say hilary what side are you taking in tonights debate on should women rule the world im taking the side that they certainly should after all dont we then hilary would suddenly address janet in a very loud voice and say something perfectly ridiculous such as i say janet old thing how many legs has a kitten and janet perfectly solemn would answer in a loud voice well usually four but youd better count and see prudence would stare in astonishment and then begin again what i say is if women ruled the world then kathleen would chime in cutting right across prudences rather affected little voice hilary janet do you suppose a worm really grows into two worms when its cut in half then bobby would cut in rather cruelly what about cutting dear prudence in two then well see and so it went on nobody ever paying any attention to prudence at all prudence was hurt and angry and went to pam for comfort she squeezed out a few tears and pam tried to comfort her pam you know quite well i wasnt spying on carlotta wept prudence cant you tell the girls i wasnt do stick up for me whats the good of being my friend if you dont and then poor pam trying her hardest to be loyal would stick up for prudence although in her heart of hearts she no longer really trusted or liked her but the thirteenyearold girl was easily swayed and any one in tears moved her heart so it came about that very soon the firstformers began to ignore poor pam too and laughed at her efforts to stick up for prudence pam retired into her shell and felt very unhappy she worried about the whole thing and turned to her work more than ever to help her to forget the many unpleasantnesses that seemed to be cropping up in those weeks now that her secret was out carlotta was very happy hers was an honest nature and she had not liked keeping everything to herself now the whole school knew what she was and eyed her with wonder halfexpecting her to do something extraordinary at any time the twins took her under their wing and they and carlotta bobby and janet were continually about together carlotta had gone to miss theobald and had told her that every one now knew she had once been a circusgirl but they dont seem to mind said carlotta looking straight at the head mistress with her fearless eyes you thought they would didnt you no carlotta i didnt think that most of them would mind at all said miss theobald but i thought it might be easier for you to settle down if the girls did not regard you as anything out of the ordinary also your father begged me to keep your secret as he called it wellits out nowand you must just show me that it doesnt matter you are all your father has you know so try and get used to the kind of life you will have to lead with him later on carlotta sighed she didnt want to lead any other kind of life except the one she had always knownthe life of the circuscamp always on the move always visiting new places always making new friends she left miss theobalds drawingroom looking rather subdued after a while the excitement caused by the row in mamzelles class and by carlottas secret died down a little this was partly because matches were looming aheadtennis and swimmingmatchesand the school was putting in a good deal of practice hoping to win all the matches against other schools the twins were practising hard and bobby was helping them dontcare bobby would not do anything much to help herself on but never minded how much time she gave to help any one else to become better at anything janet and hilary were both practising too but were not so good as the twins youre getting a grand style at tennis both of you said belinda towers approvingly as she watched the twins one afternoon if you go on like this youll be chosen for the first form team against st christophers bobby youre getting better too why dont you try a bit harder and see if you cant be the reserve girl two out of each form were chosen to play against two girls from each form of the opposing school and for each two there was a reserve girl in case one of the two fell ill or could not play for any other reason bobby shook her head when she heard belinda say this no thanks she said it makes tennis too much like hard work if i have to practise up for reserve girl belinda was not amused by this answer she gave bobby a look that rather surprised her because it held a certain amount of scorn in it oh well said belinda of course we cant expect dontcare bobby to care enough for the school or to have enough pride in her form to do anything that might seem like hard work foolish of me to suggest it she walked away and the three stared after her whats bitten her this afternoon said bobby surprised the twins looked at her uncomfortably well bobby i suppose it must seem to the top girls that you do just what you like and dont bother about working or playing as hard as you might said pat at last mind you im not blaming you not one biti think youre grand as you arebut the topformers have other ideas about things you know how good and proper they get as they go up the school maybe one day youll be good and proper toothough i jolly well hope you wont dont worry i shant said bobby shortly she hadnt at all liked what belinda had said she wondered if she ought to put in a bit of hard practice at tennis herself just to please belinda but she was obstinate and didnt though she went on helping the twins all she could standing at the other end of the court for a long time whilst they served ball after ball across the net trying to improve their style sadie alison pam prudence and carlotta made no pretence at all of trying to better their tennis they either played because they had to or because there wasnt anything better to do at the moment not one of the five with the exception of carlotta visited the swimming pool except on the days when it was compulsory to do so these days came three times a week and how prudence and sadie groaned when they had to go down to the pool and undress themselves shivering in the little wooden cubicles that ran alongside the water carlotta was quite mad in the water for although she could not swim well or fast she performed all sorts of antics there and her diving was lovely to watch miss wilton hardly knew what to make of her youll never make a swimmer carlotta she said but i shouldnt be surprised if you take all the prizes for your tricks that was a lovely swallowdive you did just now but please dont come down the chute standing up any more its dangerous and also do try not to jump into the water from the top of the diving platform just when prudence is underneath you scare her terribly oh miss wilton i wouldnt scare prudence for worlds said carlotta in her queer little upanddown voice and a wicked look in her eyes and the very next moment she ran along the marble floor pretended to slip and landed with an enormous splash in the water right on top of the unfortunate prudence no one ever knew what carlotta would do next the twins hoped against hope that they would be chosen to play against st christophers it would be such fun to play together wont mummy be pleased if she hears weve both been chosen said pat i wish bobby could be our reserve girl and come with us but i bet janet or hilary will be chosen the match was to be the following week and three girls from each of the three lower forms were to go to st christophers school for the matches against girls from similar forms there belinda promised to put up the names of the girls on the board the night before before belinda put up the names she sent for bobby bobby went to belindas study in surprise the big girl was there neatly writing out some sports lists halo bobby she said nodding her head towards a chair sit down for a minute ive nearly finished bobby sat down and studied belindas clearcut profile she liked belinda very much and knew how hard she worked at being sports captain she wondered what belinda was going to say to her the sports captain looked up and set down her pen look here bobby she said i just want to know something youre pretty good at tennis and id halfthought of making you reserve girl for your form but i want to know if youve been thinking about it too and working for it no i havent said bobby going red i told you that that would be too much like hard work belinda anyway reserve girls never play in the matchesthey only watchand i dont want to watch if i was going to do anything id want to play not watch youre very disappointing said belinda youve got such good stuff in you bobbybut you wont seem to make the best of it i believe if youd practised as hard as the twins id not have known who to choose for the two matchplayers you put yourself out to let pat and isabel practise all they like on youbut yet you wont try to make yourself good too dontcare bobby is a good name for youbut you wont get far if you dont begin to care about things i dont want to get far said bobby her obstinacy rising ive told you belindaid like to play in the matchbut i m not keen on watchingso choose janet or hilary for reserve girl i dont care very well said belinda coldly i shall choose one of the others i was hoping you would be able to tell me you really had done a bit of hard practising on your own accountthen i would certainly have chosen you for reserve girlbut seeing that you dont seem to care either way i shall choose somebody else you can go bobby went out of the room red of cheek and rather ashamed of herself she was a queer mixture she had plenty of brains plenty of high spirits plenty of kindlinessbut she seemed to have an incurable dislike of working hard at anything and if any one tried to make her she became very obstinate and immovable belinda felt really impatient with her the sports captain made out the list of three girls chosen for the tennis match next day and went to pin it on the noticeboard a crowd came round her immediately pat isabel youre the two girls yelled doris at the top of her voice whos reserve girl take your fat head out of the way prudence the reserve girl was janet she was delighted she turned to bobby i thought it would be you she said youre much better than i am really i cant think why belinda chose me instead of you bobby bobby knew quite well but she said nothing she was cross because she couldnt help feeling ashamed of herself im jolly glad its you old girl she said to janet reserve girls never playwe all know thatbut youll have some fun anyway three tennis matches and an accident the next day dawned warm and sunnyjust right for a tennis match there was a little breeze but not enough to worry the players the match was to start at three oclock the nine girls chosenthree from each of the three lower formswere to go with belinda and miss wilton in a small private bus that the school often used pat and isabel were in a great state of excitement they had not played for their school before and were proud and pleased isnt it lovely that were to play together said pat joyfully it would have been horrid if one of us had been chosen and not the other janet was almost as excited as they were because although she was only reserve girl and hadnt a chance in a hundred of really playing still it was great fun to go off in the bus to another school she and the other two reserve girls would be able to sit with belinda towers and miss wilton and talk with them whilst the game was on good luck said every one when the little bus drew up to the school door and the tennis players went to get in good luck mind you win all the matches well give you three hearty cheers when you come back if you do good luck bobby felt a little envious as she saw the happy faces of the twins and janet smiling in the bus she knew she herself might have been in that bus if she had really wanted to i but nobody guessed her thoughts for she shouted good luck and waved as wildly as the rest it was fun to go driving through the countryside to st christophers like that the girls fingered the strings of their rackets and looked at them anxiously to make sure they were all tight and good their tennis shoes shone as white as snow their white frocks were spotless they all hoped they would make a good showing in the matches against the opposing school they arrived at the school and were met by the sports captain there a tall graceful girl in white and by the girls who were to play against them they all went to the sports ground chattering hard our courts badly want a little rain said a st christophers girl the service lines are getting very worn weve hard courts as well as grass ones but we thought wed use the grass ones today because they are so much softer to the feetand also theres more room round our grass courts for the school to watch we want every one to see us giving you st clare girls a beating you beat us last year so its our turn this year margery fenworthy was one of the secondformers chosen and she was eager to begin she was wonderful at all games and had been practising hard in order to perfect her tennis style her friend lucy oriell had been chosen as her partner and both girls were delighted lucy was inclined to work far too hard and margery had made her take as much recreation as possibleand now here was lucy her dark curls dancing round her face happy at having a whole afternoon away from her scholarship work jane rickson and winnie hill were the thirdformers chosen all six st clare players changed into their tennis shoes and took off their cardigans we thought as you are nice and early we would play all three matches separately instead of at the same time said the st christophers sports captain the thirdformers could play first are you ready will you toss for sides please smooth or rough jane rickson and winnie hill won the toss and chose the side the match was to be the best of three sets the players took their places jane was serving she threw the ball high into the airand the match began it was really exciting to watch the two sets of partners were very evenly matched and the games were very close practically all of them ran up to deuce the first set was won by st clares sevenfive the second one was won by st christophers sixfour and now for the third set said pat excitedly gosh arent jane and winnie playing well belinda do you think theyll win i rather think they will said belinda smiling at pats eager face the other two seem to me to be getting a little tired belinda was right the st christopher girls were not now so fresh as the st clare two all the same the last set was very close and very exciting and went to five all then janet won her serve straight off six five play up jane and winnie yelled the twins play up and they played up they skipped about the court they hit every ball they smashed the gentle balls and killed the hard onesand lo and behold st clares had won the first match two sets to one i match to st clares two sets to one called the umpire good game everybody st christophers cheered the winners the girls shook hands across the net and then went to drink long drinks of sweet lemonade with bits of ice bobbing at the top how good it tasted golly that was a good match panted jane stretching her long tired body out over the grass look there go the next lot play up margery play up lucy belinda i dont think theres any doubt about this match do you i think margery and lucy will just wipe the floor with the st christopher girls i shall be very surprised indeed if our two dont win i must say said belinda im jolly pleased you two managed to pull it off there wasnt much in it you knowbut you and winnie managed to keep a bit fresher it was fine to see you skipping about like that in the last game well done there was never any doubt at all about the result of the second match lucy and margery had it all their own way the two girls opposing them were very good indeedbut margery played a marvellous game she and lucy made perfect partners never leaving any part of the court unprotected margery won all her serves outright summer term at st clares golly shes good said belinda isnt she good misswilton marvellous said the st clares sports mistress and how happy she looks too quito different from the sulky margery we had to deal with last term the twins remembered what a sullen badtempered girl margery fenworthy had been the term before and then how her whole outlook had been changed when she had become a heroine in one night through rescuing another girl in a fire at the san now here was that same margery winning honours for her school as proud of st clares as st clares was proud of her the match was over in two sets match to st clares called the umpire won outright in two sets sixone sixlove now its our turn said pat to isabel in great excitement as she watched the secondform girls shaking hands across the net come on isabel weve just got to win play a steady game twins said belinda you ought to win you play almost as well together as margery and lucy my word how terribly proud st clares would be of us if we went back tonight having won all three matches we simply must the twins leapt to their feet and ran on to the tennis court rackets in hand call for sides cried the st clare girl and twisted her racket rough called pat and rough it was pat chose the side and the four took up their places belinda was pleased to see how steady the twins were they had practised continually together and were almost as good partners to one another as margery and lucy they won the first three games lost one and won another and then a dreadful thing happened pat was serving the ball came back to the lefthand side of isabel and swerved away unexpectedly the girl swung herself round to hit it twisted her ankle and fell over crashing quite heavily to the ground she immediately tried to get up but her foot gave way beneath her and she fell again with a surprised cry of pain pat rushed over to her anxiously isabel whats happened oh dont say youve twisted your ankle ill be all right in a minute said isabel her face rather pale for her foot hurt her very much just wait a minute till the pain goes off but the pain didnt go off and it was not long before the ankle swelled up tremendously youve strained it said miss wilton twisted it badly im afraid poor old isabelwhat bad luck ill have to take you off the court and get janet to take your place and so it came about that for once the reserve girl did play but alas for poor janetthe sight of isabel looking so woebegone and pale quite upset her and made her thoroughly nervous she felt that at any costs she and pat must winbut somehow she couldnt play as well as she hoped for one thing she hadnt practised a great deal with either of the twins and hadnt learnt how to play a good partnership game she would keep rushing to pats court leaving her own unguarded so that her opponent found it easy to place a ball where janet could not get it and when pat went up to the net janet forgot to run to the backline so that balls went over her head and she could not get them they lost the first set foursixand alas they lost the second foursix also they were very sad and disappointed cheer up said belinda as they came off the court you both look like sourmilk prudence it couldnt be helped youd have won if isabel had been able to play with you said janet to pat and i believe youd have won if bobby had been the reserve girl and not me bobby hasnt any nerves at allshe would just have stepped right into isabels place and played magnificently she always comes up to scratch when she has to and shes practised with you so often that she knows your game better than i do shed have made a much better partner belinda dont you think so well said belinda honestly i agree that bobby knows pats game better than you dobut all the same im not sure shed have won the match but pat and isabel janet and the others were sure they talked about it as they ate a good tea and discussed it in the bus on the way home the st clare girls were delighted to hear that the third and second form had won their matches and were sorry over poor isabels fall her ankle had now gone down a little and was feeling very much better it will be all right in a day or two said matron when she examined it bad luck isabel just the wrong time to have a fall in the middle of a most important match isabel smiled wanly she had been most bitterly disappointed about the whole thing especially when she had seen pat lose the match to the st clare girls she poured out her disappointment to bobby bobby i believe pat would have won if only belinda had chosen you for reserve girl instead of janet she said janet did her bestbut she isnt as used to pats game as you are oh why didnt belinda choose you i do think that was a great mistake on her part if youd played in the match pat and you would have won it and then st clares would have won all three bobby listened in silence she knew quite well why belinda hadnt chosen her she had been silly and obstinate she had let st clares down she felt sure she wouldnt have been so nervous as janet and she did know pats style of game very well indeed she was so silent that isabel was astonished whats up bobby she said you look awfully glum you dont mind as much as all that about the match being lost do you yes i do said bobby it wasnt belindas fault that janet was chosen instead of me belinda did give me the chanceand i didnt take it dont blame belinda blame me you heard what belinda said to me on the courts the other daywell i was sore and angry about it and i just got all obstinate and thought miss roberts caught one or two of the winks and pounced on the winkers what is the joke hilary she asked coldly there isnt a joke miss roberts answered hilary opening her eyes wide as if astonished well there had better not be said miss roberts go on with your geography map please mamzelle gave her french lesson alter break the girls went to their room quickly when break was over giggling in delight prudence could not think why pam was not in the secret either but she did not notice the chuckles of the girls pam was getting very much wrapped up in her own thoughts these days hilary was left outside the twins popped their heads out of the door and doubled themselves up with laughter when they saw hilary on hands and knees looking under a tall cupboard there calling kitty kitty kitty shi here comes mamzelle suddenly cried pat to the class she darted back to her seat leaving isabel to hold the door for mamzelle hilary was still outside of course mamzelle came hurrying along on her big feet every one always knew when mamzelle came because she wore big flatheeled shoes like a mans and made a loud clipclap noise down the corridors mamzelle was most surprised to see hilary crawling about outside the classroom she stopped and stared hilary ma petite que faitesvous she cried what are you doing there have you lost something kitty kitty kitty called hilary mamzelle you havent seen one of the school cats kittens by any chance have you im looking and looking for the poor little lost thing mamzelle looked up and down the passage no i have seen no little cat she said hilary you must come to your class now it is good of you to seek for the tiny cat but it is not to be found oh mamzelle just let me look a little longer begged hilary it might be in this cupboard i thought i heard a sound she opened the cupboard the girls in the classroom hearing the sound of conversation outside wondered how hilary was getting on isabel peeped out to see have you found the poor little kitten hilary she called oh mamzelle isnt it a shame it will be so frightened mamzelle marched into the classroom and put her books down on her desk the little cat will be found somewhere she said go to your places hilary for the last time i tell you to stop looking for the tiny cat and come to your french class oh mamzelle said bobby as hilary came in and shut the door do you think it has climbed up a chimney or something like that i once knew a cat that got up our chimney at home and arrived on the top of a chimneypot and mamzelle we had a kitten once that began doris quick to follow up and waste a few more minutes of the class but mamzelle was not having any more fairytales about cats she rapped on her desk and doris stopped her tale assez said mamzelle beginning to frown that is quite enough hilary will you sit down you surely do not imagine that the kitten is anywhere here well mamzelle it might be said hilary looking all round you know my brother once had a cat that any more tales about cats and the whole class will write me out two pages in french on the habits of the cat family threatened mamzelle at this threat every one remained silent mamzelle had a horrid way of carrying out her curious threats get out your grammar books said mamzelle open at page eightyseven today we will devote the whole time to irregular verbs doris you will begin doris gave a groan she stood up to recite the verbs she had learnt poor doris no matter how much time she gave to her french preparation every bit of it invariably went out of her head when she looked at mamzelles expectant face she began in a halting voice doris again you have not prepared your work properly said mamzelle irritably you will do it again pat stand up i hope you will give a better performance than doris you at least know how to roll your rs in the french way rrrrrr the class giggled mamzelle always sounded exactly as if she were growling like a dog when she rolled her rrrrs in her throat mamzelle rapped on her desk silence pat begin but before pat could begin bobby pressed the trickbiscuit slowly and carefully between finger and thumb a piteous squeak sounded somewhere in the room every one looked up the kitten said pat stopping her recital of verbs the kitten even mamzelle listened the squeak had been so very much like a kitten in trouble bobby waited until pat had begun her verbs again and then she once more pressed the biscuit eeeeeeeeeeee squeaked the biscuit exactly like a cat pat stopped again and looked all round the room mamzelle was puzzled where is the poor little creature said kathleen oh mamzellewhere can it be mamzelle im pretty certain it must be up the chimney said hilary jumping up as if she was going to see asseyezvous hilary rapped out mamzelle you have looked enough for the little cat pat continue pat began again bobby let her recite her verbs until she made a mistakeand then before mamzelle could pounce on her mistake bobby pressed the biscuit once more a loud wail interrupted the recital of verbs a babel of voices arose mamzelle the cat must be in the room mamzelle do lets look for the poor little thing mamzelle perhaps its hurt bobby made the biscuit wail again mamzelle rapped on her desk in despair sit still please i will see if the little cat is up the chimney she left her desk and went to the fireplace she bent down and tried to look up the chimney bobby pressed the biscuit softly and made a very small mew come mamzelle halfthought it came from up the chimneyplace she got a ruler and felt about there a shower of soot came down and mamzelle jumped back her hand covered with soot the class began to giggle mamzelle perhaps the cats in the cupboard suggested janet do let me look im sure its there mamzelle was glad to leave the chimney she gazed in dismay at her sooty hand hilary open the cupboard she said at last hilary leapt to open it of course there was no animal there at all but hilary rummaged violently over the shelves sending books and handwork material on the floor hilary is it necessary to do this cried mamzelle beginning to lose her temper again i begin to disbelieve in this cat but i warn you if it is a trick i will punish you all with a terrible punishment i go now to wash my hands you will all learn the verbs on page eightyeight while i am gone you will not talk you are bad children mamzelle disappeared out of the room holding her sooty hand before her when the door shut a gale of laughter burst out bobby squeaked the biscuit for all she was worth prudence stared in surprise at it as no one had let her into the secret she really had believed in the tale of the lost kitten she looked at bobby with a sour face so bobby had once more got away with a trick how prudence wished she could give her away to mamzelle well wasnt that fine said bobby putting the biscuit into her pocket half the lesson gone and hardly any one has had to say their verbs good old biscuit you can tell your brother it was a success janet when mamzelle came back she was in one of her black tempers she had felt sure as she washed her hands that there had been some trick about the lost kitten but she could not for the life of her imagine what it was she washed her hands grimly and stalked back to the first form determined to get her own back somehow she chose prudence to say her verbs next prudence stood up she was bad at french and she faltered over her verbs trying in vain to get them right prrrrrudence you are even more stupid than dorrrris cried mamzelle rolling her rs in her fiercest manner ah this firstform you have learnt nothing this term nothing i say ahhhhhh tomorrow i will give you a test a test to see what you have learnt prudence do not stare at me like a duck that is dying i you and doris are bad girls you will not work for me if you do not get more than halfmarks tomorrow i shall go and complain to miss theobald ah this first form the girls listened in horror a french test of all the things they hated a french test was the worst the girls always felt certain that mamzelle chose questions that hardly anyone could possibly answer prudence sat down hating mamzelle she knew she would do badly in the test she had cribbed most of her written work from pambut in a test she would have to rely on her own knowledgeunless she could copy pams answers the girl sat and brooded if it hadnt been for bobbys trick mamzelle wouldnt have lost her temper and suggested a beastly horrible test how prudence wished she could find some way to get out of it if only she couldor better still if only she could know what the test questions were to be so that she might look up the answers first prudence is a cheat the more prudence thought about the french test the angrier she felt with bobby i suppose she thinks those silly tricks of hers are clever thought prudence to herself and now look what theyve led toa horrible french test that i know i shall fail hopelessly in then i shall get into a frightful row and perhaps be sent down to miss theobald she went to find pam to talk to her about it she felt sure pam would be in the library hunting for some learned book or other to read on the way there she passed the open door of the mistresses common room prudence glanced in mamzelle was there alone she was writing out what looked like a list of questions prudence felt certain they were the questions for the test how she longed to have a look at them she stood at the door uncertainly trying to think of some excuse to go in mamzelle saw her shadow there and glanced up ah prudence she said in rather a fierce voice ah tomorrow you will have this french test yes i will show you firstformers what hard work really means prudence made up her mind quickly she would go into the common room and tell mamzelle about the trick and perhaps she would be able to get a peep at the questions on mamzelles desk so in she went looking the picture of wideeyed innocence and goodness mamzelle im awfully sorry we played about so much in your class she began it was all that silly trick you knowthe squeaking biscuit mamzelle stared at prudence as if the girl had suddenly gone mad the squeaking biscuit said mamzelle in the greatest astonishment what is this nonsense you are saying mamzelle it isnt nonsense said prudence you see bobby had a trick biscuit that squeaked like a cat when it was pressed prudence was doing her best to get a look at the french questions as she spoke apparently mamzelle had finished making them out there were about twelve questions prudence managed to read the first one mamzelle listened to what prudence was saying and at once knew two thingsthe true explanation of the lost kittenand that prudence was what the english girls called sneaking mamzelle had been in england a long time and had learnt to regard sneaking with dislike although when she had first arrived she had listened to talebearers and thought nothing of it but through long years of being with english mistresses she had come to the conclusion that they were right about sneaks on no account must they be encouraged so mamzelles face suddenly changed and became hard and cold as prudence went on speaking and bobby thought it would be a good idea if we wasted some of your lesson by pretending that a kitten was lost she went on then she stopped as she saw mamzelles face prudence you are a nasty little girl said mamzelle yesa very nasty little girl i do not like you it may seem surprising to youbut i would rather have a silly trick played on me than listen to some one who sneaks about it i go away at once i do not like you at all prudence felt her face flame red she was angry and hurtand she hadnt been able to read more than one test question after all mamzelle took tip the paper and slipped it inside her desk taking no more notice of prudence the girl went out of the room ready to burst into angry tears well i know where the questions are anyway she thought fiercely ive a good mind to slip out of bed at night and have a look at them nobody would know and id have a good chance of being top then and giving every one a surprise id love to see their faces if i got top marks the more she thought about it the more determined she became i will get those questions somehow she decided i dont care what happensi will she wondered if mamzelle would punish bobby for the trick she had played but to her surprise not a word was said about it that day though mamzelle took prep and even had bobby up to her desk to explain something to her i wonder she doesnt send bobby to miss theobald thought the girl spitefully mamzelles sense of humour had come to her rescue after prudence had left the common room that morning she had felt angry with bobby first of alland then when she thought of herself poking up the chimney to find a kitten that wasnt there she had begun to laugh that was one very good thing about mamzelleshe really did have a sense of humour and when she thought something was funny she could laugh at it wholeheartedly and forget her annoyance so her anger against the first formers melted awaythough she was determined to give them the test all the same she could not however resist giving bobby a little shock when the girl came up to her desk at prep mamzelle made a remark that caused bobby to feel most uncomfortable do you like biscuits bobby she asked her large brown eyes looking at bobby through their glasses ereryes mamzelle said bobby wondering what was coming next i thought so said mamzelle and then turned to bobbys french book bobby did not dare to ask her what she meant but she felt certain that mamzelle had found out about her trick who could have told her prudence of course i nasty little sneak i bobby waited for mamzelle to say something more and it was with great relief that she found mamzelle speaking about her french mistakes now you may go to your place said mamzelle she gave bobby a sharp look you may like to know that i do not like biscuits as much as you do ma chere bobby no mamzelleer i mean yes mamzelle said poor bobby and escaped to her seat as quickly as she could if mamzelle does know what i did and isnt going to punish me its jolly decent of her thought the girl ill work really hard in her classes if shes as decent as all that that night when all the girls in her dormitory were asleep prudence sat up in bed she listened to the steady breathing of the sleepers around her and then slipped out of bed it was very warm and she did not put on her dressinggown or slippers she crept out of the room in her bare feet and went down the stairs to the mistresses common room it was in complete darkness prudence had brought a torch with her and she switched it on to see where mamzelles desk was goodthere it was just in front of her now i can just go all through the test questions and look up the answers thought prudence gleefully its lucky nobody waked up and saw me leaving the dormitory but somebody had seen her leaving the dormitory that somebody was carlotta who always slept very lightly indeed waking at the least sound she had heard the click of the door being opened and had sat up at once she dimly saw a figure vanishing through the doorway and wondered who it was perhaps it was some one from the next dormitory she decided to go and see sometimes a girl from another dormitory was dared to slip into some one elses room at night and play some kind of joke carlotta slipped out of bed she went to the dormitory where bobby pam doris and others slept she popped her head inside all was quietbut one girl was awake it was bobby she saw the door opening and the dim light from the passage came into the room showing up the figure at the door whos there whispered bobby me said carlotta i saw somebody slipping out of our dormitory and i thought it might be some one from yours playing a joke well were all here said bobby looking down the line of beds are you sure it wasnt somebody out of your own room never thought of that whispered back carlotta ill go and see she went and found that prudences bed was empty she slipped back again to bobby and went to her bed prudence is gone she whispered what do you think shes doing i bet shes up to some mischief dont you well lets go and see said bobby and slid quietly out of bed together the two made their way down the passage and then down the stairs they stood and listened at the bottom wondering where prudence was theres a light coming from the mistresses common room whispered carlotta perhaps she is in there what can she be doing im not sure i quite like spying like this said bobby a little uncomfortably but carlotta had no doubts of that sort she went quietly on bare feet to the halfopen door of the common room she looked inand there she saw prudence carefully reading the list of french test questions a french grammar book beside her she was looking up the answers one by one both girls knew at once what she was doing bobby had very strict ideas of honour and she was really horrified and shocked carlotta was not shocked because she had seen manyodd things in her lifealso she knew prudence well and was not at all surprised to find her cheating in such an outrageous way bobby went into the room at once and prudence was so startled that she dropped the grammar book on the floor she stared at bobby and carlotta with horror what are you doing said bobby so angry that she forgot to whisper cheating no im not said prudence making up her mind to brazen it out i just came to look something up in the french grammar book ready for the test tomorrow so there carlotta darted to the desk and picked up the list of questions see bobby she cried she is cheating here are the test questions bobby looked at prudence with the utmost scorn what a hypocrite you are prudence i she said you go about pretending to be so good and religious and properand yet you sneak and cheat whenever you get a chance you look down on carlotta because she was a circusgirlbut i tell you we look down on you because you are all the things people hate worse than any other in school or in lifeyou are cunning deceitful untruthfuland an outanout cheat these were terrible things to hear prudence burst out sobbing and put her head down on the desk a pile of books upset and fell with thuds to the floor nobody noticed the noise they made for all three girls were too wrapped up in what was happening it so happened that miss theobalds bedroom was just below the mistresses common room she heard the succession of thuds and wondered what the noise could be she thought she heard the sound of voices too she switched on her light and looked at her watch it was a quarterpast two whoever could be up at that time of night miss theobald put on her dressinggown tied the girdle firmly round her waist put on her slippers and left the room she went upstairs to the corridor that led to the mistresses common room she arrived at the door just in time to hear the end of bobbys scornful speech she paused in the greatest astonishment whatever could be happening miss theobald deals with three girls girls said miss theobald in her clear low voice girls what are you doing here there was a petrified silence as all three girls saw the head mistress standing at the door a cold chill came over prudences heart and bobby had the shock of her life only carlotta seemed undisturbed well said miss theobald going into the room and shutting the door i really think some explanation of this scene is needed roberta surely you can explain yes i can blurted out bobby surely you can guess what carlotta and i discovered prudence doing miss theobald she is cheating said carlotta in her little foreignsounding voice she is looking at the french test questions and finding the answers miss theobald so that she will be top tomorrow but it is nothing surprising prudence is like that prudence broke out into loud sobbing again i wasnt i wasnt she wailed carlotta only says that because i found out she was nothing but a circusgirl i hate her i hate bobby toobut carlotta is the worst of the lot always showing off and bragging about her circuslife carlotta laughed i am glad you hate me prudence she said i would not care to be liked by you you are worse than any one i have ever met in circuscamps much worse be quiet carlotta said miss theobald she was very worried this was a dreadful thing to happen go back to bed all of you i will deal with this in the morning is prudence in the same dormitory as you two no shes in mine but not in bobbys said carlotta wellgo back all of you said miss theobald if i hear another sound tonight i shall treat the matter even more seriously tomorrow she watched the three girls go back to their dormitories and then went to her own room wondering how to deal with things in the best way had she done right in letting carlotta the little circusgirl come to st clares she might have known that the secret wouldnt be kept and now there was prudence arnold to deal withmiss theobald could not like the girl any more than any one else did and robertawhat should she say to her she had had bad reports of her work from every one the three girls went back to their beds carlotta fell asleep again at once she rarely worried about anything and she did not feel any cause to be upset bobby lay and thought for a long time she disliked and despised prudencebut she did not want the girl to get into serious trouble because of her prudence was the most upset of the three it was a very serious matter to be caught cheating she had always set herself up to be such a modelso honest and straight and had always condemned underhand mean or silly tricks now every one would know she was not what she seemed and it was all because of that hateful interfering bobby and carlotta she felt a great surge of bitterness against carlotta who had so calmly told miss theobald what the two girls had found her doing prudence did not realize that practically every girl had seen through her silly pretences and had set her down as a smug hypocrite and sneak next day the three girls were called into miss theobalds room one by one first carlotta who told miss theobald again quite calmly and straightforwardly what they had found prudence doing and also added a few remarks of her own about prudence she looks down on me because i was a circusgirl said carlotta but miss theobald no circus would keep a person like prudence for more than a week i think she is a dangerous girl miss theobald said nothing to this but in her heart she agreed with carlotta prudence was dangerous she would do no good to st clares and privately miss theobald doubted if st clares would do much good for prudence she prided herself on the knowledge that it was very few girls indeed that st clares would not benefit but it seemed to her as if prudence was one of those few she was the only child of doting indulging parents who believed that prudence was all she seemed poor prudence i what a pity her father and mother hadnt been sensible with her and punished her when she did wrong instead of getting upset and begging her to do better miss theobald had bobby in next bobby did not want to say much about prudence and she was surprised to find that miss theobald looked at her coldly and did not give her even a small smile when she came in it is an unpleasant thing to find any one in the act of cheating said miss theobald looking straight at bobby i expect you hate the idea of cheating almost worse than anything else roberta yes miss theobald said bobby who was an honest and truthful girl in spite of all the tricks she played i think cheating is horrible id just hate myself if i cheated like prudence then miss theobald said a surprising thing it is odd to me roberta she said that you who seem to have such strict ideas about cheating should be such a cheat yourself bobby stared at miss theobald as if she couldnt believe her ears what did you say miss theobald she asked at last i think i didnt hear it correctly yes you did roberta said miss theobald i said that it was odd that you should be a cheat when you hold such strict ideas about cheating im not a cheat said bobby her cheeks crimson and her eyes beginning to sparkle with anger and surprise ive never cheated in my life i dont know about all your life said the head mistress but i do know about the last two months of it roberta why have your parents sent you here to have a good time and nothing but a good time why are they paying high fees for you in order to let you slack and play tricks the whole time you are cheating robertayes cheating badly you are cheating your parents who are willing to pay for you to learn what we can teach you hereand you wont learn you are cheating the school for you have good brains and could do well for st claresbut you wont try and last of all you are cheating yourselfdepriving yourself of all the benefits that hard work well done can bring you and you are weakening your character instead of making it strong and fine because you will not accept duty and responsibility you just want to go your own way do as little work as you can and make yourself popular by being amusing and thinking out ingenious jokes and tricks to entertain your form i think in your own way you are just as much a cheat as prudence is bobbys face went white no one had ever said anything like this to her before she had always been popular with girls and teachers alikebut here was the head mistress pointing out cold and horrid truths that bobby had never even thought of before it was dreadful the girl sat quite still and said nothing at all you had better go now roberta said miss theobald i would like you to think over what i have said and see if your sense of honesty is as high as you think it to be if it is you will admit to yourself that i am right and perhaps i shall then get good reports of you bobby stood up still white she mumbled something to miss theobald and went out of the room as if she was in a dream she had had a real shock it had never before occurred to bobby that it was possible to cheat in many more ways than the ordinary one prudence was the last of the three called before the head mistress she was likely to be the most difficult to deal with miss theobald decided that plain speaking was the best prudence must know exactly how she stoodand make her own choice the girl came in looking rather frightened she tried to look miss theobald straight in the eyes but could not the head told her to sit down and then looked just as coldly at her as she had looked at bobby please miss theobald began prudence who always believed in getting a word in first please dont think the worst of me well i do think the worst of you said the head mistress at once the very worst and unfortunately i know it to be true prudence i know the character of every girl in this school it is my business to know it i may not know what type of brain you have i may not know exactly where you stand in class or what your gifts and capabilities are without referring to your formmistressbut at any rate i know your charactersthe good and bad in you the possibilities in your nature your tendencies your faults your virtues these i know very well and therefore i know all too dearly prudence what you really are prudence burst into tears she often found this useful when people were what she called being unkind to her the tears had no effect at all on miss theobald she stared at prudence all the more coldly cry if you wish she said but i would think more of you if you faced up to me and listened with a little courage i need not tell you what you are prudence summer term at st clares i need not show you the dishonesty deceitfulness and spite in your own nature you are clever enough to know them yourselfand alas cunning enough to use them and to hide them too st clares prudence has nothing to offer a girl like youunless you have enough courage to face up to yourself and try to tear out the unpleasant failings that are spoiling and weakening what character you have i do not want to keep you at st clares unless you can do this think it over and face things out honestly with yourself i give you to the end of the term to make up your mind otherwise prudence i will not keep you here this was actually the only kind of treatment that prudence really understood she stared in horror at miss theobald butbutwhat would my father and mother say she halfwhispered that rests with you said the head now go please i am busy this morning and have already wasted too much time on you and the others prudence went out of the room as shocked and horrified fled as poor bobby had been a few minutes earlier she had to get her books and go to her form for a lesson but she heard practically nothing of what miss lewis the history teacher was saying bobby heard very little too both girls were busy with their own thoughts after school that morning bobby disappeared pat and isabel saw her running off in the direction of the tennis court doesnt she look white said pat i wonder if anythings up lets go and see said isabel so they went to find bobby she was nowhere on the courtsbut pat caught sight of the white blouse and navy skirt in a little copse of trees by the courts she ran up to see if bobby was there bobby whats up she cried for it was quite plain to see that bobby was in trouble her usually merry face with its sparkling eyes was white and drawn go away please said bobby in a tight sort of voice i want to think iiive been accused of cheating andive got to think about it you you accused of cheating cried pat in angry amazement what rot who dared to do that you tell me and ill go and tell them what i think of them it was miss theobald said bobby lifting her troubled face and looking at the twins miss theobald said the twins in the greatest astonishment but why how awful of her well go and tell her shes wrong wellshes not wrong said bobby i see shes right she said i was a cheat because i let my parents pay high fees for me to learn what st clares could teach and i wasted my time and wouldnt workand that was cheating because ive got good brains she said i was cheating my parentsand the schooland myself too it wassimply awful the twins stared uncomfortably at bobby they couldnt think of a word to say bobby motioned to them to go away go away please she said ive got to think this out i simply must itsits somehow very important i do play the fool a lotbut im not such an idiot as not to see that ive come to a sort ofsort ofcrossroads in my life ive got to choose which way ill go and ive got to choose by myself so leave me alone for a bit will you of course bobby said pat understanding she and isabel ran off admiring bobby for her ability to face herself and make up her own mind what she was going to do and there was no doubt as to what bobby was going to do her tremendous sense of honesty and fairness made her see at once that miss theobald was perfectly right she had been given good brains and she was wasting them that was cheating she had good parents who wanted her to go to a fine school and learn from good teachers she was cheating them too and perhaps worst of all she was cheating herself and growing into a weaker and poorer character than she needed to beand the world wanted fine strong characters able to help others onnot poor weak dontcare people who themselves needed to be helped all the time i badly want to be the sort of person who can lead others and guide them thought bobby pulling at the grass as she sat thinking i want others to lean on me not me on them wellive had my fun now ill work ill just show miss roberts what i really can do when i make up my mind ive already shown belinda and miss wilton what i can do at sports when i try ill go straight to miss theobald and tell her now ii dont feel as if i like her very much nowshe had such cold angry eyes when she looked at me but id better go and tell herill get it off my chest and make a fresh start poor bobby felt nervous as she ran back to the school miss theobald had given her a real shock and she dreaded seeing her again and felt halffrightened as she thought of looking into the head mistresss scornful eyes but bobby had courage and she was soon knocking at miss theobalds door come in said a calm voice and bobby went in she went straight to the head mistresss desk miss theobald she said ive come to say i know you were right i have been cheatingand i didnt realize it butim not going to cheat any more please believe me i really do mean what i say and you can trust me toto do my very best from today bobby said this bravely looking straight at miss theobald as she spoke her voice trembled a little but she said her little speech right to the end miss theobald smiled her rare sweet smile and her eyes became warm and admiring my dear child she said and her voice was warm too my dear child i knew quite well that you would make this decision and that you would soon come to tell me i am proud of you and i am going to be even more proud of you in the future you are honest enough by nature to be able to see and judge your own self dearlyand that is a great thing never lose that honesty bobbyalways be honest with yourself know your own motives for what they are good or bad make your own decisions firmly and justlyand you will be a fine strong character of some real use in this muddled world of ours ill try miss theobald said bobby happily so glad to see the warmth and friendliness in the heads face that she felt she could work twelve hours a day if necessary how could she have thought she didnt like miss theobald how could she shes one of the finest people ive ever met thought the girl as she left the room with a light step no wonder shes head of a great school like st clares we are jolly lucky to have her miss theobald was happy too bobby had pleased her beyond measure it was good to feel that she had been successful in handling an obstinate character like bobbysnow she might hope that the girl would have a splendid influence on the others instead of the opposite if i could only hope that prudence would have the same kind of courage as bobby thought the head but prudence im afraid is not brave enough to face up to herself thats her only chancebut i dont believe she will take it sadie gets a letter whilst bobby was thinking out things for herself and making her big decision prudence was also brooding over all that miss theobald had said mixed up with her brooding was a hatred of carlotta who seemed to be at the bottom of prudences troubles prudence could not see that it was her own jealousy of the girl that caused her troubles filling her with ideas of spite and revenge no one can ever see things clearly when jealousy or envy cast a fog over the mind prudence felt that she had to get right with miss theobald the girl could never bear to feel that any one was despising her but she had not got bobbys courageshe dared not face the head again also in her heart of hearts she was afraid that miss theobald would see that her repentance was not realthat it was only to make things more comfortable so prudence wrote a note and slipped it on miss theobalds desk when she knew she was not in her room the head found it there and opened it she read it and sighed she did not believe one word of the letter dear miss theobald prudence had written i have thought over what you said to me and i do assure you i am sorry and ashamed and i will do my best in future to turn over a new leaf and have a good influence on others little humbug thought miss theobald sadly i suppose she really believes she is going to turn over a new leaf wellwe shall see pat and isabel were glad to see that bobby looked happier that evening she smiled at them and her old merry twinkle came back im all right again she said but from now on im going to play fairim going to use my brains and work no more squeaking biscuits for me the twins and janet looked sorry oh said pat in disappointment bobbyyou dont mean to say youre going to go all prim and proper like that awful prudencenever make another joke or play another trick golly said janet i couldnt bear that bobby for pitys sake tell us youre going to be the same jolly old bobbythe dontcare bobby we all like so much bobby laughed and slipped her arm through janets dont worry she said i am going to play the game now and work hardbut i shant go all prim and proper i couldnt i shall be playing tricks all rightbut i dont particularly want to be dontcare bobby any more i do care now you see bobby kept her word to miss theobald of course she worked hard and steadily in class and was surprised to find how well her mind worked when she really set it to somethingand she was even more surprised to find how enjoyable good work was i should never be able to slave at my lessons like you do though pam she said looking at the thirteenyearold girl hunched over a book youre looking awfully pale lately im sure you read too much pam was paleand not only pale but unhappylooking too she was terribly sorry now that she had made firm friends with prudence because she was beginning to dislike her heartily but was not strong enough to tell her so so she found refuge in her lessons and was working twice as hard as any one else she smiled a pale smile at bobby and envied her bobby didnt mind saying anything that came into her mind and was as strong as pam was weak how pam wished she could have made friends with bobby instead of with prudence prudence was feeling rather pleased with herself miss theobald bad not said anything about her letter and the girl felt sure it had made a good impression on the head for some reason mamzelle had not given the french test after all so the class had heaved a sigh of relief especially prudence who felt certain that carlotta would blurt out that she prudence had seen the questions before things are going better thought prudence if only that beastly carlotta could get into a row she just flaunts about as if she were a princess and not a common little circusgirl i wonder if she visits any of her lowdown friends any more i saw her going off early yesterday morning before breakfast it was true that carlotta did go off each morningbut not to visit any circusfriend she had discovered that some lovely buntinghorses were kept in a field not far off and the girl was visiting them regularly sometimes she rode one or other bareback if there was nobody about the girl was quite mad about horses and never lost a chance of going near them if she could nobody knew this prudence knew carlotta was slipping off but told no one else for she had found that none of the girls encouraged her confidences at all she determined to keep a watch herself she and pam went off one afternoon together pam not at all pleased about it but not daring to say no prudence had seen carlotta going offbut somehow or other she missed following her and the two girls stopped in a little lane whilst prudence tried to think where carlotta had gone a man came riding by on a bicycle he was not a pleasantlooking fellow for he was very dark and his eyes were set very dose together he got off his bicycle when he came up to the girls and spoke to them his voice sounded rather foreign and had a slow american drawl with it prudence felt absolutely certain that he bad come to see carlotta excuse me missy said the man taking off his cap politely am i anywhere near st clares school wellabout a mile away said prudence why do you want to see some one there i should like to said the man its very important indeed i suppose you couldnt take a message for me prudences heart beat fast what trouble she could get carlotta into now what would miss theobald say if she knew carlotta was slipping out to see awful people like this of course i could take a message for you she said the man took a letter from his pocket and handed it to prudence dont you tell a single soul he said its very very important ill be here at eleven oclock tonight without fail all right said prudence ill see to it for you youre a brick said the man youre dandy ill give you a fine present see if i dont some one else came down the lane at that moment and the man jumped on his bicycle and rode away saluting the two girls as he went pam shivered a little prudence i dont like him i dont think you ought to have spoken to him you know its a rule we never speak to strangers youre not going to get carlotta into trouble are you oh be quiet said prudence impatiently she pushed tje letter into her pocket without looking at it arent i doing something for carlotta silly arent i taking a message to her from a friend what awful friends she has too pam was worried her head ached and she felt miserable she wished she bad never never become friendly with prudence her mind turned once again to her workshe could only forget things if she worked she hadnt been sleeping well at night and her work was becoming difficult to do which made her worry all the more now listen to me pam said prudence you and i are going to go out tonight at halfpast ten and come here we are going to hide behind the hedge and hear what goes on between our dear carlotta and her circusfriend if she is planning any more escapades we can report them pam stared at her friend in distress i cant do that she said i cant youve got to said prudence and she stared at pam out of her pale blue eyes pam felt too tired and weak to argue she simply nodded her head miserably and turned back to go home the girls walked back in silence prudence thinking with delight that now she had carlotta at her mercy as soon as they got back to school hilary hailed prudence prudence you know quite well its your turn to brush up all the tennisballs and get them dean this week you havent done it once you lazy creature you jolly well do it now or youll be sorry ive just got to take a message to somebody said prudence i wont be a minute you just let somebody else take the message said hilary annoyed i know your little ways prudence youll just do this and youll just do thatand the little jobs you ought to do arent done ill take the letter prudence said pam wearily she felt that she could not stand arguments a minute more prudence handed her the letter with a sulky face pam went off to find carlotta she was in the common room with the others pam went up to her and gave her the letter this is for you she said carlotta took the note and without looking at the envelope tore it open she read the first line or two in evident amazement then she looked at the envelope why it isnt for me she said looking round for pam who however had gone its for sadie i suppose pam didnt see her name on the envelope how odd wheres sadie alison doing her hair said alison there was a shout of laughter at this when sadie was missed she was always either doing her hair doing her nails or doing her face carlotta grinned and went to find her hie sadie she said heres a note for you sorry i opened it by mistake but that little idiot of a pam gave it to me instead of you i havent read it whos it from how did pam get it asked sadie curiously taking the note dont know said carlotta and went sadie opened the envelope and took out the letter inside she read it and her face changed she sat down on the bed and thought hard she read the letter again dear miss sadie do you remember your old maid hannah well im over here and id like to see you i dont like to come to the school can you come down to the lane by the farm and see me for a few minutes ill be there at eleven oclock tonight hannah sadie had been very fond of hannah who had been her own and her mothers personal maid for some years she was astonished that hannah should be in england for she had thought she was in america why did she want to see her had anything happened sadie wondered whether to tell alison or notand then she decided not to alison was a nice girl and a pretty one but she was a featherhead she might go and bleat it out to somebody sadie tucked the note into her pocket and went downstairs hallo said alison i was wondering whenever you were coming down its nearly suppertime sadie was rather silent at suppertime she felt puzzled and a little worried she thought she would ask pam where she had got the note frombut pam was not at supper shes got a frightful headache and miss roberts sent her to matron said janet shes got a temperature prudence was quite pleased to think she would not have pam with her that night after all she was getting a little tired of pretending to pam that everything she was doing was for carlottas good she looked at carlotta to see if the girl showed any signs of receiving the letter carlotta saw her glancing her way and made one of her peculiarly rude faces prudence looked down her nose in disgust and turned away carlotta grinned she didnt care a hapenny for prudence and delighted in shocking her an exciting night that evening sadie lay awake until the clock struck a quarter to eleven it was still fairly light but every one in the dormitory was asleep sadie got up quietly and dressed no one heard her she slipped out of the dormitory and down the stairs in a few moments she was out of the gardendoor and in the school grounds behind her slipped a dark little shadowprudence prudence thought that she was following carlotta of course she had no idea it was sadie prudence had got up at a quarterpast ten and had slipped out of the dormitory next to sadies afraid that if she waited any later carlotta might get away before she had a chance of keeping up with her she had felt so certain that it was carlotta the letter had been forshe had never even looked at the envelope to see what name was written there now at about a quarterpast eleven alison awoke suddenly with a sore throat she cleared it and swallowed it felt most unpleasant she knew that sadie had some lozenges and she decided to wake her and ask for them so the girl slipped out of bed and went to sadies cubicle she put out her hand to shake sadieand to her great astonishment found that she was not there her bed was empty her clothes had goneso she had dressed alison sat down on the bed in surprise she was hurt why hadnt sadie told her she was going somewhere but where in the world could she have gone there couldnt be a midnight feast or anything like that because it was obvious that every one was in bedunless the other dormitory was holding a feast and had asked sadie well sadie might at least have told me even if i wasnt asked thought alison aggrieved ill go and peep in at the twins dormitory and see if theres anything going on there so she slipped into the next dormitorybut every ones bed seemed filledwith the exception of one how odd alison stood thinkingand then she heard a whisper it was pat whos that what are you doing oh patare you awake said alison in a low voice going to pats bed i saysadies gone shes dressedand her bed is empty i dont know why pat but i feel worried about it sadie didnt seem herself this eveningshe was all quiet and sort of worried i noticed it pat sat up she was puzzled sadie didnt usually do anything out of the ordinary at all wherever can she have gone she said theres one bed empty in your dorm too said alison whose is it gollyits prudences said pat in astonishment dont tell me those two are somewhere together i i thought sadie detested prudence she does said alison more puzzled than ever a movement in the next bed made them look round carlottas voice came to them low and guarded what are you two doing youll wake every one up i anything up carlottaits so funnyboth sadie and prudence are gone from their beds said pat carlotta sat up at once she remembered the note she had given to sadie i wonder if its anything to do with the note that pam gave to me instead of to sadie she said what note asked alison carlotta told her and pat and alison listened in surprise somehow i think theres something a bit queer about this said carlotta i do really so do i said alison uncomfortably im awfully fond of sadie you dont thinkyou dont think do youthats she being kidnappedor anything she said once that she nearly had been over in america shes awfully rich you know her mother sent her over here because she was afraid she might be kidnapped again in america she told me that carlotta could more readily believe this than the more stolid pat she got out of bed i think the first thing wed better do is to ask pam where she got that note said carlotta shes in the san said pat well well go there then said carlotta lets wake isabel hurry it was not long before the twins alison and carlotta were creeping across the school grounds to the building called the san this was the sanatorium where any girl who was ill was kept in bed the door was locked but a downstairs window was open carlotta got in quietly she could climb like a cat stay here she whispered to the others we dont want to wake matron ill find pam and ask her what we want to know she made her way through the dark little room and up the stairs to where a dim light was burning in a bedroom here pam lay wide awake trying to cool her burning forehead with a wet handkerchief she was amazed and frightened when she saw carlotta creeping into the room sh whispered carlotta its only me carlotta i pamwhere did you get that note fromthe one you gave me prudence and i met a funnylooking man down the lane by the farm this afternoon said pam he said he wanted to send a message to some one so prudence took the note and meant to give it to you but i had to give it to you instead the man wanted you to meet him there at eleven oclock tonightor to meet somebody there why whats happened the note wasnt for meit was for sadie said carlotta feeling puzzled did the man say it was for me well now i come to think of it no names were mentioned at all said pam frowning as she tried to remember the conversation but somehow prudence seemed to think we were talking about you she would said carlotta grimly i know where she is too i she thought that the man was one of my lowdown circusfriends as she calls themand she wanted to get me down thereand she would spy on me and report me i know prudence but as it happens the note wasnt for meand ive a feeling that theres some dirty work going on round poor sadie shes gone down to the lane by the farmand i bet prudence has gone there tooto spy yes she has said pam feeling frightened and miserable tears ran down her cheeks oh carlotta im supposed to be prudences friendbut i do so dislike her its making me ill im really afraid of her dont you worry said carlotta comfortingly and she patted pams hot hand well deal with miss sourmilk prudence after this shell get herself into serious trouble if shes not careful the girl slipped away and went back to the others who were waiting impatiently by the open window she told them in a few words all she had learnt had we better wake miss theobald said pat troubled nowell see whats happening first it maynt bf anything much said carlotta come on down to the lane by the farm the four girls took bicycles and cycled away in the dark the summer twilight was just enough for them to see their way halfway to the farm they met a sobbing figure running up towards them it was prudence prudence whats the matter whats happening cried pat in alarm oh pat i is it you oh pat i something dreadful has happened sobbed prudence sadie has been kidnapped she has she has i thought i was following carlotta when i went out this evening just before eleven but it was sadie after alland when she got near the farm two men came up and took hold of her and they dragged her to a hidden car and put her in i was hiding behind the hedge did you hear them say anything demanded carlotta yesthey said something about a place called jalebury wept prudence where is it jalebury said carlotta in astonishment i know where jalebury is why thats where the circuscamp went to i are you sure you heard them say they were taking sadie there prudence prudence was quite sure carlotta jumped on her bicycle im just going to cycle to the telephone kiosk down the lane she called the kidnappers will get a shock when they get to jalebury she rode to the kiosk jumped off her bicycle disappeared into the little telephone box and looked up a number there in a minute or two her excited voice filled the kiosk as she poured out her story to some one and asked for their help in about five minutes she was back with the others i telephoned the circuscamp she said theyll be on the watch for the car theyll stop it and surround it and if they dont rescue sadie ill eat my hat oh carlottayou really are marvellous said pat but wouldnt it have been better to call the police i never thought of that said carlotta you see in circuslife we dont somehow call in the police now im off to join in the fun i i know my way to jalebury but im not going by bike how are you going then asked pat on horseback said carlotta i shall borrow one of the hunters ive ridden on in the early morning they are quite near hereand any of them will come to me if i call to them im going to be in at the fun the girl disappeared into a field the twins alison and prudence stared after her in the starlight carlotta was such a surprising person she went straight for what she wanted and nothing could stop her in a few minutes they heard the sound of galloping hoofsand that was the last they saw of carlotta that night carlotta to the rescue carlotta knew the countryside around very well she took the horse across fields and hills her sense of direction telling her exactly where to go she thought hard all the time and smiled grimly when prudence came into her mind shes gone just too far this time she thought as she galloped on through the night the horse responding marvelously to the girls sure hands i do hope i get to jalebury in time to see the fun she didnt get there in time i but when she reached the little town after some time she saw lights in the big field where the camp was and galloped swiftly to it she put the horse to jump the fence that ran round the field and it rose high in the air a voice hailed her whos that oh jimits me carlotta i she cried has anything happened did you get my message we did said the man coming up to take the panting horse and weve got the girl for you mighty pretty isnt she very said carlotta with a laugh and if i know anything about sadie she wanted to borrow a comb and do her hair or powder her nose as soon as you rescued her tell me what happened well as soon as we got your message we dragged a caravan out of the field and set it across the road there see where it runs down into the town said the man pointing in the starlight to where a road not much wider than a big lane ran between high hedges nobody was about and not a car came bytill suddenly one appeared racing along we guessed it must be the one we wanted ohif only id been there groaned carlotta go on what happened well when the car saw the caravan by the light of its headlamps it stopped of course said jim we pretended that our caravan had got stuck and we were pulling and heaving at it like anything one of the men in the car jumped out to see what was upand he called to the other man to come and help us so that we could shift the caravan out of his way so i slipped off to the car and there in the back all tied up like a chicken with a handkerchief round her mouth was your friend i got her out in half a tick of course and bundled her behind a hedge quick work said carlotta enjoying the tale thoroughly very quick agreed the man well then i went back to the others tipped them the wink and we moved the caravan away in a jiffy leaving the road clear the two men went back to the car hopped in never looked behind at all to see if the girl was thereand drove off in the night without her carlotta began to laugh it struck her as very funny indeed to think of the two kidnappers being so easily tricked and racing away in the night with an empty car whatever will they think when they take a look behind and see sadie is gone she said you did awfully well jim now we dont need to call in the police or have a fuss made or anything can just take sadie back to the school and nobody needs to know anything about it im sure miss theobald wouldnt want the papers to splash headlines all about the kidnapping of miss sadie greene come along and have a word with her said jim carlotta went along with him leading the horse by a lock of its thick mane she came to a large caravan and went up the steps inside was sadie combing out her ruffled hair by the light of an oillamp a woman was sitting watchingher nobody appeared to think that anything extraordinary had happened it seemed as if rescuing kidnapped girls was quite an ordinary thing to happen in the middle of the night not even sadie was excited but then she seldom was hallo sadie said carlotta doing your hair as usual carlotta said sadie in surprise how did you get here i was an awful idiot i got kidnapped again that note you opened by mistake was supposed to be from an old maid of ours that i was very fond ofand i went out to see herand two men caught me and then somebody bundled me out and rescued mebut i havent quite got the hang of things yet and my hair got frightfully untidy so im just putting it right carlotta grinned if you fell out of an aeroplane youd wonder if your hair was getting wind blown she said she told sadie all that had happened and how prudence had followed her thinking she was after carlotta gracious said sadie what a night i suppose wed better go back to st clares hadnt we well i think we had said carlotta you see sadie i guess miss theobald wont want this story known all over the countryand i know the circuspeople wont want the police called in they never do so i think wed better just go quietly back to school and hush it all up ive got a horse outsidea hunter i took from a field do you think you could manage to ride it with me im sure i couldnt said sadie promptly oh wellyoull have to try said carlotta impatiently you can put your arms round my waist and hang on to me come on the two girls went to find the horse jim had it outside the caravan carlotta jumped up and spoke to jim thanks for doing all you did she said i wont forget it hold your tongue about everything wont you you bet said jim its all in the days work come and see us again carlotta i always say and i always shall say youre wasted at schoolyou ought to be in a circus like youve always beenhandling horses youre a marvel with them ah well said carlotta things dont always happen as we want them to sadie what are you doing surely you can jump up behind me i cant said sadie the horse seems so enormous jim gave her a heave and the surprised girl found herself sitting behind carlotta she dung to her with all her might the horse set off at a gallop carlotta put him to jump the fence up he went with the two girls on his back and came down lightly the other side sadie squealed with fright she had nearly fallen off let me off oh let me off she shouted carlotta letmeoff but carlotta didnt she galloped on through the starlit night poor sadie bumping up and down up and down behind her oh gasped sadie tell the horse not to bump me so carlotta i carlotta do you hear its you that are bumping the horse said carlotta with a squeal of laughter hang on sadie hang on but it was too much for sadie when they had gone about halfway back she suddenly loosened her hold on carlotta and slid right off the horse she fell to the ground with a bump and gave a yell carlotta stopped the horse at once sadie are you hurt why did you do that im awfully bruised came sadies voice from the ground carlotta i will not ride that bumpy horse another step id rather walk how tiresome you are said carlotta springing lightly to the ground she pulled sadie up and soon made sure that the girl was not really hurt it will take us ages to get back we shall have to walk all the way and i must lead the horse we shant get back till daylight i wonder what the others are thinking said sadie limping along beside carlotta i bet theyre wondering and wondering whats happened the others had worried and wondered till they were tired they had all gone back to school and had awakened the rest of the twins dormitory the girls had sat and discussed the nights happenings wondering whether to go and tell miss theobald or not hilary at last decided that they really must carlotta and sadie had not come back and prudence was almost in hysterics she really was frightened out of her life to think of the trouble that she had caused through being such a mischief maker looktheres the dawn coming said pat looking to the east where a pale silvery light was spreading in another halfhour the sun will be up for goodness sakelets tell miss theobald now we cant wait for carlotta any longer so pat and isabel went down to awaken miss theobald and the head listened in growing alarm to their curious tale she had just reached out to take the telephone receiver in order to get into touch with the police when pat gave a cry look look miss theobald theres carlotta coming backand shes got sadie with her ohgood old carlotta sure enough there was carlotta coming up the school grounds with sadie limping beside her they had returned the hunter to its field and had come wearily up the school grounds just as the sun was rising they had had a long way to walk and were very tired indeed miss theobald had them in her room in a trice quite bewildered with the strange tale she had heard she made the tired girls hot cocoa and gave them biscuits to eat then to carlottas immense disgust she took the sleepy girls across to the san woke up matron and bade her put the girls to bed in peace and quietness and keep them there but miss theobald began carlotta not a scrap of notice was taken of her however and it was not long before both she and sadie were tucked up in comfortable beds and were sound asleep if i had let them go back to their dormitory they would have talked until the dressingbell said miss theobald now go back to your beds too you others and we will sort things out in the morning really i feel i must be dreaming all this but it was no dream and in the morning as miss theobald had said things had to be sorted out it was decided that the matter must certainly be reported to the police but kept as quiet as possible carlotta had the excitement of being interviewed by admiring policemenand prudence had the ordeal of being closely questioned too she was frightened out of her life at it all she had been able to lie and get away with so many unpleasant things before in her lifebut there was no getting away with this i want to go home she sobbed to miss theobald i feel ill let me go home no said miss theobald you want to run away from the troubles you have caused prudence you are going to remain here and face them however unpleasant things may be for you unless you want me to tell your parents everything you will stay here and face things out i hope this will be a lesson to you i am not going to keep you at st clares after this term of course you will never be liked by any of the girls now but you are going to learn a very bitter lesson for the rest of this termand i hope prudence you will derive some good from it you need a punishment to make you learn what you have to learn sadies mother had to be told about the attempted kidnapping and she arrived at st clares in a great state two weeks before the end of the term she wanted to take sadie away at once but miss theobald persuaded her not to you may be sure that such a thing will not be allowed to happen again now she said if you wish of course you must take her away at the end of the term maybe you will want to take her back to america with you sadie is too grown up for st clares mrs greene if you could leave her for a term or two so that she might shake down a little and try to become more of a schoolgirl i should be delighted to have her but maybe you dont want her to be an ordinary schoolgirl miss theobald was right mrs greene was like alison a featherhead she had no brains at all and her only interests in life were her clothes and entertaining others and her precious pretty daughter sadie she looked round at the girls of st clares some with pigtails some with short hair some freckled some plain some pretty well she said dont you get sore at me for saying it miss theobaldbut i dont feel i want sadie to be like these girls my sadies pretty and shes cute too i wouldnt call any of these girls cute would you no i wouldnt said miss theobald smiling we dont teach them to be cute mrs greene we teach them to be independent responsible kind and intelligent but we dont teach them to be cute welli guess ill leave sadie here for the rest of the term anyway said mrs greene after a pause ill stay at the hotel down in the town and keep an eye on her she seems fond of that pretty little thing called alison ill let her stay on just for the rest of the term then ill take her off to america againand maybe alison would like to come along too shes about the cutest girl here miss theobald made a private note in her mind to tell alisons mother not to let her go with sadie to america she was not pleased with alison that term the girl had much better stuff in her than she had shown the last two or three months and miss theobald did not want her to be completely spoilt so it came about that both sadie and prudence stayed on for the rest of the term and did not leave sadie was pleasedbut prudence was angry and unhappy it was terribly difficult to face so many hostile girls every minute of the day for the first time in her life she was really getting a punishment she deserved the end of the term and now the term drew swiftly to an end there were tennis matches swimming matches and the sports there were alas exams too the days were very full and every one had plenty to do from morning to night the girls were very happyall but prudence and nobody not even pam felt sorry for the little humbug no one knew she was leaving and prudence did not say a word about it pam had been ill for a week or twoand miss theobald had come to the conclusion that her illness was due to overwork and unhappiness carlotta hadtold her about pams friendship with prudence and how unhappy she had become about it now carlotta you can do something for me said miss theobald you can make friends with pam please and see that prudence does not try to get her under her thumb again pam is a good little thing too advanced for her ageand it seems to me it will do her good to slack a little instead of working so hard take her under your wing carlotta and make her laugh a bit carlotta was surprised at this request but rather proud she had a great admiration for the sensible and wise head mistress and the two understood each other very well so when pam came out of the san looking rather white and worn and afraid that prudence would attach herself to her once again pam had a pleasant surprise carlotta always seemed to be there carlotta pushed prudence off and asked pam to go for walks with her instead and got her to help her with her prep pam soon felt much happier and her small face glowed whenever carlotta came up its been a funny term hasnt it said miss roberts to mamzelle first of all i thought the new girls were never going to settle down and workand i gave up bobby in despair ah that bobby said mamzelle lifting her hands as she remembered all bobbys tricks that bobby i but now she has turned over a new stalkno what is it you saya new leafand she works and she works yessomething has certainly happened to bobby said miss roberts shes using her brainsand shes got good ones too im pleased with her im going easy with little pam boardman thoughshes inclined to work too bard mamzelle smiled ah yesbut now that she has carlotta for a friend she does not work so hard always we have to hold pam back or she would overwork herselfshe does not play enough but carlotta will help her to do that it is odd that friendship i shouldnt be surprised if the head had something to do with it said miss roberts shes a very remarkable woman you know she knows the girls insideout welli hear that both prudence and sadie are leaving said mamzelle that is good ah that prrrrrrrrrudence how i detest her she has a lot of lessons to learn in life said miss roberts seriously she has been taught a very big one here and has learnt for the first time to see herself as she really isand for two or three weeks she has to undergo the ordeal of knowing that others see her as she is too ah welli dont know how she will turn out shes a problemand im glad i havent got to solve it sadie will not be missed either said mamzelle except by silly little alison she has had her head turned properly by that american girl ah how cross they have both made me this term miss roberts laughed yesyouve been in some fine tempers this term mamzelle she said but never mindthe term will soon be at an endthen summer holidaysand no tiresome girls to teach and when september comes we shall both be saying ah how nice it will be to see those tiresome girls againlaughed mamzelle the girls were sorry that the summer term was coming to an end margery fenworthy won the tennis championship for the school and also the swimming matches carlotta won the diving bobby put up a record for the first form in swimming under water and was loudly cheered and clapped nobody was more surprised than she was you deserve it bobby said belinda clapping her on the back my word how youve improved in tennis and swimming im proud of you dontcare bobby bobby felt happy her work had improved as much as her sports and she had felt a new selfrespect and content janet worked well too now that bobby was working and the twins followed suit youll be able to go up into the second form next term and do me credit said miss roberts as she gave out the exam marks bobby you are top in geography simply marvellous pam you have done very well indeed you osullivan twins have managed to tie for second place in most thingsthats very good hilary you are top of the form as you should be prudence doris alison and sadie are i regret to say settling down near the bottom as usual the great surprise is carlotta who has done far better than i expected i think pam that your help has done a good deal towards putting carlotta into a higher place than i expected pam glowed with pleasure carlotta looked surprised and amused miss roberts went on with her remarks picking out each girl and commenting shrewdly on their terms work and exam results most of the firstform girls with the exception of pam who was too young were to go up into the second form the next term thats good said janet afterwards we shall all keep together nowand the two we like least sadie and prudence wont be here i overheard by accident something mamzelle said in her loud voice to miss roberts welli must say its good news that prudence wont be back wont she really said janet well i vote if thats so were a bit nicer to her then shes looking pretty miserable lately so for the last two or three days of term the girls relaxed their hostile attitude towards prudence and the girl regained some of her confidence and happiness she had begun to learn her lesson though and made no attempt to boast or to lie as she always used to do poor prudenceshe was her own worst enemy and always would be the last day came and the usual wild rush of packing and saying goodbye margery fenworthy proudly packed the beautiful racket she had won for her tennis prize bobby just as proudly packed her swimmingunderwater prizea lovely new bathingcostume all the girls were happy and excited its a shame i cant come to america with you said alison to sadie halftearful at the thought of saying goodbye to her friend i cant think why mother wont let me dont forget me sadie will you of course not said sadie quite meaning what she saidbut the girl was incapable of remembering any one for long her real interest in life was in herself and in her looksher friends would never last with her but alison did not know this and squeezed sadies arm tightly she knew she would miss her terribly the last minutes came goodbyes were shouted as the school coach came up to the door for the first batch of girls mamzelle screamed as some one dropped a suitcase on her toes pat que vous йtes she began and a whole chorus of girls finished her sentence for her abominable there was a shriek of laughter as they tried to get away from mamzelles large hands dealing out friendly slaps all the way round goodbye miss roberts said the twins goodbye miss roberts said bobby goodbye miss

to going up into her class it would be fun a new class and a new teacheryes they really would have fun the firstformers got into the coach that was waiting for them alison heaved herself up and her hat went crooked and then fell off the girls stared at her hair alison youve done your hair all funny again cried pat piled it all on top as if you were twentyone or something you do look a freak honestly you do alison went red she put her hat on again and turned defiantly to the twins well sadie says she began and at once in the greatest delight the whole coachful of girls took up the chorus
